      Mobilte Direct Observation Therapy (MDOT) is a technology has the potential to be a cost&#xD;
      effective approach to direct observation of therapy administration, the latter being one of&#xD;
      the most accurate methods of evaluating adherence. Use to date, as confirmed by the rapid&#xD;
      systematic review, has been limited mainly to TB and sickle cell disease and there have been&#xD;
      no published reports on the use of MDOT to monitor inhaled therapy. Due to the increasing&#xD;
      incidence of childhood asthma worldwide, there is a need for new innovative approaches to&#xD;
      support children and their parents with asthma management, especially since national and&#xD;
      international guidelines have advised healthcare providers to periodically assess inhaler use&#xD;
      as part of asthma management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. It is defined as a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements promote airway&#xD;
      obstruction and hyper-responsiveness (GINA, 2012). According to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO, 2014), asthma is estimated to affect approximately 253 million people worldwide.&#xD;
      Despite advances in biological and pathological research, the prevalence of asthma in&#xD;
      children has significantly increased over the past decade (Massingham et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the economic burden of asthma is increasing. In the US, it is estimated that the&#xD;
      yearly cost of asthma in children and adults is around $1.48 billion (Price et al., 2013). A&#xD;
      decade ago, the total annual asthma expenditure in the UK was determined to be Â£752.6 million&#xD;
      with 8% of costs associated with hospital admission, 13% attributable to general practitioner&#xD;
      consultations and 79% due to prescription costs (Gupta et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Thoracic Society (BTS/SIGN, 2012) and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA, 2012)&#xD;
      guidelines provide the background definitions for three broad categories of asthma control.&#xD;
      They include controlled (no nocturnal wakening, infrequent short acting beta 2 agonist (SABA)&#xD;
      use e.g. &lt; 2 puffs/week, occasional mild symptoms e.g. with exercise and no exacerbations in&#xD;
      last 3 months), partially controlled (nocturnal wakening &lt; 3 nights/week, SABA use e.g. &lt; 4&#xD;
      puffs/day, mild limitation in exercise tolerance due to asthma, and 2 or fewer mild&#xD;
      exacerbations in the previous 3 months) or uncontrolled (nocturnal wakening 4-7 nights/week,&#xD;
      SABA use e.g. &gt; 5 puffs/day, limitation in exercise tolerance due to asthma and or&#xD;
      significant asthma exacerbations requiring oral steroid, Emergency Department attendance or&#xD;
      hospital admission in the previous 3 months). Children who present with partially controlled&#xD;
      or uncontrolled asthma can be divided into difficult to treat asthma (DTA) and true severe&#xD;
      therapy resistant asthma (STRA) after careful investigation (Hedlin et al., 2012). DTA occurs&#xD;
      when asthma is uncontrolled but the impact of concomitant disorders and the basics of asthma&#xD;
      care (inhaler technique and adherence) have not been adequately resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many children with asthma can achieve symptom and disease control by using inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ICS) therapy combined with a long acting B2 agonist (LABA) and/or a&#xD;
      leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) (International ERS/ATS guideline, 2014). However, a&#xD;
      number of children with asthma experience frequent symptoms despite being prescribed high&#xD;
      dose ICS (Nagakumar and Thomas, 2013; Hedlin et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug delivery by inhalation of various medications is the most common treatment approach for&#xD;
      asthma in all patient populations. Inhalation therapy offers rapid onset and improved&#xD;
      efficacy compared to systemic drug delivery (Bisgaard, 1997). While ICS therapy is well&#xD;
      accepted as the foundation of optimal therapy for most asthma patients, efficacy of the&#xD;
      therapy depends on drug being delivered correctly into the lungs and taken on a regular basis&#xD;
      as a preventer therapy (Machira et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that good inhaler technique is an essential aspect of optimal asthma&#xD;
      management. Education on inhaler technique has been shown to improve self- management and&#xD;
      adherence to asthma therapy. Evidence is available demonstrating that asthma outcomes&#xD;
      correlate with proper inhaler technique and that periodically assessing this treatment aspect&#xD;
      has a positive impact on asthma control (Bryant et al., 2013; AL-Jahdali et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Moreover, early and repeated tailored education and follow-up assessment can result in&#xD;
      sustained good inhaler technique (Klot et al., 2011). However, many asthma clinics treating&#xD;
      children are unable to effectively evaluate these important patient treatment variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to pharmacotherapy is also considered an important basic tenet of asthma&#xD;
      management. Adherence can simply be defined as the extent to which a patient follows the&#xD;
      instructions of the prescriber (Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005). While inhaled therapy&#xD;
      technique is an essential feature of asthma pharmacotherapy, some patients with good&#xD;
      technique may have poor inhaler adherence. Available data suggest the average medication&#xD;
      adherence to ICS in children is only approximately 50% (Fish et al., 2001; Osterberg and&#xD;
      Blaschke, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that adherence to ICS in children is a complicated matter influenced by diverse&#xD;
      issues including socioeconomic factors, parents' beliefs about asthma and asthma medications,&#xD;
      and poor patient-doctor communication (Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005; Armstrong et al., 2014).&#xD;
      In addition, parent/guardian health issues such as depression or substance abuse may&#xD;
      negatively affect adherence in young children as a result of the parent/guardian's failure to&#xD;
      remind, or assist the child in the use of their medication (Brackis-Cott et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Non-adherence to medication can have various negative patient consequences such as more&#xD;
      frequent clinic visits, disease exacerbations, hospital admissions, and increased cost of&#xD;
      care (AL-Jahdali et al., 2013). Indeed, a recent review of childhood asthma deaths in SE&#xD;
      England showed that medication non-adherence was a contributing factor in more than 50% of&#xD;
      cases, including patients with milder disease (Anagnostou et al.,2012) Despite being an area&#xD;
      of active research, many interventions such as isolated educational efforts are ineffective&#xD;
      in improving adherence (Drotar and Bonner, 2009). In a qualitative study in the primary care&#xD;
      setting, asthmatic children of parents who expressed medication beliefs of a high concern-low&#xD;
      need pattern had poor outcomes. Researchers subsequently showed that these beliefs could be&#xD;
      modified by repeated tailored education and close follow-up, to result in high medication&#xD;
      adherence. They concluded that &quot;it is not the education per se, but rather the intensity,&#xD;
      quality and frequency of education about self-management and follow-up that help to improve&#xD;
      adherence&quot; (Klot et al., 2011). A multicentre clinical trial in the USA was designed to&#xD;
      determine what medication was best to add in children with severe asthma already taking ICS&#xD;
      and LABA. However,the trial was cut short due to an inability to recruit an adequate number&#xD;
      of children. Patient improvement while under close supervision during the run in period was&#xD;
      the main reason for the lack of patient recruitment. (Strunk et al., 2008) Different methods&#xD;
      used to assess patient adherence to prescribed therapy have resulted in variable outcomes.&#xD;
      Adherence can be measured by collecting data from patients or their parent/guardians,&#xD;
      pharmacy dispensing records, electronic monitoring devices, or patient observation (Osterberg&#xD;
      and Blaschke, 2005). Since the approaches have produced variable results, it can be concluded&#xD;
      that presently there is no preferred method to effectively measure or improve medication&#xD;
      adherence in asthma (Sumino and Cabana, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct observation therapy (DOT) is recommended by the WHO to promote adherence in the&#xD;
      management of tuberculosis (TB) and this approach was adopted in 187 countries by 2005 (WHO,&#xD;
      2010). DOT allows assessment of correctly taking and completing therapy, but also can be&#xD;
      valuable to promote adherence to medication use. DOT involves a healthcare professional&#xD;
      observing patients taking their medication at home or in the clinic (Dosumu, 2001; Otu,&#xD;
      2013). The DOT approach to TB management has been utilised successfully in different&#xD;
      countries as this approach has been shown to enhance medication adherence, improve outcomes&#xD;
      including microbiologic success, and decrease acquired drug resistance to therapy (Favorov et&#xD;
      al., 2012; Walley et al., 2001; Pasipanodya and Gumbo, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While data exist to show that observation of inhaler technique can positively affect asthma&#xD;
      management, there are no published studies using a DOT approach as a means to improve&#xD;
      medication adherence. However, it has been suggested that using DOT with nurses directly&#xD;
      observing asthmatic children's inhaler technique and adherence, for example at school or&#xD;
      home, would be very resource intensive and likely not feasible for continued use (Otu, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there has been widespread use of mobile smartphone and computer devices&#xD;
      within the healthcare environment. A recent survey of teenagers and caregivers in urban&#xD;
      paediatric practices showed that 84% of respondents were smartphone owners, a finding that&#xD;
      was independent of age group, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (Singh et al.,&#xD;
      2014). DeMaio et al. (2001) conducted a pilot study that compared videophone telemedicine&#xD;
      (V-DOT) to standard DOT (S-DOT) in the treatment of TB. In the videophone group, patients&#xD;
      took videos of medication administration that were provided to clinicians involved in their&#xD;
      management. The adherence rate was 95% for V-DOT compared to 97.5 % for S-DOT, but personnel&#xD;
      time was decreased by 288 hours with V-DOT in only 6 patients. Similarly, a telehealth&#xD;
      videophone home monitoring approach to TB was shown to enhance treatment compliance and use&#xD;
      less clinic resources in a larger study by Wade et al. (2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Creary et al. (2014) developed a novel mobile DOT approach utilising&#xD;
      smartphone and computer devices that resulted in a median monthly observed adherence of 93.3%&#xD;
      over the 6 month trial in children with sickle cell disease. Finally, specific to asthma&#xD;
      patients, Vasbinder et al., (2013) has developed a study to access the effectiveness of using&#xD;
      mobile phone text-messages to remind and encourage non-adherent patients to take their&#xD;
      medication and thereby improve control of their disease; results of the study are not yet&#xD;
      available. Limited available evidence, therefore, suggests that communication technology&#xD;
      could be utilised to achieve therapeutic goals of correct administration technique and&#xD;
      improved adherence to therapy in asthma patients while limiting resource utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and clinical impact of a&#xD;
      mobile DOT approach (via video capture in the patient's home) on the administration technique&#xD;
      for, and adherence to, ICS in children with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma. A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to determine factors that influence adherence to ICS in children with&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the feasibility, practicality, and persistence of a mobile DOT technology&#xD;
           approach in the home setting to assist with disease management of children and young&#xD;
           people with partially controlled or uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess inhaler technique and adherence to ICS therapy by use of DOT videos,&#xD;
           parent/guardian and child self-report questionnaires (Medication Adherence Report Scale&#xD;
           (MARS)), pharmacy records and patient's general practitioner (GP) records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the impact of the DOT intervention on asthma clinical outcomes including&#xD;
           physician assessment of disease control, medication changes, asthma control tests,&#xD;
           health-related quality of life and pulmonary function studies in participating children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify parental/guardian and patient factors that influence adherence to ICS in&#xD;
           participating children and young people with asthma&#xD;
