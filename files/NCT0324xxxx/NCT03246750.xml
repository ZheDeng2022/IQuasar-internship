      Study Title: Phase I/II study of brentuximab vedotin and methotrexate/ L-asparaginase/&#xD;
      dexamethasone (B-MAD) chemotherapy in patients with newly-diagnosed Extranodal NK/T-cell&#xD;
      Lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: I/II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 36&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and optimal dose of brentuximab vedotin when use in combination&#xD;
           with methotrexate, L-asparaginase and dexamethasone in the treatment of newly-diagnosed&#xD;
           ENKTL patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To access the overall responses including overall response rate (ORR), disease-free&#xD;
           survival (DSF), progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, 3+3 dose escalation study of brentuximab vedotin in&#xD;
      combination with fixed-dose MAD chemotherapy. The first cycle will be evaluated for the&#xD;
      determination of the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be received the treatment according to the stage of disease as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with localized ENKTL (stage IE or stage IIE) will receive involved-field&#xD;
           radiation (IRFT) with concomitant weekly intravenous Cisplatin. Three to five weeks&#xD;
           after the completion of IFRT and cisplatin, B-MAD (Brentuximab vedotin, Methotrexate,&#xD;
           L-asparaginase and Dexamethasone) regimen will be given every 21 days for 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with advanced ENKTL (stage III or stag IV) will receive B-MAD every 21 days for&#xD;
           6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly-diagnosed ENKTL will be screened for enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Overview of Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, 3+3 dose escalation study, starting with 1.2 mg/kg&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin i.v. on day 1 of a 21-day cycle in combination with fixed-dose MAD&#xD;
      (Methotrexate, L-asparaginase and Dexamethasone) chemotherapy. The first cycle will be&#xD;
      evaluated for the determination of the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be received the treatment according to the stage of disease as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with localized ENKTL (stage IE or stage IIE) will receive involved-field&#xD;
           radiation (IRFT) 40-50 Gy with concomitant weekly intravenous Cisplatin. Three to five&#xD;
           weeks after the completion of IFRT and cisplatin, B-MAD chemotherapy will be given every&#xD;
           21 days for 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with advanced ENKTL (stage III or stag IV) will receive B-MAD every 21 days for&#xD;
           6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly-diagnosed ENKTL will be screened for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENKTL is a rare and highly aggressive disease. Due to the rarity, most published studies&#xD;
      evaluating new treatment regimen for ENKTL enrolled approximately 20-40 patients in their&#xD;
      studies. Since the phase I of this study is designed as 3+3 dose escalation, then this study&#xD;
      will enroll approximately 3-12 patients with localized stage in phase I for dose finding. The&#xD;
      beginning dose of brentuximab vedotin will be 1.2 mg/kg, escalating gradually until dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Initially, 3 patients will be treated with 1.2 mg/kg of&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin and will be monitored for DLT. If there is no DLT observed in all 3&#xD;
      patients at the end of their first treatment cycle, dose escalation to the next dose level&#xD;
      (1.8mg/kg) may commence. If there is a DLT observed in 1 of the first 3 patients, additional&#xD;
      3 patients will be included, expanding the cohort to 6 patients. This cohort of patients will&#xD;
      be treated with the same previous dose of 1.2 mg/kg and monitor for DLTs. If no DLT observed,&#xD;
      dose escalation to the next level (1.8 mg/kg) may commence. If there are DLTs observed in 2&#xD;
      or higher in any of the 6 patients prior dose (0.8mg/kg) will be defined as MTD. There will&#xD;
      be no further additional patient inclusion and dose escalation beyond the maximum number of&#xD;
      12 patients and 1.8mg/kg, as MTD will be exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For phase II study, after reviewed the number of ENKTL patients in the Thai Lymphoma Study&#xD;
      Group Registry, there were 106 newly diagnosed ENKTL patients in the registry from 2007-2013.&#xD;
      This translated to approximately 15 newly diagnosed ENKTL patients per year. Since this study&#xD;
      has the time for patient accruement of three years and with respect to the reference from&#xD;
      other previous studies, the total approximate patients in this study for phase I and II is&#xD;
      36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations for Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full analysis set (FAS) comprises of all patients who were enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The per-protocol analysis (PAS) set comprises of all patient in the FAS who completed cycles&#xD;
      of B-MAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-determining set (DDS) comprises of all patients in the SAS who had at least one&#xD;
      valid safety assessment after completion of the first cycle of B-MAD or discontinue earlier&#xD;
      due to DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Baseline Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline characteristics will be listed individually by patient, and&#xD;
      summarized by cohort using descriptive statistic. The FAS will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy analysis set (EAS) comprises of all patients who are able to evaluate for&#xD;
      efficacy at least once post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety analysis set (SAS) comprises of all patients of the FAS who received at least one&#xD;
      dose of B-MAD and had at least one valid post-baseline safety assessment. (The statement that&#xD;
      a patient had no adverse events on the CRF confirms a valid safety assessment.&#xD;
