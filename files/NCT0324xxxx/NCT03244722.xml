  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that aggressive preconception weight loss in obese women will improve the&#xD;
      metabolic health of the mother and the intrauterine environment. An optimized developmental&#xD;
      environment will normalize fetal growth and improve clinical fetal and infant outcomes, and&#xD;
      theoretically reduce future susceptibility to obesity and cardiometabolic disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Further, our hypothesis is that the metabolic profiles in the mother and infant cord blood&#xD;
      and epigenetic profiles in cord blood leukocytes will be improved in the very-low energy diet&#xD;
      (VLED) group compared to standard practice nutrition counseling and support (SOC) group and&#xD;
      approach the profiles found in normal weight (LEAN) individuals. We will relate these changes&#xD;
      to the changes in the offspring clinical profiles. With these data in hand, we will develop a&#xD;
      model to understand the potential molecular markers associated with offspring size and&#xD;
      adiposity at birth, risk factors for later onset non-communicable diseases. We will use these&#xD;
      insights to define, adopt and implement future interventions that mitigate the downstream&#xD;
      risk of adiposity and cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
