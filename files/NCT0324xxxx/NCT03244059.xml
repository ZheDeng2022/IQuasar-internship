  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is intended to be an initial &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study to show feasibility, validate&#xD;
      assays and approaches, and explore dosing and safety of belimumab in pulmonary emphysema&#xD;
      patients who have clinically relevant (and quantifiable) autoimmune responses. The primary&#xD;
      goal is to determine effects of belimumab on levels of autoantibodies against glucose&#xD;
      regulated protein 78 (GRP78) among patients with pulmonary emphysema attributable to&#xD;
      cigarette smoking. The investigators hypothesize that belimumab treatment will safely reduce&#xD;
      circulating levels of autoantibodies that are associated with emphysema, and comorbidities of&#xD;
      this lung disease, including atherosclerosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To conduct a double-blind, Phase IIa trial, in which 18 former smokers with&#xD;
      pulmonary emphysema (per chest CT scans), and circulating anti-GRP78 autoantibody levels&#xD;
      &gt;mean normal values (by ELISA), will be randomized 2:1 to belimumab vs. placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive 8 infusions of either belimumab or placebo over a 6 month interval. Plasma&#xD;
      anti-GRP78 will be measured pre-treatment, and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 months. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize belimumab therapy will more effectively reduce anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies, the&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this trial, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine effects of the belimumab therapy on secondary endpoints (at the&#xD;
      times detailed for Aim 1) that include levels of pneumococcal-binding antibodies (by ELISA),&#xD;
      circulating B-cell numbers and phenotypes (by flow cytometry), and the rate and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) at any time during treatment. The investigators hypothesize belimumab&#xD;
      will have dose-related effects on B-cell numbers and their differentiation, while minimally&#xD;
      reducing host defense antibodies, and will also have an acceptable AE profile.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of past tobacco smoking (&gt;10 pack years), but quit for &gt;6 months at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment. Smoking cessation will be confirmed by serum cotinine assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pulmonary emphysema per chest CT scans (F950&gt;5%). About 60% of COPD patients followed&#xD;
             in the LHC registry meet these criteria.6 Chest CTs are routine, standard of practice&#xD;
             evaluations for patients with COPD, so no new radiographic studies will be necessary&#xD;
             for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability and willingness to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Plasma anti-GRP78 binding IgG &gt;mean values in former smokers with no lung disease&#xD;
             (standardized OD &gt;0.390) (hence this is a &quot;personalized medicine&quot; approach). Of the&#xD;
             330 emphysema subjects assayed for anti-GRP78 to date, 111 (67%) met this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age 40-75 y.o. COPD is a disease of older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of prior acute COPD exacerbations or no more than one moderate exacerbation in&#xD;
             the last year and no exacerbations four months prior to enrollment. A past history of&#xD;
             an acute exacerbation is the single biggest risk for recurrence.36 Exclusion of these&#xD;
             higher-risk subjects will minimize drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Oral steroids or cellular immunosuppressant use (e.g., cyclophosphamide) within 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History or clinical or laboratory evidence of other autoimmune syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inability or unwillingness to complete the treatment and surveillance protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eligible for lung transplant at time of enrollment. This exclusion will mitigate any&#xD;
             potential, however slight, that a patient could be rejected for transplantation due to&#xD;
             surgeon concerns about this novel therapy (and will also obviate early drop-outs due&#xD;
             to transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Evidence of serious suicide risk including any history of suicidal behavior in the&#xD;
             last 6 months and/or any suicidal ideation in the last 2 months or those, in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment, pose a significant suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of a primary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant IgG deficiency (IgG level &lt; 400 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have an IgA deficiency (IgA level &lt; 10 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Currently on any suppressive therapy for a chronic infection (such as tuberculosis,&#xD;
             pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster or atypical&#xD;
             mycobacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Hospitalization for treatment of infection within 60 days of Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of parenteral (IV or IM) antibiotics (antibacterials, antivirals, anti-fungals, or&#xD;
             anti parasitic agents) within 60 days of Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol abuse or&#xD;
             dependence within 365 days prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of a positive HIV test or positive screening test for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Serologic evidence of current or past Hepatitis B (HB) or Hepatitis C (HC) infection&#xD;
             based on positive tests for HBsAg or HBcAb, or HCAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. History of an anaphylactic reaction to parenteral administration of contrast agents,&#xD;
             human or murine proteins or monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any other clinically significant abnormal laboratory value in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Any intercurrent significant medical or psychiatric illness that the investigator&#xD;
             considers would make the candidate unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Women of Child Bearing Potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (either blood or urine) at screening, and agree to 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the 1st&#xD;
             dose of study agent until 16 weeks after the last dose of study agent (Sexual&#xD;
             inactivity by abstinence must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
             the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following acceptable methods of birth control&#xD;
             for 1 month prior to the start of the study agent, during the study, and 16 weeks&#xD;
             after the last dose of study agent:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to&#xD;
                  the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for&#xD;
                  that subject. For this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the&#xD;
                  investigator's/designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the&#xD;
                  subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal&#xD;
                  interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double barrier method: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
