      The purpose of the current study is, 1) Determine the effectiveness of injury prevention&#xD;
      programs for prevention of hamstring muscle strains, 2) Identify how these programs impact&#xD;
      athletes' flexibility, muscle stiffness, strength, and power, and 3) Determine the ability of&#xD;
      a state-of-the-art imaging technology, shear wave elastography to predict future hamstring&#xD;
      muscle strain injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hamstring strains are a significant problem for basketball athletes across levels of play for&#xD;
      both sexes. The impact of hamstring muscle strains (HSMS) is significant. Injuries typically&#xD;
      result in persistent symptoms and lengthy recovery periods which limit the athlete's practice&#xD;
      and play time. Even more significantly, HSMS have high rates of reinjury. It is estimated&#xD;
      that approximately one-third of hamstring strains are recurrent. Given the high incidence of&#xD;
      HSMS and the substantial tendency for injuries to recur, it has been advocated the greatest&#xD;
      impact may be achieved by the development of improved techniques for prevention of initial&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple risk factors for HSMS have been identified. Perhaps the strongest modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor associated with HSMS is an imbalance between quadriceps and hamstring strength,&#xD;
      specifically the eccentric hamstrings and concentric quadriceps strength ratio. The rationale&#xD;
      is that sufficient eccentric capacity of the hamstring muscles is necessary to offset the&#xD;
      concentric quadriceps contraction during the terminal swing phase of running. Not&#xD;
      surprisingly, prevention programs that emphasize eccentric hamstring strengthening have been&#xD;
      effective in reduction of HSMS injury rates.Prospective studies have demonstrated mixed&#xD;
      results regarding the relationship between hamstring flexibility and hamstring injury, and&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a flexibility program for reduction of the incidence of HSMS remains&#xD;
      controversial. Stretching duration, frequency, timing of stretching relative to sports&#xD;
      activities and the type of stretch being performed have been suggested as important factors&#xD;
      in the effectiveness of a flexibility program at reducing injury occurrence. In addition,&#xD;
      reduced hip flexor and quadriceps flexibility has been identified as a risk factor for HSMS.&#xD;
      Further investigation is necessary to determine if a flexibility program that addresses both&#xD;
      anterior and posterior thigh musculature reduces injury risk. The role of neuromuscular (NM)&#xD;
      deficits as a risk factor in HSMS injuries is unclear. Inclusion of NM exercises in a six&#xD;
      week training period improved lower extremity control and movement discrimination, which has&#xD;
      been suggested to contribute to HSMS injury prevention. However, the impact of a NM injury&#xD;
      prevention program on HSMS rates has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sheer wave elastography (SWE) represents an emerging imaging technology. This real-time&#xD;
      imaging technique evaluates the local mechanical properties of muscles. Thus, SWE has the&#xD;
      potential to provide more sensitive insight into muscle stiffness than flexibility&#xD;
      assessment. Recent studies have utilized this technique to evaluate the effect of lower&#xD;
      extremity positioning on hamstring stiffness. The relationship between stiffness measures&#xD;
      obtained using SWE and HSMS has not, however, been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key gaps in knowledge regarding HSMS injury prevention programs remain. Most critically, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of HSMS prevention programs among basketball athletes is unknown. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the comparative effectiveness of eccentric, flexibility, and NM training for reduction of&#xD;
      HSMS injuries is also unknown. Assessment of lower extremity strength, rate of power&#xD;
      production, flexibility, and stiffness (captured with SWE) may elucidate the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the effectiveness of injury prevention training, and aid in enhancement of injury&#xD;
      prevention programs. Thus, the potential impact of this proposal is profound as our&#xD;
      investigative team aims to fill these gaps in knowledge. Ultimately, the results of this&#xD;
      study have the potential to 1) reduce injuries among basketball athletes and consequently&#xD;
      enhance and lengthen athletic careers, 2) provide scientific rationale underlying the effects&#xD;
      of HSMS injury prevention training, and 3) determine if a novel ultrasound imaging technique&#xD;
      may be effective in determining risk for HSMS.&#xD;
