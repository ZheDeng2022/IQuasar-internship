  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction after eye surgery when given a&#xD;
      capsule compared to an intravenous (IV) dose of sedation (calming medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be given a capsule and an IV in the hospital before their procedure starts,&#xD;
      however they will not know which one is the sedation route. Each subject will have their&#xD;
      planned surgical procedure as previously discussed with their doctor. After the procedure is&#xD;
      completed, the doctors will complete satisfaction surveys. The subject will also complete a&#xD;
      satisfaction survey during their regularly scheduled visit the day after surgery. Once the&#xD;
      subject completes this survey, their study participation will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in patient satisfaction when given a&#xD;
      capsule in comparison to IV sedation. If the results of the study support this hypothesis, a&#xD;
      capsule could be used in place of IV sedation. By using a capsule for ocular procedures, both&#xD;
      patients and the medical practice would benefit: patient would be able to eat before their&#xD;
      procedure, patient costs would be decreased, hospital costs would be reduced, and some of&#xD;
      these procedures would be given the option to move to a procedure room (freeing up operating&#xD;
      room time for other departments).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare patient satisfaction of oral triazolam to&#xD;
      IV midazolam when administered for ocular procedures. Midazolam is an FDA-approved&#xD;
      intravenous medication commonly used as a sedative for ocular procedures conducted in the&#xD;
      operating room. This study will compare the use of triazolam, an FDA-approved oral sedative&#xD;
      for the same types of ocular procedures, a purpose which has not fully been investigated. The&#xD;
      benzodiazepine triazolam was chosen as the oral medication due to its similarity to&#xD;
      midazolam. The similarities between midazolam and triazolam include similar half-life, risks,&#xD;
      and patient experience.The medication doses were chosen from current SOC use based on weight.&#xD;
      The lower dose for both medications are used for patients with a BMI less than 35 and the&#xD;
      higher dose is used for patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first double-blind, prospective clinical trial that will compare IV and oral&#xD;
      sedation for multiple ocular sub-specialty procedures. The procedures to be investigated&#xD;
      include: cataract, retina, cornea, and glaucoma surgical groups.&#xD;

Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two study arms listed above. On the day of surgery, the subject, anesthesiologist/CRNA, and surgeon will be blinded to the treatment assignment. The anesthesiologist/CRNA or pre-operative nurses will administer the blinded oral medication approximately 30 minutes before the procedure beings. The anesthesiologist/CRNA will administer the blinded IV medication approximately 5 minutes before the procedure begins. At the completion of the procedure, the anesthesiologist/CRNA and the surgeon will complete a satisfaction survey. The subject will then return within 2 days for their first post-operative clinical visit and complete a satisfaction survey.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The subject and their entire medical team (including the anesthesiologist and surgeon) will all be masked to the subject's randomized intervention group. The randomization groups will be assigned by the statistician who will be unmasked. All medications will be provided to the medical team on the day of the procedure completely masked. The clinical research coordinator, the clinical research assistant, and the pharmacy will be unmasked to the intervention group. Any member of the medical team can be unmasked at any time after the intervention is administered in the case of an emergency resulting in a serious adverse event or an unanticipated problem.</masking_description>
