  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that addition of pembrolizumab will enhance the efficacy of&#xD;
      carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC, or patients with&#xD;
      other genetic alterations, and who have disease progression following appropriate targeted&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is Response Rate (RR) defined as the rate of complete and partial response. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis). Partial Response (PR): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) but does not qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

        targeted therapy with progressive and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 2- Other genetically altered NSCLC patients previously treated with appropriate&#xD;
        targeted therapy with progressive and measurable tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;

             are already available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have received any systemic chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
             Patients who received 1 cycle of systemic chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC while&#xD;
             awaiting the results of tumor molecular analysis and subsequently were switched to&#xD;
             appropriate targeted therapy will be eligible. Patients who have received neoadjuvant,&#xD;
             adjuvant or as part of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation are eligible if they&#xD;
             received the chemotherapy 12 months or more before the start of study therapy.&#xD;

             quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The score&#xD;
             ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have recovered to ≤ grade 1 from clinically meaningful (example&#xD;
