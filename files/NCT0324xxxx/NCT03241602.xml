  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advancement of laparoscopy and minimal access surgery has greatly influenced the&#xD;
      evolution of anaesthetic techniques. However, postoperative pain intensity may be&#xD;
      significant, with up to 40% of patients unsatisfied by routine analgesia and up to 80%may&#xD;
      require rescue opioids during their hospital stay. Diagnostic gynaecological laparoscopy has&#xD;
      no origin of pain other than the abdominal gas insufflations itself only. Pain relief after&#xD;
      diagnostic laparoscopy, being a day case, is an issue of great practical importance.The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to compare the efficacy of combining both pulmonary recruitment and&#xD;
      intraperitoneal lidocaine versus pulmonary recruitment alone to control post - laparoscopy&#xD;
      shoulder pain regarding severity and frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Prospective Randomized Double-blind Controlled Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This study is a randomized double blinded control trial. It will be conducted at&#xD;
      Kasr-al ainy hospital, faculty of medicine, Cairo university. Approval of ethical committee&#xD;
      and written informed consent will be obtained. 88 female patients, aged 18-45 years , ASA 1&#xD;
      or 2 , scheduled for diagnostic gynaecologic laparoscopy will be included. Females who are&#xD;
      (ASA) â‰¥ 3, alcoholic, drug abusers, allergic to amide LAs, with pre-existing chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders, or receiving opioids or tranquilizers for &gt; 1 week preoperatively are excluded.&#xD;
      Also if the operation included any interventional procedure or was converted to an open&#xD;
      procedure, or had postoperative complications that could increase postoperative pain, it will&#xD;
      be excluded. Consenting patients will be randomly allocated to either of three study groups :&#xD;
      GPL : Patients will receive pulmonary recruitment maneuver and intraperitoneal lidocaine.&#xD;
      GPS: Patients will receive pulmonary recruitment maneuver and intraperitoneal saline. GC :&#xD;
      Patients will receive passive exsufflation through the port site. The patient will attend at&#xD;
      the pre anaesthetic room 1 hour before the procedure. A 20 Gauge cannula will be inserted&#xD;
      peripherally and the patient will be premedicated with intravenous Midazolam 0.02 mg kg-1,&#xD;
      Ranitidine 50 mg, 10 mg Metoclopramide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operative room, standard monitoring will be applied to the patient. Anaesthesia will&#xD;
      be induced with propofol 2 mg kg-1, Fentanyl 1 mcg kg-1 , Atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 and the&#xD;
      trachea will be intubated after mask ventilation for 3 minutes. Anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with IPPV , isoflurane in 100% oxygen and muscular relaxation with atracurium&#xD;
      0.1mg kg-1every 15 minutes. Depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical signs.&#xD;
      Laparoscopy is done using CO2 as distension medium. The patient will be placed in a&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position in order to provide optimum conditions for laparoscopic view. In&#xD;
      groups GPL and GPS , the investigator prepares syringes 1.75 ml/kg of 0.2% lidocaine (3.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) or the same volume of normal saline, for intraperitoneal administration. This ensures&#xD;
      the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist are blind to the patient's group. The solution to be&#xD;
      instilled will be splashed under the right diaphragmatic area by the surgeon and complete the&#xD;
      procedure. At the end of the procedure, the patient will be placed back from trendelenburg&#xD;
      position. In groups GPL and GPS , a pulmonary recruitment maneuver will be done and consist&#xD;
      of five manual pulmonary inflations with a maximum pressure of 40 cm H2O. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist hold the fifth positive pressure inflation for approximately 5 seconds. In&#xD;
      group GC CO2 will be removed by passive exsufflation through the port site and gentle&#xD;
      abdominal pressure will be applied to evacuate the residual gas. Residual neuromuscular block&#xD;
      is antagonized with atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg and extubation will be done&#xD;
      according to extubation criteria. In the recovery room, patient will be asked about&#xD;
      post-operative pain and it'll be controlled using Meperidine 1 mg kg-1 and given by a nurse&#xD;
      who is unaware of the nature of the intraoperative analgesia. Then, the patient is discharged&#xD;
      to the ward according to the standard criteria. In the ward, patient will be asked to fulfill&#xD;
      a questionnaire at 6, 8 and 10 hours postoperative using the visual analogue score (VAS) of&#xD;
      pain severity. Patients were questioned as to presence of Side effects (nausea, vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risk : Pneumothorax , Local anaesthetic toxicity : CNS depression (lightheadedness&#xD;
      and dizziness, difficulty focusing, tinnitus, confusion, and circumoral numbness) ,&#xD;
      excitation ( tremors tonic-clonic convulsions) , respiratory depression and cardiac&#xD;
      dysrhythmias .&#xD;

      The advancement of laparoscopy and minimal access surgery has greatly influenced the&#xD;
      evolution of anaesthetic techniques. However, postoperative pain intensity may be&#xD;
      significant, with up to 40% of patients unsatisfied by routine analgesia and up to 80%may&#xD;
      require rescue opioids during their hospital stay. Diagnostic gynaecological laparoscopy has&#xD;
      no origin of pain other than the abdominal gas insufflations itself only. Pain relief after&#xD;
      diagnostic laparoscopy, being a day case, is an issue of great practical importance. Pain&#xD;
      after Laparoscopy is considered to arise from 3 main sources: the incision sites (50% to&#xD;
      70%), the pneumoperitoneum (20% to 30%) in association with both local (peritoneal and&#xD;
      diaphragmatic stretching, ischemia, acidosis) and systemic (hypercarbia causing sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system excitation resulting in amplification of the local tissue inflammatory&#xD;
      response) changes, and the procedure site (10% to 20%) as postcholecystectomy wound within&#xD;
      the liver. Pain can also be referred from the subdiaphragmatic region as shoulder pain.&#xD;
      Shoulder pain is often mild in intensity and can remain for 24 hours. Incisional pain is&#xD;
      usually mild to moderate in intensity, and maximal immediately postoperatively, subsiding&#xD;
      with time. Local anaesthetic (LA) to be filtered preincisional can not entirely eliminate&#xD;
      postoperative pain, especially shoulder pain, In contrast, Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic&#xD;
      instillation is a known method of providing post-laparoscopy pain relief. Lidocaine is safe&#xD;
      and effective in pain relief, improving respiratory functions and early return of bowel&#xD;
      motility. The local anaesthetic blocks visceral nociception from the peritoneum locally as&#xD;
      well as a having a systemic effect after absorption through the peritoneal surface . The&#xD;
      systemic analgesic effect of LA is induced through an anti-inflammatory effect by peripheral&#xD;
      suppression of acute chemically induced pain, inhibition of nerve conduction, as well as&#xD;
      having a central antihyperalgesic effect. The pulmonary recruitment manoeuvre (RM) can&#xD;
      mechanically remove residual carbon dioxide (CO2) after laparoscopic surgery, reduce phrenic&#xD;
      nerve irritation, and consequently reduce post-laparoscopic shoulder and upper abdominal&#xD;
      pain. The combined effect of these two methods ,using various local anaesthetics , on pain&#xD;
      following laparoscopic procedures has not been reported. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of combining local anaesthetic infiltration of Lidocaine with pulmonary recruitment&#xD;
      manoeuvre on postoperative pain following diagnostic Gynaecologic laparoscopy. For blinding,&#xD;
      Pulmonary recruitment maneuver will be combined with intraperitoneal instillation of saline.&#xD;
      However, intraperitoneal saline is a known simple maneuver to decrease shoulder pain. A&#xD;
      possible explanation is that saline displaces residual pockets of gas from within the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity and thereby prevents loss of suction support between the liver and&#xD;
      diaphragm. In this study we hypothesized that combining simple maneuver like pulmonary&#xD;
      recruitment with intraperitoneal instillation of local anaesthetic would be more effective&#xD;
      than pulmonary recruitment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of combining both pulmonary recruitment and&#xD;
      intraperitoneal lidocaine versus pulmonary recruitment alone to control post - laparoscopy&#xD;
      shoulder pain regarding severity and frequency&#xD;

      and written informed consent will be obtained. 88 female patients, aged 18-45 years , ASA I&#xD;
      or II , scheduled for diagnostic gynaecologic laparoscopy will be included. Females who are&#xD;
      (ASA) â‰¥ 3, alcoholic, drug abusers, allergic to amide LAs, with pre-existing chronic pain&#xD;
      disorders, or receiving opioids or tranquilizers for &gt; 1 week preoperatively are excluded.&#xD;

      peripherally and the patient will be premedicated with intravenous Midazolam 0.02 mg kg-1,&#xD;
      Ranitidine 50 mg, 10 mg Metoclopramide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operative room, standard monitoring (electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure measurement) will be applied to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol 2 mg/ kg, Fentanyl 1 mcg/ kg , Atracurium 0.5 mg&#xD;
      kg-1 and the trachea will be intubated after mask ventilation for 3 minutes. Anaesthesia will&#xD;
      be maintained with IPPV , isoflurane in 100% oxygen and muscular relaxation with atracurium&#xD;
      0.1mg kg-1every 15 minutes. Depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical signs.&#xD;
      Laparoscopy is done using CO2 as distension medium. Veress needle is introduced at first&#xD;
      through lower border of umbilicus and water test is done to ensure intraperitoneal placement.&#xD;
      Then, reaching proper distension pressure is ensured by disappearance of dullness over lower&#xD;
      border of the liver. The pressure will be about 15 mmHg. The patient will be placed in a&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position in order to provide optimum conditions for laparoscopic view. A 10 mm&#xD;
      laparoscopic trocar is introduced with 45 degree towards pelvis and zero camera is introduced&#xD;
      through the cannula trocar. Second puncture can be done through right or left iliac fossae.&#xD;
      In groups GPL and GPS , the investigator prepares syringes 1.75 ml/kg of 0.2% lidocaine (3.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) or the same volume of normal saline, for intraperitoneal administration. This ensures&#xD;
      the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist are blind to the patient's group. The solution to be&#xD;

      a questionnaire at 6, 8 and 10 hours postoperative using the visual analogue score (VAS) of&#xD;
      pain severity. The patients were asked to complete a 10-cm linear analogue scale for shoulder&#xD;
      pain, which ranged from 0 for no pain at all to 10 for the worst pain imaginable. Patients&#xD;
      were questioned as to presence of Side effects (nausea, vomiting).&#xD;
