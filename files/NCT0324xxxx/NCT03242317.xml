  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the RaindropÂ® Near Vision Inlay for the&#xD;
      improvement of near vision in presbyopes treated with low dose, short duration Mitomycin C&#xD;
      (MMC) during surgery and an extended low dose steroid regimen after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical procedure includes a low dose, short duration MMC treatment on the exposed&#xD;
      stromal bed of the non-dominant eye, before the unilateral implantation of the corneal inlay.&#xD;
      This treatment is at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (0.02%) applied for 10 to 30 seconds on the&#xD;
      stromal bed as well as the stromal side of the corneal flap or pocket. In the third month&#xD;
      after surgical procedure, one-drop a day of low dose steroid will be continued for the&#xD;
      duration of the 24-month follow-up period to maintain corneal health.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients require a near reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D in the non-dominant eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have a photopic pupil size of at least 3.0 mm in the non-dominant eye. Patients&#xD;
        have a corneal thickness greater than or equal to 500 microns in the non-dominant eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have corrected distance and near visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients have distance corrected near visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are willing and able to sign and understand a written Informed Consent Form prior&#xD;
        to any study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 24 months&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with prior ocular surgery. Patients with clinically significant dry eye (i.e.,&#xD;

        s) in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a planned corneal residual bed thickness that is less than 300 microns&#xD;
        (corneal thickness - (intended ablation depth + intended flap thickness)).&#xD;
