  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor Derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly used in the clinic to obtain genotype&#xD;
      information about lung cancer, but its concordance with concurrent tumor-derived sequenced&#xD;
      data is not known. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority&#xD;
      of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of cfDNA-based versus tumor tissue-based genotyping as it&#xD;
      pertains to the detection of clinically-actionable biomarkers in first line, treatment naïve,&#xD;
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Turn around Time (TAT) of cfDNA vs. tissue results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to treatment (TtT) initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantity not sufficient rate (QNS) of tissue for clinically-actionable biomarker&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor Not Detected (TND) rate of cfDNA in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rescue rate of QNS samples using cfDNA-derived genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate response for patients that are actionable biomarker positive (either in cDNA or&#xD;
           tissue) treated with target-drugs according investigator criteria. Up to three RECIST&#xD;
           assessments per patient will be retrospectively done by external personnel (no&#xD;
           investigational team).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of discovery of genomically mediated, acquired resistance to targeted therapies in&#xD;
           the biomarker-positive subsets.&#xD;
