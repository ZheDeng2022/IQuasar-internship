  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in patients undergoing robotic myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization with intraoperative extubation. Patients will be randomized into placebo or&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine groups to assess postoperative pain scores and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      Patients will also be assessed for side effects from the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following Institutional Review Board approval and informed patient consent, 120 patients&#xD;
      scheduled for elective robotic myocardial revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      and anticipated intraoperative tracheal extubation will be studied. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups. Group A (placebo, control group) will receive intrathecal&#xD;
      normal saline, Group B (morphine group) intrathecal morphine. All procedures will occur and&#xD;
      administered medications given immediately prior to induction of general anesthesia in the&#xD;
      operating room. Power analysis indicates that 60 patients per Group is appropriate, as&#xD;
      further described below. Inclusion criteria include any patient undergoing elective robotic&#xD;
      myocardial revascularization without anticipated use of cardiopulmonary bypass and with&#xD;
      anticipated intraoperative tracheal extubation. Exclusion criteria include emergency surgery,&#xD;
      ejection fraction less than 40%, preoperative use of inotropic agents or intraaortic balloon&#xD;
      pump, anticipated use of cardiopulmonary bypass, previous cardiothoracic surgery, anticipated&#xD;
      postoperative tracheal intubation, severe pulmonary disease, morbid obesity (BMI &gt;35 kg/m2),&#xD;
      severe renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 1.5) recent history of opioid abuse, preoperative use&#xD;
      of opioids, or any contraindication to intrathecal injection (patient refusal, difficult&#xD;
      patient anatomy, pre-existing coagulopathy, morphine allergy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative data will be collected (see Preoperative Data Sheet). Following&#xD;
      intravenous access and routine mild sedation, each patient will be transported to the&#xD;
      operating room and assume the sitting position. Following routine skin preparation, a routine&#xD;
      lumbar intrathecal injection will be made via a 22-g spinal needle. The injectate will be&#xD;
      either morphine (5 mcg/kg, maximum dose of 1 mg) or normal saline. The injectate will be&#xD;
      prepared by a co-Investigator not directly involved in patient care. Thus, all preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative, and postoperative caregivers will be blinded to intrathecal injectate&#xD;
      composition (all injectates will be standardized to a total of 1.0 ml). All patients will&#xD;
      have port incisions injected with 60 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine by the surgeon after the&#xD;
      completion of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following intrathecal injection, the patient will then assume the supine position. An&#xD;
      arterial catheter will be inserted and general endotracheal anesthesia will be induced.&#xD;
      Intraoperative anesthetic technique will be standardized and equivalent between Groups (see&#xD;
      Intraoperative Anesthetic Protocol Sheet). The anesthetic protocol will allow tracheal&#xD;
      extubation to occur in the operating room immediately after surgery (if clinically&#xD;
      indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique will not be altered in any way. All patients in both Groups will be&#xD;
      operated on by Husam H. Balky, MD. Routine intraoperative data will be collected (see&#xD;
      Intraoperative Data Sheet). In all patients, tracheal extubation will be attempted in the&#xD;
      operating room immediately after surgery (if clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Groups will receive routine postoperative care and identical postoperative analgesic&#xD;
      protocols to assess adequacy of postoperative analgesia (see Postoperative Analgesia Protocol&#xD;
      and Postoperative Data Sheets). The American Pain Society Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ)&#xD;
      will be administered to patients prior to discharge (see data sheet).15&#xD;
