    <textblock>
      The ActiPatch is a cutaneous device which is CE marked approved for relief of pain and has&#xD;
      FDA clearance as an over the counter device for the adjunctive treatment of osteoarthritis of&#xD;
      the knee and plantar fasciitis. It is taped over the affected area and stimulation at a high&#xD;
      frequency is reported to alleviate pain with no sensation. By randomising patients between&#xD;
      application of an active device or a dummy device and assessment of disability and pain&#xD;
      scores at four weeks the efficacy or otherwise can be established. Chronic low back pain is a&#xD;
      major health problem and if effective this has major economic implications as the device is&#xD;
      cheap and safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is a major public heath challenge for a number of reasons including&#xD;
      prevalence, seriousness, vulnerable populations, the utility of population health strategies,&#xD;
      and the importance of prevention at both the population and individual levels. Its incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence are increasing with an aging population and the rise in obesity. When&#xD;
      considering the location of chronic pain and its aetiology, back pain was the most common&#xD;
      location with arthritis/osteoarthritis being the most common cause. Chronic low back back&#xD;
      pain is costly to nations-not just in terms of health care expenditures and disability&#xD;
      compensation but also in terms of lost school days, lost productivity and employment, reduced&#xD;
      incomes, and lost potential and quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ages 18 or above with stable chronic lower back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing must be on birth control or practice abstinence during the&#xD;
             study period&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Women of childbearing age will be screened with a urine pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who&#xD;
             is not permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12&#xD;
             consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥3 months duration of chronic low back pain&#xD;

             extremities, as determined during screening by the principal investigator. The&#xD;
             investigator will verbally ask the participant if most of the pain being experienced&#xD;
             is in the lower back/buttock area, and rely on the response for inclusion into the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to complete and tolerate treatment for the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participant who is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients using personal home based electrical stimulation devices are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other concomitant illnesses (e.g., malignancy, osteoporosis) which, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude successful patient participation will&#xD;
             also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active psychiatric disorders will be excluded (e.g. use of antipsychotic medication,&#xD;
             bipolar disorder, schizophrenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with history of significant mood disorder will be excluded (e.g.,&#xD;

             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may&#xD;
             influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have participated in another research trial involving an&#xD;
             investigational product in the past 12 weeks.&#xD;
