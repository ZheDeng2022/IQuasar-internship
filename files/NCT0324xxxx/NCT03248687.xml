    <textblock>
      The investigators will be enrolling children with distal radius buckle fractures, treating&#xD;
      them with a removable splint and randomizing them to follow up as needed vs required follow&#xD;
      up with a primary care physician 1-2 weeks after the ED visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buckle fractures of the distal forearm that include the radius are the most common fracture&#xD;
      in childhood, and the risk of this fracture occurring is about 1 in every 25 children.Despite&#xD;
      the high frequency of this fracture, it is a very stable injury and thus can be safely&#xD;
      treated with a removable wrist splint while the fracture heals. Furthermore, authors have&#xD;
      concluded that since orthopedic intervention is exceedingly rare, this type of fracture may&#xD;
      safely be followed by a primary care physician (PCP) or managed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, about 50% of these injuries are routinely discharged from the ED for follow up&#xD;
      with the PCP, instead of an orthopedic clinic. The investigators' work examined the&#xD;
      management outcomes of 180 children with a distal radius buckle fractures who were treated in&#xD;
      an ED with a removable splint, given anticipatory guidance, and advised to follow up in two&#xD;
      weeks with their PCP. We demonstrated that PCP follow up was safe and effective, with about&#xD;
      90% of patients completing their care at the PCP without additional visits to an ED or&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon. All patients recovered as expected without complications. However, about&#xD;
      50% of these patients did not receive additional anticipatory guidance from their PCPs on&#xD;
      duration of splint use or expected timing of return to usual activities at the PCP visit.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, patients with and without this additional anticipatory guidance reported a&#xD;
      similar duration of splint use and timing for return to usual activities, largely based on&#xD;
      what was recommended at the ED visit. Since these injuries are inherently stable, carry an&#xD;
      excellent prognosis, and are treated with a splint that can be removed at home in accordance&#xD;
      with anticipatory guidance provided in the ED, it calls into question the need for any&#xD;
      routine physician follow up of these common minor fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If home management of distal radius buckle fracture after ED discharge demonstrated safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness in a methodologically robust study, it would have clear advantages for&#xD;
      patients and families, physicians, and the health care system. The frustrations of lengthy&#xD;
      clinic visits and transport difficulties would be avoided. Parents would miss less time away&#xD;
      from work or other priorities, and the patients themselves would not miss school. In&#xD;
      medically under-serviced communities in particular, patients would avoid long travel&#xD;
      distances to see a physician for this minor injury where physician intervention after the ED&#xD;
      visit is rarely required. Furthermore, it will obviate the need to shift the care of these&#xD;
      common minor fractures from the orthopedic surgeon to the PCP, relieving some pressure on&#xD;
      health care practitioners and increase availability for other patients more in need of&#xD;
      physician services. Importantly, the potential for reduced use of superfluous health care&#xD;
      services for this common injury is also likely to result in health care cost savings.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy children aged 5 to 17 years who present to the study ED within three&#xD;
             days of a wrist injury that is diagnosed in the ED as a distal radius buckle fracture&#xD;
             will be eligible for enrolment. Furthermore, approximately 15% of children with this&#xD;
             fracture have an associated ulnar buckle or ulnar styloid fracture. In previous&#xD;
             similar research, children with these associated ulnar fractures were included in the&#xD;
             study population. Thus, distal radius buckle fractures with or without an associated&#xD;
             buckle/styloid fracture of the distal ulna will be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children at risk for pathologic fractures such as those with congenital or acquired&#xD;
             bony disease (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Congenital anomalies of the extremities which may complicate clinical or radiographic&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Multisystem trauma and multiple fractures of the same limb since these patients would&#xD;
             require additional management and follow-up beyond that of an isolated buckle&#xD;
             fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients cognitively and developmentally delayed such that they are unable to&#xD;
             communicate pain or have limited performance in activities of daily living at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Past history of ipsilateral distal radius/ulna fracture within 3 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who do not have phone or electronic mail access. This will preclude follow up&#xD;
             of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients in whom the English language is so limited that consent and/or follow up is&#xD;
             not possible.&#xD;
