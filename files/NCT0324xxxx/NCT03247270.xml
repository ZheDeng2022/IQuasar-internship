  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Global Burden of Disease report in 2015, anxiety disorders are among the top&#xD;
      10 contributors to years lived with disability worldwide. There is a need for effective&#xD;
      treatment protocols. As cardiovascular fitness has a major impact on the brain's ability to&#xD;
      change structurally and functionally, interventions involving physical exercise might prove&#xD;
      positive in the treatment of persons with anxiety. Yet there are few high quality clinical&#xD;
      studies with physical exercise as an intervention for anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test a 12 week physical exercise intervention for persons treated for anxiety&#xD;
           disorders within primary care. The exposure of interest is intensity of physical&#xD;
           exercise; outcomes include anxiety symptom burden, cognitive ability and sick leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gain knowledge regarding potential mechanisms by comparing serum levels of specific&#xD;
           hormones and cytokines (characterized and associated with brain plasticity in animal&#xD;
           models) before and after different intensities of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 3 groups: 1) Intervention I: 12 week exercise program with&#xD;
      low-intensity fitness training 3 times per week. 2) Intervention II: 12 week exercise program&#xD;
      with moderate to high-intensity fitness training 3 times per week. 3) Control group, who will&#xD;
      have a physiotherapy session once and will be given general advice about physical activity.&#xD;
      At baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year data of cardiovascular fitness, anxiety symptoms, cognitive&#xD;
      and working ability and biomarkers will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If physical exercise positively affects anxiety disorders it would have significance, for the&#xD;
      patients as well as for society. In addition to increased quality of life, it may decrease&#xD;
      future marginalization and premature death among individuals suffering from anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. Reducing medical and sick-leave costs would also liberate health care resources to&#xD;
      be used elsewhere in an economically strained health care system.&#xD;

      Overall objective To examine whether physical exercise reduces anxiety symptoms, improves&#xD;
      cognition and decreases need of sick leave in patients with anxiety disorders in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Mental illness is the most common reason for unemployment in people of working age&#xD;
      and this is a growing patient group in Swedish primary care today. A survey by the European&#xD;
      Commission showed that 17% of the Swedish population had sought help over the past year for&#xD;
      psychiatric problems. These figures are above average for European countries and are&#xD;
      increasing. Sweden's costs for mental illness is around MSEK 70,000 annually - an increase of&#xD;
      MSEK 20,000 over ten years - and the proportion of sick leave days due to a psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnosis is currently 40%. Mental illness reduces quality of life substantially. For&#xD;
      example, 18-year-olds with anxiety disorders have increased risk of future marginalization&#xD;
      and have a two-fold increase in mortality not only due to suicide but several different death&#xD;
      causes, emphasizing the importance of finding effective treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the adult brain to change both structurally and functionally is called brain&#xD;
      plasticity. Both in humans and in animal models physical exercise has a major impact on brain&#xD;
      plasticity. Physical exercise can increase neurogenesis and improve memory functions in rats,&#xD;
      and circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can promote this effect. Brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are also involved.&#xD;
      In addition, there is evidence that physical activity modifies neuronal activity, increases&#xD;
      the formation of synapses, and reduces inflammation markers, which may be correlated with&#xD;
      neuroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously demonstrated an association between physical fitness and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, suggesting positive preventive benefits of physical exercise. The&#xD;
      beneficial effects of exercise interventions have to date mainly been demonstrated in persons&#xD;
      with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test a 12 week physical exercise intervention for persons treated for anxiety&#xD;
           disorders within primary care. The exposure of interest is intensity of physical&#xD;
           exercise; outcomes include anxiety symptom burden, cognitive ability and sickness leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gain knowledge regarding potential mechanisms by comparing serum levels of specific&#xD;
           hormones (characterized and associated with brain plasticity in animal models) before&#xD;
           and after different intensities of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship to the research frontline In contrast to the literature on depression there are&#xD;
      very few clinical studies on physical exercise as an intervention for anxiety. All six trials&#xD;
      performed hitherto were identified as being at a high risk of bias. Higher quality trials are&#xD;
      thus required. There is a need to investigate the role of intensity, volume, frequency and&#xD;
      type of exercise on anxiety symptoms, cognitive function and working ability in people with&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. Also, the putative mechanisms behind the potential effects on anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms are not elucidated and deserve attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel feature of this study is the examination of different intensities of physical&#xD;
      fitness-improving exercise in patients with anxiety disorders. This has not previously been&#xD;
      performed and would yield valuable insight into dose-response associations between physical&#xD;
      fitness and effects on the brain. Objective measurements of physical fitness and cognition&#xD;
      are a great strength of the proposed study. Analyzing specific hormones and cytokines before&#xD;
      and after the intervention, in relation to symptoms and functional data, may provide&#xD;
      additional information about mechanistic aspects, treatment effect and prognosis. The&#xD;
      proposed research also offers opportunities to develop effective treatment protocols to&#xD;
      reduce the costs of sick-leave, an area of increasing interest world-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the proposed study has the potential to provide novel and important contributions&#xD;
      to existing scientific knowledge regarding how physical exercise influences anxiety,&#xD;
      cognitive function and working ability in patients with anxiety disorders in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan The study cohort will be patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders at six primary&#xD;
      care centres in Gothenburg, Southern Bohuslän and Halland including patients with panic&#xD;
      syndrome (F41.0), generalized anxiety (F41.1), mixed anxiety- and depression conditions&#xD;
      (F41.2 and F41.3), as well as anxiety UNS (F41.9). Diagnoses and comorbidities will be&#xD;
      determined by the study psychiatrist using the M.I.N.I (the Mini International&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Interview, Swedish version 6.0.0d DSM-IV). Intervention and follow-ups will&#xD;
      take place at Primary Care Rehab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude patients from the baseline who have physical difficulties in&#xD;
      performing a physical exercise program, pathological ECG, previous psychiatric illnesses,&#xD;
      ongoing abuse, increased risk of suicide as determined by the GP, those under 18, pregnant&#xD;
      women and those over 65 years of age. An additional exclusion criterion will be physical&#xD;
      activity level at baseline exceeding one exercise occasion per week. Both people with and&#xD;
      without ongoing treatment with psychoactive medication will be included. Supportive contact&#xD;
      for example with a health center nurse is not an exclusion criterion but persons with ongoing&#xD;
      psychotherapy will not be included unless the participants, as well as the GP, are willing to&#xD;
      take a break in therapy for the duration of the 12 week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment takes place at primary care centres and thus represents the individuals who seek&#xD;
      help in primary care for anxiety. Potential participants are contacted by a study&#xD;
      psychiatrist who has no healthcare provider relationship to the patient. Intervention and&#xD;
      follow-ups will take place at Primary Care Rehab. Each individual must sign a statement of&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year, the following data will be collected by the study&#xD;
      physician:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Swedish version 6.0.0d DSM-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of psychoactive prescription drugs including dosage and duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sick leave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-report questions about alcohol (AUDIT self-assessment scale), smoking and diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Established psychiatric self-assessment scales: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Montgomery&#xD;
           Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRAS) and the quality of life instrument EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Design Fluency, which is part of the D-Kefs battery of tests and is well known and&#xD;
           used by many psychologists within education and psychiatry. This is a standardized test,&#xD;
           carried out within a few minutes that measures executive abilities such as creativity,&#xD;
           response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective measurements of physical fitness in the form of estimated maximal oxygen&#xD;
           uptake capacity (VO2max) using Åstrand's submaximal bicycle test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be taken, by a nurse at the health center, to analyze the potential&#xD;
           correlation of the following hormones/cytokines with symptoms and function data:&#xD;
           S-IGF-I, S-BDNF, S-VEGF and high sensitivity CRP. The blood samples are stored in a&#xD;
           separate, locked -70 freezer at c-lab Sahlgrenska. IVO has been notified of the&#xD;
           establishment of a biobank (No 946).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into three groups: 1) Intervention I: 12 week exercise program&#xD;
      with low-intensity fitness training 3 times per week. 2) Intervention II: 12 week exercise&#xD;
      program with moderate to high-intensity fitness training 3 times per week. 3) Control group.&#xD;
      The physiotherapists at Primary Care Rehab will perform the submaximal bicycle test and&#xD;
      personally design the exercise program in the gym. The patients will have a one-to-one&#xD;
      session with the physiotherapists on 2 occasions and afterwards several people will exercise&#xD;
      at the same time in the gym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical power analysis has been performed by statistician Linus Schiöler. Based on&#xD;
      other studies, an effect size of 0.5 difference between the groups is clinically relevant,&#xD;
      which equates to a 5 point difference between the groups using the BAI scale. Standard&#xD;
      deviations from a previous study using BAI as the outcome measurement were in the interval of&#xD;
      5-10. SD 9 was used in the calculations. Based on these assumptions, at least 60 patients in&#xD;
      each of the treatment arms should be included to reach 80% power at the 5% significance&#xD;
      level. Health-economic analyses will be performed using primary data generated within the&#xD;
      project concerning health-related quality of life effects caused by the intervention and&#xD;
      information about healthcare resources utilized. A health-economic model that depicts the&#xD;
      clinical trial will be constructed and used for computing cost-utility measures. Moreover,&#xD;
      the model will be constructed for performing extensive probabilistic sensitivity analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg approved the&#xD;
      study: PHYSBI intervention study: EPN Göteborg Dnr: 300-16. The control group will have a&#xD;
      physiotherapy session once and will be given general advice about physical activity. There&#xD;
      will be a possibility to individualize treatments i.e. the same intensity but different&#xD;
      exercises to better fit the needs and preferences of different individuals. Coding and&#xD;
      anonymization of data occur after data collection is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborations The principal investigator for this project Ass Prof Maria Åberg is the chair&#xD;
      of the steering committee for Physical Fitness and Brain Epidemiological studies (PHYSBE)&#xD;
      which is a multidisciplinary umbrella organization for several projects. Prof Kjell Torén&#xD;
      from Occupational and Environmental Medicine provides epidemiological competence. Prof Margda&#xD;
      Waern provides psychiatric expertise. Physiotherapist Louise Danielsson and Prof Kristian&#xD;
      Bolin at the Department of Economics and Statistics have experience of clinical intervention&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be published in international renowned peer-reviewed research journals.&#xD;
