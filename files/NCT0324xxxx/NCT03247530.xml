    <measure>Efficacy of SPN-812 Assessed by Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5) Total score at Week 6 (End of Study). The ADHD-RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess current ADHD symptomatology. The scale consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) symptoms of ADHD. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). A Total score is calculated by adding the responses of all 18 items (range: 0-54; the higher the score, the more severe the ADHD symptoms). Lower change from baseline scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>The first Key Secondary Endpoint was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale score at Week 6 (End of Study). The CGI-I scale is a single item assessment of how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state prior to the beginning of treatment. The CGI-I is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; and 7 = &quot;very much worse.&quot; Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overall score in subsequent testing.</description>

    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by Conners 3 - Parent Short Form (C3PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>The second Key Secondary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Conners 3rd Edition - Parent Short Form (C3PS) Composite T-score at Week 6 (End of Study). The Conners 3rd Edition is a focused diagnostic tool for the assessment of ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children 6 to 18 years of age. The C3PS is completed by a child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 45 items with subsets of items related to six content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive functioning, learning problems, defiance/aggression and peer relations. The parent rates his/her child on the first 43 items of the C3PS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently]) based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>The third Key Secondary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P) Total Average score at Week 6 (End of Study). The WFIRS instrument evaluates ADHD-related functional impairment. The WFIRS-P is completed by the child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 50 items grouped into six domains: Family (10 items), School (10 items, includes learning [4 items] and behavior [6 items]), Life Skills (10 items), Child's Self-Concept (3 items), Social Activities (7 items), and Risky Activities (10 items). The parent/guardian rates each item on a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=never or not at all to 3= very often or very much) based on their child's behavior past month. A Total Average score was computed by calculating mean rating of all 50 items (ranging from 0 to 3, where a higher value represents more severe functional impairment). Lower change from baseline Total Average scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by 50% Responder Rate Per the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the percentage of responders at Week 6 (End of Study). A responder was defined as a subject who had a 50% or greater reduction (improvement) in their change from baseline Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5) Total score at Week 6 (End of Study). Values range from 0 to 100%. A higher percentage represents a greater number of responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition, Short Form (PSI-4-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition, Short Form (PSI-4-SF) Total score at Week 6 (End of Study). The PSI-4 questionnaire evaluates the magnitude of stress in the parent-child relationship based on the parent's perception of the child's characteristics, the personal characteristics of the parent, and the interaction between the parent and the child. The PSI-4-SF was developed for parents of children ages 1 month to 12 years. The PSI-4-SF consists of 36 items divided into three domains: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where SD=Strongly Disagree, D=Disagree, NS=Not Sure, A=Agree, and SA=Strongly Agree. The total score ranges between 90 and 450; higher total scores indicate higher levels of stress. Lower change from baseline total scores (&lt;0) represent better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subscale and the Inattention Subscale of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5) Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale score and Inattention subscale score at Week 6 (End of Study). The ADHD-RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess current ADHD symptomatology. The scale consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 DSM-5 symptoms of ADHD, including 9 items for the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale and 9 items for the Inattention subscale. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). Each subscale score is calculated by adding the responses of all respective 9 items (range: 0-27; the higher the subscale score, the more severe the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity or Inattention symptoms). Lower change from baseline subscale scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by Conners 3 - Self Report Short Form (C3-SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Conners 3rd Edition - Self Report Short Form (C3-SRS) Composite T score at Week 6 (End of Study). The Conners 3rd Edition is a focused diagnostic tool for assessment of ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children 6 to 18 years of age. The C3-SRS, which is only validated in children/adolescents 8-18 years of age, is comprised of 41 items with subsets of items related to five content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning problems, aggression and family relations. The subject rates himself/herself on the first 39 items of C3-SRS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently] based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). Total score = sum of 18 items (range: 0 to 54). The higher the score, the more severe the ADHD symptoms (a total score &gt;=28 was an inclusion criterion of this study).</description>

        <description>The Primary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5) Total score at Week 6 (End of Study). The ADHD-RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess current ADHD symptomatology. The scale consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) symptoms of ADHD. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). A Total score is calculated by adding the responses of all 18 items (range: 0-54; the higher the score, the more severe the ADHD symptoms). Lower change from baseline scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The second Key Secondary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Conners 3rd Edition - Parent Short Form (C3PS) Composite T-score at Week 6 (End of Study). The Conners 3rd Edition is a focused diagnostic tool for the assessment of ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children 6 to 18 years of age. The C3PS is completed by a child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 45 items with subsets of items related to six content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive functioning, learning problems, defiance/aggression and peer relations. The parent rates his/her child on the first 43 items of the C3PS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently]) based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

The C3PS is completed by a child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 45 items with subsets of items related to six content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive functioning, learning problems, defiance/aggression and peer relations. The parent rates his/her child on the first 43 items of the C3PS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently]) based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The third Key Secondary Endpoint was the change from baseline in the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale-Parent Report (WFIRS-P) Total Average score at Week 6 (End of Study). The WFIRS instrument evaluates ADHD-related functional impairment. The WFIRS-P is completed by the child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 50 items grouped into six domains: Family (10 items), School (10 items, includes learning [4 items] and behavior [6 items]), Life Skills (10 items), Child's Self-Concept (3 items), Social Activities (7 items), and Risky Activities (10 items). The parent/guardian rates each item on a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=never or not at all to 3= very often or very much) based on their child's behavior past month. A Total Average score was computed by calculating mean rating of all 50 items (ranging from 0 to 3, where a higher value represents more severe functional impairment). Lower change from baseline Total Average scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition, Short Form (PSI-4-SF) Total score at Week 6 (End of Study). The PSI-4 questionnaire evaluates the magnitude of stress in the parent-child relationship based on the parent's perception of the child's characteristics, the personal characteristics of the parent, and the interaction between the parent and the child. The PSI-4-SF was developed for parents of children ages 1 month to 12 years. The PSI-4-SF consists of 36 items divided into three domains: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where SD=Strongly Disagree, D=Disagree, NS=Not Sure, A=Agree, and SA=Strongly Agree. The total score ranges between 90 and 450; higher total scores indicate higher levels of stress. Lower change from baseline total scores (&lt;0) represent better outcome.</description>

        <title>Effect of SPN-812 Assessed by the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subscale and the Inattention Subscale of the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5)</title>
        <description>An additional secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, 5th Edition (ADHD-RS-5) Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale score and Inattention subscale score at Week 6 (End of Study). The ADHD-RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess current ADHD symptomatology. The scale consists of 18 items that directly correspond to the 18 DSM-5 symptoms of ADHD, including 9 items for the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale and 9 items for the Inattention subscale. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). Each subscale score is calculated by adding the responses of all respective 9 items (range: 0-27; the higher the subscale score, the more severe the Hyperactivity/Impulsivity or Inattention symptoms). Lower change from baseline subscale scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>

The Conners 3rd Edition is a focused diagnostic tool for assessment of ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children 6 to 18 years of age. The C3-SRS, which is only validated in children/adolescents 8-18 years of age, is comprised of 41 items with subsets of items related to five content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning problems, aggression and family relations. The subject rates himself/herself on the first 39 items of C3-SRS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently] based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome.</description>
