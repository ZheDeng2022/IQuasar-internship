      The subjects and evaluating investigator will be blinded to the treatment, thus maintaining&#xD;
      double-blind status. By nature of the varying volumes of injection, the treating investigator&#xD;
      will be unblinded to the treatment. A series of 3 injection sessions will be performed spaced&#xD;
      4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canfield Vectra 3D imaging will be performed at baseline and at each follow up visit. Follow&#xD;
      up visits will be performed 3 and 5 days after each injection session to assess for side&#xD;
      effect and tolerability profile. After the final injection session, additional follow up&#xD;
      visits will be performed at days 90 and 180 to assess for efficacy. Subject weight will be&#xD;
      recorded at baseline and at end of study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Single-site randomized, double-blind comparison trial of Kybella injections with or&#xD;
      without triamcinolone acetate for the reduction of submental fat. 20 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial. Of these 20 subjects, 5 will be randomized to receive Kybella&#xD;
      injections alone whereas 15 will receive Kybella plus triamcinolone acetate in the following&#xD;
      way:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Kybella alone: 2 mg/cm2 of Kybella will be delivered in up to 50 injections spaced 1.0&#xD;
           cm apart at 0.2 mL/injection for a total dose of up to 100 mg of sodium deoxycholate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Kybella plus triamcinolone: 0.2 mL of 2 mg/cm2 of Kybella will be mixed with 0.05 mL of&#xD;
           40 mg/mL of triamcinolone acetate and then delivered in up to 50 injections spaced 1.0&#xD;
           cm apart at 0.25 mL/injection for a total dose of up to 100 mg of sodium deoxycholate&#xD;
           using a 30 gauge (or smaller) 0.5-inch needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment area will be bounded superiorly by a line 1 cm inferior to the mandibular&#xD;
      margin, laterally by the sternocleidomastoid muscles, and inferiorly by the hyoid bone. The&#xD;
      subjects and evaluating investigator will be blinded to the treatment, thus maintaining&#xD;
      double-blind status. By nature of the varying volumes of injection, the treating investigator&#xD;
      will be unblinded to the treatment. A series of 3 injection sessions will be performed spaced&#xD;
      4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canfield Vectra 3D imaging will be performed at baseline and at each follow up visit. Follow&#xD;
      up visits will be performed 3 and 5 days after each injection session to assess for side&#xD;
      effect and tolerability profile. After the final injection session, additional follow up&#xD;
      visits will be performed at days 90 and 180 to assess for efficacy. Subject weight will be&#xD;
      recorded at baseline and at end of study.&#xD;
