&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: Up to 30 interviews with patients +/- their carers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study Period: October 2017 - December 2018&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be invited and recruited to the study from St Joseph's Hospice in Hackney&#xD;
      (single centre study). Patients with cancer that are either attending the day centre service&#xD;
      at St Joseph's or being visited at home by the community specialist palliative care&#xD;
      nursing/medical team based at St Joseph's Hospice; will be approached by their direct&#xD;
      clinical care staff. (Some of the direct clinical care team are National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      staff and some care is commissioned by the NHS despite St Joseph's Hospice being a non-NHS&#xD;
      site). Staff will initiate discussion about the project, and will assess for both mental and&#xD;
      physical capacity to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Emilie Green (EG) will then contact the potential participants by phone or in person (if&#xD;
      they have previously given verbal consent for her to join their usual clinical staff on a&#xD;
      home visit or when they are attending the day centre). The project will be discussed with&#xD;
      each potential participant, and EG will answer any questions they may have, will assess for&#xD;
      mental and physical capacity, and will arrange a mutually convenient time and location to&#xD;
      meet for the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the interview, EG will again make time to clarify any questions each&#xD;
      participant may have. She will ask each participant to date/sign three consent forms before&#xD;
      starting the interview (one for EG, one for the participant, and one for their notes at St&#xD;
      Joseph's Hospice). If a joint interview is undertaken with a patient and their carer; both&#xD;
      parties will individually sign their own consent forms. She will then ask questions relating&#xD;
      to sociodemographic data (recording this on the Personal Information Sheet) e.g. age, living&#xD;
      situation and diagnosis before starting the interview. The interviews will each last at least&#xD;
      30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants decide that they would like a telephone interview, the process will be&#xD;
      slightly different. EG will send three consent forms to each prospective participant (one for&#xD;
      them to keep, and two for them to date/sign and send back by post) in a stamped addressed&#xD;
      envelope. If the forms are not received within 3 weeks, EG will follow up with a phone call&#xD;
      to the prospective participant, to clarify whether they still wish to participate. Only after&#xD;
      she receives the two dated/signed consent forms will EG arrange a time with them for the&#xD;
      telephone interview. She will then phone the participant from a private location that she&#xD;
      does not share with other colleagues. She will collect sociodemographic information (which&#xD;
      will be recorded on the Personal Information Sheet) before starting the interview (which will&#xD;
      last at least 30 minutes.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be obtained through semi-structured interviews with adults with cancer&#xD;
      and palliative care needs. Patients will be invited to bring their carer to the interview. EG&#xD;
      will conduct and transcribe up to 30 audio-recorded semi-structured interviews, which will be&#xD;
      carried out at the patient's preferred location (either at home, over the phone, or in a&#xD;
      pre-booked room at St Joseph's Hospice). EG will ask questions relating to sociodemographic&#xD;
      data (recording this on the Personal Information Sheet) prior to starting the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EG will transcribe all interviews verbatim. Data will be analysed thematically and will&#xD;
      adhere to the principles of the Framework Analysis developed by Ritchie and Spencer.&#xD;
      Recurring themes and concepts will be identified using a constant comparative approach. Any&#xD;
      contributions made by carers will be included and analysed as 'added value' data.This will&#xD;
      enable us to explore if and how carers' perspectives contribute to our understanding of&#xD;
      patient experience of their GP's involvement in palliative care.&#xD;

        Participants will be invited and recruited to the study from St Joseph's Hospice in Hackney&#xD;
        (single centre study). Patients and their carers from all three geographical areas, served&#xD;
        by St Joseph's, will be invited to participate: City &amp; Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham.&#xD;
        The Principal Investigator Jane Naismith (JN) working at St Joseph's Hospice will assist&#xD;
        with and coordinate the recruitment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This setting was chosen as it permits access to a varied group of patients and carers. A&#xD;
        purposive sampling will ensure recruitment of patients across a breadth of&#xD;
        socio-demographics, cancer diagnoses and experience of different GP practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A target sample size of up to 30 interviews has been chosen, taking into account available&#xD;
        time and resources.&#xD;
