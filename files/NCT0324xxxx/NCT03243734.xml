      Prospective, open label, non-controlled single arm, multi-center study The primary objective&#xD;
      is to study the effects of the trūFreeze® Spray Cryotherapy System in a population of&#xD;
      subjects who have been diagnosed with persistent local esophageal cancer and who are not&#xD;
      surgical candidates or have completed or declined systemic therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of cryotherapy delivered with the trūFreeze® System via noncontact spray ablates the&#xD;
      cancer cells while allowing adjacent normal tissue to regenerate. When the liquid nitrogen is&#xD;
      delivered to the malignant lesion the cancer cells undergo ablation induced by intracellular&#xD;
      water being frozen in place such that ice crystals are formed. These ice crystals aggregate&#xD;
      quickly causing immediate intracellular energy producing organelles to be destroyed leading&#xD;
      to a non-viable cell. Subsequent tumor sloughing and absorption of apoptotic cells occurs&#xD;
      with a subsequent debulking of the tumor mass. Normal tissue will regenerate as&#xD;
      re-epithelialization occurs. The extreme cold of -196 degrees Celsius or a &quot;hard freeze&quot;&#xD;
      leads to more extensive primary cell death over a shorter freeze time as compared to&#xD;
      cryoprobes. A reduction of overall tumor obstruction in the esophageal lumen can reduce&#xD;
      symptoms of dysphagia, delay the time until stent is needed, provide palliative care for&#xD;
      patients for whom additional tri-modal therapies are not an option, and may increase quality&#xD;
      of life in esophageal cancer patients. The studies conducted to date have provided&#xD;
      documentation of the safety and effectiveness of spray cryotherapy (SCT) when used for&#xD;
      malignancies in the esophagus. Measures of dysphagia relief have been described in peer&#xD;
      reviewed literature. This study aims to provide much needed HRQOL information as well as&#xD;
      additional tumor characteristics before and after SCT. A cohort of patients with locally&#xD;
      persistent esophageal cancer will be studied in up to twelve (12) centers in the United&#xD;
      States to provide important HRQOL data and more a comprehensive understanding of clinical&#xD;
      tumor response post SCT. In the proposed study, the trūFreeze® System spray cryotherapy&#xD;
      procedure will be performed during endoscopy. Each SCT procedure will be performed&#xD;
      endoscopically at clinically indicated intervals of 6 weeks +/- 3 weeks. Total procedure&#xD;
      dosimetry will be delivered at the discretion of the Investigator based on tumor location and&#xD;
      patient tolerability. After each procedure at defined intervals, patients will be contacted&#xD;
      and QOL symptom related information will be collected. If at any point an Investigator&#xD;
      determines that a subject is not a candidate for further spray cryotherapy or is unable to&#xD;
      tolerate additional procedures, they will be contacted via telephone to ascertain HRQOL&#xD;
      information. Subject participation will last up to two years or until death&#xD;
