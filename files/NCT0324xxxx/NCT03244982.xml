  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescein angiography is a common procedure used in ophthalmology to diagnose and monitor&#xD;
      diseases of the eye. The standard dose of fluorescein dye used in fluorescein angiography is&#xD;
      500mg. It is common practice to give patients who have previously had an adverse reaction to&#xD;
      fluorescein dye a half-dose, or 250mg, of fluorescein. It has been determined by our&#xD;
      institution that anecdotally, there is no difference in image quality between the images&#xD;
      created by a half-dose of fluorescein versus a full dose of fluorescein. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study seeks to determine whether these doses are actually equivalent in terms of image&#xD;
      quality. Patients who consent to participate in the study will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a half or a full dose of intravenous fluorescein, and their images will be compared&#xD;
      subjectively using a masked team of retinal surgeons and residents. We hypothesize that there&#xD;
      will be no significant difference between the images obtained using a half-dose versus a full&#xD;
      dose of intravenous fluorescein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescein angiography is a common procedure used in ophthalmology to diagnose and monitor&#xD;
      diseases of the retinal and choroidal blood vessels. The most commonly seen adverse reactions&#xD;
      to fluorescein angiography include nausea, vomiting, and urticaria. More severe reactions&#xD;
      such as anaphylaxis are rare, occurring in only 1 of 2247 patients (0.4%) in a recent&#xD;
      retrospective study. The standard dose of intravenous fluorescein used for fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography is 500mg given intravenously in a 10% or 25% solution. One study from 2008&#xD;
      attempted to compare a 200mg dose versus a 500mg dose of intravenous fluorescein, and found&#xD;
      that 200mg produced inferior image quality. However, the quality of the cameras used for&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography has improved significantly in the last 10 years, and the scanning&#xD;
      laser ophthalmoscope currently used for fluorescein angiography in our clinic (Optos) is&#xD;
      significantly more effective than the fundus camera used in the 2008 study (Topcon). The&#xD;
      scanning laser ophthalmoscope uses a fundamentally different imaging technique than the&#xD;
      traditional fundus camera, with a much narrower illumination source, and has been shown to be&#xD;
      significantly more sensitive in the detection of retinal vascular leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commonly used method for preventing adverse reactions in patients who have previously had&#xD;
      an adverse reaction to intravenous fluorescein is to use a 250mg dose instead of the standard&#xD;
      500mg dose, despite the lack of evidence to this effect. In our anecdotal experience, a 250mg&#xD;
      dose of intravenous fluorescein, used in patients whom have previously experienced an adverse&#xD;
      reaction, has produced images of equivalent quality to the images produced using a full 500mg&#xD;
      dose. To our knowledge, no study has compared a 500mg dose of intravenous fluorescein with a&#xD;
      lower dose since the 2008 study previously mentioned, despite the advances in camera quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to recruit a sample size of approximately 100 patients. Adult patients&#xD;
      scheduled for fluorescein angiography at the Kresge Eye Institute will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study by one of the study members if they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once a&#xD;
      patient has consented to participate in the study, they will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      a 250mg or 500mg dose of intravenous fluorescein with their fluorescein angiography&#xD;
      procedure. All fluorescein angiograms will be done only if clinically indicated, and&#xD;
      therefore the patient will not be placed at any increased risk by participating in this&#xD;
      study. If a participant returns for a repeat fluorescein angiogram within the next four&#xD;
      months, they will receive the dose (250mg or 500mg) which they did not receive with their&#xD;
      previous angiogram. Patients who experience an adverse reaction during their first angiogram&#xD;
      will be removed from the study in order to prevent a patient who had an adverse reaction with&#xD;
      a half-dose from receiving a full-dose with a subsequent procedure. The photographer will&#xD;
      adjust the image brightness settings in order to create the &quot;best possible&quot; image for each&#xD;
      patient, and there will be no change between procedures with the 250mg and 500mg doses. A&#xD;
      single camera (Optos) will be used for each patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be obtained from the patient, the imaging procedure, and the patient's&#xD;
      electronic medical records at the Kresge Eye Institute. Information to be collected includes&#xD;
      age, gender, race, visual acuity, and ophthalmologic medical history. The timing and quality&#xD;
      of images at different phases of fluorescein angiography will be compared between 500mg and&#xD;
      250mg doses in each eye using objective and subjective measures. Subjective criteria will&#xD;
      include grading of the images by a panel of masked retinal surgeons and residents. Grading&#xD;
      will look at specific factors of a fluorescein angiography such as macula detail,&#xD;
      macrovasculature, and microvasculature. These subjective criteria will then be used to&#xD;
      determine whether any appreciable difference exists in the image quality between 250mg and&#xD;
      500mg doses of intravenous fluorescein given prior to Optos fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
