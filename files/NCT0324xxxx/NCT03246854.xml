  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to assess the MTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and preliminary antitumor activity of DBPR112 in patients with head and neck cancer and EGFR&#xD;
      mutated lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human study to determine the MTD and&#xD;
      RP2D of DBPR112 and to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of DBPR112 in Asian patients.&#xD;
      Patients with non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed following prior therapy with&#xD;
      an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor or in patients with&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN) who have progressed following prior standard&#xD;
      therapy will be selected. Approximately 24 to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study as&#xD;
      out patients/inpatients, in 2 study centers in Taiwan.&#xD;
