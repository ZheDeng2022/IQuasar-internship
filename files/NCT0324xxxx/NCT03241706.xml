      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how sugar levels in the liver&#xD;
      affect the ability of people both with and without type 1 diabetes. People with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes do not make their own insulin, and are therefore required to give themselves&#xD;
      injections of insulin in order to keep their blood sugar under control. However, very often&#xD;
      people with type 1 diabetes give themselves too much insulin and this causes their blood&#xD;
      sugar to become very low, which can have a negative impact on their health. When the blood&#xD;
      sugar becomes low, healthy people secrete hormones such as glucagon and epinephrine (i.e.,&#xD;
      adrenaline), which restore the blood sugar levels to normal by increasing liver glucose&#xD;
      production into the blood. However, in people with type 1 diabetes, the ability to release&#xD;
      glucagon and epinephrine is impaired and this reduces the amount of sugar the liver is able&#xD;
      to release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with type 1 diabetes also have unusually low stores of sugar in their livers. It has&#xD;
      been shown in animal studies that when the amount of sugar stored in the liver is increased,&#xD;
      it increases the release of glucagon and epinephrine during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In&#xD;
      turn, this increase in hormone release boosts liver sugar production. However, it is not&#xD;
      known if increased liver sugar content can influence these responses in people with and&#xD;
      without type 1 diabetes. In addition, when people with type 1 diabetes do experience an&#xD;
      episode of low blood sugar, it impairs their responses to low blood sugar the next day. It is&#xD;
      also unknown whether this reduction in low blood sugar responses is caused by low liver sugar&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to learn more about how liver sugar levels affect the ability to&#xD;
      respond to low blood sugar.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is universal agreement that iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the single most prominent&#xD;
      barrier to the safe, effective management of blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D). The typical patient with T1D is required to &quot;count&quot; the number of carbohydrates they&#xD;
      consume, estimate their own insulin doses and deliver this insulin subcutaneously to manage&#xD;
      their own glycemic level. With these multiple degrees of freedom, it is not surprising that&#xD;
      people with T1D frequently over-insulinize, thereby putting themselves at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing hypoglycemia and its associated comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the glycemic level falls in people who are generally healthy (i.e., non-T1D), the first&#xD;
      response is an abatement of insulin secretion. This reduction is then followed by an increase&#xD;
      in the release of the counterregulatory hormones glucagon and epinephrine as glycemia&#xD;
      continues to fall. Collectively, this hormonal milieu causes an increase in liver glycogen&#xD;
      mobilization and gluconeogenesis such that hepatic glucose production (HGP) increases,&#xD;
      thereby preventing serious hypoglycemia from occurring. However, people with T1D are unable&#xD;
      to reduce their own insulin levels (due to subcutaneous insulin delivery) and often have a&#xD;
      diminished capacity to secrete both glucagon and epinephrine during insulin-induced&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Predictably, the HGP response to hypoglycemia in people with T1D is a fraction&#xD;
      of that seen in non-T1D controls, thereby increasing the depth and duration of the&#xD;
      hypoglycemic episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver glycogen is the first substrate used to defend against hypoglycemia. Interestingly,&#xD;
      hepatic glycogen levels in people with T1D are lower than those of non-T1D controls and their&#xD;
      ability to mobilize liver glycogen to combat insulin-induced hypoglycemia is also diminished.&#xD;
      Because of this, we carried out experiments in dogs to determine whether hepatic glycogen&#xD;
      content is a determinant of the HGP response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Results of&#xD;
      those studies showed that a 75% increase in liver glycogen (such as occurs in a non-T1D&#xD;
      individual over the course of a day) generated a signal in the liver that was transmitted to&#xD;
      the brain via afferent nerves which, in turn, led to an increase in the secretion of both&#xD;
      epinephrine and glucagon. As expected, this increase in counterregulatory hormone secretion&#xD;
      caused a 2.4-fold rise in HGP, despite insulin levels that were ~ 400 ÂµU/mL at the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finding that an acute increase in hepatic glycogen can augment hypoglycemic&#xD;
      counterregulation has important clinical implications. However, despite the potential of this&#xD;
      therapeutic avenue to reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia, it remains unclear at this&#xD;
      point if such a strategy translates to humans with T1D. Therefore, the overarching theme of&#xD;
      this proposal is to determine whether an acute increase in liver glycogen content can augment&#xD;
      the hepatic and hormonal responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans with and without&#xD;
      T1D. Herein we are proposing studies that will advance the field, with the specific aims&#xD;
      being as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To determine the effect of increasing liver glycogen deposition on&#xD;
      insulin-induced hypoglycemic counterregulation in humans with and without T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of ways by which the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia can be reduced in people&#xD;
      with T1D is a priority. The proposed experiments will improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which increased glycogen improves hypoglycemic counterregulation. If&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is reduced by increased glycogen, it will focus attention on the ways in which&#xD;
      liver glycogen levels can be normalized in people with T1D. This would be a significant step&#xD;
      forward in the ongoing effort to reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia in people with&#xD;
      T1D.&#xD;
