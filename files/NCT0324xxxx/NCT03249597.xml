  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a condition with a high mortality. Septic patients are frequently difficult to&#xD;
      identify because of their non-specific presentations. There is also a low sensitivity of&#xD;
      clinical judgment among health care personnel, and of existing screening tools, which are in&#xD;
      turn typically based on vital parameters. Despite prior research, no unique sepsis biomarker&#xD;
      has been identified so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for new strategies to identify sepsis which do not rely on vital parameters&#xD;
      and traditional laboratory blood tests alone. The hypothesis of the investigators is that a&#xD;
      combination of clinical variables measurable in the ambulance can be used to predict sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to determine the predictive value of keywords related to&#xD;
      symptom presentation, vital parameters and point-of-care (POC) blood tests, alone and in&#xD;
      combination, with respect to the outcome sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed in the Stockholm ambulance setting from April 2017. A total of 956&#xD;
      adult non-trauma patients will be included.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis affects at least 19 000 people in Sweden each year. Despite being a time critical&#xD;
      condition with a high mortality, sepsis is often not identified in a timely fashion. The&#xD;
      current study aims to identify predictors of sepsis in the ambulance setting. Early treatment&#xD;
      is a cornerstone in sepsis. Time to treatment in the emergency department (ED) has been shown&#xD;
      to be shortened by identification of the septic patient in the ambulance. Identification of&#xD;
      the septic patient in the ambulance may also move the treatment to the prehospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, identification is dependent on the suspicion of sepsis and by health care&#xD;
      professionals applying clinical judgment. Traditionally, the definition of sepsis has been&#xD;
      based on the presence of infection and a minimum of two SIRS criteria (Systemic Inflammatory&#xD;
      Response Syndrome), which have, however, been shown to be both un-sensitive and non-specific.&#xD;
      The investigators have in previous studies proved proof of principle that a screening tool&#xD;
      increases the identification of the septic patient and is superior to clinical judgment among&#xD;
      both ambulance personnel and ED doctors. Moreover, these studies also illustrate that current&#xD;
      screening tools do not identify all septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the patients' medical history has not previously been incorporated in a&#xD;
      screening tool. The investigators have previously identified keywords related to the septic&#xD;
      patients' medical history as presented to the emergency medical services (EMS). Eight&#xD;
      keywords showed a prevalence exceeding 20% for all septic patients, and examples were&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms and a history of abnormal temperature. However, the specificity of&#xD;
      these keywords with respect to sepsis remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, point of care blood tests may add value in sepsis identification in the ambulance when&#xD;
      combined with other measures. Glucose is currently measured by the Swedish EMS. Lactate&#xD;
      testing is standard in Swedish EDs, but yet not in all ambulance services, and is used as a&#xD;
      marker of hypoperfusion and response to treatment in sepsis. Soluble urokinase-type&#xD;
      plasminogen activator (suPAR) has been shown to be a prognostic marker in sepsis.&#xD;
      Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a promising biomarker and as an early indicator of&#xD;
      circulatory failure in sepsis. To date, no studies have analyzed the added value of suPAR or&#xD;
      HBP to history and vital parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the identification of sepsis within ambulance care can be increased by&#xD;
      implementing a screening tool based on a combination of vital parameters, keywords related to&#xD;
      patients´ medical history and point of care tests. Such a screening tool is expected to&#xD;
      enable timely treatment, and thus improve the prognosis for the septic patient. The current&#xD;
      study aims to determine the predictive value of parameters that could be included in a sepsis&#xD;
      screening tool tailored to the ambulance setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the predictive value of vital parameters, keywords related to patients´ medical&#xD;
      history and point-of-care blood tests, alone and in combination, with respect to&#xD;
      identification of sepsis in the ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study in the ambulance setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult (≥18 years) non-trauma patients with a new onset of infection (prehospital infection&#xD;
      group) or considered to belong to the prehospital control group (the next consecutive patient&#xD;
      cared for in the same ambulance, immediately following the patient suspected to have a new&#xD;
      infection but not him/ herself considered suffering from an infection) will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. A Case Report Form (CRF, the same for both prehospital groups), including eight&#xD;
      short yes/no-questions representing keywords related to the patients´ medical history will be&#xD;
      used for all included patients. In addition, the CRF will prompt ambulance personnel to&#xD;
      document the six vital parameters (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, level of consciousness, temperature) in accordance to current guidelines.&#xD;
      Level of consciousness is described according to GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) or AVPU (Alert,&#xD;
      Voice responsive, Pain responsive or Unresponsive)-since both scales are currently used in&#xD;
      the ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will be taken in the ambulance (the same tests for both prehospital groups). A&#xD;
      total of maximum 24 mL venous blood will be drawn from each included patient. P-(plasma)&#xD;
      glucose (&lt;1 ml, will be analyzed in the ambulance) An additional 5 tubes of venous blood will&#xD;
      be taken: 1. P-lactate (Sodium fluoride tube, 4 ml), 2. P-SuPAR (EDTA; Ethylenediamine&#xD;
      tetraacetic acid tube, 4 ml), 3. P-HBP (EDTA tube, 4 ml), 4. EDTA tube 6 ml: whole blood for&#xD;
      cytokines (caspase-1 generated interleukins: IL-1β, IL-18, IL-37), glucose metabolites and&#xD;
      downstream regulators of immunometabolic processes (pyruvate, lactate, HIF; Hypoxia inducible&#xD;
      factor, mTOR; mammalian target of rapamycin etc) and 5. PAXgene blood RNA (ribonucleic acid)&#xD;
      tube 2,5 ml: whole blood for priming step of the inflammasome mRNA levels of pro-IL and NLRP3&#xD;
      (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3), etc. Inflammatory markers in tube 4&#xD;
      and 5 are included in a sub study performed in collaboration with Örebro University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube 1-5 (P-lactate, P-SuPAR, P-HBP and inflammatory markers) will, be centrifuged and frozen&#xD;
      at the receiving hospital (weekdays 15:00 pm-8:00 am and weekends) or the Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital study laboratory in Solna (weekdays daytime) depending on time of day and&#xD;
      day of the week. The tests will be stored at -70 °C at Karolinska University Hospital study&#xD;
      laboratory until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED nurse receiving the ambulance will be collect the blood tests taken in the ambulance.&#xD;
      CRFs and informed consent forms will be left in a, for the study specific purpose labeled&#xD;
      mailbox, and is present in the ED. Inclusion in the study and the drawing of blood tests will&#xD;
      be documented in the patient´s ambulance record. Except for P-Glucose, no laboratory results&#xD;
      will be registered in the patients´ medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive outcome (&quot;cases&quot;) are defined as presence of sepsis within 36 hours from ED arrival,&#xD;
      according to predefined criteria, based on an analysis of medical records from the receiving&#xD;
      hospital. The definition of sepsis is in accordance with Sepsis-3. This outcome measure will&#xD;
      be compared with that of the definition of severe sepsis according to the traditional&#xD;
      criteria, i.e. based on SIRS criteria and according to the investigators´ previously&#xD;
      developed severe sepsis criteria, adapted to emergency care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three possible categories; 1. Sepsis, 2. Infection but not sepsis, and 3. No&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary calculation of sample size and statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to sample size calculations; 210 patients with the outcome sepsis is sufficient for&#xD;
      analysis of the predictive value of 21 variables (eight keywords related to patients´ medical&#xD;
      history, six vital parameters, glucose, lactate, SuPAR and HBP in addition to 3 demographic&#xD;
      variables: age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score) in the final multivariate regression&#xD;
      model, as ten events are needed for each predictor variable in logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact size of the required study sample is not possible to determine before the pilot&#xD;
      study has been conducted, since the variation is not known. Models for multivariate&#xD;
      regression analysis are based on, and require, variation of the analyzed variable within the&#xD;
      population. If there is no such variation, only Fischer´s test can be performed. Again, this&#xD;
      will be determined after the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of 100 patients will be conducted to test the CRF, analyze the logistical&#xD;
      aspects of the study, estimate the required duration of the study period, and to estimate&#xD;
      variation of variables within the population. The pilot study is planned to be initiated in&#xD;
      April 2017, and to involve the northern ambulance stations of the ambulance entrepreneur&#xD;
      Samariten Ambulans AB in Stockholm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pilot:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the pilot, the study is planned to be performed county-wide, ie in Stockholm Count&#xD;
      Council, involving all three ambulance entrepreneurs (AISAB; Ambulansen i Storstockholm AB,&#xD;
      Falck ambulans AB, Samariten Ambulans AB) and all seven emergency hospitals (Södersjukhuset,&#xD;
      Karolinska Huddinge, Karolinska Solna, St Göran, Danderyd, Norrtälje, Södertälje) of&#xD;
      Stockholm.&#xD;
