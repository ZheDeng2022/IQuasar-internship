    <textblock>
      Health care providers (HCP) are increasingly using genomic sequencing (GS) to target&#xD;
      treatment for patients. However, GS may incidentally reveal inherited risks for thousands of&#xD;
      current and future diseases. Guidelines recommend HCP inform patients of incidental GS&#xD;
      results. No decision aid (DA) exists to guide patients' decisions about which incidental GS&#xD;
      results they wish to learn. This study will evaluate whether the DA followed by genetic&#xD;
      counselling (GC) reduces decisional conflict compared to GC alone in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) with 128 patients with a family history of cancer, who have had a negative&#xD;
      genetic test and may eligible for GS. A qualitative component with a subset of participants&#xD;
      (n=40) will explore patients' preferences for the types of incidental results they wish to&#xD;
      receive and their decision making process.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Health care providers are increasingly using GS to diagnose, prognose and treat&#xD;
      diseases. GS offers increased sensitivity over classic genetic tests, decreasing&#xD;
      time-consuming and costly diagnostic cascades. However, GS may also incidentally reveal&#xD;
      inherited risks for many other cancers and diseases. Guidelines recommend doctors inform&#xD;
      patients of their incidental GS results. Yet there are limited tools to communicate the scope&#xD;
      and implications of the thousands incidental results available to help guide patients'&#xD;
      decisions about which results they wish to learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaps: Decision aids (DAs) are best suited to meet this challenge, but no DA exists to guide&#xD;
      patients' decisions about incidental GS results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: It is not feasible to counsel patients on the thousands of incidental findings&#xD;
      available to make informed choices about which incidental results they wish to receive&#xD;
      because of the limited genomics expertise and capacity among oncologists, and the long wait&#xD;
      times for genetic counseling. Our DA fills this critical care and translational gap by&#xD;
      improving the quality of patients' decisions and saving oncologists time counseling patients&#xD;
      on incidental findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data: 1) DA development: We created an interactive online DA. It begins with a&#xD;
      professional whiteboard video (by Dr. Mike Evans) that conveys the key concepts, risks and&#xD;
      benefits of learning about incidental GS results to educate patients. It then prepares&#xD;
      patients for decision-making using a values clarification exercise (with feedback of their&#xD;
      preferences) and a knowledge questionnaire (with correct answers provided after). It ends by&#xD;
      asking participants to select result categories they want to learn using a menu tool. 2)&#xD;
      Usability testing: We also evaluated the DA's usability with 15 patients in 2 rounds.&#xD;
      Interviews demonstrated strong face validity and content comprehension. Most patients found&#xD;
      the amount of information 'just right' (11/15), clear (12/15) and balanced (14/15). All&#xD;
      patients felt that the information was sufficient to reach a decision, that the DA was easy&#xD;
      to use and would recommend it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of the DA compared to standard genetic counseling (GC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand the decision-making patients' use regarding GS and selecting incidental&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - RCT to evaluate the DA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will evaluate the efficacy of the DA in reducing decisional conflict compared to&#xD;
      standard genetic counseling (GC) using a superiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: We will recruit adult cancer patients who are eligible to have GS (i.e., tested&#xD;
      negative for the classic gene mutation associated with their cancer - e.g., BRCA1/2, MLH,&#xD;
      MSH, PMS, APC, MUTYH) from genetics clinics at Mount Sinai Hospital, Princess Margaret&#xD;
      Hospital and Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, ON Canada. We will include adults who speak and&#xD;
      read English and exclude patients with metastatic/recurrent disease as incidental results are&#xD;
      less consequential to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: TThe primary outcome is decisional conflict; the study requires 64 patients/arm&#xD;
      to detect the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.3 using the Decisional&#xD;
      Conflict Scale (DCS) (Appendix 3), assuming a standard deviation of 0.6, an alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      (two-sided) and power of 0.815,16. In the last 3 months, 244 patients with a family history&#xD;
      of breast and colon cancer tested negative for their associated classic mutations (BRCA1/2,&#xD;
      MLH, MSH, PMS, APC, MUTYH) most of who would be eligible for GS. Extrapolating this over the&#xD;
      next 9 months we estimate that there would be 732 eligible patients. It is highly feasible to&#xD;
      reach our target of 128 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consecutively randomized and allocated from an existing list of eligible&#xD;
      subjects using a computer-generated randomization in a 1:1 ratio with random permuted blocks&#xD;
      of varying sizes. Patients from each clinic will be randomized separately to ensure we have&#xD;
      an even distribution of this population in both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm: Participants will view the online DA and then complete the online&#xD;
      self-administered measures (below) in one sitting within 14 days of recruitment. Next, they&#xD;
      will speak with a GC over the telephone after the DA, using a standardized script. They will&#xD;
      then complete the same online measures again after speaking to the GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: The GC will conduct the GC session over the telephone within 14 days of&#xD;
      recruitment. A topics script will be used to standardize GC discussions covering standard&#xD;
      educational content to enable patients to select incidental GS results (participants will not&#xD;
      view the DA nor the video). Participants will complete the online self-administered measures&#xD;
      after speaking with the GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Consistent with the Ottawa Decisional Support Framework, our primary outcome is&#xD;
      decisional conflict. Secondary outcomes are: knowledge of GS, satisfaction with decision,&#xD;
      preparation for decision-making and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: We will use validated scales to assess decisional conflict, knowledge, anxiety,&#xD;
      satisfaction with the decision and preparation for decision-making. We will develop a&#xD;
      standardized topic script for the GC in each arm, as well as a questionnaire to collect&#xD;
      intervention fidelity (e.g., usage statistics, duration of counseling sessions), demographic&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics (e.g., cancer status and genetic testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Consistent with the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, our primary outcome is&#xD;
      decisional conflict, assessed via the validated Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). Knowledge is&#xD;
      the secondary outcome, will be measured by the Cliseq genomic sequencing questionnaire and a&#xD;
      set of internal developed knowledge questions. Satisfaction and anxiety with also be&#xD;
      assessed. Satisfaction will be measured using the Satisfaction with Decision scale (SWD) and&#xD;
      the Preparation for Decision Making scale (PrepDM). Anxiety will be measured using the state&#xD;
      subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We will also include a demographics and&#xD;
      cancer history questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of outcomes will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Mean DCS, SWD,&#xD;
      PrepDM and STAI scores will be compared using a t-test. Knowledge scores will be assessed by&#xD;
      summing the number of correct responses to the questions, and compared using t-tests. Linear&#xD;
      regression will be used in a secondary analysis to account for known predictors for&#xD;
      decisional outcomes such as education. Secondary analyses will compare the mean DCS,&#xD;
      knowledge, SWD, PrepDM and STAI scores before and after GC in the intervention arm to explore&#xD;
      the additional benefit of GC after the DA. Un/adjusted mean differences and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be reported. We will use descriptive statistics to report participants'&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - qualitative study of decision making for incidental results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of study participants will be asked to take part in a qualitative interview about&#xD;
      their decision-making regarding selecting incidental findings. These semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will take place over the phone with a total of 40 participants. For the&#xD;
      qualitative component a purposeful sample of study participants will be used. We will target&#xD;
      a mix of participants across ages, cancer type and stage, gender, and study group to assess&#xD;
      the varying approaches to decision-making. At total of 40 participants will take part in the&#xD;
      qualitative component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Qualitative data analysis will draw on grounded theory methodology. We will sort&#xD;
      the data by searching for themes/patterns and variations within and across interviews using&#xD;
      HypeRESEARCH. Coding, which is the first stage in the analysis process, will involve&#xD;
      'labeling' the data with descriptive codes. Two team members will independently code each&#xD;
      transcript. Consensus on coding will be reached through comparison and discussion among these&#xD;
      members. The second stage will involve constant comparison, where codes and their content&#xD;
      will be compared across interviews to discern common and divergent themes and issues across&#xD;
      them. The final stage is selective coding, which integrates all the codes under a central&#xD;
      phenomenon to build a theory. Validation methods include triangulation and member checking.&#xD;
