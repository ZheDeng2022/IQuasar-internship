  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine whether cannabidiol (CBD), a compound derived from the&#xD;
      cannabis plant, is effective in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) in individuals with&#xD;
      comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Investigators will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      oral cannabidiol (CBD) will reduce alcohol drinking in individuals with AUD comorbid with&#xD;
      PTSD. To test this hypothesis, 48 otherwise healthy adult participants with moderate or&#xD;
      severe AUD and PTSD will be randomized to treatment with either CBD (600 mg daily) or&#xD;
      placebo, for a period of 6 weeks, such that both participants and study staff are blind to&#xD;
      treatment condition. Participants (each treated for 6 weeks) will be continuously recruited&#xD;
      over a study period of 14 months until 48 have completed. Baseline and weekly data will be&#xD;
      collected on alcohol usage and PTSD symptoms, and investigators will assess whether CBD&#xD;
      treatment leads to a greater improvement in these measures relative to placebo, and whether&#xD;
      reduction in alcohol drinking is temporally linked to improvement in PTSD symptoms. Subjects&#xD;
      will also participate in a task designed to quantify the psychological and physiological&#xD;
      links between negative emotion produced by re-experiencing PTSD trauma, and alcohol craving.&#xD;
      The task will be administered following 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment-associated reduction&#xD;
      in alcohol craving elicited by trauma-associated negative emotion between CBD and placebo&#xD;
      groups will be compared. This study will be the first to test whether CBD is effective in&#xD;
      treating alcohol addiction and in treating PTSD in humans, and the first to examine the&#xD;
      interaction between these treatment effects. Results will serve as proof of concept and&#xD;
      provide guidance for a future larger clinical trial. Because CBD is a safe, readily available&#xD;
      drug, such a trial would have an immense potential to prevent death, medical illness, and&#xD;
      psychological suffering associated with AUD and PTSD. Further, because the brain circuits via&#xD;
      which CBD acts to produce hypothesized effects are relatively well-understood, results may&#xD;
      substantially advance understanding of the neurobiological basis of alcohol addiction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators aim to test the hypothesis that CBD will reduce alcohol&#xD;
      drinking in individuals with AUD comorbid with PTSD. CBD is currently a medical research&#xD;
      focus because it shows promise for treating anxiety and other brain disorders, but does not&#xD;
      produce a 'high' like other parts of cannabis, has not been shown to be addictive, and is&#xD;
      safe, with few or no side effects. AUD, which is one of the most common and most debilitating&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions, is often associated with other comorbid psychiatric disorders - in&#xD;
      particular, PTSD: depending on the population studied, 30-60% of individuals with AUD also&#xD;
      have PTSD, with high comorbidity rates in military veterans. Evidence from animal models and&#xD;
      clinical studies suggests that the negative emotion caused by PTSD symptoms intensifies&#xD;
      craving for alcohol during alcohol withdrawal, perpetuating the addictive cycle; further,&#xD;
      evidence shows that the brain circuits underlying negative emotion and addiction are linked&#xD;
      in a forebrain area called the extended amygdala, which provides a neuropharmacological&#xD;
      target to simultaneously treat both negative emotion and alcohol addiction in individuals&#xD;
      with AUD and PTSD. CBD is known to inhibit brain activity in the extended amygdala, leading&#xD;
      to reduced anxiety in both animal models and humans. CBD also reduces addictive alcohol&#xD;
      seeking in animal models.&#xD;
