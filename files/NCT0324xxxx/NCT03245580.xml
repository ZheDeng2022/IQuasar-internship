  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this prospective, randomized, multicenter study is to evaluate and&#xD;
      compare the amount and quality of tissue samples yielded in a liver biopsy comparing 2&#xD;
      different techniques of EUS guided CORE liver biopsy for benign disease. The two techniques:&#xD;
      &quot;modified Wet suction&quot; and &quot;Slow pull&quot; technique of collecting tissue from a liver biopsy via&#xD;
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will have a biopsy performed via one of 2 different techniques: &quot;modified wet&#xD;
      suction&quot;, or &quot;slow pull&quot; technique. A randomization process will determine which technique.&#xD;
      Each subject shall undergo 2 passes (2 cores of tissue will be obtained - ideally from the&#xD;
      right and left lobe of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of tissue obtained via the 2 different techniques will be evaluated by number of&#xD;
      fragments, length of specimens and number of tracts observed by the local pathologist and&#xD;
      compared between the tissues obtained from the two techniques. We will also note technical&#xD;
      success rate (ability to insert the needle twice into the liver for obtaining 2 specimens and&#xD;
      ability to pass into the right and left lobe of the liver).&#xD;
