    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, the addition of nivolumab&#xD;
      or the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab to typical chemotherapy has on the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced high-grade serous cancers of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      origin. The typical chemotherapy treatment is Carboplatin and Paclitaxel.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with nivolumab plus standard of care dose dense paclitaxel and carboplatin for three cycles, where each cycle is 3 weeks, followed by cytoreductive surgery then three more cycles of the same treatment regimen administered as adjuvant treatment. Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 will be administered over approximately 1 hour as an IV infusion on Days 1,8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Carboplatin AUC6 will be administered as approximately a 30 minute IV infusion, following paclitaxel administration on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Carboplatin dose calculation instructions can be found in Appendix 4. Nivolumab 360mg will be infused IV over approximately 30min on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6. During the maintenance phase, Nivolumab 480mg will be infused IV on day 1 of each 28 day cycle, for up to 12 months. During the maintenance period, each cycle is 4 weeks.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing. The effects of nivolumab on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must&#xD;

                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal.&#xD;
                  Menopause is defined clinically as 12 month amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the&#xD;
                  absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the&#xD;
                  age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;

             weeks or more after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of nivolumab administration. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive&#xD;
             doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In order for patients with known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to be&#xD;
             eligible, they must be on a stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
             regimen, have CD4 counts &gt; 350, with no detectable viral load on quantitative PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated hepatitis virus infections (Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C) are&#xD;
             eligible if they have been definitively treated for 6 months, have no detectable viral&#xD;
             load on quantitative PCR, and LFTs meet eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;

             patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome,&#xD;
             or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or&#xD;
             exacerbation of disease. Patient with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including&#xD;
             thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids&#xD;
             are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's&#xD;
             syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive&#xD;
             serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic&#xD;
             treatment but should otherwise be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement&#xD;
             (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis), psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating&#xD;
             event).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;

             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use&#xD;
             topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with&#xD;
             minimal systemic absorption). A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g.,&#xD;
             contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following within 2 months of registration: active peptic ulcer disease,&#xD;
             diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, malabsorption&#xD;

             abscess, gastrointestinal obstruction requiring parenteral hydration and/or nutrition,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal perforation. Note: complete resolution of an intra-abdominal abscess&#xD;
             must be confirmed prior to registration even if the abscess occurred more than 6&#xD;
             months prior to registration.&#xD;
