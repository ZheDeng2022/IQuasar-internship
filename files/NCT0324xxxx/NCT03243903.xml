    <textblock>
      In this study, QS-M needle-free injector and needle-insulin pen were used as a drug carrier&#xD;
      to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetic patients（T2DM）.The efficacy and safety of QS-M&#xD;
      needle-free injector and needle-insulin pen were evaluated and compared.This is a&#xD;
      needle-insulin pen as control group, using a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open,&#xD;
      parallel grouping study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QS-M needle-free injector as a&#xD;
      drug carrier in the control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by&#xD;
      non-inferiority study，using needle-insulin pen as the comparison. This is a prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, open and parallel grouping study. QS-M needle-free injector produced&#xD;
      by Beijing QS medical technology co., Ltd.is used as the insulin carrier in the experimental&#xD;
      group. While needle-insulin pen is used as the insulin carrier in the control group. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators investigated whether the changes of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)&#xD;
      at the 16th week in the experimental group respected to the baseline is non-inferiority&#xD;
      compared with that in control group. A total of 427 patients with T2DM were enrolled in a&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter,randomized, open-label study, and were randomly assigned 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive 16 weeks' treatment with basal insulin or premixed insulin administered either by a&#xD;
      needle-free insulin injector (NFII)or insulin treatment via a conventional insulin pen (CIP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups entered a 2-week screening period after providing their written&#xD;
      informed consent. A run-in period from week 1 to the end of week 4 was implemented to allow&#xD;
      treatment adjustment. Assessment visits occurred at screening (week -2), baseline, and week&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16.After the 4-week run-in phase, the patients entered a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment observation period. All patients were unable to change the type of insulin and the&#xD;
      number of injections during the study period. In this study, the treatment regimen was&#xD;
      adjusted according to the results of the determination of prescription blood glucose.&#xD;
      According to clinical experience, the adjustment of blood glucose fluctuations in the&#xD;
      possibility of a larger, so the study of the adjustment phase follow-up frequency is greater&#xD;
      than the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation of Visits and Timing of Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment was performed for all subjects during the screening period. On the first&#xD;
      day of treatment, the first week after treatment (± 2 days), the second week (± 2 days), the&#xD;
      4th week (± 5 days), the 6th week (± 5 days), the 8th week (± 5 days),the 12th week (± 5&#xD;
      days), the 16th week (± 5 days) for visit.The 3th week (± 2 days), the 5th week (± 5 days),&#xD;
      the 7th week (± 5 days), the 10th week (± 5 days), the 14th week (± 5 days), for telephone&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
