  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood stem cells can produce red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells of the&#xD;
      immune system (which fight infections) and platelets (which help the blood clot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sickle cell disease produce abnormal red blood cells. A blood stem cell&#xD;
      transplant from a donor is a treatment option for patients with severe sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      The donor can be healthy or have the sickle cell trait. The blood stem cell transplant will&#xD;
      be given to the patient as an intravenous infusion (IV). The donor blood stem cells will then&#xD;
      make normal red blood cells - as well as other types of blood cells - in the patient. When&#xD;
      blood cells from two people co-exist in the patient, this is called mixed chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most children are successfully treated with blood stem cells from a sibling (brother/sister)&#xD;
      who completely shares their tissue type (full-matched donor). However, transplant is not an&#xD;
      option for patients who (1) have serious medical problems, and/or (2) do not have a&#xD;
      full-matched donor. Most patients will have a relative who shares half of their tissue type&#xD;
      (e.g. parent, child, and brother/sister) and can be a donor (half-matched or haploidentical&#xD;
      donor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with severe sickle cell disease were successfully treated with a half-matched&#xD;
      transplant in a clinical study. Researchers would like to make half-matched transplant an&#xD;
      option for more patients by (1) improving transplant success and (2) reducing&#xD;
      transplanted-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research transplant is being tested in this Pilot study for the first time. It is&#xD;
      different from a standard transplant because:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Half-matched related donors will be used, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A new combination of drugs (chemotherapy) that does not completely wipe out the bone&#xD;
           marrow cells (non-myeloablative treatment) will be used to prepare the patient for&#xD;
           transplant, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Most of the donor CD4+ T cells (a type of immune cells) will be removed (depleted)&#xD;
           before giving the blood stem cell transplant to the patient to improve transplant&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the research transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will reverse sickle cell disease and improve patient quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will reduce side effects and help the patient recover faster from the transplant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Help the patient keep the transplant longer and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduce serious transplant-related complications.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of the COH-MC-17 regimen and&#xD;
      ability of the regimen to induce a mixed chimeric status in severe sickle cell disease&#xD;
      patients (hemoglobin SS or S-βº Thalassemia). The COH-MC-17 regimen consists of a&#xD;
      non-myeloablative regimen (cyclophosphamide, pentostatin and rabbit-anti-thymocyte globulin&#xD;
      (ATG)) followed by a CD4+ T-cell-depleted haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant&#xD;
      (HaploHCT).&#xD;

                  stroke is defined as a sudden neurologic change lasting more than 24 hours that&#xD;
                  is accompanied by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of ≥ 1 episodes of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in the 2-year period&#xD;
                  preceding enrollment despite the institution of supportive care measures (i.e.&#xD;

                  (i.e. a pain management plan and/or treatment with hydroxyurea). A severe VOC is&#xD;
                  defined as an episode of pain lasting more than 2 hours severe enough to require&#xD;
                  care at a medical facility. Note that priapism that lasts more than 2 hours and&#xD;
                  requires care at a medical facility is also considered a VOC.&#xD;

               4. Osteonecrosis of ≥ 2 joints despite the institution of supportive care measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Prior treatment with regular RBC transfusion therapy, defined as receiving ≥ 8&#xD;

             contraception prior to study entry and 6 months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior bone marrow transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent other investigational agents, chemotherapy, biological therapy or radiation&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Planned use of moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active infection&#xD;

          9. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to any in the pre- or post-transplant regimen.&#xD;
