      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy as a safe&#xD;
      means of down-staging Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) prior to surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial uses nivolumab and radiotherapy prior to definitive surgical resection of&#xD;
      tumors in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OHNSCC) with the primary&#xD;
      objective of determining the safety and feasibility of preoperative immunoradiotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition, tumor tissue, microbiome samples, and peripheral blood will be obtained for&#xD;
      exploratory immunologic end points including measurements of tumor infiltrating immune cell&#xD;
      populations based on flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as well as circulating&#xD;
      immunological parameters. This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiation + PD-1 blockade in patients with HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated duration of 20 weeks: neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy +/- surgery, followed by 6&#xD;
      doses of nivolumab 480mg IV q4wks +/- risk-adapted adjuvant therapy, per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I safety lead-in study (n = 6) evaluating the safety of neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy&#xD;
      in HNSCC, followed by phase II efficacy study (n = 28, total) to assess rate of down-staging&#xD;
      after neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy using Simon's two-stage design (futility assessment at n&#xD;
      = 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 portion of this study will require 6 patients and is therefore expected to&#xD;
      complete in 6 months. Although non-surgical patients are eligible to enroll, they will not be&#xD;
      counted toward accrual for either the primary safety endpoint, (as by definition, unplanned&#xD;
      delay of surgery cannot exist); nor the secondary efficacy endpoint, as potential for&#xD;
      surgical staging is absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So long as 2 or fewer surgical delays are observed (primary safety endpoint), the phase 2&#xD;
      portion of study will proceed (secondary efficacy endpoint). Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      disease free and overall survival at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients may be enrolled unless a rate of unplanned surgical delay attributed to&#xD;
      immunoradiotherapy is found to exceed 33% after enrollment of the first 6 patients. We&#xD;
      estimate 10 to 20 patients per year will be enrolled.&#xD;

                  have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative pregnancy test (bHCG urine or serum, women of childbearing potential&#xD;
                  only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             practices to avoid pregnancy for the duration of treatment with nivolumab plus 5&#xD;
             half-lives of nivolumab (75 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a&#xD;
             total of 105 days post-treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow adequate contraceptive&#xD;

             total of 165 days post-treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinical factors such as bleeding, active infection, or psychiatric factors that&#xD;
             in the judgment of the investigator would preclude safe participation and compliance&#xD;
             with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HNSCC for which radiation is not indicated during normal treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;

             inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis,&#xD;
             systemic sclerosis (scleroderma and variants), systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
             autoimmune vasculitis, autoimmune neuropathies (such as Guillain-Barre syndrome)],&#xD;
             which in the judgment of the investigator poses an active and significant morbidity&#xD;
             risk. Vitiligo and adequately controlled endocrine deficiencies such as hypothyroidism&#xD;
             are not exclusionary. Patient and investigator may opt to accept risk of autoimmune&#xD;
             disease flare, based on shared-decision making with consideration of risk/benefit.&#xD;
