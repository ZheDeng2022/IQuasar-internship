      Chiauranib, which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases&#xD;
      involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the&#xD;
      angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related&#xD;
      kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammation related kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with&#xD;
      the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high&#xD;
      selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor&#xD;
      kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms&#xD;
      of clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its broad preclinical anti-tumor efficacy and the potential to improve&#xD;
      conventional TKI kinase inhibitor therapy in various cancer indications, Chiauranib has now&#xD;
      entered phase Ib clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, in the meantime, exploring the latent&#xD;
      biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.&#xD;
