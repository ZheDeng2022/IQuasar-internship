  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a debilitating and costly condition and currently available treatment options have&#xD;
      risks and limitations that necessitate development of novel interventions. Collectively, the&#xD;
      functional brain imaging reports suggest that patients with PTSD, especially those with the&#xD;
      re-experiencing and hypervigilence phenotype, show ventromedial PFC hypoactivation and&#xD;
      amygdala hyperactivation in response to symptom provocation, and that treatment, when&#xD;
      successful is associated with reduced amygdala and increased ventromedial PFC activation.&#xD;
      This project is guided by a neurocircuit model of PTSD dysfunction in which abnormalities in&#xD;
      fronto-limbic imbalance, which diminishes capacity for fear extinction learning, and produces&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms of re-experiencing and hyperarousal. Thus, our studies aim to bridge the&#xD;
      translational gap between theoretical and neurobiological models of PTSD to implementation of&#xD;
      clinical practice. The Target Engagement and Dosing Phase of this project, which is a pilot&#xD;
      study, will demonstrate target engagement and its association with laboratory measures of&#xD;
      PTSD-relevant neural processes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed treatment is expected to reduce symptoms of PTSD particularly re-experiencing&#xD;
      and hyperarousal symptoms. These improvements in symptoms are expected to translate into&#xD;
      improved social and occupational function for subjects with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The investigators will test (1) the efficacy of neurofeedback in subjects&#xD;
      with PTSD attempting to upregulate ventral medial PFC and simultaneously downregulate&#xD;
      amygdala, and (2) determine the number of neurofeedback sessions (dose) needed for target&#xD;
      engagement and transfer. Prior to the neurofeedback training, participants' baseline ability&#xD;
      to regulate in the absence of neurofeedback from real-time fMRI will be ascertained. Then&#xD;
      during session, participants will receive veridical real-time feedback in the scanner&#xD;
      indicating the activation level of ventromedial PFC minus amygdala. Participants will attempt&#xD;
      to regulate to achieve a predetermined target level known to the participant. Neurofeedback&#xD;
      conditions will include (1) false feedback (sham) shows a thermometer that indicates false&#xD;
      feedback consisting of noise, (2) view condition shows a thermometer that indicates true&#xD;
      activation of ventromedial PFC minus amygdala but the participant is asked not to attempt&#xD;
      neuroregulation, (3) free regulate shows a thermometer that indicates true activation of&#xD;
      ventromedial PFC minus amygdala while the participant attempts neuroregulation. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 10 participants who will engage in a six weekly neurofeedback&#xD;
      sessions to assess target engagement and dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The ability for participants to regulate will be further challenged by&#xD;
      explicit exposure to trauma relevant stimuli that elicit increased amygdala activation in&#xD;
      patients with PTSD. The investigators will follow the same procedure as the previous aim&#xD;
      except that free regulate condition (condition #3) will be replaced with conditions (4)&#xD;
      trauma regulate shows a participant-specific trauma-relevant image and the thermometer that&#xD;
      indicates true activation of ventromedial PFC minus amygdala while the participant attempts&#xD;
      neuroregulation, and (5) neutral regulate shows a trauma-unrelated image and the thermometer&#xD;
      that indicates true activation of ventromedial PFC minus amygdala while the participant&#xD;
      attempts neuroregulation. The investigators will enroll 10 participants who will engage in a&#xD;
      six weekly neurofeedback sessions to assess target engagement and dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed for PTSD and related symptoms before and after to the 6-week&#xD;
      intervention using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (Appendix XVI) and Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Appendix IX). The investigators hypothesize enhanced&#xD;
      neuroregulation and transfer will be associated with a concomitant reduction in PTSD severity&#xD;
      and lower comorbid anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Participants will be assessed before and after the 6-week intervention with a&#xD;
      brief neurocognitive battery of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, and&#xD;
      sustained attention. The investigators hypothesize that successful neuroregulation and&#xD;
      transfer will be associated with concomitant cognitive performance improvements.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline scan (week 1), week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5 and week 6.</time_frame>
    <description>fMRI scans will use a 3T GE scanner at the Duke-UNC Brain Imaging and Analysis Center. Structural MRI data and functional MRI data that includes real-time feedback on the participants brain activity will be made available to the participant to facilitate self-regulation.&#xD;
Participants will begin and end each scanning session with a 6-minute resting-state scan. The purpose of the first resting-state run is collect pre-Training baseline resting-state activation and to acclimate the subject to the scanner environment prior to neuroregulatory training. The purpose of the second resting state run is examine changes in functional connectivity after compared to before real-time fMRI neurofeedback.&#xD;
To determine the effect of session on subject ability to increases ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation and decrease amygdala activation and establish a dose-response relationship for neuroregulation, we will measure changes in BOLD signal across scan sessions.</description>

    <description>Physiological measures of heart rate and respiration will be recorded during each scan, using an MR-safe commercial system (MP-150 BIOPAC systems, Goleta, CA) to permit removal of physiological noise from the fMRI signal. To evaluate potential scalable non-fMRI correlates, we will also acquire pupillometry using an MR-compatible camera (Arrington Research, Inc.) and galvanic skin conductance levels to identify fear or anxiety responses that impede self-activation.&#xD;

    <description>Recovery from PTSD symptoms has been modeled experimentally as fear extinction that depends on three interconnected brain regions that involve the amygdala where extinction memories are stored, the subcallosal/subgenual cortex within the medial PFC involved in consolidation of the extinction memory, and the hippocampus which mediates the context specificity of context specificity of extinction.&#xD;
The two MRI systems are used for human research by many faculty and research groups at Duke and UNC, Chapel Hill. The center has two research dedicated General Electric MR 750 scanners with a field strength of 3 Tesla. These systems use a combination of General Electric production pulse sequences and custom research pulse sequences that have been developed by Brain Imaging and Analysis Center faculty and other MR physicists. The scanners are used for imaging and spectroscopy.</description>
