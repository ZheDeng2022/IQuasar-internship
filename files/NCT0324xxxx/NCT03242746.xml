    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess how the proportion of the cervical volume/length removed during&#xD;
      treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) varies and whether this correlates to&#xD;
      the pregnancy duration at delivery&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high peak age of the Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)patients was from 25 to 35&#xD;
      years old, which is the best women of childbearing age, Standard treatment for CIN is called&#xD;
      Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP),but the inappropriate conization may damage&#xD;
      the cervical function leading to infertility, abortion, preterm delivery and dystocia.&#xD;
      Therefore, reasonable and standard conization is very important for treating and preventing&#xD;
      the complication. The International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy(IFCPC)&#xD;
      advocates the length of cervical conization should be decided by the type of cervical&#xD;
      transformation zone, however, the cervical lengths in female are different leading to the&#xD;
      same cervical conization lengths cause the diverse influences on the cervical&#xD;
      function.Therefore, individualized cervical conization therapies are very neededï¼ŒAt present,&#xD;
      there are still lack of objective data about cervical morphology of women at childbearing&#xD;
      age,besides the effects of cervical morphological changes caused by LEEP on pregnancy and&#xD;
      childbirth has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the proportion of the cervical tissue removed is likely to influence&#xD;
      both cervical healing and the cervical volume following surgery and as a result the risk of&#xD;
      prematurity in subsequent pregnancies. The present prospective study investigates the&#xD;
      variation in the proportion of the cervix removed during excisional treatment and provides&#xD;
      pilot data on pregnancy outcomes in a sample population for which the dimensions and&#xD;
      proportions of the cervical tissue excised are assessed at the time of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The dimensions of the cone are measured with a measuring tape and a ruler before formalin fixation. The measurements included the length/depth, and the anteroposterior,transverse, and lateral diameters. A fluid filled volumetric cylindrical vial (tube) are subsequently used to measure the cone volume with the fluid displacement technique</description>

    <description>Assessment of the cervical dimensions and the cervical volume is repeated 1,3,6,12 months post-treatment follow-up visit, using the same imaging technique as that used pretreatment</description>

    <description>In the event of a pregnancy, the prenatal management and outcomes are recorded. More specifically, it is recorded whether interventions such as cervical length ultrasound, cervical cerclage, or progesterone are used. The duration of pregnancy at delivery, the birth weight, and other obstetric outcomes and complications are recorded.</description>
