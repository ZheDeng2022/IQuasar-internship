      The purposes of this study are to: 1) assess the safety and tolerability and 2) establish a&#xD;
      preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a&#xD;
      maximum administered dose (MAD) of MK-2118 when administered via intratumoral (IT) injection&#xD;
      as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) intravenous (IV) infusion, or&#xD;
      via subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with pembrolizumab IV infusion in the&#xD;
      treatment of adult participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;

      Participants will receive either MK-2118 monotherapy or MK-2118 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles for Arms 1-3 or up to 36 cycles for Arm 4 (approximately 2&#xD;
      years).&#xD;
&#xD;
