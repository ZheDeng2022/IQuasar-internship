  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more than 100,000 Canadians and results in symptoms&#xD;
      affecting both motor and cognitive (thinking and memory) functions. Parkinson's disease with&#xD;
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) frequently results in development of dementia for which few&#xD;
      treatment options exist. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is used to alter activity in&#xD;
      the outer regions of the brain and has been shown in previous studies to increase cognitive&#xD;
      performance in patients with different disorders. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TMS as a clinical treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. 64 male and female participants between the ages of 50 and 90 will&#xD;
      attend eight study visits over a period of 63 to 66 days. This study is a double-blind&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial meaning the participant will be assigned by chance to either the&#xD;
      TMS-treatment group or the Sham-treatment group. Additionally, a combination of memory and&#xD;
      thinking tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to see if there are&#xD;
      structural and functional changes within the brain. Genotyping and blood analysis before and&#xD;
      after treatment for different biomarkers will also be performed and these data will be&#xD;
      compared to the TMS data. Initially, this research will increase knowledge about the effects&#xD;
      of TMS on various brain regions. Ultimately, we will be able to determine if TMS can be used&#xD;
      as a complementary therapy for PD to improve cognitive performance and to reduce progression&#xD;
      into dementia.&#xD;
