    <description>The treatment in this clinical study starts with fimasartan 30 mg; if blood pressure is not controlled (siSBP ≥ 140 mmHg or siDBP ≥ 90 mmHg), the dose is escalated once gradually, and then a diuretic combination is administered. The escalation of dose and administration of diuretic combination are decided after checking blood pressure 4 weeks after the administration of each investigational product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Voluntarily provided a written consent to participate in this clinical study after&#xD;

             on the selected arm is as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For treatment-naïve patients who have not taken drugs for hypertension within the&#xD;
                  last 3 months from the screening visit: Mean siSBP ≥ 140mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with essential hypertension who are taking drugs for hypertension:&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. At the baseline visit (Visit 2), Blood pressure: Patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
             essential hypertension whose mean siSBP measured 3 times on the selected arm is ≥140&#xD;

             pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, etc.)&#xD;
