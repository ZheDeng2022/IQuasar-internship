  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a devastating condition, affecting 1.6-5/100,000&#xD;
      children/year. Although their outcome is different, children with stroke do not recover&#xD;
      better than adults, with at least 2/3 suffering long term sequels such as developmental&#xD;
      (motor, global intellectual, language...) and behavioral disabilities, epilepsy, and low&#xD;
      adaptative and academic skills...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stenotic cerebral arteriopathy is identified as AIS etiology in 60-80% of previously healthy&#xD;
      children and the course of this arteriopathy is the strongest predictor of recurrent events.&#xD;
      30-40% of these children have a focal unilateral cerebral arteriopathy (FCA). Childhood FCA&#xD;
      is suspected to be an inflammatory vessel wall pathology triggered by varicella and other&#xD;
      (viral) infections. As recurrences occur for the great majority in the first 6 months after&#xD;
      the index event, aspirin 5 mg/kg/day is recommended for at least 18 months to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is a rational for using immunomodulatory drugs at the acute stage of FCA,&#xD;
      immunotherapies are currently used by neuropaediatricians in AIS, mainly as steroids for&#xD;
      children with stenosing arteriopathies. However, due to weak evidences, the literature cannot&#xD;
      either encourage or discourage this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term course of children with FCA is only approach to date by retrospective studies&#xD;
      and controversies about outcome remain (for example, the recurrence risk on antithrombotic&#xD;
      treatment varies notably from quasi zero to 25%). And finally, it is shown in childhood&#xD;
      stroke, as well as in the global field of longstanding impairment, that parental and medical&#xD;
      points of view do not match consistently. Longitudinal studies are needed to deserve this&#xD;
      familial approach.&#xD;
