  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussion is widely recognized as a major public health concern in the United States and&#xD;
      worldwide. Although many concussions resolve completely and spontaneously, almost 1 in 4&#xD;
      patients will go on to experience post-concussion syndrome (PCS). In the United States, PCS&#xD;
      diagnoses have increased 100% from 2010-2015. Concurrently, recent advances in EEG evoked&#xD;
      response potential analysis have led to a novel technique for assessing brain network&#xD;
      activation (BNA) patterns. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of BNA in&#xD;
      individuals who are diagnosed with PCS or have the risk of experiencing PCS due to a recent&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, occurs commonly in sport. The Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that as many as 3.8 million sport-related&#xD;
      concussions occur annually in the United States. Although many concussions resolve completely&#xD;
      and spontaneously, almost 1 in 4 patients will go on to experience post-concussion syndrome&#xD;
      (PCS). In the United States, PCS diagnoses have increased 100% from 2010-2015. Concurrently,&#xD;
      recent advances in EEG evoked response potential analysis have led to a novel technique for&#xD;
      assessing brain network activation (BNA) patterns. The purpose of this study is to explore&#xD;
      the use of BNA in individuals who are diagnosed with PCS or have the risk of experiencing PCS&#xD;
      due to a recent injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ElMindA, the sponsor of this study, has developed a novel method to automatically reveal&#xD;
      functional networks of brain activity based on analysis of EEG Event Related Potential (ERP)&#xD;
      data. This technological platform is capable of providing new metrics of brain function which&#xD;
      can assist in patient evaluation and management. The analysis is done in two separate&#xD;
      processes which are entirely separate and are performed independently of one another. First&#xD;
      EEG data are recorded and analyzed from a group, or several groups, of subjects to establish&#xD;
      a set of group patterns which characterized the brain network activity of the group. Second,&#xD;
      EEG data from a single subject are processed to enable subject evaluation, as compared to the&#xD;
      established group patterns. This individual analysis is the basis of the BNA scores computed&#xD;
      for an individual subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Exploratory (e.g. Hypothesis-generating) study designed to collect data that will aid in&#xD;
      future understanding of the relationship between Post Concussion Syndrome and&#xD;
      Electrophysiology. The results are primarily intended for scientific inquiry and development&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploring the relationship between the characteristics of early/acute stage Mild&#xD;
           Traumatic Brain Injury and the subsequent development of PCS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting electrophysiological and clinical data that will serve as the basis for&#xD;
           athlete brain health case studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Study staff will contact subjects tested in the past with BNA and were diagnosed with&#xD;
      Post-Concussion Syndrome at their medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Eligible subjects treated at the study medical facility for acute concussion or Post&#xD;
      Concussion Syndrome will be approached by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested volunteers will complete a brief initial in person or phone consultation with a&#xD;
      member of the study team and those who meet eligibility criteria and wish to participate will&#xD;
      be invited for a study visit in the testing facility. During this visit, a member of the&#xD;
      study team will describe the study in greater detail, verify subject eligibility, obtain&#xD;
      informed written consent/assent for study participation, and record relevant demographic,&#xD;
      medical history information, concussion history and clinical assessment questioners as&#xD;
      provided by the subject or as available from subject's medical records. The subject will then&#xD;
      have the EEG electrode cap placed on their head and will undergo the BNA test after a brief&#xD;
      training and instructional session.&#xD;
