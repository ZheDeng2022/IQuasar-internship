  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a commonly pigmention characterized by melanotic patches on the face. literature&#xD;
      searched revealed that periodontitis and vitamin D deficiency have occurred along with&#xD;
      anemia. Actinic associated factors may be indirectly related to vitamin D, melasma&#xD;
      contributes to sun exposed area of face.To correlate melasma with clinical evidence of&#xD;
      periodontitis and vitamin D serum analysis along side hb %. Patients with facial melasma&#xD;
      between 30-70yrs of either gender formed Group A (95). Anaemia and periodontitis were&#xD;
      Clinically checked. Additionally serum analysis of vitamin D and hb percentage were analysed.&#xD;
      Similar procedure was carried out on controls which had Group B (95) patients with no melasma&#xD;
      on face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study revealed significant correlation between melasma and periodontitis with vitamin D&#xD;
      abnormalities (p value&lt;.05), where as insignificant correlation between melasma and Hb%. The&#xD;
      correlation between melasma, vitamin d changes and periodontitis may prompt the clinician to&#xD;
      check for any such changes in any patient. Melasma in patients with periodontitis and serum&#xD;
      vitamin D changes might be a considered as a syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melasma, is a relatively common chronic pigmentation of the face, although it may be&#xD;
      localized also on the neck and forearms. It is also called as chloasma or mask of pregnancy.&#xD;
      It has higher prevalence in women and occurs less commonly in men. It most commonly affects&#xD;
      the sun-exposed areas of skin of face. Three patterns of presentation have been reported:&#xD;
      Centro-facial, malar and mandibular forms. The interplay of various risk factors are known to&#xD;
      contribute in the pathogenesis of melasma such as genetic predisposition, ultraviolet&#xD;
      radiation, hormonal factors, oral contraceptives and drugs like phenytoin. Thyroid&#xD;
      abnormalities were reported to occur with melasma. Skin pigmentation is a common&#xD;
      manifestation in nutritional deficiencies and frequently associated with deficiency of&#xD;
      vitamin B12 . Increased iron may affect the pattern and course of pigmentation, however it is&#xD;
      unclear how they coexist. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized from&#xD;
      7-dehydrocholesterol by photochemical process in the skin and through successive&#xD;
      hydroxylation to its active metabolite. 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1, 25(OH)2D3; calcitriol]&#xD;
      is formed in liver and kidney. Intracellular receptor (VDR) helps in binding of vitamin D&#xD;
      which helps the epithelial cells and melanocytes a target for vitamin D. Although vitamin D&#xD;
      is used in the treatment of melanoma and psoriasis and active role of 1, 25(OH)2D3 in skin no&#xD;
      reports of melasma associated with vitamin D reported. The dysfunction of 1,25(OH)2D3 - VDR&#xD;
      system may lead to periodontal disease . Mineral bone density could be directly related to&#xD;
      deficiency of vitamin D which also progress to osteoporosis. Studies have reported that&#xD;
      anemia may predispose to periodontitis but the correlation was not determined. Until date, no&#xD;
      studies reported any correlation or mere association between melasma, periodontitis and serum&#xD;
      vitamin D abnormalities as well as decreased Hb levels. The present study was intended to&#xD;
      assess the presence of periodontitis and vitamin D deficiency in melasma patients and&#xD;
      evaluate clinical presence of periodontitis, which may occur in conjunction with melasma and&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency. The mere presence of melasma may help to investigate for further oral&#xD;
      issues such as periodontitis and anemia which may or may not be associated with vitamin D&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients visiting the Dept. of Oral medicine, with melasma on face within the age group of&#xD;
      30-70yrs in either gender were included in the study, matched with similar control group&#xD;
      without melasma after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A, had Patients with melasma in whom 2 ml of&#xD;
      blood was collected for estimation of serum-vitamin D levels, and complete blood picture was&#xD;
      estimated for Haemoglobin percentage and clinical oral examination was evaluated for&#xD;
      periodontitis. Group B served as control arm, where same procedure of blood parameter&#xD;
      estimation and clinical examination protocol was followed as in group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of 100 patients participated in the study, 50 in each group. The samples that&#xD;
      resulted out of recruitment were tabulated and appropriate statistical analysis was done&#xD;
      comparing the both groups with the presence or absence of periodontitis and serum vitamin D&#xD;
      abnormalities and serum Hb% levels.&#xD;
