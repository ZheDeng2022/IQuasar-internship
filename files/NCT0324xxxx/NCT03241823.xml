    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a major global health challenge; it is estimated that&#xD;
      more than 80 million people are chronically infected worldwide, with 3-4 million new&#xD;
      infections and 350,000 deaths occurring each year because of HCV-related complications .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, a national Egyptian health issue survey was conducted to describe the prevalence of&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibody was found to be&#xD;
      10.0% and that of Hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA ) to be 7.0% in the age group&#xD;
      between 15-59 years. While In children, 1-14 years old, the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) antibody and Hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) were 0.4% and 0.2%&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of HCV therapy is to cure the infection, i.e. to achieve a sustained&#xD;
      virological response (SVR) defined as undetectable Hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid (HCV&#xD;
      RNA )12 weeks or 24 weeks after treatment completion. The infection is cured in more than 99%&#xD;
      of patients who achieve asustained virological response (SVR). Asustained virological&#xD;
      response (SVR) is generally associated with normalization of liver enzymes and improvement or&#xD;
      disappearance of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis in patients without cirrhosis. Patients&#xD;
      with severe liver disease remain at risk of life-threatening complications; however hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis may regress and the risk of complications such as hepatic failure and portal&#xD;
      hypertension is reduced .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous data suggest that the risk of Hepatocellular carcinoma and all-cause mortality is&#xD;
      significantly reduced, but not eliminated, in cirrhotic patients who clear Hepatitis C Virus&#xD;
      compared to untreated patients and non-sustained virological responders . Hepatitis C Virus&#xD;
      is also associated with a number of extrahepatic manifestations and effective viral&#xD;
      suppression induces reversal of most of them .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in those with hepatitis C-related decompensated cirrhosis have demonstrated that&#xD;
      sustained virological response can indeed be achieved in the majority of these individuals,&#xD;
      and short-term follow-up from these studies has shown that Sustained virological response is&#xD;
      often accompanied by improvement in measures of decompensation including Model for End-Stage&#xD;
      Liver Disease (MELD) score and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CPT) score. Moreover, because hepatitis C&#xD;
      recurrence after Orthotopic liver transplantation is associated with worse outcomes,&#xD;
      achieving Sustained virological response before transplant in a decompensated population with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C will likely allow these patients to achieve long-term outcomes not&#xD;
      different from non-Hepatitis C virus-infected populations .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SOLAR-1 and SOLAR-2 studies, those with decompensated cirrhosis with genotypes 1 and 4&#xD;
      were randomized to receive sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with low-dose ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks .&#xD;
      No difference was seen in Sustained virological response in the 12- or 24-week arms, and the&#xD;
      therapy was well tolerated. Moreover, these studies both reported improvement in Model for&#xD;
      End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CPT) scores 4 weeks after&#xD;
      therapy had been stopped with longer-term follow-up results expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography is a noninvasive, painless, rapid, and&#xD;
      objective method for the evaluation of fibrosis or cirrhosis . Systemic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of Liver stiffness&#xD;
      measurement in the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review conducted at 2007, repoted that at a threshold of approximately 0.60,&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of the FibroTest were 47% (35-59%) and 90% (87-92%). For&#xD;
      FibroScan (threshold approximately 8 kPa), corresponding values were 64% (50-76%) and 87%&#xD;
      (80-91%), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another systematic review conducted at 2010, reported that the pooled estimates for&#xD;
      sensitivity of fibroscan were 87% (84%-90%), specificity 91% (89%-92%) in stage IV fibrosis&#xD;
      (cirrhosis). While in patients with stages II-IV fibrosis, they reported that the pooled&#xD;
      estimates for sensitivity were 70% (67%-73%), specificity 84% (80%-88%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter observational, cohort, prospective study included 90 patients with hepatitis C&#xD;
      genotype 1 treated with telaprevir or boceprevir who had advanced fibrosis evidenced by liver&#xD;
      stiffness and achieved Sustained virological response reported that liver stiffness was&#xD;
      significantly reduced 2 weeks after treatment. This suggested the possibility of liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis regression evidenced by liver stiffness after sustained virological response in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study included 182 Egyptian patients with HCV infection to validate and compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of Fibroscan , APRI Score , FIB4 for the prediction of hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis and treatment outcome in HCV infected patients receiving pegylated interferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin, the authors reported that Fibroscan and noninvasive scores as APRI , FIB4 can be&#xD;
      used as good predictors of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. However, they are not good&#xD;
      predictors of response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study 2010, they concluded that liver stiffness measurement can be useful for monitoring&#xD;
      regression of liver fibrosis during entecavir treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies showed a consistent relationship between Doppler Ultrasonography findings and&#xD;
      liver histology. showed that Doppler Ultrasound findings are sensitive to haemo dynamic&#xD;
      changes in liver fibrosis. Doppler Ultrasonography scoring was significantly related to liver&#xD;
      fibrosis staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Doppler Ultrasound signs for portal hypertension are: (1) reduced portal vein blood flow&#xD;
      velocity (time-averaged mean vel. &lt; 14-16 cm/s2), with sensitivity and specificity between&#xD;
      80-88% and 80-96%, respectively; (2) portal vein congestion index &gt; 0.08. This parameter,&#xD;
      however, is not used routinely, probably due to its being difficult to measure and its lower&#xD;
      reproducibility; and (3) measurements of the hepatic arterial Resistive Index are less&#xD;
      useful. In the course of Liver cirrhosis, the appearance of clinically significant portal&#xD;
      hypertension worsens prognosis and Doppler ultrasound is very useful in evaluating portal&#xD;
      hypertension. . astudy showed a significant reverse correlation between the velocities of the&#xD;
      main portal vein and fibrous staging of the liver.&#xD;
