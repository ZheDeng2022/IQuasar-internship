      Study Conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for enrollment will be entered into the study. Patients will&#xD;
      receive ivosidenib 500 mg by mouth once daily on 28-day cycles until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, physician or subject decision to discontinue, the subject proceeds to&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the subject dies, or until the study closes. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve complete remission, undergo stem cell transplant, and then relapse can come back onto&#xD;
      the study after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Enrollment into the study will close&#xD;
      should ivosidenib be granted marketing authorization. If the study terminates for other&#xD;
      reasons, access to drug will be assessed based on the rationale for termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have baseline assessments performed to confirm eligibility. Thereafter,&#xD;
      treatment and assessments will be per routine standard of care at the investigational site&#xD;
      and documentation will be maintained at the study site in the patient chart. Should study&#xD;
      drug be discontinued, it is recommended that the patient return at least 28 days after&#xD;
      receiving the last dose of study drug for a safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments should be performed at intervals per institutional standard of care for&#xD;
      patients taking ivosidenib. These assessments should include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
      pregnancy tests, ECG, clinical lab assessments, vital signs and physical exam findings, and&#xD;
      assessment of adverse events of special interest (AESIs)/serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
      Toxicity severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Be able to understand and willing to sign an informed assent/consent. A legally&#xD;
             authorized representative may consent on behalf of a patient who is otherwise unable&#xD;

             creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior surgery,&#xD;

         10. Female patients with reproductive potential must agree to undergo medically supervised&#xD;
             pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug. The first pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             performed at screening (within 7 days prior to first study drug administration); the&#xD;
             second will be performed on the day of the first study drug administration and must be&#xD;
             confirmed negative prior to dosing. Patients with reproductive potential are defined&#xD;
             as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             or tubal occlusion or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not&#xD;
             menstruated at all) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any&#xD;
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). Females of reproductive potential, as&#xD;
             well as fertile men and their partners who are female of reproductive potential, must&#xD;
             agree to use two effective forms of contraception (including at least one barrier&#xD;
             form) from the time of giving informed assent/consent, during the study, and for 90&#xD;
             days (both females and males) following the last dose of AG-120. Effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception are defined as hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches,&#xD;
             intrauterine devices, intrauterine hormone-releasing systems, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, condoms with spermicide, or male partner sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             anticancer therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have previously received prior treatment with a mutant-specific IDH1 inhibitor and&#xD;
             progressed on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have undergone HSCT within 60 days of the first dose of ivosidenib, or patients on&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening, or with clinically&#xD;
             significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (The use of a stable dose of oral&#xD;
             steroids post HSCT and/or topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted with&#xD;
             Medical Monitor approval.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;14 days prior to their&#xD;
             first day of study drug administration. (Hydroxyurea is allowed prior to enrollment&#xD;
             and after the start of ivosidenib for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in&#xD;
             patients with leukocytosis [white blood cell {WBC}] counts &gt;30,000/μL.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have received an investigational agent &lt;14 days prior to their first day of study drug&#xD;
             administration. In addition, the first dose of ivosidenib should not occur before a&#xD;
             period ≥5 half-lives of the investigational agent has elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are taking known strong CYP3A4 inducers or sensitive CYP3A4 substrate medications with&#xD;
             a narrow therapeutic window, unless they can be transferred to other medications&#xD;
             within ≥ 5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless the medications can be properly&#xD;
             monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Are taking P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter-sensitive substrate medications with a&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic window, unless they can be transferred to other medications within&#xD;
             ≥5 half-lives prior to dosing or unless medications can be properly monitored during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have an active severe infection that requires anti-infective therapy or with an&#xD;
             unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during Screening visits or on their first day of study drug&#xD;
             administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, patients with tumor fever may&#xD;
             be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have known hypersensitivity to any of the components of ivosidenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have had New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure (Appendix&#xD;
             14.2), myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and/or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have a heart-rate corrected QT interval using Fridericia's method (QTcF) ≥ 470 msec or&#xD;
             any other factor that increases the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events&#xD;
             (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome).&#xD;
             Patients with prolonged QTcF interval in the setting of bundle branch block may&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have active hepatitis B or C. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             infection are allowed provided their disease is under control on anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy and that precautions are taken to modify their HAART regimen to minimize&#xD;
             ivosidenib drug interactions. Such subjects should be monitored for a change in dosage&#xD;
             requirements for the concomitant HAART drug when co-administering ivosidenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have any other medical or psychological condition, deemed by the Investigator to be&#xD;
             likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed assent/consent,&#xD;
             cooperate, or participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have immediately life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as&#xD;
             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated&#xD;
             intravascular coagulation.&#xD;
