    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test LabPatch-alcohol, a wearable, non-invasive biosensor Band-Aid&#xD;
      like patch that is designed to detect real-time changes in interstitial alcohol&#xD;
      concentrations in human subjects. The changes in interstitial alcohol concentrations will be&#xD;
      compared to blood alcohol concentrations to determine the patch's validity against the gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nanotechnology has the potential to become a powerful tool in addiction medicine. The&#xD;
      potential utility for passive, non-invasive wearable alcohol monitors is great and could play&#xD;
      a major role in public safety as well as in both research, clinical, and treatment settings.&#xD;
      Clinitech, LLC has developed LabPatch, an electronic bandage that continuously and&#xD;
      imperceptibly samples interstitial fluid from the skin surface and measures relevant&#xD;
      biomarkers in the fluid. The patch uses novel nanowire technology to sample the interstitial&#xD;
      fluid from just underneath the skin and then uses an electrochemical reaction to measure&#xD;
      either glucose or alcohol concentration. The participants' interstitial alcohol concentration&#xD;
      (IAC) will be measured via LabPatch-alcohol at the same time points as blood samples so that&#xD;
      a direct comparison can be made. Thus, the LabPatch-alcohol will be tested as the&#xD;
      participant's BAC rises and falls through the legally intoxicated concentration (0.08%), and&#xD;
      the goal is to match measures obtained via the prototype LabPatch-alcohol with whole blood&#xD;
      alcohol concentrations. The LabPatch operational circuit lies on the underside of the&#xD;
      bandage. The circuit surface is placed in contact with the skin by the application of the&#xD;
      elastic adhesive bandage with a contact tension that provides modest pressure, as in the case&#xD;
      of a conventional wound bandage. The temperature of the skin is measured electrically and the&#xD;
      consistency of temperature is used to verify good contact and to monitor continued contact.&#xD;
      The entire process takes 3-5 seconds to collect the sample, a pause for 1 sec and then 3&#xD;
      additional seconds to conduct the analysis.&#xD;
