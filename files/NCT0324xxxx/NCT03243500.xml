  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several local anesthetic techniques available for cataract surgery and the choice&#xD;
      depends on patient, surgical and operator factors. The eyes of patients with axial myopia&#xD;
      (the eye globe is abnormally elongated) have thin wall (sclera), limited space for needle&#xD;
      insertion for local anesthetic injection between the globe and the orbit and out-pouching of&#xD;
      the back of the eye (staphyloma). These factors increased the risk of perforation following&#xD;
      conventional needle techniques of eye block The current study technique is per-caruncular&#xD;
      injection (the needle insertion site is between the nasal side of the globe and bony orbit)&#xD;
      which may provide a safer alternative to the conventional needle techniques for myopic&#xD;
      patients. The space of injection is devoid of blood vessels moreover, myopic staphylomata are&#xD;
      infrequently located on the nasal side of the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local injection of muscle relaxant added to local anesthetic solution may provide earlier&#xD;
      onset of eye muscle paralysis thus earlier onset of favorable surgical condition than local&#xD;
      anesthetic solution alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will demonstrate the effect of adding low dose atracurium (a muscle&#xD;
      relaxant) to local anesthetic mixture in providing early onset of eye muscle paralysis and&#xD;
      favorable surgical condition in per-caruncular technique of eye block in high myopes&#xD;
      undergoing cataract surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, it is hypothesized that adding low dose atracurium to lidocaine,&#xD;
      bupivacaine and hyaluronidase mixture would provide an early onset of akinesia and favorable&#xD;
      surgical condition in per-caruncular peribulbar anesthesia for high myopes undergoing&#xD;
      phacoemulsification Initially, informed consents from the eligible patients will be obtained.&#xD;
      Preoperatively, the axial length of the enrolled patients will be measured by ultrasound&#xD;
      biometry and the presence of staphyloma was identified by B-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preparation room, the intravenous (IV) cannula will be placed. Anxious patients will&#xD;
      be given midazolam intravenously (titrated to response according to patient's age and&#xD;
      associated medical condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, standard monitoring of pulse oximetry, electrocardiography (ECG) and&#xD;
      noninvasive arterial blood pressure will be commenced. The O2 will be administered at 2&#xD;
      ml/minutes by the nasal O2 cannula. Drugs and equipment for resuscitation will be checked&#xD;
      before initiation of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetic eye drops (benoxinate 0.4%) will be instilled in the eye to be operated upon&#xD;
      three times separated by one minute interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will lie in a supine position and will be asked to look directly ahead focusing&#xD;
      on a fixed point on the ceiling, so that the eyes are in the neutral position. A&#xD;
      per-caruncular will be given using a 25 Gauge (G), 25 mm needle. The needle insertion point&#xD;
      will be just medial to the caruncle with the needle passing directly perpendicular to the&#xD;
      face and parallel to the medial orbital wall to 15-20 mm depth. , After negative aspiration&#xD;
      the already chosen local anesthetic mixture will be injected slowly. During injection, the&#xD;
      globe will be palpated with one finger and tension in the lids will be tested frequently, if&#xD;
      the lids become tense or if the tension is felt to rise in the globe, the injection will be&#xD;
      stopped. After injection, external compression with Honan balloon inflated to 20-30 mm Hg&#xD;
      will be applied for 10 minutes and will be removed every 2 minutes to test akinesia and&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA physical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axial length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure, heart rate (baseline, 5 minutes after local anesthetic injection, 5&#xD;
           minutes after the beginning of the operation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) (baseline and 5 minutes after local anesthetic&#xD;
           injection) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The beginning of motor blockade (ocular movement score [OMS]≤6) and onset time of globe&#xD;
           akinesia (OMS≤2)will be recorded. Moreover, the OMS will be assessed at the end of the&#xD;
           surgery and then every 30 minutes post-operative till regaining full ocular movement to&#xD;
           determine the duration akinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time to eyelid movement score of ≤1 will be recorded. If, after 10 minutes the block&#xD;
           is inadequate a 3-4 ml supplementation of lidocaine 2% by the same technique will be&#xD;
           given. If the block is still inadequate, it will be considered a failure and excluded&#xD;
           from the study. When the block is considered a failure the patient will receive either&#xD;
           supplemental inferotemporal injection (if ultrasound excluded presence of posterior&#xD;
           staphyloma), topical anesthesia, intravascular fentanyl 50 mcg or general anesthesia&#xD;
           according to the patient condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adequate analgesia (loss of sensation to touch by a small cotton wool) and akinesia&#xD;
      (OMS≤2), the surgeon was allowed to start the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for supplementation and total volume of local anesthetic mixture will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to adequate surgical anesthesia will be noted defined as the presence of corneal&#xD;
           anesthesia together with ocular movement score ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain will be assessed by direct questioning using a 3 point scoring system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (No pain = 0, discomfort = 1, pain = 2) throughout the operation. If the patient score is 1&#xD;
      or more, reassurance and or 50 mcg fentanyl IV will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of complication (Retrobulbar hemorrhage, Globe penetration, Optic nerve&#xD;
           damage, Local anesthetic toxicity, Muscle palsies, Chemosis, or side effect of the&#xD;
           muscle relaxant e.g. local hyperemia) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeon satisfaction will be assessed at the end of surgical procedure by using a&#xD;
           three-point scale: 0 = not satisfied, 1 =moderately satisfied, 2 = satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collector (also the administrator of the block) will record the data in a&#xD;
      pre-printed data sheet with abbreviations and each variable is explained. Also in the data&#xD;
      sheet, principle investigator number and e-mail for communication will be present. The&#xD;
      collected data will be then revised and registered to an electronic form for later&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on a two-sided alpha of 0.05, 95% power, and a clinically relevant&#xD;
      difference in time of onset of akinesia at least 3 minutes, a minimum of 74 patients will be&#xD;
      required for the conduct of the study (MedCalc®version12.7.1.0- 64-bit). Eight patients will&#xD;
      be added to compensate for dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      82 patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups: Statistical analysis Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using S-Plus Statistical Software (SPSS) for Windows (version&#xD;
      20.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois). All variables will be tested for normality using&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; if the test is significant, non-normality will be accepted.&#xD;
      Otherwise double-checking using graphs, skewness and kurtosis will be required to confirm&#xD;
      normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation when normality of&#xD;
      distribution assumptions are satisfied. If not, it will be presented as median and range.&#xD;
      categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be compared using two-tailed unpaired student t- test, and qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      compared using Fisher's exact test. P value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;

    <description>This will be achieve by assessing ocular movement score (OMS) every 2 minutes by asking the patient to move his/her eye in four directions; up, down, medially and laterally and the movement in each direction is given a score from 0 to 2 as follows: movement more than 2 mm will be given a score of 2, 1-2 mm movement will be given a score of 1 and no movement will be given a score of 0. A total Score of 2 or less will be considered adequate akinesia for surgery.&#xD;
Also, eyelid movement score will be assessed by asking the patient to open his/her eye widely followed by squeezing them maximally. A full movement will be given a score of 2, the flickering will be given a score of 1 and no movement will be given a score of 0.</description>
