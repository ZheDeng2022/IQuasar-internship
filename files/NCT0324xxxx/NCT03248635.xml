      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics does research into the causes of cancer and&#xD;
      ways to prevent it. It uses data from questionnaires. Sometimes, pre-testing a questionnaire&#xD;
      with a group of volunteers can help researchers find errors in it and learn ways to improve&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a questionnaire for problems that might cause response errors and to develop ideas&#xD;
      for improving it. To test how long it takes people to complete it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 35-75. Volunteers both with and without a history of tobacco use and with or&#xD;
      without a family history of cancer are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told what background data to bring to the 1 study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interviewer will give the participants the questionnaire. It will be done with pen and&#xD;
      paper. It will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be multiple-choice and open-ended questions. They will be about lifestyle,&#xD;
      medical, and environmental factors. Some of the questions will be about possibly illegal or&#xD;
      highly sensitive behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will note any questions that they find hard to answer for any reason. They will&#xD;
      be asked to answer the best they can, but they can skip any question that they prefer not to&#xD;
      answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal data of participants will be deleted when the study is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviewer will observe participants while they do the questionnaire. He or she will&#xD;
      look for things like long pauses and confusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will discuss the exam with the interviewer after they finish. This will take&#xD;
      about 1 hour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is to conduct&#xD;
      broadbased, high quality, high impact research to uncover the causes of cancer and the means&#xD;
      of its prevention. To this end, DCEG relies on epidemiologic data captured on self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires. The purpose of this pre-test study is to pilot a questionnaire to: (1) detect&#xD;
      problems that might contribute to response errors; (2) develop ideas for improving the&#xD;
      questionnaire in order to minimize such errors; and (3) assess the length of time to complete&#xD;
      the questionnaire. If there are specific sections of the questionnaire that are skipped by&#xD;
      all 30 initial participants, then six (6) additional, separate individuals may be invited to&#xD;
      pre-test the questionnaire for sections that were missed by the initial set of participants.&#xD;
      After a post-revision of the questionnaire based on the pre-test results, up to 10&#xD;
      additional, separate individuals will be invited to test the revised questionnaire for&#xD;
      duration and comprehensibility.&#xD;
