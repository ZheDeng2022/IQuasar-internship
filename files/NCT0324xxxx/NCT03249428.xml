  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco is the most preventable cause of disease and death in Canada. Although the tobacco&#xD;
      use rate has substantially gone down in the general population, significant differences exist&#xD;
      between sub-populations in Canada, for example Ottawa's highly vulnerable homeless or at-risk&#xD;
      for homelessness population has an almost 100% tobacco smoking rate relative to 9-18% in the&#xD;
      rest of the Canadian general population. This stark inequity in tobacco use translates into&#xD;
      devastating healthcare outcomes such as a disproportionate amount of cancer, stroke, heart&#xD;
      disease and death. Canadians who are homeless or at-risk for homelessness die 25 years&#xD;
      earlier than housed Canadians, mostly due to tobacco. In order to tackle this tobacco use&#xD;
      related inequity - a novel approach is urgently needed. Despite commonly held dogma that&#xD;
      People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) don't want to quit smoking, many studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      in fact they are very interested in quitting. Moreover, the investigators pragmatic peer-led&#xD;
      community-based action approach used in their PROMPT project has demonstrated that tobacco&#xD;
      dependence strategies can be implemented with great success in this population. The majority&#xD;
      of PROMPT participants reduced or quit tobacco use, in addition to reducing or quitting all&#xD;
      other drug use. Importantly, the investigators have demonstrated that it is possible to gain&#xD;
      the trust and engagement of marginalized populations and that researchers can create a&#xD;
      community space that is low-threshold, safe and non-judgmental. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      compare two tobacco dependence management strategies in the homeless (or at-risk for&#xD;
      homelessness) multi-drug use population in Ottawa and Toronto. They will use the same&#xD;
      peer-led approach in PROMPT with community peer researchers with lived experience; with the&#xD;
      hope that the cost-effective community based framework derived from this trial will serve as&#xD;
      a template for interventions and treatments in community settings for chronic diseases such&#xD;
      as obesity and diabetes.&#xD;

      Aim: A 3-yr multi-centre, pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to compare&#xD;
      effectiveness of nicotine e-cigarettes (e-cigs) (with counseling) with peer-led PROMPT&#xD;
      strategy (nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counseling) for tobacco dependence in the&#xD;
      inner city population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Homelessness/at-risk for homelessness populations in Canada carry&#xD;
      disproportionate burden of many diseases, mostly due to tobacco. With smoking rates at ~100%&#xD;
      in some subpopulations as compared to 9-18% in the general population, tobacco inequity is&#xD;
      translated into unequal morbidity and mortality (COPD, cancers, heart diseases). Tobacco use&#xD;
      costs the Ontario economy ~$1.6 billion/yr in healthcare costs. Smoking attributable&#xD;
      hospitalization costs ~$38.2 million/yr in Ottawa alone from 2008-10. The inner city&#xD;
      population in Canada dies ~25 yrs earlier than housed Canadians, largely due to tobacco. With&#xD;
      negligible quit rates using conventional strategies, novel approaches to address tobacco&#xD;
      inequity are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 200 Toronto and Ottawa inner city homeless/ at-risk for homelessness&#xD;
      participants using poly-substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Patient-Oriented Outcome: To assess impact of two tobacco dependence strategies on&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) measured by questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L scores) at 26 wks; Secondary: i) To&#xD;
      assess effectiveness of these two strategies with biochemically validated 7-day point&#xD;
      prevalence smoking abstinence at 12, 26 and 52 wks; ii) To assess effectiveness of these two&#xD;
      strategies on cigarette use reduction and cessation at 12, 26 and 52 wks; iii) To assess&#xD;
      self-reported reduction and cessation of other illicit drug use; and; iv) To describe the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of nicotine e-cigs serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      drop-outs due to side effects, and therapy adherence over 52 wks; and, v) To compare the lung&#xD;
      function (spirometry/oscillometry), 6-min walk and self-efficacy at baseline, 26 and 52 wks;&#xD;
      Tertiary: i) To assess the cost-effectiveness of the pragmatic tobacco dependence strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A multi-centre pragmatic RCT trial comparing e-cigs (with nicotine) with&#xD;
      counseling or NRT with counseling for a 26 wks treatment period and 52 wks follow up. Similar&#xD;
      to the real world all participants will be given an opportunity to choose either strategy at&#xD;
      26 wks. The primary analysis will be change in QOL measured with EQ-5D-5L at 26 wks between&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 1) The Bridge Engagement Centre, Ottawa, adjacent to the largest homeless shelter&#xD;
      downtown; and 2) Nicotine Dependence Clinic, Center for Addiction and Mental Health, catering&#xD;
      Toronto's inner city population downtown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise: Both PIs are well versed in community-based research and Dr. Pakhale led the&#xD;
      PROMPT project, a community based smoking cessation project engaging the same target&#xD;
      population. Together the team is very experienced in tobacco dependence and the target&#xD;
      population. The investigators collective expertise with links to the target community will&#xD;
      support the implementation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Pragmatic community-based participatory and peer-led research holds a tremendous&#xD;
      potential in investigating solutions 'for the people, by and with the people'. Outcomes of&#xD;
      this trial will aid policy makers in implementing effective programs to treat tobacco&#xD;
      dependence in marginalized population. The cost-effective community based framework of this&#xD;
      trial can be used as a template for intervention in other chronic diseases (e.g. obesity or&#xD;
      diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: The trial will require 3 yrs to complete.&#xD;
