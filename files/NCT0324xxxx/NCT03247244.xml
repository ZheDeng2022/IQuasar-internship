  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS), available medications do not help with&#xD;
      their symptoms, or cause significant side effects. Two small controlled trials have&#xD;
      investigated the effect of oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a principal psychoactive&#xD;
      ingredient of cannabis, in TS patients. While these trials have shown promising results, the&#xD;
      effect sizes were not as large and consistent as those reported by patients with regards to&#xD;
      inhaled cannabis (smoked or vaporized). Indeed, based on anecdotal evidence, patients have&#xD;
      much greater improvement in their symptoms using inhaled cannabis than using cannabinoid&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals. However, there have been no controlled trials of inhaled medical cannabis&#xD;
      for TS to date. Furthermore, various medical cannabis products are authorized in Canada with&#xD;
      different contents of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), another primary cannabinoid. No data exists&#xD;
      regarding the dosing, efficacy and safety of these products in the treatment of TS. To gather&#xD;
      such data, a double-blind, randomized, crossover pilot trial will be conducted to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of three vaporized medical cannabis products with different THC and CBD&#xD;
      contents, as well as placebo, in adults with TS. As well, the PK/PD profile of THC and CBD of&#xD;
      the products will be assessed and correlated with tic symptoms&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female adult, 18-65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;

             observation by clinician at both screening and Week 0 (randomization). This&#xD;
             requirement is for the purpose of minimizing the potential for floor effects given the&#xD;
             relatively short window for assessing effect on symptoms in this single-dose trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able and willing to refrain from using any non-study cannabis during&#xD;
             the screening and treatment phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential (defined by menarche and not having undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization/hysterectomy) must have a negative pregnancy test, must be&#xD;
             practicing acceptable double-barrier methods of contraception (or can confirm&#xD;
             abstinence at each scheduled visit), and must not be breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to the initiation of&#xD;
             any protocol-required procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able to comprehend and satisfactorily comply with the protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • The subject and/or his/her family have a history of psychosis, schizophrenia or&#xD;
             bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential who will not commit to&#xD;
                  utilizing 2 of the approved birth control methods or who will not remain&#xD;
                  abstinent during the trial; Females who are breast-feeding and/or who have a&#xD;
                  positive serum pregnancy test result prior at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject represents a significant risk of committing suicide (current suicide&#xD;
                  plan or attempt in past 2 years) or committing homicide.&#xD;

                  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer (asthma is not an&#xD;
                  exclusionary criterion); hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject has a current or past history of substance abuse within the last 5&#xD;
                  years, with the exception of cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject is using cannabis regularly for the treatment of TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject has any abnormal laboratory tests and vital sign results which in the&#xD;
                  investigator's judgment is medically significant and would impact the safety of&#xD;
                  the subject or the interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
