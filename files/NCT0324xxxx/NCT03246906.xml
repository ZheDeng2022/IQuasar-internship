  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial includes a blood stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor&#xD;
      to treat blood cancer. The treatment also includes chemotherapy drugs, but in lower doses&#xD;
      than conventional (standard) stem cell transplants. The researchers will compare two&#xD;
      different drug combinations used to reduce the risk of a common but serious complication&#xD;
      called &quot;graft versus host disease&quot; (GVHD) following the transplant. Two drugs, cyclosporine&#xD;
      (CSP) and sirolimus (SIR), will be combined with either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or&#xD;
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). This part of the transplant procedure is the main&#xD;
      research focus of the study.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)-free and relapse-free survival (CRFS)&#xD;
      after transplant between the 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare rates of acute (grades II-IV and III-IV) and moderate and severe chronic GVHD&#xD;
      (based on National Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus criteria), relapse, non-relapse&#xD;
      mortality, progression or relapse-free survival, and overall survival between the 2 regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) at day 0.&#xD;
      Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) on&#xD;
      days 0 to 40, cyclosporine PO every 12 hours twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 then tapered&#xD;
      to day 150, and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to day 150 then tapered to day 180.&#xD;
      Patients with an HLA-mismatched donor receive mycophenolate mofetil PO on days 0-100 then&#xD;
      tapered to day 150, cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 150 then tapered to day 180, and&#xD;
      sirolimus PO QD on days -3 to 180 then tapered to day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo HCT at day 0. Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive&#xD;
      cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-96 then tapered to day 150, sirolimus PO QD on days 5-150 then&#xD;
      tapered to day 180, and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days 3 and 4. Patients with an&#xD;
      HLA-mismatched donor receive cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-150 then tapered to day 180,&#xD;
      sirolimus PO QD on days 5-180 then tapered to day 365, and cyclophosphamide IV on days 3 and&#xD;
      4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and every year&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) - patients in CP1 must have failed or be intolerant of&#xD;
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); patients beyond CP1 will be accepted if they have &lt;&#xD;
             5% marrow blasts at time of transplant&#xD;

          -  Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN) - must be in complete remission&#xD;
             at the time of transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: FHCRC matching allowed will be grades 1.0 to 2.1;&#xD;
             unrelated donors who are prospectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by&#xD;
                  high resolution typing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is&#xD;
             identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this&#xD;
             determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution; the&#xD;
             recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match&#xD;
             is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens&#xD;
             for all patients before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or&#xD;
             B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded&#xD;
             if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an&#xD;
             HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches&#xD;
             should be obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic&#xD;
             crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele&#xD;
             in the graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient&#xD;
             is A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Only granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)&#xD;
             mobilized PBSC will be permitted as a HSC source on this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: Unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the&#xD;
             recipient within one of the following limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with or without an additional mismatch for&#xD;
                  one HLA-class I allele, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mismatched for two HLA class I alleles, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HLA class I HLA-A, -B, -C allele matched donors allowing for any one or two DRB1&#xD;
                  and/or DQB1 antigen/allele mismatch&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: HLA-matching must be based on results of high&#xD;
             resolution typing at HLA-A, -B, -C, - DRB1, and -DQ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class&#xD;
             I locus or II locus, the donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must&#xD;
             match the patient (i.e., patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous&#xD;

             increased risk for G-CSF mobilization and harvest of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DONOR: Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched HLA class I or II locus, the&#xD;
             donor is excluded if homozygous at the mismatched locus (i.e., patient is homozygous A&#xD;
             *01:01 and donor is homozygous A *02:01); this type of mismatch is considered a&#xD;
             two-antigen mismatch and is not allowed&#xD;
