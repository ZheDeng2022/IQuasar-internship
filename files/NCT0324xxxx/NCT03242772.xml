  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD) have significantly worse outcomes than those with either ASD alone or ADHD&#xD;
      alone. Effective early treatments that account for ADHD symptoms have not been developed for&#xD;
      young children with ASD+ADHD. The overarching goals of this randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      phase 2, pilot study are to (1) evaluate a novel early intervention that pharmacologically&#xD;
      addresses ADHD symptoms while providing an ASD-targeted behavioral intervention, and (2)&#xD;
      identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie improved&#xD;
      outcomes in children with comorbid ASD and ADHD ages 3-10 years. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate whether a stimulant treatment augments efficacy of an ASD specific form&#xD;
      of parent child therapy based on the Early Start Denver Model called ESDM influenced Parent&#xD;
      Coaching. Secondary aims are to determine the efficacy of combined intervention in improving&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT in young children&#xD;
      with ASD+ADHD. The study will also examine correlations between behavioral changes and&#xD;
      state-of-the-art eye-gaze tracking (EGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers to&#xD;
      elucidate key ways in which ADHD impacts attentional and neural functioning in ASD+ADHD, and&#xD;
      to potentially identify new targets for intervention in children with ASD+ADHD. The study is&#xD;
      about 8 months long and will involve screening, baseline assessment followed by 10- 11 weeks&#xD;
      of study drug treatment (active or placebo) and 8 sessions of ESDM informed parent coaching&#xD;
      beginning after 2 weeks of study drug treatment, primary endpoint assessments at ~11 weeks,&#xD;
      AE follow-up by phone at ~week 13 and remote FU 24 weeks after baseline. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication or placebo, Between weeks 11&#xD;
      to 24, it is expected that the parent will use the behavioral strategies they were coached in&#xD;
      even though they will not receive parent coaching. Participants will be given the option to&#xD;
      pursue ADHD medication outside of the research study after week 11 assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2, single site, pilot study will evaluate the&#xD;
      developmental impact of combined medication and behavioral treatment (COMB) versus placebo&#xD;
      and behavioral treatment (BEH) in children with comorbid ASD +ADHD, who are between 36 and &lt;&#xD;
      132 months of age. The active medication treatment will be an orally dissolvable, extended&#xD;
      release amphetamine preparation (Adzenys-XR-ODT) administered from weeks 0-~11 and carefully&#xD;
      titrated to the optimal dose using an algorithm that considers adverse events and improvement&#xD;
      in attention symptoms with a flexible dose range of 1.55mg - 18.6mg/day. The target dose is&#xD;
      12.4mg/day. A placebo, matched to the active medication, will be titrated and adjusted using&#xD;
      the same algorithm in the BEH arm. The provided behavioral treatment will be eight ~ hour&#xD;
      long parent child therapy sessions of ESDM influenced parent coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 48 participants will be randomly assigned to either the COMB or BEH treatment&#xD;
      arms. To account for possible differences in attrition due to potential poor tolerability of&#xD;
      Adzenys-XR-ODT, participants will be randomized in a 7 COMB to 6 BEH ratio. Treatment&#xD;
      assignment will be provided by the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC)using computer&#xD;
      generated algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analyses will compare changes in outcomes between weeks 0 and 11 weeks.&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will explore changes between weeks 0 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is change in amount and quality of joint engagement between the&#xD;
      child and the parent during a semi-structured, 6 minute parent child interaction task (PCIT),&#xD;
      which reflects the core symptom domain targeted by P-ESDM: social communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our key secondary outcomes will be changes in 1) the mean of the interview version of the&#xD;
      VABS-3 socialization subscale and communication subscale standard scores and 2) clinician&#xD;
      ratings of ADHD symptoms using the preschool ADHD-RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also assess the safety and tolerability of Adzenys-XR-ODT compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Mean of standard scores for VABS-3 (socialization subscale and communication subscales) assess how the participant actually has been functioning over the preceding month with regard to communication and social behaviors. The VABS-3 comprehensive form will be administered as a semi-structured interview by a trained and research reliable staff member. The standard score is based on the participant's age and is normed from a large sample of typically developing children. The standard score has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores represent more adaptive functioning and lower scores represent less adaptive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in ADHD Symptoms using Preschool or School age ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 1-10, Remote Follow up (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) will assess symptom frequency using data from clinician completed ADHD-RS and parent completed ADHD-RS (only parent-completed ADHD-RS is completed at week 24).&#xD;
ADHD-RS includes 18 items, each rated on a 4 point scale (0-3);Total Score is the sum of all responses (0-54). An Inattention subscale and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale (each range 0-27) are calculated based on individual items assessing those symptoms. Higher values represent worse outcomes for the subscales and the total scale. Normative scores are available. Clinically significant scores in boys are 14 for inattention and 17 for hyperactivity/impulsivity items; thresholds in girls are 12 and 14 respectively. A supportive exploratory analysis will examine change to a nonclinically significant score a24 weeks after baseline*. If subscales are used, they would be summed to compute the total score. *Baseline measures occur on visits weeks -1 and week 0 in the study.</description>
