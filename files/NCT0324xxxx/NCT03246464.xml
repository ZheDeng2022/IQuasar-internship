  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a common disease of the eye with increasing prevalence in the Western World as well&#xD;
      as in South East Asia where 60-90% of the children are affected. High myopia is associated&#xD;
      with an increasing risk of sight threatening complications such as retinal detachment,&#xD;
      glaucoma, macular choroidal degeneration and myopic choroidal neovascularization. In myopia&#xD;
      the eye is elongated compared to an emmetropic eye. If the elongation of the eye can be&#xD;
      controlled the progression of myopia can be controlled. Asian studies have shown reduction in&#xD;
      axial length growth by 36-46% in children using orthokeratology contact lenses (OKL). OKL are&#xD;
      custom fit, form stable lenses. During sleep the cornea is reshaped creating an emmetropic&#xD;
      vision during the day, so no glasses or contact lenses are needed. Twin and family studies&#xD;
      have shown a high heritability for the development of myopia, and more than 40 genetic loci&#xD;
      have been identified indicating that the effect of OKL in Asian children might not be the&#xD;
      same in North European children which is why we want to execute a similar study on North&#xD;
      European children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate if nightly wear of OKL reduces the progression of childhood myopia (change&#xD;
           in axial length) in Danish children when compared to a control group using monofocal&#xD;
           glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the safety (Efron score) of OKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate children's quality of life impact of refractive correction (questionnaire)&#xD;
           using OKL compared to glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify possible predictors for progression of myopia (AC/A ratio, peripheral defocus&#xD;
           and higher order aberrations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled 18 months prospective 1:1 study of a group of Danish children. 60&#xD;
      children will be included; 30 in each group. The participants will undergo several&#xD;
      measurements reflecting the anatomy and function of the eye at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 month&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a common disease of the eye with increasing prevalence in the Western World as well&#xD;
      as in South East Asia where 60-90% of the children are affected. A Danish study found that&#xD;
      early debut of myopia is associated with a higher degree of myopia later on in life. Myopia&#xD;
      may be corrected with spectacles, contact lenses or surgically, but despite this&#xD;
      socio-economic burden, high myopia is associated with an increasing risk of sight threatening&#xD;
      complications such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, macular choroidal degeneration and myopic&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myopia is a complex disease with a multi-factorial etiology. Twin studies and family studies&#xD;
      have shown a high heritability for development of myopia, and more than 40 genetic loci have&#xD;
      been identified. Outdoor activity seems to reduce the myopia progression. The shape of the&#xD;
      eye may be of importance; axial growth makes the eye ellipsoidal which increase the&#xD;
      peripheral defocus on the retina. Peripheral defocus has been suggested to induce further&#xD;
      axial growth of the eyeball.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accommodation is a significant covariant of near work and reading. A cross section study has&#xD;
      shown a reduced precision in accommodation (A) on a near object combined with increased&#xD;
      convergence (C) in myopic eyes. This increased AC/A ratio (dynamic) may be a predictor for&#xD;
      myopia progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for reducing myopia progression have been many. The effects of progressive&#xD;
      additional lenses, multifocal lenses and bifocal lenses have been limited. Anticholinergic&#xD;
      eyedrops (Atropin 0.01%) significantly reduce the progression of myopia in Asian children by&#xD;
      approximately 50% over a period of two years with limited side effects. Almost similar&#xD;
      results have been found in Asian children using orthokeratology contact lenses (OKL) for&#xD;
      reducing myopia progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OKL are custom fit, form stable lenses used during sleep. The lenses induce a temporal&#xD;
      flattening of the cornea, which modify or eliminate refractive errors, leaving no need for&#xD;
      glasses or contact lenses during daytime. OKL were introduced in the 1960 ÃÅs, but with&#xD;
      limited success due the lens material (PMMA) which was not gas-permeable. Decentration was&#xD;
      also a problem making the effect variable and unpredictable. With new gas- permeable lens&#xD;
      materials and computer assisted topographic measurements of the cornea, fitting of the lenses&#xD;
      has been improved significantly, so that nightly wear is now standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear-cut reduction in axial length growth in Asian children using OKL compared to&#xD;
      single-vision spectacles (SVS) has been proofed in several studies. In these studies, which&#xD;
      are very heterogeneous regarding design, reductions of 36-46% in axial length growth were&#xD;
      found compared to a matched control group. Two European prospective cohort studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effect of OKL compared to SVS in Spanish children. A reduction in axial&#xD;
      growth of 32 % and 38% respectively was found. Side effects of OKL have been evaluated; in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis from 2015, including 8 Asian and one of the European studies. Odds Ratio for&#xD;
      side effects were 8.87 for the OK group compared to the control group, however all side&#xD;
      effects were mild and disappeared after termination of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a reduction in childhood myopia using OKL has been proofed in Asian children; however,&#xD;
      weather similar result can be achieved in a group of children from Northern Europe is&#xD;
      unknown. The influence of OKL on quality of life impact of refractive correction has never&#xD;
      been investigated in a randomized trail. How OKL reduce the axial growth of the eye is&#xD;
      unknown. The lenses induce multifocality and higher order aberrations in the cornea, which&#xD;
      might change the peripheral defocus. A change in defocus has been suggested as a mechanism&#xD;
      for controlling axial length growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized 18 months prospective 1:1 study of a group of Danish children to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate if nightly wear of OKL (DreamliteR, Procornea, Nederlands) may reduce the&#xD;
           progression of childhood myopia (change in axial length) when compared to a control&#xD;
           group using SVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate safety (Efron score) in the use of OKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare children's quality of life impact of refractive correction (questionnaire) using&#xD;
           OKL and glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify possible predictors for progression of myopia (AC/A ratio, peripheral defocus&#xD;
           and higher order aberrations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nightly wear of OKL reduces the progression of childhood myopia in Danish children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of OKL is safe, with no sight threatening complications during 18 months of nightly&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children using OKL experience a higher quality of life impact of refractive correction&#xD;
           compared to children wearing SVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response AC/A ratio is positively correlated to progression of childhood myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of OKL induce changes in corneal topography resulting in (1) decreased peripheral&#xD;
           defocus (2) increased number of higher order aberrations. Progression in childhood&#xD;
           myopia is associated to changes in peripheral defocus and higher order aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 18-month randomized prospective 1:1 study of progression of myopia in a group of Danish&#xD;
