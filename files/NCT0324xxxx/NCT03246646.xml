  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and pilot test an enhanced, telephone &quot;coaching&quot; intervention to&#xD;
      help family members concerned about a Veteran of the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan who needs to&#xD;
      seek treatment for a substance abuse problem.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will first develop a detailed manual for Coaching-CRAFT, which will be a&#xD;
      telephone-based model of coaching that uses the web-version of an intervention already&#xD;
      developed and available to the investigators. The investigators will conduct a preliminary&#xD;
      nonrandomized feasibility trial of the use of Coaching-CRAFT with a sample of 50 family&#xD;
      member callers recruited from VA's Coaching Into Care call center. Later in the study, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit up to 50 Veterans whose family members also participated in this&#xD;
      study. Since the 'Coaching Into Care' telephone-based call center located at the Corporal&#xD;
      Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center (CMCVAMC) is a national call center, study subjects&#xD;
      (non-Veterans and Veterans) will be from all parts of the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members (spouses, siblings, or parents) of Veteran will be recruited from Coaching&#xD;
      Into Care, and offered telephone-based coaching to the family member regarding their concern&#xD;
      that the Veteran has a substance abuse problem and does not want to seek treatment. The&#xD;
      program will involve approximately 12 telephone calls over 4-6 months. Family members will be&#xD;
      assessed for their own mental health symptoms, their perception of their Veteran's mental&#xD;
      health symptoms and substance use, his or her treatment, as well as their perception of&#xD;
      burden on the relationship with the Veteran. These assessments will occur at study entry, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months after study entry. Veteran's perceptions of the intervention will be&#xD;
      sought at 12 months, whenever safe and practical. For Veterans who are not approached to&#xD;
      participate in the study, VHA administrative data will be sought through a HIPAA Waiver to&#xD;
      confirm any possible mental health and or substance abuse treatment the Veteran has received.&#xD;
      Rates of initiation of treatment will be compared to QA data from the Coaching Into Care call&#xD;
      center.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be approximately 12, 30-45 min. telephone sessions, every 2-3 weeks, and will last 4-6 months. The Coach helps the participant individualize the content of a web-based course (VA-CRAFT) based on an intervention to encourage a loved one to seek treatment for substance abuse. The VA-CRAFT course has 8 modules that follow the original CRAFT intervention: 1) Introduction, 2) Overview, 3) Getting Started: Safety Planning, 4) Understanding substance abuse, 5) How to respond to substance abuse, 6) Rebuilding your life together, 7) Helping someone consider treatment, 8) Wrapping up. The goals include understanding triggers and long-term reinforcement of substance misuse, ignoring unhealthy behaviors and rewarding healthy behaviors, getting support, and how to help the CSO caller help the Veteran enter treatment. The participants in the active intervention will be compared to a treatment as usual, matched comparator group drawn from regular clinical operations.</intervention_model_description>

      <recruitment_details>Potential participants were recruited from the callers who reached a staff member of the Coaching Into Care (CIC) program. Those interested in considering the research study were screened by a study staff member, consented if eligible, and given a baseline assessment. Some participants responded to notices on social media who filled out a brief online screener or contact study staff directly. The matched TAU control participants were selected from callers to CIC in the same time period.</recruitment_details>

          <description>The interventionist provided a telephone-guided coaching intervention with the aid of a web-based program, VA-CRAFT, developed by the Co-Investigators for concerned significant others (CSOs). The VA-CRAFT program, based on the original Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) program for substance misuse has 8 modules: 1) Introduction to CRAFT, 2) Overview of CRAFT, 3) Getting Started with CRAFT: Safety Planning, 4) Understanding substance abuse, 5) How to respond to substance abuse, 6) How to rebuild your life together, 7) How to help someone consider treatment, 8) Wrapping up. The goals of the intervention include helping the CSO understand triggers and long-term reinforcement of substance misuse, ignoring unhealthy behaviors and rewarding healthy behaviors, getting support, and encouraging the Veteran to enter mental health treatment for substance abuse. After viewing each of the VA-CRAFT web-based modules, the interventionist reviewed and personalized the material with the CSO via a telephone conversation. The intervention was flexible within the following framework: 1) 8 to 12, 30-45 min. telephone sessions, every 2-3 weeks, and 2) between 4 and 6 months.</description>

          <title>Treatment as Usual (TAU) Coaching</title>
          <description>The treatment as usual coaching (TAU) seeks to empower, motivate, educate, and improved the concerned significant others' (CSOs') listening and communication skills with the goal of enhancing the veteran's intrinsic motivation for care. It draws from self-determination theory and emphasizes humans' underlying need for autonomy to maximize intrinsic motivation. CSOs were encouraged to reduce their pressure on the veteran to seek care and to engage in more positive activities of interest to both. CSOs were coached to listen for concerns expressed by the veteran, such as complaints about mood, anxiety, or the future (11, 12). CSOs were also encouraged to use an &quot;autonomy-supportive&quot; style of communication, which means offering to help the veteran but stating that it is understood that the offer is subject to the veteran welcoming this assistance. Coaching includes behavioral rehearsal to enhance the learning of these skills.</description>

          <title>Coaching + VA-CRAFT</title>
          <description>The interventionist provided a telephone-guided coaching intervention with the aid of a web-based program, VA-CRAFT, developed by the Co-Investigators for concerned significant others (CSOs). The VA-CRAFT program, based on the original Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) program for substance misuse has 8 modules: 1) Introduction to CRAFT, 2) Overview of CRAFT, 3) Getting Started with CRAFT: Safety Planning, 4) Understanding substance abuse, 5) How to respond to substance abuse, 6) How to rebuild your life together, 7) How to help someone consider treatment, 8) Wrapping up. The goals of the intervention include helping the CSO understand triggers and long-term reinforcement of substance misuse, ignoring unhealthy behaviors and rewarding healthy behaviors, getting support, and encouraging the Veteran to enter mental health treatment for substance abuse. After viewing each of the VA-CRAFT web-based modules, the interventionist reviewed and personalized the material with the CSO via a telephone conversation. The intervention was flexible within the following framework: 1) 8 to 12, 30-45 min. telephone sessions, every 2-3 weeks, and 2) between 4 and 6 months.</description>

          <title>Treatment as Usual (TAU) Coaching</title>
          <description>The treatment as usual coaching (TAU) seeks to empower, motivate, educate, and improved the concerned significant others' (CSOs') listening and communication skills with the goal of enhancing the veteran's intrinsic motivation for care. It draws from self-determination theory and emphasizes humans' underlying need for autonomy to maximize intrinsic motivation. CSOs were encouraged to reduce their pressure on the veteran to seek care and to engage in more positive activities of interest to both. CSOs were coached to listen for concerns expressed by the veteran, such as complaints about mood, anxiety, or the future (11, 12). CSOs were also encouraged to use an &quot;autonomy-supportive&quot; style of communication, which means offering to help the veteran but stating that it is understood that the offer is subject to the veteran welcoming this assistance. Coaching includes behavioral rehearsal to enhance the learning of these skills.</description>
