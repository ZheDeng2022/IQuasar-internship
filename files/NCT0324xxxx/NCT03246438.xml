    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a 3-arm randomized control trial assessing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      sequential or active choice in CRC (colorectal cancer) screening outreach vs. colonoscopy&#xD;
      outreach only, in patients between 50-74 years old, who have received care at the University&#xD;
      City or Valley Forge CCA (Community Care Associates) practices, are due for screening, and&#xD;
      are asymptomatic for CRC. The three arms are: Arm 1: Direct schedule colonoscopy (Control),&#xD;
      Arm 2: Direct schedule colonoscopy followed by mailed FIT(Fecal Immunochemical Test)&#xD;
      (Sequential Choice), and Arm 3: Choice of direct schedule colonoscopy or mailed FIT (Active&#xD;
      Choice).&#xD;
