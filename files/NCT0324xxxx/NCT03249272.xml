      The aim of this study is to assess microvascular function as determined by a cardiovascular&#xD;
      magnetic resonance measurement of whole-heart (global) perfusion reserve. The goal is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of MVD in two common forms of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). The&#xD;
      hypothesis that an optimized technique will provide robust detection of MVD and that a&#xD;
      multifaceted approach will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of MVD, including&#xD;
      the influence of myocardial scarring upon the presence and severity of MVD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary microvascular dysfunction (MVD) has been implicated as an important marker of&#xD;
      cardiac risk and has been thought to directly contribute to the pathogenesis of a wide&#xD;
      variety of cardiomyopathies. For instance, MVD is believed to cause ischemia (with reduction&#xD;
      in coronary flow reserve) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) despite the&#xD;
      presence of angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries. The implication is that MVD&#xD;
      in HCM may lead to the ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death, and heart failure. Similarly,&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) have blunted coronary flow reserve,&#xD;
      which appears to be independently associated with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several etiologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of MVD, including&#xD;
      structural and functional abnormalities1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increased microvascular resistance due to reduced vascular luminal caliber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduced density of microvessels associated with replacement scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. inappropriate vasoconstrictor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. inadequate vasodilator responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these mechanisms are difficult to study in humans since no technique currently&#xD;
      allows the direct visualization of the coronary microcirculation in vivo. Thus, MVD has been&#xD;
      largely studied using non-invasive imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) or single photon emitted computed tomography (SPECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these methods have provided insight into MVD, much remains unknown. For example,&#xD;
      even the prevalence of MVD in patients with various types of cardiomyopathy is unclear, with&#xD;
      different studies showing widely different rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is increasingly being used in clinical practice to&#xD;
      evaluate cardiac disease. CMR employs a multifaceted imaging approach with separate&#xD;
      techniques used to acquire separate sets of raw data, providing information on cardiac&#xD;
      morphology, function, regional myocardial ischemia, scarring, and global myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      reserve. The advantage of this approach is that image artifacts in one set of data will not&#xD;
      affect the quality of the other datasets, and the datasets in combination can be used to&#xD;
      distinguish separate pathophysiologies that could confound image interpretation. For example,&#xD;
      perfusion defects could be due to ischemia or scar tissue, but since the investigators will&#xD;
      obtain both perfusion images and scar images, the investigators will be able to resolve the&#xD;
      etiology. Additionally, CMR provides high spatial resolution (over 10-fold higher than PET),&#xD;
      and hence partial volume affects will be kept to a minimum and variability in measurements&#xD;
      will be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess microvascular function as determined by a cardiovascular&#xD;
      magnetic resonance measurement of whole-heart (global) perfusion reserve. The goal is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of MVD in two common forms of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). The&#xD;
      hypothesis that an optimized technique will provide robust detection of MVD and that a&#xD;
      multifaceted approach will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of MVD, including&#xD;
      the influence of myocardial scarring upon the presence and severity of MVD.&#xD;

        <title>Prevalence of Microvascular Dysfunction (MVD) by a CMR Measurement of Whole-heart (Global) Perfusion Reserve Ratio in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy, and Controls.</title>
        <description>Prevalence of microvascular dysfunction as determined by the CMR measure of global perfusion reserve ratio (GPR) in each these patient groups. MVD was considered present when either GPR was &lt;2.0 or regional stress perfusion abnormalities were present.&#xD;
In order to calculate this ratio, coronary sinus flow was measured twice:&#xD;
prior to the the administration of adenosine/regadenoson&#xD;
during the administration of adenosine/regadenoson&#xD;
GPR is a ratio of coronary sinus flow during the administration adenosine/regadenoson divided by the baseline coronary sinus flow measured prior to the administration.&#xD;
Regional perfusion abnormalities will be assessed at the time of adenosine/regadenoson administration.</description>
        <time_frame>The prevalence of MVD will be determined based on the findings at the time of the scan on Day 1 of the study.</time_frame>
        <population>Due to the slow pace of recruitment, the sponsor withdrew funding for the study. Of the expected 75 participants, 31 were recruited. As was pre-specified, the regadenoson and adenosine groups were combined for analysis as these interventions are interchangeable.</population>
