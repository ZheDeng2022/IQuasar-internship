  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of an enhanced alcohol intervention among individuals&#xD;
      who are mandated to complete an alcohol education activity as part of a university sanction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High volume drinking and related adverse consequences pose significant health concerns at US&#xD;
      colleges and universities; drinking behavior often leads to students being sanctioned for&#xD;
      violations of campus alcohol policy. Given the widespread use of mandated alcohol&#xD;
      interventions for these students, optimizing their initial effects and their duration could&#xD;
      substantially mitigate adverse alcohol outcomes. Self-affirmation represents a promising&#xD;
      adjunct to brief alcohol interventions, particularly those delivered via computer that are&#xD;
      popular but tend to have smaller effects. Basic research shows that when self-affirmation&#xD;
      exercises precede the receipt of health information, they decrease defensiveness and&#xD;
      resistance to threatening health information and increase acceptance and processing of health&#xD;
      messages. Furthermore, the facilitative effects of self-affirmation are strongest among those&#xD;
      at higher risk. Because many mandated students display both defensiveness and high drinking&#xD;
      severity, use of self-affirmation to enhance information processing and reduce defensive&#xD;
      responding could optimize the efficacy of an active alcohol intervention in this at-risk&#xD;
      subpopulation. The investigators propose to use a two-group randomized design to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of a self-affirmation exercise prior to an empirically supported brief alcohol&#xD;
      intervention consisting of computer-delivered personalized normative feedback (PNF). Building&#xD;
      on an extensive history of academic-student affairs collaborations, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 450 mandated students from a large public university over the course of 5 semesters.&#xD;
      The primary aim is to examine the additive effects of an initial self-affirmation (SA)&#xD;
      manipulation prior to receiving PNF (SA + PNF) relative to Control + PNF on alcohol use and&#xD;
      consequences. This study extends prior work by evaluating the ability of self-affirmation&#xD;
      exercises to supplement active alcohol interventions (rather than just health messages), and&#xD;
      tracking the impact on alcohol use over a longer (12-month) follow-up period. Secondary aims&#xD;
      include (a) testing theoretically-derived mediation sequences that explain the SA + PNF&#xD;
      effects on alcohol use and alcohol consequences, incorporating mechanisms of action&#xD;
      associated with both self-affirmation and brief alcohol interventions, and (b) the&#xD;
      examination of theoretical moderators of the effects of SA + PNF on alcohol use and alcohol&#xD;
      consequences. The investigators will use latent growth curve modeling analyses to examine&#xD;
      direct and indirect intervention effects on alcohol use and consequence trajectories from&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) baseline assessment across 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups. The&#xD;
      public health goal of this research is to reduce the acute and chronic effects of alcohol&#xD;
      misuse by improving the efficacy of a low intensity brief alcohol intervention. The findings&#xD;
      of this study have both practical and theoretical implications. Demonstration of the additive&#xD;
      utility of a very brief self-affirmation exercise could improve the efficacy and impact of&#xD;
      currently available computer-delivered interventions for mandated students; it may also&#xD;
      expand the reach of self-affirmation theory, leading to adaptation of self-affirmation for&#xD;
      use with other at-risk populations receiving brief alcohol interventions.&#xD;
