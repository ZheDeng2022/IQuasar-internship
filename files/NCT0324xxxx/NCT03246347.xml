  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study with the combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel with&#xD;
      the addition of enzalutamide in the treatment of subjects with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess if ADT + docetaxel + enzalutamide is well tolerated&#xD;
      and demonstrates improved efficacy compared to ADT + docetaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the 12 month PSA&#xD;
      complete response rate in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer treated&#xD;
      with ADT, docetaxel and enzalutamide. The primary endpoint of this study will be 12-month PSA&#xD;
      complete response rate, which will be assessed against a contemporary historical control rate&#xD;
      for the combination of ADT and docetaxel alone in the metastatic hormone naive setting. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at all participating sites across North and South Carolina within the&#xD;
      Levine Cancer Institute network. Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 24 months.&#xD;
