  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open, comparative, multi-centre study which will recruit up to 66&#xD;
      patients. The objective is mainly to explore the safety and feasibility in neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      first-line ovarian cancer (including patients with primary peritoneal or fallopian tube&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma) of various combinations of durvalumab with chemotherapy with or without&#xD;
      tremelimumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The schedule is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • In a first step a run-in phase of 6 patients will be conducted to test the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of the combination of durvalumab with standard carboplatin-paclitaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 : chemotherapy alone (day1) Cycle 2 : chemotherapy + durvalumab (day1) Cycle 3 :&#xD;
      chemotherapy + durvalumab (day1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • In a second step, if first-step was found feasible, a run-in phase of 6 patients will be&#xD;
      conducted to test the safety and feasibility of the combination of durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab with standard carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 : chemotherapy alone (day1) Cycle 2 : chemotherapy + durvalumab + tremelimumab (day1)&#xD;
      Cycle 3 : chemotherapy + durvalumab (day1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the run-in phase, patients will be randomized in a ratio 1:1 between those&#xD;
           included in the durvalumab-chemotherapy expansion phase (arm A) and those included in&#xD;
           the durvalumab + tremelimumab-chemotherapy expansion phase (arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will also allow to explore the feasibility of a salvage therapy personalized&#xD;
           according to the results of interval surgery and type of previous neo-adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In those patients who achieved a complete surgical resection at interval debulking&#xD;
                surgery, adjuvant treatment will include 3 cycles of durvalumab + chemotherapy and&#xD;
                then a follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In patients with residual tumor at interval debulking surgery, salvage therapy will&#xD;
                depend on the initial treatment arm allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. In arm A, the tremelimumab will be added to the durvalumab-chemotherapy&#xD;
                     combination at day 1 of cycle 2 before a salvage surgery. Durvalumab (with one&#xD;
                     cycle of tremelimumab post S3) will be pursued in maintenance treatment, up to&#xD;
                     1 year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient&#xD;
                     withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. In arm B, the therapy will be according to the Investigator choice and managed&#xD;
                     according to local practice.&#xD;
