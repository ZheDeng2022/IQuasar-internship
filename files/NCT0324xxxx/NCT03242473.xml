    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is increasingly common diagnosis in children. Most of the guidelines&#xD;
      related to the details of management of acute pancreatitis are extrapolated from the adult&#xD;
      literature. There is only limited data regarding management of acute pancreatitis in&#xD;
      children. The mainstay of management is bowel and pancreatic rest with significant fluid&#xD;
      support to minimize the effect of the cytokines on the pancreas and other organs. The&#xD;
      standard fluid choices are Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and normal saline (NS). Currently,&#xD;
      both LR and NS are used at the discretion of the treating physician as the standard of care&#xD;
      for acute pancreatitis. The investigators hope to examine the question of ideal fluid choice&#xD;
      for fluid resuscitation in children with acute pancreatitis by assessing recovery time in the&#xD;
      context of measured inflammatory markers and SIRS status at 24 and 48 hours after admission.&#xD;
      The ideal fluid choice in the initial resuscitation of acute pancreatitis has not been&#xD;
      effectively evaluated before in the pediatric population. Even if there is no statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the two fluid options, this trial will still provide&#xD;
      clinically significant information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis represents inflammation of the pancreas that has been well identified in&#xD;
      the literature for several centuries. However, the phenomenon has only relatively recently&#xD;
      gained prominence in the pediatric literature. The incidence can be as high as 13 per 100,000&#xD;
      per year, a level which approaches that seen in adults, and the diagnosis has been&#xD;
      increasingly common over the last two decades. It affects all ages of children (including&#xD;
      infants) evidenced by well-established age appropriate diagnostic criteria. The precise&#xD;
      pathophysiological basis of the inflammation is not always as clear. Currently, the&#xD;
      prevailing theory is that there is an insult to the acinar cells of the pancreas likely via&#xD;
      an atypical calcium signal that releases a cascade of cellular activity and that ultimately&#xD;
      results in a disseminated cytokine storm. While there is certainly debate as to the inciting&#xD;
      event to this cascade, one thing that is clear is that extensive end-organ damage can occur&#xD;
      if this cytokine storm reaches systemic circulation. Therefore, the mainstay of management is&#xD;
      bowel (and specifically pancreatic) rest with significant fluid support to minimize or&#xD;
      mitigate the effect of the cytokines on the pancreas and other systemic organs such as the&#xD;
      lungs, heart, and kidneys. The remainder of therapy consists of appropriate analgesia and&#xD;
      antiemetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most of the guidelines related to the details of management of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis are extrapolated from the adult literature. There is only limited data regarding&#xD;
      management of acute pancreatitis in children. Recently, Wu et al. have shown compelling data&#xD;
      that suggest the choice of fluid for management of acute pancreatitis in adults should be&#xD;
      Lactated Ringers (LR). Their group demonstrated in a small randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      involving 40 adult patients with acute pancreatitis, that the patients randomized to the LR&#xD;
      arm of the study had significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein and Systemic&#xD;
      Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) markers compared with controls in the normal saline&#xD;
      (NS) group. They proposed that the mechanism for this difference may be related to the more&#xD;
      balanced pH of LR which might prevent, or at least further buffer, the systemic inflammation&#xD;
      that is triggered by the release of the offending cytokines from the pancreas. Currently,&#xD;
      both LR and NS are used at both Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters (CHKD) and&#xD;
      Children's National Health System (CNHS) at the discretion of the attending physician as the&#xD;
      standard of care for acute pancreatitis. The investigators hope to examine the question of&#xD;
      ideal fluid choice for fluid resuscitation in children with acute pancreatitis by assessing&#xD;
      recovery time in the context of measured inflammatory markers and SIRS status at 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized trial of pediatric patients in the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      or inpatient ward diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Patients meeting the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be identified by an ED or inpatient physician. The ED or inpatient physician&#xD;
      will ask the eligible patient/parent if they are interested in hearing about the study. If&#xD;
      the eligible patient/parent is interested in hearing information about the study, the ED or&#xD;
      inpatient ward will notify the PI via telephone or page. The PI will come to the eligible&#xD;
      patient's room to explain the study and answer any questions, or the PI will page a research&#xD;
      team member to do so. If the patient/parent agrees to participate in the study, the research&#xD;
      team member will consent the parents of the patients aged 0-17 years or consent patients aged&#xD;
      18 years. Assent will be obtained from patients aged 8-17 years. Non-English speaking&#xD;
      patients/parents will be consented using an in-person translator or the blue phone&#xD;
      translating service. These consent and assent forms will be signed by a witness. At the time&#xD;
      of enrollment, the subject identification (ID) number and medical record number will be&#xD;
      entered into the electronic Subject ID Key. Once the patient is enrolled in the study, their&#xD;
      treatment will be randomized to either the LR or the NS group. Both treatments are current&#xD;
      standard of care for acute pancreatitis. Patients who choose not to participate in the study&#xD;
      will receive the standard of care treatment at the discretion of the attending physician,&#xD;
      which may involve either fluid, and will likely include most (if not all) of the lab studies&#xD;
      as outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to screen and enroll the subjects in either the ED or inpatient ward within 6&#xD;
      hours of diagnosis, as this is within the theoretical window prior to the development of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. At the discretion of the attending physician, however, treatment can&#xD;
      begin in the ED or inpatient ward before enrollment in the study; patients will not have to&#xD;
      wait for necessary treatments. Patients will still be eligible to participate in the study if&#xD;
      treatment was begun in the ED or inpatient ward. The randomized treatment may end up being&#xD;
      the same or different than what was originally ordered by the attending physician. If any&#xD;
      such changes in treatment plan are noted, this will be considered for the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization plan will include constrained randomization using the permuted blocks&#xD;
      method. The research team member will open the envelope that contains the randomized&#xD;
      treatment and the Admission Order Sheet that details the orders that need to be placed on&#xD;
      admission. The research team member will communicate this information to the ED or inpatient&#xD;
      attending physician or staff member overseeing the patient's care at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
      All clinical treatments described in this protocol, including labs orders, are the current&#xD;
      standard of care for acute pancreatitis diagnosis. The purpose of the Admission Order Sheet&#xD;
      is to standardize the timeline of the lab work at admission, at 24 hours and 48 hours after&#xD;
      admission, not to request any additional lab work for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be placed on 1.5x maintenance IVF with the fluids to which they are&#xD;
      randomized. The patient will remain nil per os (NPO) for at least the first 24 hours, and the&#xD;
      time of initiating feeds after 24 hours will be at the discretion of the admitting team. As&#xD;
      the standard of care, the following studies will be obtained at the time of admission if not&#xD;
      previously obtained in the ED: Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP), gamma-glutamyltransferase&#xD;
      (GGT), Amylase, Lipase, Triglycerides, Complete Blood Count (CBC), and CRP, along with an&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound. CBC, CRP, amylase and lipase levels will be obtained at 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      (+/- 2 hours) as listed in the Admission Order Sheet. Similarly, a Basic Metabolic Panel&#xD;
      (BMP) will be collected at 24 and 48 hours (+/- 2 hours), with the addition of liver function&#xD;
      tests if liver enzyme levels are elevated at admission (as defined by transaminases greater&#xD;
      than 2 times the age appropriate upper limit of normal). SIRS status will be evaluated with&#xD;
      vital sign checks every 4 hours and the leukocyte counts every 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be observed for additional known signs and complications of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis such as persistent inflammation, shock, sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, renal&#xD;
      failure or other end organ damage. Any adverse reactions during the trial will be treated&#xD;
      independent of the trial, and the attending physician will continue to manage the care of the&#xD;
      patient at their discretion. Any serious adverse reactions will be documented clinically and&#xD;
      reported to the CHKD or CNHS incident reporter systems, Eastern Virginia Medical School&#xD;
      (EVMS) Institutional Review Board (IRB), CNHS IRB and CHKD Human Research Coordination (HRC)&#xD;
      Committee .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-identified information will be collected from the patient's electronic medical record&#xD;
      by a research team member and entered directly into an Excel database. Patients transferred&#xD;
      from an outside ED should already have charts scanned into the Electronic Health Record (EHR)&#xD;
      as standard of care. If only a paper chart is available for any transferred patient, a&#xD;
      research team member will enter information directly from the paper chart into the Excel&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
