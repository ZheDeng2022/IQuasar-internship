    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiology diseases. Trans aortic valve&#xD;
      implantation (TAVI) has been developed since 2002, first to treat rejected patients from&#xD;
      conventional surgery, then to treat high surgical risk patients and nowadays probably&#xD;
      intermediate surgical risk patient. TAVI related complications are still recurrent and the&#xD;
      investigators are searching a way to decrease them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of them could be image fusion, since it may decrease radiation exposure and contrast&#xD;
      agent use. It may also improve valve placement position leading to decreased complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 prospective and consecutive patients will be included. Participants will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups: the 20 first included will be control group, the 20 following patients will be&#xD;
      the fusion group. For control group TAVI procedure will be the usual one, for fusion group&#xD;
      the procedure will be the usual one with addition of computed tomography 3D images fusion&#xD;
      with fluoroscopy 2D images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main evaluation criteria will be radiation exposure, measured by dose area product (DAP).&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criterion will be procedural as contrast agent volume used, procedure&#xD;
      duration, subjective usefulness of image fusion or procedure failure evaluated immediately&#xD;
      after procedure. The investigators will also evaluated procedure induced complications as de&#xD;
      novo pacemaker implantation, de novo left bundle branch, vascular complication, major&#xD;
      bleeding, acute kidney failure, significant aortic regurgitation. These complications&#xD;
      occurrence will be evaluated after 1 month follow up, during the usual following&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiology diseases. If untreated, symptomatic&#xD;
      aortic stenosis rapidly leads to death. Most of the time, this disease affects old fragile&#xD;
      people for whom conventional surgery is countered or very risky. That is why Trans aortic&#xD;
      valve implantation has been developed since 2002, first to treat rejected patients from&#xD;
      conventional surgery, then to treat high surgical risk patients and nowadays probably&#xD;
      intermediate surgical risk patient. Indeed, thanks to prodigious technical and human&#xD;
      progress, procedure induced complication have clearly decreased. But TAVI related&#xD;
      complications are still recurrent and the investigators are searching a way to decrease them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of them could be image fusion, since it may decrease radiation exposure and contrast&#xD;
      agent use correlated to acute kidney failure. It may also improve valve placement position,&#xD;
      and the investigators know that many rhythmic (atrio-ventricular block) and valvular&#xD;
      (significant aortic regurgitation) complications are partially due to placement mistakes. So&#xD;
      the investigators hope that image fusion will decrease these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 40 prospective and consecutive patients. Inclusion criterion&#xD;
      will be all major patients admitted in Nantes CHU for transfemoral aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      with SAPIEN® 3 valve. Exclusion criterion will be women of childbearing age without&#xD;
      contraception, impossible written consent, judiciary protected people. After inclusion,&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two groups: the 20 first included will be control group, the 20&#xD;
      following patients will be the fusion group. For control group TAVI procedure will be the&#xD;
      usual one, for fusion group the procedure will be the usual one with addition of computed&#xD;
      tomography 3D images fusion with fluoroscopy 2D images. The only difference during all&#xD;
      patient medical care will be the addition of image fusion in fusion group. Before and after&#xD;
      procedure, both groups will have the usual medical monitoring and the appropriated medical&#xD;
      interventions to participants case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main evaluation criterion will be radiation exposure, measured by dose area product (DAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criterion will be procedural as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contrast agent volume used (mL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  procedure duration (min),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjective usefulness of image fusion evaluated on a 0 to 3 scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  procedure failure : death, more than one valve implantation, valve dysfunction (mean&#xD;
           trans-valvular gradient &gt; 20 mmHg or moderate to severe aortic regurgitation) These&#xD;
           criterions will be evaluated immediately after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluated procedure induced complications as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  de novo pacemaker implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  de novo left bundle branch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non minor vascular complication on VARC-2 definition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  major bleeding (BARC 3 or 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute kidney failure (AKIN 2 or 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  significant aortic regurgitation ≥ 2/4 These complications occurrence will be evaluated&#xD;
           after 1 month follow up, during the usual following consultation with echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then differences between will be tested with appropriated statistical methods.&#xD;
