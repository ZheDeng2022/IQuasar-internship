  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical assessments can only offer a snapshot of daily life with Parkinson's Disease, while&#xD;
      wearable devices can offer immensely more information that can improve the understanding of&#xD;
      this disease. With recent advancements in technology, investigators are now able to use&#xD;
      watch-like devices to more effectively measure the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease outside of&#xD;
      the doctor's office. The present study is designed to evaluate the usability, applicability,&#xD;
      and interpretability of an electronic VA Patient Motor Diary (eON-OFF), MC10 BioStampRC&#xD;
      actigraphy sensor, APDM actigraphy sensor and the GENEActiv Watch in persons with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease. There is no placebo/control group.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be comprised of at least four sessions in the Spivack Center (Rm.&#xD;
      X-140) on separate days (not counting recruitment, screening, or consent activities), each&#xD;
      lasting approximately 1-2 hours. Subjects will commence a 1-week testing period during which&#xD;
      they will wear the 3 actigraphy devices in their normal schedule and daily environment. On&#xD;
      Days 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will use the eON-OFF motor diary application to select their&#xD;
      current Parkinson state (e.g. &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;). ON and OFF states are subjective measures&#xD;
      identified by subjects, and are commonly used words in Parkinson's Disease treatment and&#xD;
      research to describe symptom states. Symptom severity is directly linked to medication&#xD;
      effectiveness. &quot;On&quot; is when the medication is working and symptoms are not severe or&#xD;
      troublesome. &quot;Off&quot; is when medication has worn off, and symptom severity increases. Subjects&#xD;
      will also use the eON-OFF motor diary application to verbally record symptomology every 30&#xD;
      minutes while awake. Subjects will complete paper VA Patient Motor Diaries to record ON and&#xD;
      OFF states on Day 2, Day 3, and Day 4. Subjects will then complete the outlined set of&#xD;
      activities during Phase I in a second phase to take place approximately one month later. All&#xD;
      questionnaires, training and interviews will be administered one-on-one by a trained research&#xD;
      assistant. All UPDRS' will be administered by a clinician. Ideally, subjects will be&#xD;
      administered the study activities on the days listed above, but they are allowed a&#xD;
      flexibility of +/- 4 days for scheduling appointments.&#xD;
