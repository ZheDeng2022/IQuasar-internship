  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BASIC study will take place in Kanduyi/Bungoma South Sub-County, in western Kenya, and&#xD;
      focuses on children orphaned by one or two parents. Growing evidence demonstrates that&#xD;
      orphaned children in low- and middle-income countries are at higher risk of mental health&#xD;
      problems, but mental health professionals are largely unavailable in this area. Research&#xD;
      suggests that some mental health treatments can be delivered effectively in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries using a task-shifting approach, in which lay counselors with little&#xD;
      or no prior mental health experience are trained to provide treatment, and deliver with&#xD;
      supervision. However, very little is known about how to support local systems and&#xD;
      organizations in delivering mental health care via task-shifting, particularly in a way that&#xD;
      could scale-able and sustainable in the low-resource context. The BASIC team's prior work&#xD;
      suggests that partnering with two government sectors, education and health, could be a&#xD;
      low-cost and sustainable strategy to implement task-shifted mental health services. By&#xD;
      training teachers (via the Education sector) and community health volunteers (via the Health&#xD;
      sector) to provide mental health care, a larger population could potentially be reached.&#xD;
      Before attempting any country or system-wide implementation, it is important to know what is&#xD;
      needed to enable successful implementation in either or both sectors, client outcomes for&#xD;
      those receiving mental health care when delivered via Education or Health, and cost of&#xD;
      delivery in both sectors. The team aims to collect outcomes that are relevant to policy&#xD;
      makers, and that can be considered along with cost and experiences in both sectors.&#xD;

      Building and Sustaining Interventions for Children (BASIC): Task-sharing mental health care&#xD;
      in low-resource settings builds on our 15-year history of collaborations with research&#xD;
      partners in Kenya, prior NIH-funded work that identified mental health needs of orphaned&#xD;
      children in low- and middle-income countries, and iterative and collaborative intervention&#xD;
      adaptation and testing using a task-sharing approach, to address these needs.Our goal is to&#xD;
      identify locally sustainable implementation policies and practices (IPPs) that lead to&#xD;
      effective implementation of task-shared evidence-based treatment (EBT) delivery (a locally&#xD;
      adapted version of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), Pamoja Tunaweza in&#xD;
      this study) in 2 governmental sectors in Kenya. Both sectors were identified by our Kenyan&#xD;
      partners as potential platforms for scale- up-Education via teacher delivery and Health via&#xD;
      community health volunteer (CHV) delivery. Both Education and Health may be viable sectors&#xD;
      for mental health care delivery, but the IPPs that predict implementation success and&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness in either/ both sectors are unknown. This study identifies&#xD;
      con-textually relevant, practical, and actionable IPPs that can inform implementation&#xD;
      planning, while also assessing child outcomes and intervention costs in both sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent devolvement of the Kenyan government (leading to more local decision-making), the&#xD;
      launch of a National Mental Health Policy, and our Kenyan partners' empowerment work building&#xD;
      enthusiasm for TF-CBT are converging to create a local climate in which BASIC could become&#xD;
      part of the county plan, if evidence-based guidance for implementation, using mostly existing&#xD;
      resources, existed. The trial design is an incomplete stepped wedge cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (SW-CRT) including 40 schools and the 40 surrounding villages. The school&#xD;
      and the surrounding community are considered a &quot;village cluster.&quot; Each of the 40 &quot;village&#xD;
      clusters&quot; has 1 team of teachers and 1 team of CHVs delivering Pamoja Tunaweza, resulting in&#xD;
      120 trained lay counselors in each sector, who provide TF-CBT to 1,280 youth and one of their&#xD;
      guardians, across seven sequences of the SW-CRT. Site leaders are enrolled for data&#xD;
      collection (up to 80), but do not provide services. The study uses a novel method,&#xD;
      qualitative comparative analyses (QCA), that holds potential for substantially advancing the&#xD;
      field of implementation science. QCA leverages the rigor of quantitative approaches and the&#xD;
      detail of qualitative approaches, and allows for complex causality and equifinality (i.e., an&#xD;
      outcome can be reached by multiple means).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are: 1) Identify actionable IPPs that predict adoption (delivery) and fidelity&#xD;
      (high- quality delivery) after 10 sites in each sector implement TF-CBT (sequence 1). Use&#xD;
      identified IPPs to (Aim 1a) guide implementation planning support for subsequent sites and to&#xD;
      (Aim 1b) generate testable hypotheses about IPPs as causal mechanisms; 2) Test mechanisms of&#xD;
      implementation success in both sectors across all 7 sequences; and 3) Test TF-CBT&#xD;
      effectiveness (i.e., mental health outcomes; functioning) and cost in both sectors. This&#xD;
      research has important implications for implementing an evidence-based treatment in&#xD;
      low-resource settings, including the US.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Child mental health outcomes are assessed using an incomplete stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial with 7 sequences. Child participants &amp; one guardian each are randomized to receive the treatment (therapy sessions) from lay counselors in the Health (Community Health Volunteer) or Education (teacher) sector, with timing based on the sequence to which their village cluster was randomly assigned. These participants are the focus of the Interventional Study Design in Aim 3. Also included are lay counselors &amp; site leaders (Head Teachers, Deputy Teachers, &amp; Community Health Extension Workers), given that it is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. These participants, the focus of implementation questions in Aims 1 &amp; 2, provide TF-CBT &amp; do not receive therapy sessions themselves. The village clusters are randomized to sequences in the SW-CRT, &amp; if randomized to sequences 2-7, they receive coaching support informed by sequence 1 on how to effectively implement TF-CBT.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>No masking--Child/Adolescent participants and their participating guardian will be able to tell to which arm they were allocated or randomized, given that they know from whom they receive treatment (from teachers, indicating Education or from Community Health Volunteers, indicating Health). There are other participant types in addition to children/adolescents and guardians who are enrolled in BASIC (per above description) to answer implementation questions (Aims 1 and 2 of BASIC). As noted above, these other participants include the lay counselors (teachers and Community Health Volunteers, their site leaders [Education: Head Teachers and Deputy Teachers; Health: Community Health Extension Workers]).</masking_description>

    <time_frame>End of first year of site implementation (2 groups, 8 sessions each)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using both reflective and formative measures at the group leader level. The reflective measure is the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), with scores ranging from 1 (least acceptable) to 5 (most acceptable) calculated as a mean score to reflect the acceptability of the TF-CBT intervention in a given setting. The formative measure is the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Implementation science case for Acceptability (using only 5 items that mapped directly onto Proctor's definition of acceptability and did not overlap with items on the AIM measure). This is not treated as a scale, and items are analyzed independently of each other.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>End of first year of site implementation (2 groups, 8 sessions each)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using both reflective and formative measures at the group leader level. The reflective measure is the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), with scores ranging from 1 (least feasible) to 5 (most feasible) calculated as a mean score to reflect the feasibility of implementing TF-CBT in a given setting. The formative measure is the Johns Hopkins University Implementation science scale for Feasibility (using 12 items). This is not treated as a scale, and items are analyzed independently of each other. 2 additional items were included that inquired about the estimated hours per week that respondents felt Pamoja Tunaweza/TF-CBT would require, given the importance of this information for understanding added workload and feasibility for providers in the two contexts (&quot;On average, how many hours per week do you spend on Pamoja Tunaweza/TF-CBT [e.g., preparing for sessions, delivering sessions, and supervision]?&quot;).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Appropriateness</measure>
    <time_frame>End of first year of site implementation (2 groups, 8 sessions each)</time_frame>
    <description>A formative measure is used to assess perceived appropriateness of the TF-CBT intervention at the group leader level, with scores ranging from 1 (least appropriate) to 5 (most appropriate). This is not treated as a scale, and items are analyzed independently of each other. Six items were adapted from the Johns Hopkins University implementation measures that aligned with Proctor and colleagues' (20) definition of appropriateness. Minor changes were made to fit wording to the local context. Two additional items were developed to measure appropriateness domain content for which Johns Hopkins University items did not exist. Given challenges in creating new items, Hujig's Theoretical Domains Framework was used when possible to guide item creation (42). In the resulting 8-item measure, 4 items assessed the perceived fit of delivering TF-CBT with one's role. The additional 4 items assessed the perceived fit of delivering TF-CBT within the specific setting.</description>
