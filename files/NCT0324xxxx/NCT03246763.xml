  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current obesity treatment guidelines recommend 26 or more hours of behavior treatment,&#xD;
      delivered over a 6-month period in a multidisciplinary weight management clinic. However,&#xD;
      this guideline is not feasible in real-world clinic settings where medical visits are costly&#xD;
      and poorly reimbursed, and attrition is high, particularly among the most vulnerable&#xD;
      children. The National Collaborative on Child Obesity Research has issued a call for research&#xD;
      investigating healthcare-community partnerships to improve the effectiveness of child obesity&#xD;
      treatment. The World Health Organization supports this approach, and in 2015 modified the&#xD;
      chronic disease model to include healthcare-community integration. ARCHES is a three-year&#xD;
      project that will develop and evaluate an effective, engaging, and scalable&#xD;
      community-healthcare treatment option for low-income and racially diverse children. The&#xD;
      project engages four communities in North Carolina and facilitates a local clinic-community&#xD;
      partnership, supports the development of an integrated childhood obesity treatment program,&#xD;
      and evaluates the feasibility of the integrated program model. The effectiveness of the&#xD;
      integrated model will also be evaluated, as we will monitor patient outcomes associated with&#xD;
      participation. Participation among teens (ages 11-18) will be incentivized where&#xD;
      teen/caregiver dyads will be randomized to a gain or loss frame group at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and have the opportunity to receive and redeem points for attending sessions. Patient&#xD;
      and process outcomes associated with participation in the integrated model with and without&#xD;
      financial incentives will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a three-year project to evaluate the implementation feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an integrated clinic-community model of child obesity treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will engage four communities in North Carolina, facilitate a local&#xD;
      clinic-community partnership, support the development of an integrated child obesity&#xD;
      treatment program, and monitor outcomes. To evaluate implementation feasibility the&#xD;
      investigators will measure fidelity, reach, acceptability, uptake and cost. To evaluate the&#xD;
      program model the investigators will conduct a classical program evaluation by monitoring&#xD;
      aggregate referral, enrollment and attendance data, as well as safety and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. To report patient outcomes associated with participation in the integrated&#xD;
      model, the investigators will measure participant-level outcomes over a 6-month period,&#xD;
      including changes in nutrition and physical activity behaviors, quality of life,&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness, and body mass index.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods study using focus groups and interviews to explore the facilitators and barriers to program implementation, and a time-series analysis to examine program engagement and individual health outcomes. This study design will be repeated at each of the four sites. Aim 1 will consent and enroll program providers to obtain qualitative feedback on program design and implementation; Aim 2 will collect de-identified program-level data on attendance and program components; Aim 3 will consent patients for individual-level baseline and outcomes data.Subjects will be enrolled at our community sites. A research assistant will conduct all the enrollment, consent, and data collection. Where needed, the investigators will report or obtain required IRB authorization agreements for each site, including Federal Wide Assurances, Data Transfer Agreements, or other documents as required by federal regulation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will include nutrition and fitness programming at a community center. The program will be open at least two sessions per week, each session lasting at least 1 hour. The program coordinator will run the programming, which will consist of comprehensive wellness activities. Each session will include at least 60 minutes of exercise and/or active play, and each session will have an additional special &quot;theme.&quot; For example, one session might include a cardio focused class, and one session might include a yoga class. The number and which sessions the participants attend each week is voluntary; clinic staff will recommend participation in as many sessions per week as possible. Participation is voluntary, and patients may opt-out at any time. Participants will be told that they can indicate to their provider or the program coordinator at any time either by phone or during the clinic appointment that they wish to opt-out of the study and its assessments.</description>
