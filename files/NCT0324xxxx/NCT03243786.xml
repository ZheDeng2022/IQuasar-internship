      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a lifestyle intervention. The study&#xD;
      will examine the Stay on Track program, dietary and activity patterns, body composition,&#xD;
      biomarkers and quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.&#xD;

      Research Design. The investigators will be conducting an randomized trial in 60 women&#xD;
      undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer to examine the feasibility of a 12-week&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention that addresses diet and physical activity and to explore the impact on&#xD;
      behavioral, biological and psychosocial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Summary. Patients who are eligible are consented by the research coordinator, after&#xD;
      which a baseline assessment will be scheduled. The baseline assessment requires 60 minutes&#xD;
      and includes questionnaires, height/weight, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and&#xD;
      phlebotomy. Participants will also wear the Fitbit for one week to establish baseline&#xD;
      activity level. After the baseline assessment, women are then randomly assigned to: the&#xD;
      12-week &quot;Stay on Track&quot; lifestyle intervention or the 12-week self-guided control. Both&#xD;
      groups complete a post-intervention and a 3-month follow-up visit identical to their baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Self-guided controls can utilize their Fitbit and will receive informative&#xD;
      binders 24 weeks' post-intervention.&#xD;
