  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is common and disabling for most patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease.&#xD;
      Therapies designed to improve physical activity and 'talking' treatments, which positively&#xD;
      help patients change the way they think and behave, are both helpful in reducing the burden&#xD;
      of the fatigue. However, few patients have access to these treatments in most health&#xD;
      services. This situation results from the absence of standardised programmes and limited&#xD;
      availability of relevant therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enhance access to fatigue alleviating physical activity and talking&#xD;
      therapies by testing innovative,standardised and cost-effective approaches to treatment&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also use this opportunity to understand how to select the best&#xD;
      treatment for a patient based on their individual profile and to better understand how these&#xD;
      treatments actually work. This in turn may lead to more refined and effective therapies in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be identified from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases&#xD;
      attending major secondary care rheumatology services in the United Kingdom. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be identified using local databases/clinic lists and will then be mailed a&#xD;
      pre-study invite, which will include questions about fatigue. Potentially eligible&#xD;
      participants will be invited to attend a baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it has been confirmed at the baseline assessement that they are eligible to take part in&#xD;
      the study, the consented participant will be allocated to one of three treatment groups.&#xD;
      During the course of the trial, the participant will be invited to visit the study centre&#xD;
      three more times for assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of the four assessment visits (baseline, and approximately 2, 7 and 13 months after)&#xD;
      they will be asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To complete questionnaires which collect information about various outcomes which we&#xD;
           think will improve in response to the therapies under evaluation as well as factors&#xD;
           which will help us understand how the treatments may work, and factors which may help&#xD;
           identify those patients better suited to one therapy over another&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide a blood sample for research&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To take part in an aerobic fitness test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To wear an activity monitor for the next 7 days which will be fitted at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To answer three short questions about engagement with intervention delivered by&#xD;
           telephone from trial office at the time of session 4 and 8 (CBA and PEP intervention&#xD;
           only). Similarly, the allocated therapists will be asked to give their view of the&#xD;
           participants' engagement with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to keep a diary on any other treatments they are using in&#xD;
      addition to the treatments they may receive during the study and how costly these other&#xD;
      treatments are. The diary period will last for the first 6 months and then for 2 weeks after&#xD;
      the third visit and 2 weeks before the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they finished the study, the investigators may approach a subgroup of participants who&#xD;
      received either the talking therapy or the personalised exercise programme again and ask for&#xD;
      an interview to enable more detailed feedback on if they found the intervention helpful and&#xD;
      how it has changed their daily life.&#xD;
