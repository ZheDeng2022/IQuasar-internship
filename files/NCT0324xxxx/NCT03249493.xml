  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of today, HIV-infected patients followed in decentralized area have little or even no&#xD;
      access to viral load monitoring because laboratories able to perform this biological&#xD;
      measurement are only in large cities, and because plasma transfer to these laboratories is&#xD;
      complex and very costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling using dried blood spots (DBS) could overcome these difficulties. The goal of&#xD;
      this operational research is to document the feasibility of DBS use in decentralised area to&#xD;
      monitor viral load, to evaluate the virological response on ART, and to compare the&#xD;
      virological response between injecting drug users (IDU) and the other patients, as IDU&#xD;
      represent a large proportion of HIV-infected patients who may have a lower access/adherence&#xD;
      to care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MOVIDA project is a longitudinal observational study enrolling patients who initiate ART&#xD;
      in decentralized areas requiring individual data and blood samples collected in routine HIV&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims at evaluating and providing operability data of the use of Dried Blood&#xD;
      Spots (DBS) as sampling tool to measure and monitor the HIV viral load in real life in rural&#xD;
      decentralized areas in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This operational project would contribute to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the provision of viral load measurements in patients from rural decentralized areas,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the improvement of the proportion of patients in virological success on ART, and hence&#xD;
           to reduce the proportion of patients with acquired HIV drug resistance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the improvement of general HIV care and to establish an observatory of HIV drug&#xD;
           resistance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strengthen national capacities through capitalization and exchange of good practices of&#xD;
           blood sampling using DBS system to expand to other indications than HIV VL measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this goal, clinical and laboratory staff will be trained to the management of the&#xD;
      MOVIDA project (enrollment of patients; sample collection, management and analysis; data&#xD;
      collection) before the operational observational study. Patients on the antiretroviral (ART)&#xD;
      initiation visit will be informed about the study and invited to participate, before&#xD;
      collection of blood to prepare DBS and collection of clinical data already routinely&#xD;
      collected in the patient medical records. The blood collection (5ml) will be repeated at 6,&#xD;
      12 and 24 months during follow-up visits already planned according to the current national&#xD;
      guidelines for the ART delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples collected (5ml of blood) will be analyzed in a local central laboratory using the&#xD;
      m2000rt Abbott techniques. Analysis results (VL and when necessary HIV Drug Resistance&#xD;
      genotyping) will be available to the medical doctor in order to adapt the patient treatment&#xD;
      appropriately. A set of randomly selected DBS will be shipped to France for centralized&#xD;
      quality control analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A socio-anthropological qualitative study will also be implemented targeting patients,&#xD;
      health-care staff and peer health workers to apprehend their understanding of VL, and to&#xD;
      better define determinants of adherence and attendance to clinical visits. This will help&#xD;
      local health authorities adapt the messages and the initiatives to improve adherence to ART&#xD;
      and attendance to care follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is 36 months with a 6 months period of enrollment and will be conducted in&#xD;
      6 provinces where 1000 patients are to be enrolled.&#xD;
