  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) represent the overwhelming majority of both HCV and HIV/HCV&#xD;
      infected people in the United States. Though new, direct-acting HCV medications are highly&#xD;
      efficacious and have the potential to end the HCV epidemic, few PWIDs ever initiate&#xD;
      treatment. This study seeks to improve HCV treatment uptake and cure among HCV and HIV/HCV+&#xD;
      PWIDs by testing a primary care based HCV Group Evaluation and Treatment UPtake (GET-UP)&#xD;
      intervention. If efficacious, this innovative care intervention could provide a means to&#xD;
      reduce the growing mortality from HCV, as well as decrease the current reservoir for HCV&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to improve HCV (hepatitis C virus) treatment uptake among&#xD;
      current and former injection drug users (IDUs) by testing an innovative, primary care based&#xD;
      HCV Group Evaluation and Treatment UPtake (HCV GET-UP) intervention. IDUs make up the&#xD;
      majority of the 4 million Americans chronically infected with HCV, and up to 90% of HIV+ IDUs&#xD;
      are infected with HCV. In the U.S., HCV is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and the most common indication for liver transplantation. Without&#xD;
      imminent action, mortality from HCV-related disease is projected to triple over the next&#xD;
      decade and HCV-related deaths have already surpassed deaths related to HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While past HCV therapies have been relatively ineffective, new oral treatment regimens with&#xD;
      direct-acting antivirals are substantially more efficacious, with few side effects, and cure&#xD;
      rates as high as 100% for both HCV+ and HIV/HCV+ individuals. Importantly, successful HCV&#xD;
      treatment has been associated with decreased mortality. Unfortunately, there are significant&#xD;
      gaps along the HCV care cascade that prevent patients from ever realizing the benefits of&#xD;
      these revolutionary medications. Approximately 10% of all HCV+ patients, and even fewer IDUs,&#xD;
      have ever initiated HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ease and efficacy of the new HCV medications, investigators have an unprecedented&#xD;
      opportunity to treat IDUs within medical settings that they are already accessing, such as&#xD;
      primary care clinics. Community-based primary care clinics, such as Federally Qualified&#xD;
      Health Centers (FQHCs), are abundant throughout the US and serve populations at high risk for&#xD;
      HCV, such as IDUs; studies show an HCV prevalence rate of approximately 8% in FQHCs almost 5&#xD;
      times greater than the general population. Over the past year at Montefiore Medical Center,&#xD;
      investigators have piloted onsite HCV treatment at one FQHC and treated nearly 50 patients&#xD;
      (81% former or current IDUs) with direct-acting antivirals, with 93% cure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite high HCV cure rates for those treated in primary care at our FQHC, only a small&#xD;
      minority of eligible patients has initiated treatment. Though onsite treatment reduces&#xD;
      obstacles related to specialty referral, patient level barriers to HCV evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment uptake still exist. IDUs in particular often have limited HCV knowledge, as well as&#xD;
      low perceived vulnerability to poor HCV-related health outcomes, low self-esteem and poor&#xD;
      self-efficacy, high levels of perceived stigma, and mistrust of healthcare providers. These,&#xD;
      as well as other barriers, prevent many IDUs from ever initiating HCV evaluation or starting&#xD;
      the treatment uptake process. Investigators therefore propose to test an HCV Group Evaluation&#xD;
      and Treatment UPtake (HCV GET-UP) intervention to improve HCV medical evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment uptake for HCV and HCV/HIV IDUs within an FQHC. Group-based interventions, often&#xD;
      familiar to IDUs, provide social support and encourage behavior change, which together&#xD;
      promote enhanced engagement in care. Group-based care can also allow efficient delivery of&#xD;
      health-education and medical treatment. Informed by the Information-Motivation-Behavior (IMB)&#xD;
      model. Investigators hypothesize that a group-based HCV intervention, HCV GET-UP, delivered&#xD;
      in an FQHC already accessed by patients, will improve HCV treatment uptake by: (1) providing&#xD;
      HCV education; (2) increasing motivation by minimizing stigma, and addressing competing&#xD;
      priorities and social norms; and (3) increasing self-efficacy and related behavioral skills.&#xD;
      Investigator propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of HCV GET-UP. Investigators will pre-test&#xD;
      HCV GET-UP by conducting two group interventions (each consisting of 4 weekly sessions; 8&#xD;
      participants in each intervention group). Investigators will assess feasibility by examining&#xD;
      process measures, and acceptability using a brief, self-administered questionnaire after each&#xD;
      of the 4 sessions. Investigators will also conduct focus groups after the entire 4-session&#xD;
      intervention. Investigators will then refine HCV GET-UP based on these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of HCV GET-UP for&#xD;
      improving HCV treatment uptake in an FQHC. Investigators will enroll 96 HCV+ or HIV/HCV+ IDUs&#xD;
      and randomize them 1:1 to HCV GET-UP plus onsite treatment in primary care (intervention)&#xD;
      versus onsite treatment alone (control). Our primary outcome is HCV treatment uptake, and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include HCV medical evaluation, HCV treatment completion, and HCV&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine potential moderators and mediators of the impact of HCV GET-UP on HCV&#xD;
      treatment uptake, using a sequential explanatory design. First, Investigators will perform&#xD;
      exploratory quantitative analyses to determine if there are specific patient characteristics&#xD;
      (demographic, clinical) that moderate the intervention effect, and if there are mediators&#xD;
      (reduced stigma, peer support, increased self-efficacy) of HCV GET-UP's impact on treatment&#xD;
      uptake. Second, investigators will perform semi-structured interviews with 20 participants&#xD;
      randomized to HCV-GET UP to explore potential moderators/mediators deduced from quantitative&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
