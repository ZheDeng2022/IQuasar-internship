    <measure>Annual Change in Total Score of St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Week 52.</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction. The questionnaire included 3 subscales measures: symptoms, activity limitation, and social, and emotional impact of disease (each subscale score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating poorer quality of life). The SGRQ total score was calculated by summing weights from all positive items, divided by sum of weights for all items in SGRQ questionnaire and multiplying by 100. The total score of SGRQ ranged from 0 (no effect on quality of life) to 100 (maximum perceived distress). Thus, a higher score indicated a poorer quality of life. Annual change in score of St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 52 was reported.</description>

    <description>The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) is an 8-item, health status instrument which provides a method for assessing the impact of COPD on the patient's health and quality of life. The CAT score (ranging from 0 to 40) was calculated for each individual by summing the points for each item. A decrease in CAT score represents an improvement in health status, whereas an increase in CAT score represents a worsening in health status.</description>

        <title>Annual Change in Total Score of St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction. The questionnaire included 3 subscales measures: symptoms, activity limitation, and social, and emotional impact of disease (each subscale score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating poorer quality of life). The SGRQ total score was calculated by summing weights from all positive items, divided by sum of weights for all items in SGRQ questionnaire and multiplying by 100. The total score of SGRQ ranged from 0 (no effect on quality of life) to 100 (maximum perceived distress). Thus, a higher score indicated a poorer quality of life. Annual change in score of St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 52 was reported.</description>

          <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction. The questionnaire included 3 subscales measures: symptoms, activity limitation, and social, and emotional impact of disease (each subscale score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating poorer quality of life). The SGRQ total score was calculated by summing weights from all positive items, divided by sum of weights for all items in SGRQ questionnaire and multiplying by 100. The total score of SGRQ ranged from 0 (no effect on quality of life) to 100 (maximum perceived distress). Thus, a higher score indicated a poorer quality of life. Annual change in score of St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Week 100 was reported.</description>

        <description>The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) is an 8-item, health status instrument which provides a method for assessing the impact of COPD on the patient's health and quality of life. The CAT score (ranging from 0 to 40) was calculated for each individual by summing the points for each item. A decrease in CAT score represents an improvement in health status, whereas an increase in CAT score represents a worsening in health status.</description>
