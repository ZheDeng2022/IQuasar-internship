  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if combining durvalumab with standard stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an effective treatment for people with locally advanced or&#xD;
      borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The researchers will also look at the safety of the&#xD;
      combination treatment and any side effects it causes.&#xD;
