      Preanesthetic evaluation is a clinical assessment process with purpose of increased patient&#xD;
      safety. One focus is review of patient medical history to reduce perioperative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality as well as optimize the daily process in at anesthesia ambulance. The aim of that&#xD;
      study is the development and implementation of a practical computer-based individualized and&#xD;
      risk-adapted questionnaire for the daily routine&#xD;

      The study was a step-by-step process. In the first investigation in 2013 the investigators&#xD;
      included 50 patients and 81 patients in 2016. Questionnaires were identical in both testing&#xD;
      stages for comparability. Practicability of a computer-based questionnaire on patient medical&#xD;
      history, diagnosis as well as behavior guidelines was tested at anesthesia ambulance.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators evaluated the user satisfaction with the help of a separate&#xD;
      anonym paper-based questionnaire in 2013 as well as in 2016.&#xD;
