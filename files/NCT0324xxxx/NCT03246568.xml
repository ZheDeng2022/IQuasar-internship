  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and it is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PVI) by radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy or cryoablation has been shown to be an effective treatment of AF by reducing&#xD;
      morbidity, improving quality of life and functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal artery sympathetic denervation (RND) by catheter ablation has been shown in a&#xD;
      preliminary study to improve outcome of PVI in patients with paroxysmal and/or persistent AF&#xD;
      with concomitant refractory or moderate hypertension. In patients with renal impairment, RND&#xD;
      also conferred benefit in reducing AF recurrence after PVI. The initial indication for&#xD;
      catheter-based RND is for blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension.&#xD;
      However, a recent study failed to show significant difference in blood pressure reduction by&#xD;
      RND. Therefore, the effect of RND on AF suppression may be independent of blood pressure&#xD;
      control. Possible mechanisms of RND on AF may include risk factors modification and&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic effect.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aimed to evaluate the effect of RDN added to PVI for&#xD;
      persistent AF. Study will be performed in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: Catheter based RDN can prevent recurrence of AF in patient with persistent&#xD;
      AF undergoing PVI by mechanism not related to hypertension control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: Freedom from documented AF episodes post PVI as defined by longer&#xD;
      than 30 seconds of AF recorded by implantable loop recorder 2 to 18 months after procedure&#xD;
      with or without antiarrhythmic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study, the sample size calculation will not be applied and arbitrary&#xD;
      assign 20 subjects to each arm will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized in 1:1 fraction to one of the following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PVI by cryo-balloon ablation without linear ablation plus bilateral RND using a&#xD;
           multi-electrode renal denervation catheter.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Research on the Basis of Earlier Theory Renal artery sympathetic denervation (RND) by catheter ablation has been shown in a preliminary study to improve outcome of electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal and/or persistent AF with concomitant refractory hypertension and the same group later showed renal sympathetic denervation improved outcome of PVI in the cohort of paroxysmal and/or persistent AF patients with moderate hypertension. In patients with renal impairment, RND also conferred benefit in reducing AF recurrence after PVI.The initial indication for catheter-based RND is for blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension. Early data from clinical trials without sham controls was promising - demonstrating large blood pressure reductions in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.</intervention_model_description>
