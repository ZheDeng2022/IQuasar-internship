  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes during pregnancy is a challenging clinical situation requiring substantial patient&#xD;
      engagement. The investigators have developed a novel early-phase tool, called SweetMama, that&#xD;
      incorporates educational, motivational and supportive elements to positively impact maternal&#xD;
      health behaviors. This phase of work involves develop an optimized version of SweetMama via a&#xD;
      2-step sequential process of in-depth usability and feasibility testing. First the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct focus groups and individual usability testing followed by&#xD;
      refinement of SweetMama based on participant input. Next, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      feasibility testing via a pilot randomized trial to determine acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      pilot procedures for a fully powered larger trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In prior work, the investigators created a text messaging curriculum that was well-received&#xD;
      by patients for diabetes-related education and support during pregnancy. The team has now&#xD;
      drawn upon these earlier phases to develop a mobile health behavior tool to educate and&#xD;
      support low-income, minority pregnant women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus. This &quot;first-of-its-kind&quot; mHealth platform for pregnant women with GDM or&#xD;
      T2DM is called SweetMama. SweetMama is a theory-driven application that delivers an&#xD;
      interactive, goal-oriented educational and motivational diabetes-focused curriculum.&#xD;
      SweetMama currently functions as a user-friendly application in which participants are&#xD;
      delivered curriculum messages and have the opportunity to receive novel educational,&#xD;
      motivational, or supportive content when desired by patients; they additionally have the&#xD;
      opportunity to view library content and receive support with goal-setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform usability testing, the investigators will first conduct focus groups with 10-20&#xD;
      low-income pregnant women with diabetes to evaluate tool functionality, design, and&#xD;
      interpretability. The investigators will then conduct a phase of individual usability testing&#xD;
      with 20 women, who will use SweetMama for 2 weeks followed by qualitative (interviews) and&#xD;
      quantitative (questionnaires and user interaction data) assessments of tool satisfaction and&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, to perform feasibility testing, the investigators will recruit approximately 40&#xD;
      low-income pregnant women with diabetes to be randomized to either usual care or SweetMama&#xD;
      care, from the beginning of their enrollment at this clinical site for diabetes-specific&#xD;
      prenatal care through the first 8 weeks postpartum. Randomization will be unbalanced to favor&#xD;
      receipt of the intervention. Participants will undergo surveys and interviews at multiple&#xD;
      time points, and those who are randomized to experience SweetMama will undergo an exit&#xD;
      interview. Outcomes will include retention, treatment adherence, functionality of the tool,&#xD;
      and user interactivity with the tool. The expected outcome of the pilot RCT phase is a better&#xD;
      understanding of feasibility of a SweetMama trial via field testing.&#xD;

Women recruited to the pilot RCT phase will enroll in the study upon initiation of prenatal care for diabetes, which could be early in pregnancy at the time of first prenatal visit, or at a later point if they have transferred care to this site. Women randomized to receive SweetMama care will be oriented to use of SweetMama and will then use the intervention (messages, library, goal setting, and appointment reminders) throughout pregnancy and the first 8 weeks postpartum, at which point they will undergo surveys and interviews.</description>

    <description>Women will be oriented to SweetMama use on their own Android- or Apple-based phones. The goals of this phase are to collect data from diverse users that will (1) confirm that the mobile apps are functioning (not crashing) across a wide range of devices and operating systems, (2) provide basic information about app usage and user satisfaction (3) inform the development of future iterations by analyzing participant characteristics and use, and (4) collect quality assurance data that will allow the research team to refine the applications. Women will use SweetMama for 2 weeks, engage in periodic &quot;check-ins&quot; with the research assistant, and participate in a semi-structured interview upon completion of SweetMama usage.</description>
