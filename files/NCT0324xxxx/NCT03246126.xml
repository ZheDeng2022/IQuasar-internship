    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an investigational device called the&#xD;
      ValiantTM Visceral Manifold Thoracoabdominal Stent Graft System for the repair of&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), which is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta (major&#xD;
      artery leading away from your heart) that originates in your chest and extends to your&#xD;
      abdomen and also includes the branch arteries that supply blood to the liver, spleen,&#xD;
      intestine, kidneys and other organs in your abdomen. The word &quot;investigational&quot; means the&#xD;
      device is still being tested and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for sale in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to assess the use of the thoracic&#xD;
      bifurcation and the visceral manifold to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients&#xD;
      having appropriate anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety (i.e. freedom&#xD;
      from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days) and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment&#xD;
      success and technical success) of the device (i.e., the proportion of treatment group&#xD;
      subjects that achieve and maintain treatment success at one year). Additionally, the study&#xD;
      will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up interval.&#xD;

    <description>The Visceral Manifold System is comprised of the Thoracic Bifurcation and Visceral Manifold to treat a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or TAAA. The experimental procedure to implant the stent graft will be done in an operating room and will last anywhere from four to eight hours, but may take longer.</description>
