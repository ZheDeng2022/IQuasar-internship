  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few years, Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) supplements have gradually used on&#xD;
      different groups. From training athletes, maintaining functions of healthy elders to&#xD;
      preventing disabilities of people that can't do intense exercises. BCAAs are now considered&#xD;
      to be able to prevent muscle atrophy and strength loss, also possible to increase strength&#xD;
      and muscle mass if combined with resistance exercises. Stroke patients have difficulties with&#xD;
      moving, which led to multiple disabilities, are more likely to have sarcopenia and strength&#xD;
      loss. Furthermore, reducing the will of moving or walking. Recently, studies showed that&#xD;
      combined BCAAs with resistance exercises can effectively increase muscle mass, thus commonly&#xD;
      used on training athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although aerobic exercises are proven to be more likely to improve walking ability of chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients than traditional rehabilitation, BCAAs' effects are yet to be proven.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore if BCAAs combined with moderate intensity&#xD;
      exercises can prevent muscle atrophy, loss of strength and cardiopulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized control trial. Participants are randomly assigned to either experiment&#xD;
      or control groups. Both group received aerobic exercise (30 min in a session, 3 days a week,&#xD;
      and for 8 weeks). Experiment group received BCAA supplement immediately after the exercise&#xD;
      while the control group receive sham product (vitamins). The outcome measurements (including&#xD;
      muscle mass, functional measures, and quality of life) are performed before (0-wk) and after&#xD;
      (8-wk) the interventions, also after interventions in 3 months and 6 months for follow up.&#xD;

      Setting : inpatient rehabilitation department of Wan-Fang Hospital and Shuang-Ho Hospital&#xD;
      Study population : Patients received inpatient treatment or rehabilitation for stroke in&#xD;
      Wan-Fang Hospital (WFH) and Shuang-Ho Hospital (SHH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: controlled trial with randomization Blinding : The patients were blinded by the&#xD;
      real or sham bcaa supplements. The assessors who performed the outcome measurements were&#xD;
      blinded to the assignment of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements : DXA(Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry),CPET(Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing),6&#xD;
      minute walk test,Timed up and go,Berg balance test,Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale&#xD;
      (SS-QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurements (including the clinical and corticomotor excitability assessments) are&#xD;
      performed by one researcher who are responsible for the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and side effect. The compliance of supplements were investigated. The attendance&#xD;
      of treatments (including bcaa supplements and physical therapy sessions) and possible side&#xD;
      effect/discomfort were recorded during the interventions by a researcher. He also tries to&#xD;
      understand the reason of drop-out from the study.&#xD;
