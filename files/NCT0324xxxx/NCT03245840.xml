    <textblock>
      This is a continuation study of Budesonide Oral Suspension (BOS) in adults and adolescents&#xD;
      with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) who have completed participation in the SHP621-302&#xD;
      extension study. The purpose of this study is to see if BOS is safe and well tolerated over&#xD;
      the long-term in adolescents and adults with EoE.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant completed the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) extension study and is considered&#xD;
             by the investigator to potentially benefit from continued BOS investigational&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is able to provide written informed consent (participant, parent or legal&#xD;
             guardian and, as appropriate, participant assent) to participate in the study before&#xD;
             completing any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to continue acceptable birth control&#xD;
             measures (example (e.g.): abstinence, surgically sterile male partner, stable oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, or double-barrier methods) throughout study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing and has an understanding and ability to fully comply with study&#xD;
             procedures and restrictions as defined in protocol.&#xD;

          -  Participant anticipates using swallowed topical corticosteroid for EoE or systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid for any condition during the treatment period; any temporary use (less&#xD;
             than or equal to [≤] 7 days) or initiation of new steroid treatment during the study&#xD;
             should be documented and discussed with the medical monitor prospectively but should&#xD;
             be avoided within 4 weeks of the scheduled esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDs).&#xD;

             achalasia, or parasitic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis that failed to respond to&#xD;
             previous treatment. Diagnosis with oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis at or since&#xD;
             the final treatment evaluation visit (Visit 8) of the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study&#xD;
             is not an exclusion as long as the participant is expected to respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a potentially serious acute or chronic infection or immunodeficiency&#xD;
             condition, including tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral/parasite infection, ocular&#xD;
             herpes simplex, or chicken pox/measles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has upper gastrointestinal bleeding identified at the EGD at the final&#xD;
             treatment evaluation visit (Visit 8) of the SHP621-302 (NCT02736409) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has evidence of active infection with Helicobacter pylori.&#xD;
