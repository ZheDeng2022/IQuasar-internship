      To determine the clinical effectiveness of combined use of pre-emptive analgesia and long&#xD;
      acting anesthesia for pain suppression following dental implant surgery as measured by a&#xD;
      validated numerical rating scale and the information related to consumption of post-operative&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental practitioners often prescribe opioids for the relief of moderate - severe acute&#xD;
      post-operative pain.1 There is evidence that alternative approaches, such as the use of long&#xD;
      acting local anesthetics along with the combination of non-opioid analgesics such as&#xD;
      acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may prevent the need for&#xD;
      opioid medications. With the current national opioid overdose epidemic, government officials&#xD;
      have introduced new prescribing recommendations for the management of acute pain. Dentists&#xD;
      can play a role to address this epidemic by wider recognition and adoption of the new&#xD;
      prescribing recommendations for fast acting pre-emptive non-opioid analgesics to prevent&#xD;
      acute dental pain.2 Dentists are the fifth leading prescribers of opioids among health care&#xD;
      professionals accounting for 12% of the total immediate-release opioids prescribed in the&#xD;
      United States (U.S).3 With the increasing trends of opioid prescribing for dental surgeries&#xD;
      in the past few decades, dental implant procedures hold the highest increasing rate for&#xD;
      opioid prescribing.4 In the U.S alone, there has been as many as 183,000 prescription opioid&#xD;
      overdose related deaths from 1999 to 2015. Since 1999, the mortality rate from opioid&#xD;
      overdose has more than quadrupled.5 With more than 650,000 opioid prescriptions being&#xD;
      dispensed daily in the U.S,6 there has been a national call to alter the current prescribing&#xD;
      patterns of opioids to ensure appropriate indications and patient selection.7 There are&#xD;
      multiple adverse effects that may develop from opioid pain medications: nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      constipation, dizziness, headache.8 However, two major concerns associated with the excessive&#xD;
      prescribing of opioids are overdosing leading to life threatening respiratory depression&#xD;
      problems and the creation of an environment that fosters the development of opioid&#xD;
      dependency, abuse and addiction.8 The U.S. Senate passed the 'Comprehensive Addiction and&#xD;
      Recovery Act' of 2016 to combat the opioid epidemic.9 This legislation is designed to prevent&#xD;
      opioid-related morbidity and misuse via physician and patient education, risk awareness,&#xD;
      proper prescribing practices, and efforts to improve safer handling of prescription opioids.9&#xD;
      NSAIDs are widely used for their anti-inflammatory, pain and fever reducing properties. In&#xD;
      the periphery, these drugs interfere with the formation of pro-inflammatory modulating&#xD;
      prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 via reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes&#xD;
      (Cox-1 and Cox-2). NSAIDs exact their effects through a variety of peripheral and central&#xD;
      mechanisms. Their efficacy in the reduction of post-operative pain has been widely&#xD;
      documented.10 It has been demonstrated that a single dose of an NSAID (i.e. etoricoxib,&#xD;
      ketoprofen, diclofenac potassium, diflunisan, ibuprofen) may provide better acute&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia than some commonly prescribed single dose opioids, even when they&#xD;
      are prescribed in combination with other NSAIDs.10 There is also sound evidence that some&#xD;
      individuals receive synergistic analgesic effects when NSAIDs are combined with&#xD;
      acetaminophen.11 However, these effects can vary, as not everyone will achieve adequate pain&#xD;
      relief even from the most potent drugs. Simple drug combinations of fast acting&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories with acetaminophen can reliably provide successful analgesia for many&#xD;
      acute pain patients in reasonably low doses.10 While modern dental literature contains&#xD;
      numerous articles that support the tolerability, safety and efficacy of NSAIDs, many dental&#xD;
      practices continue to prescribe opioids in cases which would likely respond better to other&#xD;
      analgesics. Many dentists still underrate the risks and abuse of opioids. That is why it is&#xD;
      important to design and test more lucid protocols for prescribing analgesics in dental care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of post-operative pain in periodontal and dental implant surgery can vary between&#xD;
      mild to severe 12,13 and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be adverse at times.14&#xD;
      There is evidence that straightforward implant placement procedure is a surgical procedure&#xD;
      associated with relatively low postoperative pain and pain management following dental&#xD;
      implants is usually achieved by the use of drugs such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or&#xD;
      opioids.11,15 Pre-emptive analgesia refers to the reduction of pain severity that occurs&#xD;
      post-operatively by suppressing pain pre-emptively prior to the performance of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure.16,17 Previous studies have shown the rationale and efficacy of using pre-emptive&#xD;
      analgesia in periodontal and oral surgical models.18-25 Long acting local anesthetics such as&#xD;
      bupivacaine have been shown to prolong the onset of and suppress postoperative pain better&#xD;
      than lidocaine, an intermediate duration anesthetic.26,27 With successful pre-emptive&#xD;
      analgesia including NSAIDs and long acting local anesthetics, the need for stronger&#xD;
      post-operative analgesics, like opioids, may be significantly decreased.&#xD;
