      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PRIMARY: Using a randomized, parallel group design, this investigation will determine if&#xD;
           the combination of 2-weeks polyphenol supplementation (using the Reoxcyn flavonoid&#xD;
           supplement in capsule form) and one acute 45-minute brisk walking bout enhances the&#xD;
           translocation of gut-derived phenolics into the circulation. A comparator group of&#xD;
           runners (N=20) ingesting the flavonoid supplement for two weeks will be included (2.5 h&#xD;
           run, 70% VO2max).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SECONDARY: Data from this study will determine if 2-weeks supplementation of the Reoxcyn&#xD;
           flavonoid supplement is a sufficient time period to increase circulating levels of&#xD;
           gut-derived phenolics, extending data collected from the previous 12-week community&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that an acute 45-minute brisk walking exercise bout (60% VO2max)&#xD;
      following 2 weeks of increased polyphenol intake will be a sufficient exercise stimulus to&#xD;
      increase gut permeability and the movement of gut-derived phenolics into circulation. If this&#xD;
      hypothesis is confirmed, these data would have broad public health appeal, demonstrating that&#xD;
      the combination of brisk walking and increased polyphenol intake augments circulating levels&#xD;
      of health-restoring small phenolic molecules derived from bacterial breakdown in the colon.&#xD;

      Research Design: Study participants (N=85) will be entered into the study and randomized to&#xD;
      the flavonoid or placebo supplement groups for 2 weeks, with these two independent groups run&#xD;
      in parallel (with N=80 anticipated to successfully complete all study phases). Supplements&#xD;
      will be administered in a double-blinded manner in capsule form. Study participants will&#xD;
      report to the research facility for baseline testing and orientation, and then pre-study and&#xD;
      after 2-weeks supplementation, and then again 24 hour later. Four blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected as shown in the Figure (pre- and post-supplementation, post-exercise/rest, and&#xD;
      24-hour post-exercise/rest). When reporting to the lab after 2-weeks supplementation, study&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either sit or walk briskly on treadmills for 45 minutes. A&#xD;
      comparator group of 20 runners ingesting the flavonoid supplement and running 2.5 h in the&#xD;
      lab will be included to allow a comparison between moderate and intense exertion (and to&#xD;
      provide pilot data for a future study). Baseline Testing: One to two weeks before the start&#xD;
      of the study, study participants (walkers and runner) will be given an orientation to the&#xD;
      study and then provide voluntary consent. Instructions will be given for recording all food&#xD;
      and beverage intake in 3-day food logs (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday prior to starting&#xD;
      supplementation). Demographic and training histories will be acquired with questionnaires.&#xD;
      Height, body weight, and percent body fat (seca Medical Body Composition Analyzer 514&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance scale, Hanover, MD) will be measured. VO2max will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Bruce's treadmill protocol, with oxygen consumption and ventilation continuously&#xD;
      monitored using the Cosmed CPET metabolic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Supplementation Lab Visit: On the first day of the study, participants (walkers and&#xD;
      runners) will return to the lab in a fasted state (9 or more hours with no food or beverage&#xD;
      other than water). Blood samples will be taken from an antecubital vein with subjects in the&#xD;
      seated position. Participants (walkers) will be given a 2-week supply of flavonoid or placebo&#xD;
      capsules organized into supplement trays to facilitate compliance. Runners will be given a&#xD;
      2-week supply of flavonoid capsules. The 3-day food record will be reviewed and collected by&#xD;
      the research team, and analyzed for nutrient and flavonoid content using the Food Processor&#xD;
      v. 11.1 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR). Each food/beverage will be assessed for macro- and&#xD;
      micro-nutrients, total flavonoids and subtotals for each of the six flavonoid subclasses, and&#xD;
      two individual flavonoid values (quercetin, EGCG). During the 2-day period prior to visit #3&#xD;
      to the lab, and during the entire day that includes visit #3, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      avoid food and beverages containing sucralose (Splenda) and mannitol. To avoid sucralose and&#xD;
      mannitol, participants will be asked to check ingredient lists for diet sodas, yogurt and&#xD;
      other dairy products, snack foods, chewing gum and candy, low-sugar products, toothpaste, and&#xD;
      mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Supplementation Lab Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 2-week supplementation period, participants (walkers and runners) will return to&#xD;
      the lab in an overnight fasted state (on the same day of the week as the pre-supplementation&#xD;
      lab visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will turn in the supplement tray to verify compliance with ingesting the&#xD;
      capsules. A blood sample will be collected. Participants (walkers) will be randomized to&#xD;
      either sit for 45 minutes in the lab or to walk briskly for 45 minutes on a 5% graded&#xD;
      treadmill at 60% VO2max (with metabolic monitoring during the first 5 minutes, and then at&#xD;
      15, 30, and 45 minutes) using the Cosmed CPET metabolic cart. Runners will run at 70% VO2max&#xD;
      on an ungraded treadmill for 2.5 h, with metabolic measurements made every 30 minutes. Water&#xD;
      will be given ad libitum for all participants, with no other beverage or food allowed. Just&#xD;
      prior to the sitting or walking lab sessions, and the 2.5 h run, participants will consume a&#xD;
      150-ml solution containing 1 g sucrose, 1 g lactulose, 0.5 g L-rhamnose, 1 g erythritol, 1 g&#xD;
      sucralose, 0.5 g mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected in plastic containers for 24 h in two separate fractions: 0-5 h and&#xD;
      5-24 h. No eating or drinking (except tap water) will be allowed during the first 5-h urine&#xD;
      collection. Participants will return the next morning in an overnight fasted state, provide a&#xD;
      blood sample, and turn in urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collection guidelines to the subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You should collect every drop of urine during each collection period (5 hours from the&#xD;
           start of the exercise bout, and then the second collection lasting to the next morning&#xD;
           or 5 to 24 h from the start of exercise). It does not matter how much or little urine is&#xD;
           passed each time, as long as every drop is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect every drop of urine during the day and night in the two collection bottles (0-5&#xD;
           hours, 5-24 hours, beginning with the start of the lab exercise test session). Store the&#xD;
           bottles in the refrigerator. Be sure to collect any urine passed during bowel movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finish by collecting the first urine passed the next morning, adding it to the&#xD;
           collection bottle. Bring both urine collection bottles with you to the lab (i.e., the&#xD;
           morning after the exercise session when you will provide your final blood sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flavonoid Supplement: Supplement and placebo capsules will be prepared by Reoxcyn Innovation&#xD;
      Group LLC (Salt Lake City, UT). (SEE supplementation information in attached file).&#xD;
      Ingredients will be the same as tested in the community trial: vitamin C (as ascorbyl&#xD;
      palmitate) (Green Wave Ingredients, La Mirada, CA), wild bilberry fruit extract (25% total&#xD;
      anthocyanins) (FutureCeuticals, Momence, IL), green tea leaf extract (50% EGCG) (Watson&#xD;
      Industries, Inc., Pomona, CA), quercetin aglycone (Novel Ingredients, East Hanover, NJ),&#xD;
      caffeine (Creative Compounds, Scott City, MO), and omega 3 fatty acids (Novotech&#xD;
      Nutraceuticals, Ventura, CA). Capsule fill ingredients and excipients include Nu-Flow 70R&#xD;
      (from rice hulls), tapioca from cassava root, natural bamboo silica, marshmallow root.&#xD;
      Placebo capsules will contain only the fill ingredients and excipients (without the active&#xD;
      ingredients). The daily serving for the walkers will be 2 flavonoid or 2 placebo capsules.&#xD;
      Two flavonoid capsules provides 329 mg flavonoids (American adult average, depending on the&#xD;
      study, is 240 mg per day). The daily serving for the runners will be 4 flavonoid capsules&#xD;
      (658 mg flavonoids). Participants will be given a 2-week supply of the either the flavonoid&#xD;
      or placebo capsules, with instructions on how to consume daily in split doses (1 with&#xD;
      breakfast and 1 with lunch, or double that amount for the runners). Study participants will&#xD;
      be allowed to add one extra capsule per day to increase consumption if one or two days of&#xD;
      taking the supplement are missed. Study participants will ingest 2 capsules (4 for the&#xD;
      runners) just after providing the blood sample during the walk/rest (or run) lab session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUPPLEMENT CAPSULES will be TESTED for flavonoid content pre- and post-study by Dr. Mary Ann&#xD;
      Lila (NCSU, Plants for Human Health Institute, NCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Metabolomics Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut-derived phenolic metabolites will be purified from plasma by SPE using an automated&#xD;
      platform and in-house 96-well SPE protocol (60mg, 3mL; Phenomenex) for extraction of 100 μL&#xD;
      tissue. All analytes have been previously optimized for extraction efficiencies of between&#xD;
      80-100% recoveries with CV≤10%. Extracts will be separated and quantified via liquid&#xD;
      chromatography tandem-MS/MS involving previously published and validated methodologies.&#xD;
      Briefly, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis will be performed using a SCIEX UPLC coupled 6500 +&#xD;
      MS/MS-QTRAP™ equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) Turbo-V source (blood and fecal&#xD;
      metabolites), with samples injected onto a Kinetex PFP column and mobile phase gradient&#xD;
      consisted of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile&#xD;
      (B), and a 24 min separation time. The targeted metabolite analysis protocol has been&#xD;
      optimized and validated to detect greater than 200 analytes which are quantified relative to&#xD;
      authentic commercial and synthetic standards in our library, with putative Phase II&#xD;
      conjugates identified using fragmentation profiling involving 3-5 unique transitions. This&#xD;
      involves scanning over 1000 transitions corresponding to sulfate, glucuronide, methyl and&#xD;
      glycine conjugates. This SMRM methodology was previously optimized for the Rexocyn treatment&#xD;
      and provides a significantly more sensitive method than traditional multiple reaction&#xD;
      monitoring (MRM) scanning procedures, as it permits monitoring a greater number of&#xD;
      transitions per unit of time, in addition to allowing unique compound-dependent parameters to&#xD;
      be utilized for each analyte, resulting in enhanced sensitivity. Finally, metabolites will be&#xD;
      confirmed on the basis of retention time (using authentic and synthesized standards where&#xD;
      possible) and three or more precursor-to-product ion transitions. Seven-point matrix-matched&#xD;
      calibration curves ranging from 0 to 10 μM will be used for the analysis of flavonoids or&#xD;
      from 0 to 50 μM for the analysis of phenolic metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal Permeability, Urine Lactulose/Rhamnose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sugar concentrations will be determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Sucrose&#xD;
      in 0-5-h urine, lactulose/rhamnose (L/R) ratio in 0-5-h urine, and sucralose/erythritol (S/E)&#xD;
      ratio in 5-24-h urine will be used as indicators for gastroduodenal, small and large&#xD;
      intestine permeability, respectively.&#xD;
