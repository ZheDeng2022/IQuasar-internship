  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate whether the administration of the stimulant modafinil during a&#xD;
      40 hour sleep deprivation period in depressed patients can intensify the antidepressant&#xD;
      effect of the sleep deprivation as assessed by a reduction in the Hamilton Depression score&#xD;
      (HAMD, 6-item version). We postulate that this also correlates with a reduction of the&#xD;
      polysomnographically assessed overall amount of sleep during this period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In about 60 % of depressed patients, sleep deprivation has an acute therapeutic effect. The&#xD;
      effect appears within very few hours; this is different from all other antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments. However, in most cases patients relapse after the subsequent night's sleep (Wu &amp;&#xD;
      Bunney 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antidepressant mechanism of action of sleep deprivation is not known as yet; several&#xD;
      hypotheses are presented and discussed in various review articles (Wiegand 1995; Kasper &amp;&#xD;
      Möller 1996; Wirz-Justice &amp; van den Hoofdakker 1999; Gillin et al. 2001; Ringel &amp; Szuba 2001;&#xD;
      Giedke &amp; Schwärzler 2002). At present, the following general hypotheses are most discussed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep deprivation exerts its effect by activating or intensifying an antidepressant&#xD;
           &quot;pro-cess&quot;. This &quot;process&quot; may be dopaminergic or serotonergic transmission, thyroid&#xD;
           function etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sleep deprivation inactivates a hypothetic &quot;depressiogenic&quot; substance which is produced&#xD;
           during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep deprivation reduces the central nervous cholinergic transmitter activity and&#xD;
           restores the balance between cholinergic and aminergic transmitter systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sleep deprivation acts by preventing sleep during a &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; phase of&#xD;
           circadian rhythms; there are various chronobiological assumptions which can specify such&#xD;
           a &quot;critical phase&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies tried to indentify predictors of response to sleep deprivation in order to&#xD;
      clarify the mechanism of action. Among clinical predictors is a symptom pattern with&#xD;
      &quot;endogenous&quot; or &quot;melancholic&quot; traits and the presence of pronounced diurnal variations of&#xD;
      mood, and a behaviour pattern pointing to an elevated level of arousal or activity. Another&#xD;
      predictor is a pronounced sleep disturbance during the baseline night. Among the many&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and neurohumoral factors which have been studied, only elevated thyroid&#xD;
      hormones turned out to be a predictor for response to sleep deprivation. PET and SPECT&#xD;
      studies have convergently demonstrated an elevated metabolism in parts of the limbic system&#xD;
      (e.g., the anterior cingulum) at baseline in responders. These findings do not yet allow&#xD;
      conclusions with respect to the neurotransmitter systems involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wiegand et al. (1993) investigated whether scheduled daytime naps can induce relapses after&#xD;
      successful sleep deprivation therapy. The timing of the nap turned out to be a crucial&#xD;
      factor; nap sleep duration and sleep structure during naps were less important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of studies in this field suffers from a methodological problem: there is no&#xD;
      objective continuous polysomnographic measurement of sleep. The continuous absence of sleep&#xD;
      during the sleep deprivation period is thus not documented. It is known from sleep&#xD;
      deprivation studies in healthy probands that during prolonged sleep deprivation, short sleep&#xD;
      episodes (&quot;microsleep&quot;) occur frequently. Hemmeter et al. (1998) were the first to&#xD;
      demonstrate that also in depressed patients undergoing sleep deprivation, microsleep occurs&#xD;
      and tends to prevent the antidepressant effect. Data from a recently finished study of our&#xD;
      group point into the same direction (partly published in Wiegand et al. 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further elucidate this question, an experimental procedure appears useful where the&#xD;
      occurrence of sleep episodes during the sleep deprivation period is suppressed as far as&#xD;
      possible by the vigilance enhancing drug modafinil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate whether the administration of modafinil or placebo during a 40&#xD;
      hour sleep deprivation period in depressed patients can intensify the antidepressant effect&#xD;
      of the sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a basic science study that aims to provide information on the therapeutic&#xD;
      mechanism of sleep deprivation in depression and on the reoccurence of depressive symptoms in&#xD;
      case of intermittent short sleep episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant reduction on the HAMD-6 scale between baseline and 24 h later (at the&#xD;
      mornings before and after one night of sleep deprivation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The amount of &quot;responders&quot; (50% of reduction on the HAMD-6 scale) is significantly&#xD;
           greater in the modafinil than in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The primary hypothesis and the first secondary hypothesis are also assessed by a&#xD;
           self-rating scale of global mental state (Befindlichkeitsskala (Bf-s)) and by the&#xD;
           Stanford Sleepiness Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The overall amount of sleep assessed by polysomnography is smaller in the modafinil&#xD;
           group as compared to the placebo group during the 40 h sleep deprivation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The group differences in HAMD-6 ratings are parralleled by differences in the overall&#xD;
           amount of sleep during the 40 h sleep deprivation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There are group differences (Modafinil versus Placebo) on a comprehensive&#xD;
           neuropsychological battery taken at baseline and 24 h later (at the mornings before and&#xD;
           after one night of sleep deprivation)&#xD;
