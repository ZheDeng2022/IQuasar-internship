      The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety, not inferiority clinical and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profile of the drug Enoxaparin Sodium produced by laboratory Blausiegel when&#xD;
      compared with Clexane product, produced by Laboratory Sanofi-Aventis in 60 patients with&#xD;
      Chronic Renal Desease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is a filtering and cleaning process of endogenous and exogenous metabolic blood&#xD;
      products. The level control of anticoagulants in patients with chronic renal disease is&#xD;
      indispensable. Evidence of clotting as TTPa and evidence of activity of anti-factor Xa should&#xD;
      be used as a substrate to protect these patients, undergoing dialysis. The Enoxaparin sodium&#xD;
      is one that acts as antithrombin-factor Xa inhibitor of acting directly on the inactivation&#xD;
      of antithrombin. Thus, small-chain molecules (low molecular weight) as Enoxaparin show&#xD;
      fundamentally anti-Xa high end and low end antitrombotic. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, not inferiority clinical and pharmacodynamic profile of the drug Enoxaparin&#xD;
      Sodium produced by laboratory Blausiegel when compared with Clexane product, produced by&#xD;
      Laboratory Sanofi-Aventis in 60 patients with Chronic Renal Desease. The study was kind of&#xD;
      parallel, randomized, double-blind and systematic sampling. The drugs were administered&#xD;
      during 12 consecutive dialysis sessions at a dose of 1 mg / kg. The activity of the drugs was&#xD;
      verified by the strength of markers TTPa and anti-Xa and security was seen through adverse&#xD;
      reactions and the evaluation function of capillaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted 60 patients with chronic renal desease to both sexes, above 18 years&#xD;
      aged, who were carrying out haemodialysis treatment during 3 times a week and satisfied&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. The investigational products were randomly administered to patients in 12&#xD;
      consecutive dialysis sessions, at a dose of 1 mg / kg. The primary endpoint was safety of&#xD;
      using the drug evaluated by monitoring events as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of blood clotting by the system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood coagulation and loss of capillary vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombus of capillary in 3 sessions of monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in the patient's hematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint was evaluation of non inferiority clinic, observed over the criteria&#xD;
      in maintaining the non-coagulation of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis and the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic curve effect of enoxaparin sodium verified by the strength of markers TTPa,&#xD;
      anti-Xa and anti-IIa.&#xD;
