  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect and safety of two different&#xD;
      doses of PZ-601 and to compare this with another antibiotic that is approved by the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (also known as FDA) to treat adults with skin and skin structure&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PZ-601 is a novel investigational carbapenem antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum of&#xD;
      activity that includes pathogens responsible for community-acquired bacterial infections as&#xD;
      well as multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens - MRSA and vancomycin-resistant&#xD;
      enterococci. PZ-601 also has activity against Gram-negative organisms including cephalosporin&#xD;
      and quinolone resistant Enterobacteriaceae as well as Bacteriodes fragilis and&#xD;
      peptostreptococci. Based on the antimicrobial profile, PZ-601 is a potentially promising&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.&#xD;
