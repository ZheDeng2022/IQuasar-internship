  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is one of the first causes of morbidity-mortality in industrialized&#xD;
      countries. Numerous works suggest that some infectious agents could be involved in the&#xD;
      inflammatory process leading to the development of this pathology, such as Chlamydophila&#xD;
      pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus. Enteroviruses are small RNA viruses that&#xD;
      have been incriminated in various acute or chronic cardiac diseases (pericarditis,&#xD;
      myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy) and exhibit a tropism for vascular endothelia. Different&#xD;
      clinical and experimental arguments suggest that they could play a cofactor role in the&#xD;
      occurrence or maintenance of atherosclerosis lesions. A multicenter study developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with colleagues of the University Hospital of Reims (France) showed that it was&#xD;
      frequent to detect enterovirus RNA in cardiac biopsies from patients with myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Furthermore, a pilot study conducted in the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne&#xD;
      (France) on atheromatous arterial samples from 18 patients allowed the detection of&#xD;
      enterovirus RNA in 20% of them.&#xD;

      Objective: In order to complete these data and to answer clearly to the question of the role&#xD;
      of persistent infection by enteroviruses in atherosclerosis, we propose this research program&#xD;
      involving the Departments of Vascular Surgery of three University hospitals of the&#xD;
      &quot;Rhône-Alpes&quot; region and of three laboratories of Virology interested by the relationship&#xD;
      between chronic diseases and enterovirus infection..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: It is projected to include about one hundred voluntary adults exhibiting carotid&#xD;
      atheromatous lesions requiring a surgical removal. Because of the difficulty to define a&#xD;
      pertinent control group, each patient will be his/her own control. In addition to the&#xD;
      fragment of pathologic carotid, it will be taken arterial and venous fragments from vessels&#xD;
      that are never the seat of atherosclerosis lesions. To reach the best sensitivity,&#xD;
      enterovirus RNA will be detected by nested RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria: The main evaluation criterion will be the percentage of detection of&#xD;
      enterovirus RNA by RT-PCR in atheromatous lesions by comparison to control arteries by&#xD;
      Mac-Nemar test. These results will be correlated to anatomic and histological lesions of the&#xD;
      atheromatous plaques. Other markers will be analysed secondarily: detection of enterovirus&#xD;
      RNA in control venous samples, detection of stigmata of viral replication by immunochemistry&#xD;
      or detection of negative RNA strands, analysis of the antibody response to enterovirus in&#xD;
      blood, molecular typing of enteroviruses detected in the lesions… Expected benefits: This&#xD;
      study should allow to better understand the putative involvement of enteroviruses in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis-linked diseases. If the hypothesis of a relationship was confirmed, a more&#xD;
      ambitious research project would be proposed in order to investigate the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      enterovirus can favour atherosclerosis and to discuss the opportunity of preventive&#xD;
      strategies (notably vaccination) to reduce the risk.&#xD;
