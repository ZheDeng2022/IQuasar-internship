  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate subjectively reported treatment effects of&#xD;
      ramelteon, once daily (QD), in adults with chronic insomnia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, or complaints of&#xD;
      non-restorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third&#xD;
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples&#xD;
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were&#xD;
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;&#xD;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the&#xD;
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the&#xD;
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep&#xD;
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramelteon is under global development by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the treatment&#xD;
      of transient and chronic insomnia and for the treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to assess the treatment effects of ramelteon in adults through&#xD;
      the use of daily entry of information into an interactive voice response system. Study&#xD;
      participation in this study is anticipated to be about 1 month.&#xD;
