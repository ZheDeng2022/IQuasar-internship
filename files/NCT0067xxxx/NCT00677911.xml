      Summary: Chronic pain is stressful, both physically and psychologically. Stressful&#xD;
      experiences induce autonomic nervous system arousal, which reliably leads to inflammation and&#xD;
      immune suppression. Inflammation then exacerbates existing pain and may be a key factor in&#xD;
      both the genesis and maintenance of pain. Stress-induced immune effects are detected two&#xD;
      hours (2 hrs) post-stressor, suggesting only a few stressful experiences per day may be&#xD;
      sufficient to sustain elevated pain levels1. Cognition has emerged as a potential mediating&#xD;
      factor in the relationship between pain and stress. Mentally recreating an emotionally&#xD;
      stressful event induces de novo physiological stress1. In other words, thinking about an&#xD;
      emotionally charged event down-regulates autonomic stress responses and subsequent immune&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, exploring cognition as a mediating factor between stress, pain, and&#xD;
      inflammation will inform our understanding of pain pathways, as well as improve treatment for&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: The acute stress response induces immunosuppression; however, this&#xD;
      relationship has been studied in arbitrary models only (shock avoidance, job interview). This&#xD;
      study employs the novel approach of examining stress and immune responses to a personally&#xD;
      relevant stressor (pain); prior studies used arbitrary models only (shock avoidance, job&#xD;
      interview). Pain offers a highly salient and personal context well-suited for investigation&#xD;
      of negative cognitive perseveration. Pain is acutely sensitive to exacerbation via&#xD;
      inflammation, and thus the relevance of examining immune effects of rumination on future&#xD;
      negative expectations (&quot;expecting the worst&quot;) is underscored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: To test the biological consequences of negative expectations, achieved via an active&#xD;
      10-minute negative cognitive perseveration on a personally relevant stressor: future&#xD;
      worsening of one's chronic pain condition. Biological stress response will be measured via&#xD;
      heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and serum cortisol. Impact of negative cognition on&#xD;
      inflammation will be measured using interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) as biomarkers of immune function, controlling for depression&#xD;
      and pain catastrophizing. This study aims to inform the understanding of pain mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the magnitude of an autonomic stress response to an induction of negative&#xD;
      cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine immune effects of the experiment-induced stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Establish whether a pre-existing tendency to catastrophize mediates the relationship&#xD;
      between experiment-induced negative perseveration and immune effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Establish whether stress-related increases in IL-6 remain elevated post 2 hrs.&#xD;

      Methods: This prospective study examines the magnitude of biological stress and subsequent&#xD;
      immunologic changes in response to negative cognitive perseveration. Five physiological&#xD;
      measurement time points occur over the course of the 3 hour experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and health characteristics of interest: gender, marital status, smoking status,&#xD;
      education level, race, height, weight, body mass index, medical comorbidity, psychological&#xD;
      comorbidity, medications (for inflammation, pain, or psychiatric conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusionary Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt;18 years of age; &lt;65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-inflammatory musculoskeletal patients presenting for evaluation at Oregon Health &amp;&#xD;
           Science University (OHSU) Comprehensive Pain Center (CPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusionary Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active or recent virus/infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thought disorder, Suicidality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substance Abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active corticosteroid regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limited venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Former intravenous drug user&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: All persons presenting for evaluation at the CPC who meet study criteria will be&#xD;
      offered the option to participate in the study. Approximately 60 new pain patients are&#xD;
      evaluated by psychology monthly and we expect to obtain our goal of 40 participants within 6&#xD;
      months. Informed consent will be obtained in compliance with OHSU Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      protocol. Subjects will receive $100 gift certificate compensation, even if they fail to&#xD;
      complete the study. We anticipate a low completion failure rate as the study is completed in&#xD;
      one 3-hour time block. Study times will be standardized to account for circadian effects.&#xD;
      Participants will be told to arrive having eaten a light breakfast with minimal caffeine&#xD;
      consumption (e.g., less than 2 cups of coffee). They will be given a subject number and their&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnoses will be blinded to prevent bias. The study involves gathering 5 serum&#xD;
      samples and thus participants will be catheterized by nursing staff to minimize physiological&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study site: The study will be conducted at the NIH-funded General Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      (GCRC). The GCRC provides state of the art resources including research space, specialized&#xD;
      research nurses to perform blood draws and gather biodata, biostatisticians, and&#xD;
      sophisticated laboratories to perform serum biomarker analysis. OHSU's GCRC is Oregon's&#xD;
      premier multidisciplinary patient-oriented research facility and is housed in the same&#xD;
      building as the CPC, thus minimizing travel burden on participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Stress Induction: Negative Cognitive Perseveration On their experiment day,&#xD;
      participants will interface with a licensed clinical psychologist who did not perform their&#xD;
      clinical interview and who is blinded to their diagnoses. The psychologist will instruct the&#xD;
      participant talk for 10 minutes about the worst aspects of their pain, to discuss their loss&#xD;
      of control over their situation, the negative impact pain has had on their life and others.&#xD;
      They will be guided to imagine that their situation will progressively worsen, and to focus&#xD;
      on how badly they will feel as a result. Two measures of induction efficacy will be given:&#xD;
      subjective verbal rating (0-10) and objective rating by attending psychologist (0-10). The&#xD;
      intervention ends at 10 minutes and the remainder of the study involves biodata measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study ends at 2.5 hrs post induction following the final blood draw. The psychologist will&#xD;
      debrief subjects and will assess their affective state. Their subjective units of distress&#xD;
      will be checked. Persons who are in a continued negative cognitive state will receive 30&#xD;
      minutes of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) by the on-site psychologist. Care will be taken&#xD;
      not to allow participants to leave the study site in distress. Participants will receive&#xD;
      follow up psychology care at the CPC as indicated in their treatment plan.&#xD;
