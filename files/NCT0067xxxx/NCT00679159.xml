    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of the TB vaccine MVA85A in healthy children&#xD;
      and infants in South Africa. A single vaccination with MVA85A has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      highly immunogenic in a wide range of subjects in previous clinical trials. In this trial,we&#xD;
      will vaccinate 24 children with 5 x 10^7pfu of MVA85A and three groups of 36 infants with 2.5&#xD;
      x 10^7, 5 x 10^7 or 1 x 10^8 pfu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified from the general population living in Worcester, Western&#xD;
      Cape, South Africa&#xD;

    <textblock>
      M.tb is an intracellular organism and protective immunity is dependent on an intact cellular&#xD;
      immune system. Both Class II-restricted CD4+ and Class I-restricted CD8+ T lymphocytes are&#xD;
      important for protection. Gamma delta cells and non-classically restricted T cells such as&#xD;
      CD1-restricted T cells may also play a protective role but knowledge of how to induce these&#xD;
      to protective levels by vaccination is very limited. Although several vaccine delivery&#xD;
      systems are capable of inducing T cells, e.g. protein/adjuvant combinations, DNA vaccines and&#xD;
      recombinant viral vectors, when used alone these delivery systems induce only low-level&#xD;
      responses. Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategies involve immunizing with 2 two&#xD;
      different vaccines, each expressing the same antigen, several weeks apart. These strategies&#xD;
      induce higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than homologous boosting in animal models of&#xD;
      malaria, HIV and TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A). When used in&#xD;
      heterologous prime-boost strategies, some viral vectors are very good at boosting previously&#xD;
      primed T cell responses, particularly recombinant adenoviral constructs and recombinant pox&#xD;
      viruses. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated strain of vaccinia virus that&#xD;
      has been passaged more than 500 times through chick embryo fibroblasts and as a consequence&#xD;
      has lost both host range genes and cytokine receptor genes. MVA has an excellent safety&#xD;
      record, as it was used to vaccinate more than 120,000 people at the end of the smallpox&#xD;
      eradication campaign, with no serious adverse events. In humans, several hundred HIV negative&#xD;
      volunteers have now been immunized with recombinant MVAs expressing a number of different&#xD;
      antigens, with no serious adverse events. A recombinant MVA expressing an antigen from&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum has been demonstrated to boost CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in humans.&#xD;
      Recombinant MVAs are now in clinical trials for several infectious diseases including HIV,&#xD;
      hepatitis B and malaria. Importantly, for a new TB vaccine, the safety of MVA as a viral&#xD;
      vector has now been demonstrated in HIV positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including BCG in such heterologous prime-boost regimes allows for the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      BCG to be retained. We have developed an immunisation strategy using BCG as the priming&#xD;
      immunisation and a recombinant MVA (rMVA) as the boost. The antigen selected for inclusion in&#xD;
      the rMVA must be present in all strains of BCG. We have selected Antigen 85A, which forms&#xD;
      part of the immunodominant antigen 85 complex. Although there are numerous candidate antigens&#xD;
      for use in a TB vaccine, antigen 85A has long been considered a leading choice. It is a major&#xD;
      target antigen recognised by T cells from infected individuals and it is protective as a DNA&#xD;
      vaccine in small animals. Importantly, for use in BCG prime-MVA boost regimes, it is highly&#xD;
      conserved amongst all mycobacterial species and is present in all strains of BCG. In small&#xD;
      animals it is a major target of the immune responses induced by BCG and in humans HLA-A2&#xD;
      restricted CD8 T cells have been found in a high proportion of BCG-immunised individuals.&#xD;
      Antigen 85A is an enzyme, mycolyl transferase, which is involved in cell wall biosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical data Using this BCG prime-MVA85A boost in BALB/c mice induces higher levels of&#xD;
      both antigen specific interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secreting CD4 T and CD8+ T cells and higher&#xD;
      levels of protection than after BCG alone. This regime has now been further evaluated in the&#xD;
      more sensitive guinea pig aerosol challenge model with very encouraging results. Guinea pigs&#xD;
      vaccinated with BCG, followed by MVA85A, and then further boosted with a second recombinant&#xD;
      viral vector, fowlpox, expressing antigen 85A (FP85A) showed significantly greater protection&#xD;
      against challenge than guinea pigs vaccinated with BCG alone. This regime is also immunogenic&#xD;
      and protective in rhesus macaques&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies The safety and immunogenicity of this BCG prime-MVA85A boost vaccination&#xD;
      strategy has now been evaluated in a series of small-scale Phase I studies in the UK. MVA85A&#xD;
      was the first candidate TB vaccine in clinical trials anywhere in the world in September&#xD;
      2002, and is currently the only one in clinical trials in Africa . The main immunological&#xD;
      read-out used in these clinical trials is the ex-vivo IFN-γ Elispot assay, which is used to&#xD;
      assess specific T cell responses to tuberculin PPD, antigen 85 complex and pools of&#xD;
      overlapping peptides spanning the length of antigen 85A. The best immunological correlate of&#xD;
      protection in murine and human TB is the secretion of IFN-γ from sensitised T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, 14 mycobacterially and BCG naïve, healthy volunteers have been vaccinated with 5 x&#xD;
      10^7pfu MVA85A, administered intradermally. We find that MVA85A is safe and well tolerated. A&#xD;
      single vaccination with MVA85A induces remarkably high levels of specific effector T cell&#xD;
      responses (median IFN- γ Elispot response to Antigen 85A summed peptide pools 1153 spots per&#xD;
      million PBMC). In addition, the safety of MVA85A in volunteers previously vaccinated with BCG&#xD;
      has now been demonstrated in 17 volunteers. These 17 volunteers show even higher peak levels&#xD;
      of antigen specific T cells (median response 2455 spots per million PBMC) 1 week&#xD;
      post-vaccination than those immunized with MVA85A alone. Perhaps more importantly for the&#xD;
      induction of T cell memory, volunteers who have been previously BCG vaccinated maintain&#xD;
      higher levels of antigen specific T cells after MVA85A for up to 24 weeks after vaccination,&#xD;
      when compared to those volunteers vaccinated with MVA85A alone. In contrast to this viral&#xD;
      vector boost, the magnitude of T cell responses seen after vaccination with a leading&#xD;
      protein/adjuvant vaccine (for malaria), RTS,S/AS02, is around 200 spots per million PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This series of Phase I studies have also replicated in The Gambia, and the results from The&#xD;
      Gambia are equally promising. In both the UK and The Gambian studies, MVA85A induces 5-10&#xD;
      fold higher immune responses than any other recombinant MVA in clinical trials. The most&#xD;
      likely explanation for this is that the volunteers have some weak pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-mycobacterial immunity induced by exposure to environmental mycobacteria, and this&#xD;
      specific anti-mycobacterial immunity is being boosted by MVA85A. We have some preliminary&#xD;
      data to support this hypothesis, and other groups have also found pre-existing immunity to&#xD;
      environmental mycobacteria in healthy UK adults. Vaccines that are good at boosting&#xD;
      previously primed T cell responses, such as MVA85A, are potentially good candidates for a&#xD;
      post-exposure vaccine designed to boost the immune response and prevent the development of&#xD;
      disease in those latently infected. If the high levels of specific T cells seen after a&#xD;
      single immunisation with MVA85A are attributable to the boosting of pre-existing&#xD;
      environmentally induced responses, then this makes MVA85A an extremely promising candidate&#xD;
      for a boosting vaccine, given as a post-exposure vaccine in latent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next study, which completed enrolment in the UK in February 2006, assessed the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MVA85A in healthy volunteers who were latently infected with M.tb. Twelve&#xD;
      latently infected healthy subjects were vaccinated with a single dose of 5 x 10^7pfu MVA85A.&#xD;
      In this study, latent M.tb infection was determined by tuberculin skin testing and ex-vivo&#xD;
      IFN-γ Elispot responses to two M.tb specific antigens, ESAT6 and CFP10. Follow-up involved&#xD;
      detailed radiological and clinical assessment of the safety of this vaccine in M.tb infected&#xD;
      subjects. We found that MVA85A is equally safe and equally immunogenic in this latently&#xD;
      infected population as it is in the population vaccinated with BCG (Sander et al, unpublished&#xD;
      data). We have also conducted a dose finding study looking at two further doses of MVA85A, 1&#xD;
      x 10^7pfu and 1 x 10^8 pfu. Twelve subjects were vaccinated with each dose. The preliminary&#xD;
      results show the vaccine is significantly more immunogenic at the higher (1 x 10^8 pfu) dose&#xD;
      but the immunogenicity of the lower (1 x 10^7 pfu) dose is comparable with the standard (5 x&#xD;
      10^7pfu) dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have just started enrolment into an HIV study where antiretroviral naïve, HIV infected&#xD;
      adults with a CD4 count greater than 350 are vaccinated with MVA85A. To date, there have been&#xD;
      no safety concerns with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA85A is being trialled in a series of Phase I and II studies in the Western Cape province,&#xD;
      South Africa, where the prevalence of tuberculosis is extremely high (annual incidence of&#xD;
      disease ~1%). In August 2005, enrolment commenced into trial 008 and it continued until July&#xD;
      2006. 24 healthy TB naïve and HIV uninfected adults were vaccinated. The preliminary results&#xD;
      of this arm of the trial were presented in Vienna (Hawkridge et al, TB Vaccines for the&#xD;
      World; April 2006) and Paris the vaccine was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic.&#xD;
      Enrolment into the adolescent arm of this study commenced in November 2006 once it was clear&#xD;
      that the day 84 safety results in the adults were satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol forms the second part of these age de-escalation studies in South Africa, which&#xD;
      are necessary before we commence a Phase IIb proof-of-concept efficacy trial with MVA85A in&#xD;
      this population in 2008.&#xD;
