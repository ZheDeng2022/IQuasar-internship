      The two objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase the 2-year event-free survival from 55%, established with Total Therapy II&#xD;
           (UARK 98-026), to 75% in myeloma patients with cytogenetic abnormalities, and from 80%,&#xD;
           established with the Total Therapy II regimen, to 95% in myeloma patients without&#xD;
           cytogenetic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can be safely&#xD;
           incorporated with transplant 1 into the established pre-transplant regimen of high-dose&#xD;
           melphalan (used in Total Therapy II) and whether Velcade and gemcitabine can be safely&#xD;
           added to the transplant 2 high-dose chemotherapy regimen of combination melphalan and&#xD;
           BCNU.&#xD;

      This study is targeted towards patients who have been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma and&#xD;
      have had no prior autologous or allogeneic transplant. Furthermore, only up to 12 months of&#xD;
      prior treatment are allowed in this patient population. The study schema consists of one&#xD;
      round of induction chemotherapy, two transplants, one round of consolidation chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and two years of maintenance treatment. This study design differs from its historical&#xD;
      predecessors in the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In contrast to Total Therapy II and III, which only allow enrollment of patients with at&#xD;
           most one cycle or one month of treatment prior to enrollment, the proposed study allows&#xD;
           enrollment of patients with up to 12 months of prior treatment. No statistically&#xD;
           significant difference in outcome between patients with one or no cycle of preceding&#xD;
           therapy and those with up to 12 months of prior therapy. This should allow enrollment of&#xD;
           significantly more myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy has been reduced to a single cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib and thalidomide have been added to the transplant regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCNU is added to the second transplant to high dose melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine is added to the second transplant regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation treatment has been reduced to a single cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first year of maintenance is with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone, and the&#xD;
           second year of maintenance therapy consists of dexamethasone only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The novel agents thalidomide and bortezomib are not introduced upfront, but only with&#xD;
           transplantation and maintenance.&#xD;
