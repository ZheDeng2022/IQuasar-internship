  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), characterized by abdominal pain/discomfort and disturbed&#xD;
      bowel frequency, is a common functional bowel disorder that accounts for a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients seen in primary care and secondary referral centers. The impact on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and the economic burden on the community are considerable. However,&#xD;
      the outcome of conventional Western medicine in treating IBS has been disappointing. Several&#xD;
      potential new therapeutic agents have been withdrawn because of serious adverse events.&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of IBS for centuries in&#xD;
      Asian countries but scientific evaluation of its therapeutic function is scarce. A&#xD;
      methodologically strong trial of a 20-herb formula has shown significant benefit for IBS&#xD;
      patients. However, the herbal formulation was inadequately characterized and defined for&#xD;
      repeated clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to complete chemical characterization, a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, phase II dose-escalation clinical trial will be conducted to find an optimally&#xD;
      safe and efficacious dosage of this standardized 20-herb preparation in 104 patients aged 18&#xD;
      to 75 with all types of IBS. At each of two dosage levels, 52 participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to treatment for 8 weeks with the herbal formula or placebo in a 1:1 allocation ratio, and&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 for the clinically important and&#xD;
      reliable outcome of patient reported global symptom improvement. At the conclusion of the 1st&#xD;
      dosage level, safety will be assessed prior to using the higher dosage in a new cohort of&#xD;
      participants. We also will assess individual IBS symptoms, nature, severity, duration, and&#xD;
      frequency of adverse events, quality of life, concurrent IBS medications and health care&#xD;
      utilization, and will perform blood tests for safety purposes. Adherence to study medication&#xD;
      will be verified by dose counts. Results of this dose-ranging study will help to identify the&#xD;
      optimal dosage of the herbal formula to be used in future randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials and in head-to-head comparisons with conventional pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
