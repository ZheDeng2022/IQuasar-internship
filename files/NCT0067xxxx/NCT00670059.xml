      BACKGROUND: Single-embryo transfer is a well-accepted strategy to avoid multiple pregnancies&#xD;
      in an assisted reproductive technology programme. The selection of the embryo with the&#xD;
      highest implantation potential is a crucial step. Besides the morphological quality and&#xD;
      embryo kinetics up to the blastocyst stage, pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) of&#xD;
      aneuploidy has been advocated as an adjuvant approach by which to select the right embryo for&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Couples with a female partner younger than 36 years were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      undergo transfer of a single blastocyst in a cycle with or without PGS using fluorescence in&#xD;
      situ hybridization for the chromosomes X, Y, 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22.&#xD;

      Study design Between October 2004 and December 2006, ovulatory women undergoing infertility&#xD;
      treatment were asked to participate in this RCT subject to the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      maternal age below 36 years, need for ICSI and having motile sperm (sperm parameters: more&#xD;
      than 1 x 106 sperm cells/ml) and both partners having a normal karyotype. Following written&#xD;
      informed consent, eligible couples were randomly assigned to ICSI followed by blastocyst&#xD;
      transfer either with or without PGS on the eight-cell stage embryo. Randomization was&#xD;
      performed at the outpatient clinic, and each patient could be included only once. The consent&#xD;
      form mentioned that patients allocated to PGS group would agree to donate embryos for&#xD;
      research if these were chromosomally abnormal or unsuitable for transfer or cryopreservation.&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital. The patients were&#xD;
      aware of the treatment allocation and were informed at the moment of transfer concerning the&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormalities observed and about the morphological quality of the embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and embryo culture Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      was carried out in an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist (ganirelix, Orgalutran, NV Organon) (Kolibianakis et al., 2004) or an agonist&#xD;
      protocol, using GnRH analogues for pituitary desensitisation (buserilin, Suprefact; Hoechst,&#xD;
      Frankfurt, Germany), combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG)(Menopur, Ferring&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) or recombinant FSH (Puregon, NV Organon, Oss, The&#xD;
      Netherlands)(Van de Velde et al., 1998). Final oocyte maturation was induced by the&#xD;
      administration of 10,000 IU of HCG. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval was&#xD;
      scheduled 36 h after HCG administration. ICSI was used to fertilize the oocytes. Sperm&#xD;
      preparation, in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures and embryo&#xD;
      culture were carried out as described by Van Landuyt et al. (2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of fertilization and embryo evaluation Fertilization was assessed as the number of&#xD;
      2PN zygotes per COC retrieved. Embryo evaluation was performed on days 2 and 3 by recording&#xD;
      number of blastomeres and percentage of fragmentation. Grade A embryos were defined as&#xD;
      embryos without anucleate fragments. Grade B embryos had blastomeres of equal or unequal&#xD;
      sizes, with a maximum of 20 % of the volume of the embryo filled with anucleate fragments. In&#xD;
      grade C embryos, anucleate fragments were present in 20-50 % of the volume of the embryo.&#xD;
      Grade D embryos had more than 50% of the volume of the embryo filled with anucleate&#xD;
      fragments. The embryos were evaluated daily until day 5. On day 5, the embryos were&#xD;
      classified into arrested embryos showing no signs of compaction on day 5, compacting embryos&#xD;
      (C1-C2), early blastocysts (Bl1-Bl2) and expanding blastocysts (Bl3-Bl7) according to the&#xD;
      classification proposed by Gardner and Schoolcraft (1999). Embryos were considered for&#xD;
      transfer at day 5 only from the compacting stage on. In both groups, supernumerary embryos&#xD;
      were cryopreserved on day 5 or 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo biopsy Embryos of grade A, B or C with at least five blastomeres were biopsied (Joris&#xD;
      et al., 2003) in the morning of day 3 after ICSI. These selection criteria to decide whether&#xD;
      an embryo was suitable for biopsy were the same as those used to decide whether an embryo was&#xD;
      transferable on day 3 in the regular ICSI programme without PGD. Before biopsy of one&#xD;
      blastomere, the blastomeres were checked for the presence of nuclei. If consequently no&#xD;
      nuclear material was found during fixation, a second blastomere was removed. Embryo biopsy&#xD;
      was carried out in HEPES-buffered medium under oil using laser technology (Fertilase) as was&#xD;
      earlier described in detail (Staessen et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spreading of the interphase nuclei and FISH procedure Using a mouth pipette, the individual&#xD;
      blastomeres were first rinsed in medium and then transferred to a 1 µl droplet of 0.01 N HCl/&#xD;
      0.1% Tween 20 solution (Coonen et al., 1994) on a Superfrost Plus glass slide (Kindler GmbH,&#xD;
      Freiburg, Germany). A two-round FISH procedure was performed allowing us to detect the&#xD;
      chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, 21 (round 1) and 16, 22 (round 2) as was previously described in&#xD;
      detail (Staessen et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FISH scoring criteria The specific FISH signals detected in a given blastomere were&#xD;
      interpreted as follows: (i) a blastomere was considered to be diploid when the two gonosomes&#xD;
      and two chromosome 13-, 16-, 18-, 21- and 22 specific signals were present; (ii) a blastomere&#xD;
      was considered to be haploid, triploid or tetraploid when respectively one, three or four&#xD;
      signals for the investigated chromosomes were present; (iii) a blastomere was considered to&#xD;
      be aneuploid when an extra (trisomic) or missing (monosomic) signal for one chromosome was&#xD;
      observed, in the presence of two signals for the remaining chromosomes analysed; (iv) a&#xD;
      blastomere was considered as combined abnormal when it was neither diploid nor haploid,&#xD;
      triploid, tetraploid or aneuploid. After FISH analysis, only embryos found to be&#xD;
      chromosomally normal in the corresponding biopsied blastomere were transferred on day 5. FISH&#xD;
      analysis was performed by experienced cytogeneticists trained in cytogenetics and FISH&#xD;
      analysis. The results of the first and second round were analysed by two observers using a&#xD;
      Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo transfer In the PGS group the transfer was performed on day 5 if at least one&#xD;
      compacting embryo or early blastocyst was obtained from the embryos found to be genetically&#xD;
      normal. In the control group the transfer was also performed if at least one compacting&#xD;
      embryo or early blastocyst was obtained on day 5; 4 embryo transfers were performed on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy A biochemical pregnancy was defined as two consecutive positive rising (&gt; 15IU/ml)&#xD;
      serum hCG levels. A preclinical miscarriage was defined as two consecutive positive rising (&gt;&#xD;
      15IU/ml) serum hCG levels, but no FHB at least 6 weeks post embryo transfer. A clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy was defined as an intrauterine gestational sac with positive foetal heart activity&#xD;
      seen at ultrasonography performed at least 6 weeks post-embryo transfer. A miscarriage was&#xD;
      defined as a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation. The live birth delivery rate was&#xD;
      defined as the number of live birth deliveries expressed per 100 initiated cycles, aspiration&#xD;
      cycles or embryo transfer cycles (Zeghers-Hochschild et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint The primary outcome was live birth delivery rate. Statistical analysis Analysis was&#xD;
      performed according to the intention to treat. For descriptive statistics, we used means±SD.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were analyzed by the t-test for independent samples. Categorical&#xD;
      variables were analyzed by chi-square test. All tests were two-sided, and a P value of less&#xD;
      than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Using group sequential&#xD;
      methods, we calculated that the enrolment of 447 patients in each group would give the study&#xD;
      a statistical power of 80% to detect an absolute difference of 10% in the delivery rate&#xD;
      between the groups at an alpha level of 0.05 with the use of a two-sided z-test.&#xD;
