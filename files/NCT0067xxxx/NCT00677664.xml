      Purpose: to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate) injections&#xD;
      in the nerve fiber layer thickness and retinal function in diabetic patients who underwent&#xD;
      panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Double- Masked Randomized Clinical Trial. The follow up period estimated is 12&#xD;
      months after the last PRP section. Patients enrollment: Thirty patients with severe&#xD;
      nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy and no previous laser treatment&#xD;
      were enrolled. They were divided into two groups: &quot;A&quot; which received Copaxone or &quot;B&quot;which&#xD;
      received mannitol (placebo) using a block randomization. Both drugs were offered by&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration one week prior and in the three sections of PRP, one per week.&#xD;
      All patients received and signed a written inform consent approved by the research ethics&#xD;
      committee of UNIFESP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronogram: All patients received a full ophthalmic examination (best-corrected Log-Mar&#xD;
      visual acuity, slit lamp examination, applanation tonometry, fundus biomicroscopy and&#xD;
      indirect fundus examination); functional examination (Humphrey 24-2 SITA STANDARD visual&#xD;
      field, Electroretingrams and FDT C-20 strategy visual field) and anatomic examination (Color&#xD;
      digital photography and fluorescein angiography (FAG), GDX- VCC, Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) and Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) before PRP and 1st,3rd,6th months and 1 year&#xD;
      after laser, or whenever needed for clinical reasons.&#xD;
