    <textblock>
      In this study, MGCD265, a new anticancer drug under investigation, is given daily on a 7 days&#xD;
      on / 7 days off schedule to patients with advanced malignancies to study its safety profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MGCD265 belongs to a new class of drugs with anticancer potential, known as tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors. MGCD265 was shown to slow down the growth of human cancer cells in mice. Clinical&#xD;
      studies are being pursued to evaluate the safety of MGCD265 in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, oral MGCD265 is administered daily on a 7 days on / 7 days off schedule to&#xD;
      patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
