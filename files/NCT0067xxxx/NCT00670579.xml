  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary infections are the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF);&#xD;
      patients frequently have to take antibiotics which often cannot be given orally or by aerosol&#xD;
      but have to be administered intravenously. In order to reduce the number of venepunctures,&#xD;
      totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAD) or Ports have been used to administer&#xD;
      antibiotics and other infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Port systems has been increasing in recent years, especially for those patients&#xD;
      requiring frequent intravenous treatments. Having a TIVAD in place makes venous access&#xD;
      quicker and also reduces trauma, suffering and pain. However, there are important&#xD;
      complications associated with TIVADs which can be early (pneumothorax, arterial puncture,&#xD;
      severe bruising) or late (infections, thromboembolic complications and occlusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of TIVADs in CF is increasing, there is little CF-specific literature&#xD;
      available on the epidemiology and risk of TIVAD complications. Also, literature is scarce&#xD;
      about clinical criteria for deciding to insert a TIVAD. Therefore, so far clinical decisions&#xD;
      were based mainly on experiences of TIVAD use in other diseases, such as cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this prospective observational study we will survey a large population of Italian CF&#xD;
      people with TIVAD in order to: collect data about current clinical conditions of CF people&#xD;
      with TIVAD; investigate about clinical criteria that led to the decision of positioning a&#xD;
      TIVAD; observe the possible onset of late complications.&#xD;

      To be included in the study, subjects need to fulfil the following requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of CF, made accordingly to the CF Foundation Guideline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to consciously express owns informed consent, if aged 18 or more. If minor,&#xD;
           presence of at least one legally authorised parent able to consciously express informed&#xD;
           consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a TIVAD implanted;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have no current complications in the TIVAD (infection, thromboembolic complications or&#xD;
           occlusion) Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of TIVAD infections (Port pocket infection, Cutaneous site&#xD;
           infection,Catheter-related infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of TIVAD thrombosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of TIVAD occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational phase will last 12 months for each subject involved&#xD;
