  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate and compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ziprasidone versus&#xD;
      placebo in the treatment of conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and&#xD;
      disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified (DBD-NOS) of older children and&#xD;
      adolescents in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct and other behavior disorders are some of the most common forms of psychopathology in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. The main characteristic of these disorders is a repetitive and&#xD;
      persistent pattern of antisocial, aggressive or defiant behavior that involves major&#xD;
      violations of age-appropriate expectations or norms. According to the guidelines of the&#xD;
      German Society for Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry &amp; Psychotherapy (Deutsche Gesellschaft für&#xD;
      Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und -psychotherapie DGKJPP), the European Society for Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP), and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&#xD;
      (AACAP) currently no standard pharmacotherapy is established and recommended for children and&#xD;
      adolescents. However Risperidone has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with disruptive behavior disorders and below average IQ.&#xD;

      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, single center design that&#xD;
      includes a 3-weekly baseline period for finding the best individual dose, a 6-weeks treatment&#xD;
      period and a 2-weeks washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Agent / Placebo - Dosage and Route of Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication will first be dispensed at Visit 2 (day 1). Treatment assignments will be&#xD;
      made in accordance with the randomization sequence. At each medication visit (Visit 2 to&#xD;
      Visit 7), subjects will receive one bottle for the following week (Visit 2 to Visit 4) resp.&#xD;
      the following two weeks (Visit 5 to Visit 7). Only qualified personnel may dispense study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be randomized equally to the verum or placebo group at Visit 2. All&#xD;
      patients will receive an initial oral course starting with 5mg/d Ziprasidone Hydrochloride or&#xD;
      placebo for patients with a body weight ≤ 50 kg and 10 mg/d Ziprasidone Hydrochloride or&#xD;
      placebo for patients with a body weight &gt; 50 kg for the first week in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 the therapist can increase the dose to the double of the initial dose according to&#xD;
      clinical response and tolerability. At Visit 4 the dose can be increased to the double of the&#xD;
      last dose or reduced to the initial dose. At Visit 5 the most effective and best tolerated&#xD;
      dose will be given for the 6 week fixed dose phase of the trial. Therefore the maximum daily&#xD;
      dose is 20 mg (patients with body weight ≤ 50 kg) or 40 mg (patients with body weight &gt; 50&#xD;
      kg). The total dose will be split and the half-dose will be given twice a day (morning and&#xD;
      evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study Time Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ends 11 weeks after enrollment of the last patient (total study end). Study&#xD;
      duration for each patient is 11 weeks (from inclusion) until the last visit (close-out&#xD;
      visit). Patients with a pre-treatment of psychotropic drugs will have an individual washout&#xD;
      period before inclusion to the study. This individual washout period will last 5 elimination&#xD;
      half-life of the taken drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the patients will enter a 3 week dose escalation phase with weekly&#xD;
      visits. Then a 6 week stable drug dose phase will follow with visits every second week,&#xD;
      followed by a two week washout period and a final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the assumption that treatment with Ziprasidone will show&#xD;
      an effect size of ES=1 compared to treatment with placebo. In order to demonstrate this&#xD;
      difference at a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, 17 patients per group are&#xD;
      required, and a drop-out rate of approximately 8 patients per group (with no data available&#xD;
      to be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle) must be accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The effect of&#xD;
      treatment with Ziprasidone will be assessed by analyzing changes in the score of the scale&#xD;
      described above. Changes calculated from the evaluations before and after treatment will be&#xD;
      analyzed by means of analysis of covariance, considering the baseline measurement as a&#xD;
      covariate. The difference between treatment groups will be estimated with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and will be tested within this model by the corresponding two-sided test at the 5%&#xD;
      level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analyses will be performed for patients who received at least one dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug. Rates of adverse events and of serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject and the authorized legal representative must understand the nature of the&#xD;
             study and be able to comply with protocol requirements. The representative must sign&#xD;
             an Informed Consent Document and the subject must provide Written Assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject (male or female) must be between 7-17 (inclusive) years of age at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have a primary diagnosis of Conduct Disorder [CD] (312.8),&#xD;
             Oppositional Defiant Disorder [ODD] (313.81) or Disruptive Behavior Disorder not&#xD;
             otherwise specified [DBD-NOS] (312.9) as defined by DSM-IV criteria and confirmed by&#xD;
             the Kiddie-SADS-PL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the screening visit (Visit 1), subjects must have a score of 21 or more on the sum&#xD;
             of the scales for conduct problems and for oppositional behaviour in the NCBRF-TIQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be likely to benefit from the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to discontinue any medications that are prohibited in&#xD;
             this study (see Concomitant Medications table, Section 3.5.1). Any such medications&#xD;
