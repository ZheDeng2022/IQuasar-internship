  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to provide metreleptin for the treatment of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and/or hypertriglyceridemia associated with lipodystrophy. This study intends to provide&#xD;
      guidance to investigators with respect to identification of appropriate subjects for&#xD;
      metreleptin treatment, guidance on metreleptin dosing, and collection of safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data following metreleptin treatment in this population&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Must practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control&#xD;
                  (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per&#xD;
                  year, when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, tubal&#xD;
                  ligation, or a vasectomized partner) during the entire duration of the study&#xD;
                  (Double barrier methods including the use of female diaphragm and male condom&#xD;
                  with spermicide can also be used.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has physician-confirmed lipodystrophy as defined by evidence of generalized (whole&#xD;
             body) or partial (limbs) loss of body fat outside the range of normal variation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been diagnosed with at least one of the following 2 metabolic disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hypertriglyceridemia as defined by fasting triglyceride concentrations &gt;200 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If ≥18 years of age, is able to read, understand, and sign the Informed Consent Form&#xD;
             (ICF) and an Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information form,&#xD;
             communicate with the investigator, and understand and comply with protocol&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If &lt;18 years of age, has a parent or legal guardian to read and understand the ICF and&#xD;

             protocol requirements. Adolescent subjects must also read and understand the Child&#xD;
             Assent Form; if the child is too young or unable to read, then the Child Assent Form&#xD;
             must be explained to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
