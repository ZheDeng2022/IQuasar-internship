      RATIONALE: Gathering information about the number of young patients with cancer and the&#xD;
      outcome of these patients may help doctors learn more about cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the medical records of young patients undergoing&#xD;
      cancer treatment at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center to determine how often cancer occurs&#xD;
      and the outcome of these patients.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of patients between 15 and 30 years old who are treated for&#xD;
           newly diagnosed cancer at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC), in middle&#xD;
           Tennessee, and in the state of Tennessee between 1990 and 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the outcomes of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of these patients enrolled on clinical trials at VICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the outcomes of these patients when treated on a trial versus not treated on&#xD;
           a trial provided they have the same disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the number of these patients who are treated on a clinical trial when they&#xD;
           are first seen at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital vs Vanderbilt University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine referral patterns of these patients to VICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the outcomes of these patients who are treated at VICC vs middle Tennessee vs&#xD;
           the state of Tennessee vs the entire nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the reason for not enrolling on a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Cancer cases taken from the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) Registry and the&#xD;
      Tennessee Cancer Registry are examined for number and types of cancer, mortality rates broken&#xD;
      down by county and health department region, electronic medical records, and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes. Data is analyzed for comparison of number of new cancer patients, mortality rates,&#xD;
      and referral patterns at VICC versus number of new cancer patients in the region, state, and&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
