    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of administering Wilms&#xD;
      tumor gene 1 (WT1) cancer peptides. Cancer peptides are short pieces of protein that are made&#xD;
      in a laboratory to be like the peptides that can be found in cancer. These peptides are&#xD;
      intended to be given as a &quot;vaccine&quot; to activate the immune cells in a person to attack&#xD;
      his/her cancer. These peptides are mixed with an oily substance called Montanide ISA-51 and a&#xD;
      white cell growth factor called Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      which may help make the immune response stronger.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two subgroups with 2 dose cohorts of up to 6 patients each will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      exploratory study in order to attempt to obtain immunologic and clinical data on patients&#xD;
      with a variety of hematologic malignancies and amongst those in remission and early relapse.&#xD;
      The 2 subgroups of patients will be treated with different schemas depending upon whether&#xD;
      they are undergoing or have undergone autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the autologous transplant patients: Immune monitoring will require 90ml peripheral blood&#xD;
      before the first immunization, 3-5 ml from the leukapheresis product, 40-90ml peripheral&#xD;
      blood before the 4th immunization immunizations, after the last immunization (week 6-8), and&#xD;
      at the discretion of the immune monitoring lab, every two months if immunizations are&#xD;
      continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the allogeneic transplant patients: Immune monitoring will require 90ml peripheral blood&#xD;
      before the first immunization, 40-90ml peripheral blood before the 4th immunization&#xD;
      immunizations, after the last immunization (week 6-8), and at the discretion of the immune&#xD;
      monitoring lab, every two months if immunizations are continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored with blood pressure, temperature, and pulse, pre-injection, at 15&#xD;
      and 30 minutes after injection, prior to being allowed to leave the clinic. Diphenhydramine&#xD;
      50 mg, solumedrol 100 mg, and epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mL) must be available bedside (or a&#xD;
      clinic code cart must be available). If hypotension (SBP &lt;90mmHg for patients with baseline&#xD;
      SBP &gt; 110mmHg or &gt; 20 mmHg decrease for those with baseline SBP&lt; 110 mmHg), urticaria or&#xD;
      orofacial or laryngeal edema or bronchospasm occurs, an IV line will be placed and the&#xD;
      diphenhydramine 50 mg, solumedrol 100 mg, and epinephrine 1:1000 sq are recommended. In this&#xD;
      event, patients will be transported emergently to the emergency room if stabilized or the&#xD;
      code team will be contacted if patients continue to have progression of symptoms or worsening&#xD;
      hypotension. For fever&gt;101.5, acetaminophen 650 mg may be given orally.&#xD;
