      This randomized clinical trial is aimed at testing the efficacy of pit and fissure sealants,&#xD;
      in a current environmental context different from that of the seventies and eighties. This&#xD;
      study assesses the cost-effectiveness of sealants according to the individual caries risk.&#xD;
      This study takes place in Nice, Marseille and Paris (France) and the patients are to be&#xD;
      enrolled both in the dental hospitals and in the private practice. In the hospitals, the&#xD;
      subjects are recruited directly by the headmasters of the pediatric dentistry or public&#xD;
      health departments in the three dental schools. In private practice, the head of the&#xD;
      department of pediatric dentistry and / or public health dentistry, of each dental school&#xD;
      chooses 4 to 6 private practitioners who are used to place dental sealants in their daily&#xD;
      practice. They recruit the subjects among their own patients. The type of study corresponds&#xD;
      to randomized clinical trial (Split mouth design) in which the tooth is the statistical unit&#xD;
      (one pair of molars considered for each included patient). This study has a direct benefit&#xD;
      for individuals. The number of necessary subjects is 328; the sample size is 400. The&#xD;
      follow-up duration is 2 years. The treatment is a pit and fissure sealant on one randomized&#xD;
      tooth by pair of permanent molars (Split mouth design). Sealant material is set up in&#xD;
      accordance with the usual practice of each practitioner. Occlusal exams are conducted every 6&#xD;
      months. The effectiveness of dental sealants and the retention of sealing materials are&#xD;
      statistically analyzed according to both the individual caries risk and the clinical protocol&#xD;
