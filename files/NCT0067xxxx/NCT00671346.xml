    <textblock>
      Two large homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin intervention trials have been performed in Norway&#xD;
      during the period 1998 to 2005, NORVIT and WENBIT. The main objective in these trials was to&#xD;
      study the clinical effects of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid and vitamin B12&#xD;
      in patients with established coronary artery disease. Follow-up was terminated for NORVIT on&#xD;
      Marc 31st 2004 and for WENBIT October 5th 2005, and none of the two trials proved any&#xD;
      protective effect of the B-vitamin intervention on cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is so far no data on possible long-term effects following years of such B-vitamin&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main objective of the combinded NORVIT-WENBIT study will will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term effect of the B-vitamin intervention on incident life-style diseases including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporotic fractures and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary object will be the identification of risk phenotypes or genotypes, and if such&#xD;
      risk associations are midified by the B-vitamin intervention&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;homocysteine-hypothesis&quot; of vascular disease has attracted considerable interest, as&#xD;
      total plasma homocysteine levels can be easily lowered by folic acid and vitamin B12, raising&#xD;
      the prospect that cardiovascular disease could be lowered by such B-vitamin supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two large B-vitamin intervention trials have been performed in Norway during the period 1998&#xD;
      to 2005, NORVIT and WENBIT, both registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifiers NCT00266487&#xD;
      and NCT00354081, respectively. The main objective in these trials was to study the effects of&#xD;
      homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid and vitamin B12 to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in patients with established coronary artery disease. The B-vitamin&#xD;
      intervention, which included vitamin B6 in a 2x2 factorial design, was identical in the two&#xD;
      trials. Follow-up was terminated for NORVIT on March 31st 2004 and for WENBIT October 5th&#xD;
      2005. Results from the NORVIT trial was published April 2006 {Bonaa, 2006} and preliminary&#xD;
      results from the WENBIT trial were presented at the annual congress of the European Society&#xD;
      of Cardiology September 4th 2007 {Zegers, 2007}. The WENBIT trial is completed and submitted&#xD;
      for publication early in year 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, none of the B-vitamin intervention trials have shown any statistically significant&#xD;
      favourable effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid with or without&#xD;
      concomitant vitamin B12 on cardiovascular events {Bazzano, 2006}. In NORVIT there was even a&#xD;
      trend towards an increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarctions) in patients&#xD;
      receiving the combination of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6. This trend was not&#xD;
      observed in WENBIT. However, the treatment with folic acid / B12 was associated With a more&#xD;
      rapid progression of angiographic coronary atenoses {LÃ¸land, 2010}. Thus, the&#xD;
      &quot;homocysteine-hypothesis&quot; of vascular disease has been attenuated through the emergence of&#xD;
      these negative trial results, whereas a potential harmful effect of the B-vitamin&#xD;
      intervention has been revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is so far no data on possible long-term effects following years of B-vitamin&#xD;
      supplementation. By combining analyses and follow-up in the NORVIT and WENBIT cohorts, we&#xD;
      will probably have some more answers both considering possible subgroup and long-term effects&#xD;
      of the B-vitamin intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current data indicate that folate prevents cancer, especially breast and colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      However, during the last few years several reports have challenged this assumption. Swedish&#xD;
      observational studies found increased risk of colorectal cancer at high blood folate levels&#xD;
      {Van Guelpen, 2006} and increased risk of prostate cancer at high levels of folate and&#xD;
      vitamin B12 {Hultdin, 2005}. In a randomised trial with folic acid versus placebo to prevent&#xD;
      colorectal adenomas, one found increased risk of cancer in the group receiving folic acid,&#xD;
      especially of prostate cancer {Cole, 2007}. In a long-term follow-up of women taking high&#xD;
      doses of folic acid throughout pregnancy one found a doubled risk of deaths attributable to&#xD;
      breast cancer {Charles, 2004}. Recently it has been hypothesized that the implementation of&#xD;
      folic acid fortification of foods may have been wholly or partly responsible for the observed&#xD;
      increase in colorectal cancer rates in the USA and Canada in the mid to late 1990s {Mason,&#xD;
      2007}. This has led to new hypotheses that folate may prevent carcinogenesis but may enhance&#xD;
      the growth of established cancer cells {Ulrich, 2007}. The question of possible adverse&#xD;
      effects of folic acid supplementation will be of major importance when public health&#xD;
      administrations decide whether to implement or enhance programs folic acid fortification of&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the B-vitamin intervention will also be studied in relation to other life-style&#xD;
      diseases like diabetes and osteoprosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the combined NORVIT-WENBIT cohort will used for observational studies&#xD;
      evaluating new risk phenotypes or genotypes and their potential effect modification by the&#xD;
      B-vitamin interventions.&#xD;
