      The first goal of this study is to investigate whether CE-US is able to accurately identify&#xD;
      and quantify neovascularisation in carotid artery plaques. Since this is one of the first&#xD;
      studies systematically evaluating the ability of ultrasound in combination with air bubbles&#xD;
      to evaluate neovascularisation in carotid artery plaques, the examination will be performed&#xD;
      twice with an interval of 1/2 hour on the day before surgery, thus studying the reliability&#xD;
      of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal of this study is to investigate whether MRI at 3.0 T with a custom-designed&#xD;
      3T carotid coil, using a recently developed pulse sequence, is able to accurately identify&#xD;
      and quantify neovascularisation. And the third goal of this study is to make an intermodality&#xD;
      comparison of CE-US and MRI regarding their ability to identify and quantify plaque&#xD;
      neovascularisation.&#xD;

      Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease of the large arteries and the leading cause of death in&#xD;
      Western society. The development of atherosclerosis involves the accumulation of lipids,&#xD;
      cells and extracellular matrix in the blood vessel wall. It is a progressive disease&#xD;
      characterized by the formation of a fibrous cap by smooth muscle cell proliferation and&#xD;
      migration, and the development of a necrotic/lipid core. This core develops due to the&#xD;
      accumulation of lipids and apoptosis of lipid-loaded macrophages. In this process the intima,&#xD;
      the innermost layer of the blood vessel, thickens. This will lead to narrowing of the lumen&#xD;
      and obstruction of blood flow. The developed lesion of the vessel wall may become vulnerable&#xD;
      to rupture of the fibrous cap. Cap rupture exposes the necrotic core to the blood leading to&#xD;
      the formation of a thrombus. The thrombus may fully or partially obstruct the lumen and cause&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Although&#xD;
      atherosclerosis forms the origin of most cardiovascular diseases, at present much remains&#xD;
      unknown of the atherogenic process. Therefore, it is essential that research is done to&#xD;
      discover novel mechanisms of atherosclerotic development. Intimal neovascularisation has&#xD;
      recently drawn much attention as a novel factor, likely contributing to atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque growth and rupture. Neovascularisation occurs when the intima thickens and is&#xD;
      associated with stenosis, plaque inflammation and hemorrhage. Because increased amount of&#xD;
      neovascularisation may be associated with increased risk for stroke, it would be highly&#xD;
      desirable to identify plaque neovascularisation by noninvasive imaging. At present, imaging&#xD;
      of neovascular development in atherosclerotic lesions with conventional ultrasound is not&#xD;
      feasible, since the vessel diameter is well below the resolution capacity of currently&#xD;
      available ultrasound systems. Since almost a decennium, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US)&#xD;
      with gaseous ultrasound contrast agents has been used for research purposes but is now also&#xD;
      widely commercially available and registered for clinical use, which can be done safely. With&#xD;
      the help of such a gaseous contrast medium containing air bubbles smaller than erythrocytes&#xD;
      (microbubbles) it might be possible to depict neovascularisation in a carotid artery plaque,&#xD;
      due to the strong signal that will be evoked even by a small number of air bubbles as&#xD;
      compared to the signal from the surrounding tissue. So, the intensity increase of the&#xD;
      ultrasound signal from the carotid artery plaque after administration of microbubbles might&#xD;
      reflect the amount of neovascularisation. Until now, only case reports concerning this&#xD;
      technique have been published, especially no comparison with histology has been performed.&#xD;
      So, the first goal of this study is to investigate whether CE-US is able to accurately&#xD;
      identify and quantify neovascularisation in carotid artery plaques. Since this is one of the&#xD;
      first studies systematically evaluating the ability of ultrasound in combination with air&#xD;
      bubbles to evaluate neovascularisation in carotid artery plaques, the examination will be&#xD;
      performed twice with an interval of 1/2 hour on the day before surgery, thus studying the&#xD;
      reliability of the method. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well suited for evaluating&#xD;
      carotid plaques; it is widely available, provides excellent soft tissue contrast, multiplanar&#xD;
      imaging capability, and is free of ionising radiation. Multisequence MRI has shown to be able&#xD;
      to detect different carotid plaque components in vivo. However, only very little experience&#xD;
      exists in identifying neovascularisation by MRI. Also, newer MRI systems (&gt;1.5 T), newer coil&#xD;
      systems, and better pulse sequences have recently become available. Therefore, the second&#xD;
      goal of this study is to investigate whether MRI at 3.0 T with a custom-designed 3T carotid&#xD;
      coil, using a recently developed pulse sequence, is able to accurately identify and quantify&#xD;
      neovascularisation. Finally, the third goal of this study is to make an intermodality&#xD;
      comparison of CE-US and MRI regarding their ability to identify and quantify plaque&#xD;
      neovascularisation.&#xD;
