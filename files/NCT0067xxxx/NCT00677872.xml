&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of COPD with an FEV1 above 20% and less than 65% of predicted normal and an&#xD;
             FEV1-to-FVC ratio of less than 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension based on echocardiography within the last 6 months&#xD;
             or by cardiac catheterization within the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association(NYHA)Class II or III&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening LVEF&gt;55%, obtained by any appropriate method within 6 months of screening&#xD;

          -  Baseline 6MWT distance&gt;150m and &lt;450m&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent from each subject prior to the initiation of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented negative results (within 12 months)and Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Serology&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment for pulmonary hypertension with epoprostenol (prostacyclin), trepostinil&#xD;
             (Remodulin), iloprost (Ventavis), bosentan (Tracleer), ambrisentan (Letairis),&#xD;
             sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) within the 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of any of the following cardiovascular co-morbidities or&#xD;
             conditions: Un-controlled systemic hypertension at screening; unstable cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease including intermittent atrial fibrillation or unstable angina within the 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening; amyloidosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis; history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous cardiac intervention&#xD;
             within the 3 months prior to screening; significant valvular heart disease;&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  COPD exacerbation less than 1 month prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;

             dysfunction is acceptable as long as the subject does not take the medication within&#xD;
             72 hours of an efficacy assessment. Other concomitant medications are allowed provided&#xD;
             the subject has been on a stable dose regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
             and the regimen continues and remains stable during the treatment and follow-up&#xD;
             periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of nasal airway mass, septal perforation, chronic sinusitis, lidocaine allergy&#xD;

             naso-esophageal catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has the presence, or history, of malignancy that required significant&#xD;

             within the next 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The receipt of any investigational medication within 30 days prior to screening or&#xD;
