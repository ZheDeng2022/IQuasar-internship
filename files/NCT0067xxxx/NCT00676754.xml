      The purpose of this study is to better understand tuberculosis (TB) and the risk of infection&#xD;
      with TB, in Peru. TB is a disease that is caused by bacteria and transmitted through droplets&#xD;
      in the air that come from the lungs of an infected person. The risk of infection will be&#xD;
      compared between two groups: household members, who live with people having TB that does not&#xD;
      respond well to treatment and household members, who live with people having TB that responds&#xD;
      well to treatment. Study participants will include 4,500 TB infected people and 22,500 of&#xD;
      their household contacts. Study procedures include answering a questionnaire, TB skin tests,&#xD;
      blood samples, and a chest x-ray. Individuals with symptoms indicating TB will be asked to&#xD;
      provide sputum samples. Individuals with TB will be involved in the study for up to 48&#xD;
      months; household contacts will be involved in the study for 12 months. The knowledge gained&#xD;
      from this study will be used to improve tuberculosis control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The emergence of drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium (M) tuberculosis poses&#xD;
      a significant threat to global tuberculosis (TB) control strategies. The prospective design&#xD;
      of this study will allow the direct study of infection risk, because the population among&#xD;
      which the TB cases arise will be identified and monitored over the course of the study. This&#xD;
      study design will permit the characterization and comparison of TB strains with differential&#xD;
      success in causing new infections. The study will be conducted within a well-established&#xD;
      public health TB control program in a region of Peru, where drug-resistant strains already&#xD;
      account for about 20 percent of new TB cases. This study protocol will be implemented in&#xD;
      collaboration with the 52 Ministry of Health outpatient health centers in 4 districts of&#xD;
      Lima, Peru. This will be a prospective cohort study with an enrollment period of 36&#xD;
      consecutive months. Two types of study subjects will be enrolled: patients found to have&#xD;
      active TB disease by routine testing (TB index subjects), and the individuals living in the&#xD;
      households of these patients (household members). Study participants will include 4,500&#xD;
      subjects with active TB and their approximately 22,500 household members. Ages will range&#xD;
      from less than 1-100 years. The tuberculin skin test will be used to diagnose latent TB&#xD;
      infection in the household members. This product is used routinely by health center staff in&#xD;
      household members who are children in the age group less than1-15 years. In this study&#xD;
      protocol, it will also be used in all household members age 16 years and older. Each TB index&#xD;
      subject will remain in the study for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum 48 months. Each&#xD;
      household member will remain in the study for 12 months. The primary objective of the study&#xD;
      is to measure the risk of infection in household members of index cases with drug-resistant&#xD;
      TB compared with the risk of infection in household members of subjects with drug-sensitive&#xD;
      TB. This refers to household members who are tuberculin-skin-test negative at the beginning&#xD;
      of follow-up. Secondary study objectives are: to assess the impact of sociodemographic and&#xD;
      clinical confounders and risk modifiers such as age, sex, comorbidity, human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV) infection, nutritional status, and Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination on&#xD;
      the association between risk of infection and exposure to a drug-resistant or a&#xD;
      drug-sensitive strain; to measure associations between specific mutations associated with&#xD;
      drug resistance in M tuberculosis and phenotypes including resistance profile, clinical&#xD;
      presentations, and transmissibility; to measure the rate of true relapse versus reinfection&#xD;
      in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB subjects using molecular-epidemiologic methods; and&#xD;
      to measure the rate of reversion (to negative) of the tuberculin skin test among household&#xD;
      members with a positive tuberculin skin test result. The primary study outcome measure is the&#xD;
      relative risk of TB infection (by tuberculin skin test) in household members of subjects who&#xD;
      are sick with drug-resistant M tuberculosis strains compared to household members of subjects&#xD;
      with drug-sensitive strains. Secondary study outcome measures are the rate of relapse and&#xD;
      rate of reinfection among TB subjects treated with routine TB therapy by outpatient health&#xD;
      centers; and the rate of reversion (to negative) of the tuberculin skin test among household&#xD;
      members with a positive tuberculin skin test result.&#xD;

        The study population includes two categories of subjects: (1) the 4,000 TB index subjects&#xD;
        and (2) their approximately 18,000 household members. All of these individuals live in&#xD;
        Lima, Peru, in the catchment area of the participating public health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Approximately 50% of study participants will be female. According to the ethnic and racial&#xD;
        categories used by NIH, all of the study population would be classified as &quot;Hispanic or&#xD;
        Latino&quot; (Mestizo). None of these participants live within a tribal indigenous culture; all&#xD;
        speak Spanish while some also speak the indigenous (Quechua) language of their birthplace&#xD;
        in Peru. At least 75% of this population has some &quot;Amerindian&quot; heritage. Less than 1% of&#xD;
        individuals are either Asian-Peruvian or Afro-Peruvian in descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Apart from the age restriction (at least 16 years old) for the TB index subjects only,&#xD;
        there are no other restrictions on participant selection&#xD;
