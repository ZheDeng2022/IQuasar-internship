             women, or 21 units/week or 3 units/day for men, within 6 months of screening. One unit&#xD;
             is equivalent to a half-pint of beer or 1 measure of spirits or 1 glass of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating women, or an unwillingness of male subjects to use a condom/spermicide, in&#xD;
