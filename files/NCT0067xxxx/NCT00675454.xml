    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a lung disease that involves damage to the air sacs in the lungs and can lead to&#xD;
      breathing difficulties. Treatment options for people with emphysema include pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. This study will&#xD;
      observe people with emphysema to assess the effect of these treatment therapies on their&#xD;
      quality of life and long-term health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a progressive lung disease that results in shortness of breath and a reduced&#xD;
      capacity for physical activity. It is caused by inflammation within the small air sacs and&#xD;
      small airways of the lungs, which can lead to the destruction of the air sac walls and&#xD;
      eventually to airway collapse. Treatment options for emphysema include both non-surgical and&#xD;
      surgical interventions. Pulmonary rehabilitation, a non-surgical treatment, includes a&#xD;
      combination of education, exercise training, nutrition advice, and smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs. The goal of pulmonary rehabilitation is to increase exercise tolerance and reduce&#xD;
      breathing difficulties. Two surgical treatment options include lung volume reduction surgery,&#xD;
      in which small amounts of damaged lung tissue are removed, and lung transplantation, in which&#xD;
      a person's damaged lung is replaced with a healthy lung from a donor. While these surgical&#xD;
      options may offer potential improvements in quality of life, they also impose substantial&#xD;
      risks, including infections, pneumonia, or even death. In this study, researchers will follow&#xD;
      participants over a long period of time to assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation,&#xD;
      lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation on health outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people with moderate to severe emphysema who have undergone pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, or lung transplantation. Participants will&#xD;
      attend annual study visits and will complete computerized interviews and health-related&#xD;
      questionnaires that will assess quality of life factors. Study researchers will also review&#xD;
      participants' medical records to collect information on lung function and blood test results.&#xD;
