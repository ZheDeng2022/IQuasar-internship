  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled 3% hypertonic saline (HS) administered every 2-8 hours to infants admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with viral bronchiolitis has been shown to improve airway clearance and reduces&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: When infants first present to the ER, frequent administration of HS over a brief&#xD;
      time period will provide significant symptom improvement such that the need for hospital&#xD;
      admission will be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine in a randomized, controlled and double-blind fashion if the short&#xD;
      term intensive use of inhaled 3% hypertonic saline (HS) in the Emergency Room (ER) can reduce&#xD;
      the rate of hospital admission for infants presenting with moderately severe viral&#xD;
      bronchiolitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the Emergency Room (ER) or out-patient department with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      moderately severe bronchiolitis (as defined by inclusion/exclusion criteria below) will be&#xD;
      approached for entry into the study. After the initial routine assessment by the ER medical&#xD;
      and nursing staff, informed consent will be obtained and the infant will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive treatment in a double-blinded fashion with 4 ml of nebulized study solution&#xD;
      containing 1 mg salbutamol (bronchodilator) plus either 3% hypertonic saline (HS, study&#xD;
      group) or 0.9% saline (NS, control group) every 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses. After an&#xD;
      observation period of 1 hour following the last dose, the infant will be reassessed by the&#xD;
      attending physician in the ER for disposition (admit, discharge home, remain in ER for&#xD;
      further treatment) at which point the infant's active involvement in the study will end. All&#xD;
      subsequent therapy, if needed, will be at the sole discretion of the attending physician. The&#xD;
      family of each recruited subject will be contacted by phone 7 days later to assess resolution&#xD;
      of symptoms or the presence of any unexpected adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response to the above treatment will also be determined independently by the study&#xD;
      physician or designate utilizing a standardized respiratory scoring system, the Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI), at study entry and after the post-treatment&#xD;
      observation period. The primary outcome measure is to compare the rate of admission to&#xD;
      hospital between the study and control groups. A secondary outcome measure will involve the&#xD;
      assessment of change in the RDAI between study entry and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infant will remain in the ER throughout the study period and receive standard ongoing&#xD;
      monitoring by the nursing staff. In the unlikely event of significant clinical worsening&#xD;
      during this period, the ER physician on duty will be notified to assess and intervene as&#xD;
      he/she feels appropriate. The site study investigator will be immediately notified of all&#xD;
      such occurrences by the research assistant involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a single bronchiolitis season from November 1, 2008 to April&#xD;
      1, 2009. There will be 2 study sites as listed below with the name of the study site&#xD;
      director.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Royal Victoria Hospital of Barrie (Emergency Department), Barrie ON (B.A. Kuzik, MD,&#xD;
           FRCP (lead investigator))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kingston General Hospital (Emergency Department) and Hotel Dieu Hospital (Emergency&#xD;
           Department, Children's Outpatient Centre), Kingston ON (M. P. Flavin, MB, MRCP, FRCP)&#xD;
