  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of Quetiapine SR versus placebo over 8 weeks in unipolar&#xD;
      non-psychotic adult outpatients depression and comorbid fibromyalgia. This will be measured&#xD;
      by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) mean change from baseline to week 8 on the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, response regarding improvement in depressive symptoms will be&#xD;
      defined as a 50% decrease in HAM-D scores over 8 weeks. Furthermore, proportion of patients&#xD;
      achieving remission is defined as an HAM-D total score of 7 at end of treatment. The anxiety&#xD;
      comorbid symptoms often associated with major depression will be assessed with the HAM-A (14&#xD;
      items) scale. Proportion of patients responding and achieving remission of anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      are defined respectively as a reduction of 50% in the HAM-A total score from baseline and a&#xD;
      HAM-A total score of 7 at the end of treatment.&#xD;

        -  Changes from baseline to week 8 in HAM-A total scores Changes from baseline to week 8 in&#xD;
           CGI Severity of illness scores. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score&#xD;
           from randomisation to Week 8 Change from baseline in the Fibromyalgia Impact&#xD;
           Questionnaire (FIQ). Change from baseline in the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcome&#xD;
           Study (MOS). Change from baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Change from&#xD;
           baseline in the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire- Short Form&#xD;

      Change from baseline in the Patient Health Questionaire-15 (PHQ-15). Change from baseline in&#xD;
      the Global Assessment Scale (GAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects and the tolerability profiles of Quetiapine SR at the dose range used in the&#xD;
      study will be assessed at every visit following the initial visit.&#xD;
