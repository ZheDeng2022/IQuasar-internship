    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of JNJ-26854165 (a new drug in development&#xD;
      for cancer) in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors on the maximum dose&#xD;
      tolerated by these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JNJ-26854165 is a new drug in development and belongs to a class of drugs that act on the&#xD;
      specific protein present in cells. It may stop cancer cells from growing or kill cancer&#xD;
      cells. In this study, the safety (the effect on the body) of the JNJ-26854165 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced or refractory solid tumors will be examined. The effect (if any) of&#xD;
      JNJ-26854165 on the disease will be assessed throughout the study. The maximum dose tolerated&#xD;
      by these patients will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of JNJ 26854165 will start low and will be increased during the study. The drug will&#xD;
      be taken by mouth every day in each 21-day cycle. The dose each patient receives will be&#xD;
      assigned at enrollment. Patients who enroll at a later time may receive a higher dose. If&#xD;
      patients do not have severe side effects at a certain dose level, the next group of 3 to 6&#xD;
      patients will get a higher dose. The dose will increase until some patients have severe side&#xD;
      effects. The dose will be then decreased and 3 to 6 patients will receive the highest amount&#xD;
      of drug where non-severe side effects were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of JNJ 26854165 in the blood will be measured and the effect of JNJ 26854165 on&#xD;
      the disease will also be monitored. The effect of food on the absorption, break down and&#xD;
      elimination of the drug will be studied in some patients. At some dose levels, the possible&#xD;
      interaction of JNJ 26854165 with medications frequently used in cancer patients will be&#xD;
      examined and patients at these dose levels will be asked to take a single dose of three&#xD;
      additional drugs (dextromethorphan hydrobromide (30mg), tolbutamide (250mg), and midazolam&#xD;
      (5mg) &quot;cocktail&quot;) on 2 study days, which will all be supplied by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility up to 4 weeks before the study drug is&#xD;
      administered. During Cycle 1 patients will be observed as inpatients for at least 12 hours&#xD;
      after administration of the drug on 3 or 4 days and will be required to visit the study site&#xD;
      on 2 additional days. One additional visit is required for patients in whom the food effect&#xD;
      or interaction with other medications will be examined. During Cycle 2, patients are required&#xD;
      to visit the study center on 2 days. During all cycles after Cycle 2, patients are required&#xD;
      to visit the study center on 1 day. Fourteen days after the last dose of JNJ-26854165, the&#xD;
      patient will be invited for a follow-up visit which will include tests for safety and the&#xD;
      effect of the drug on the disease. The proposed starting dose of JNJ-26854165 is 4 mg/day as&#xD;
      a single oral dose. JNJ26854165 will be provided in a glass vial with tear-off cap placed in&#xD;
      a child resistant pouch so that the drug may be taken at home. Patients will take&#xD;
      JNJ-26854165 each day while in the study. Treatment may continue as long as there is benefit&#xD;
      and there are no unacceptable side effects as assessed by the study doctor.&#xD;
