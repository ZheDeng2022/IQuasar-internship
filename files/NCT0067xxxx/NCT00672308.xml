      In cholera, the function of small intestine is affected resulting in increased secretion of&#xD;
      electrolytes and water and their reduced absorption leading to profuse watery diarrhoea. The&#xD;
      human colon has the capacity to absorb water and electrolytes. A number of recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, butyrate and propionate&#xD;
      stimulates absorption of sodium in the colon, which is not affected by cyclic AMP. It has&#xD;
      also been shown that SCFAs inhibits c-AMP mediated chloride secretion in the colon. Benefiber&#xD;
      (partially hydrolyzed guar gum) is water soluble fibre, and when added to ORS it undergoes&#xD;
      fermentation in the colon liberating SCFAs. SCFAs not only serves as metabolic fuel to the&#xD;
      enterocytes but they also enhance colonic absorption of salts and water. Thus, they have&#xD;
      potentials to reduce the severity of diarrhoea in patients with cholera. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy of Benefiber-added WHO-ORS in the management of adults with&#xD;
      cholera. In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, a total of 174 adult males with&#xD;
      cholera would be studied. Study patients would be selected from those who attend the Dhaka&#xD;
      Hospital of ICDDR,B with a history of diarrhoea of less than 24 hours and signs of severe&#xD;
      dehydration. They would be rehydrated using intravenous fluid (cholera saline) over 4 hrs&#xD;
      during which a stool specimen would be subjected for dark-field microscopy for identification&#xD;
      of V. cholerae. Those identified to have cholera would be randomized in equal numbers to&#xD;
      receive either: a) Benefiber (25 g/L) added WHO-ORS, b) Benefiber (50 g/L) added to the new&#xD;
      formulation (Na+ 75, glucose 75, Cl- 65, K+ 20 mmol/L, citrate 10 mmol/L, osmolarity 245&#xD;
      mosmol/L) of WHO-ORS , or c) the same WHO-ORS but without Benefiber for maintenance of&#xD;
      hydration until resolution of diarrhoea. All patients would be treated with a single, 300 mg&#xD;
      dose of doxycycline capsules and would be provided with the standard hospital diets. Fluid&#xD;
      intake (intravenous fluid, ORS, and plain water) and output (stool, urine, and vomit) will be&#xD;
      measured for each 6-hourly periods of the study. Patients would be hospitalized until&#xD;
      resolution of their diarrhoea. Stool output, intake of intravenous fluid and ORS, the&#xD;
      duration of diarrhoea, and the proportion of patients requiring &quot;unscheduled intravenous&#xD;
      fluid therapy&quot; would be compared between the treatment groups. If Benefiber is found&#xD;
      effective, it would be possible to formulate improved ORS for better case management of&#xD;
      cholera.&#xD;

      Considerable interest has recently been generated on dietary fibers (DF), and soluble fibers&#xD;
      have emerged both as a subject for research and therapeutic applications. The 'fiber&#xD;
      hypothesis', put forward by Denis Bukitt and Hugh Trowel (1-4), suggests that consumption of&#xD;
      unrefined carbohydrate food protects against many western ailments including colon cancer,&#xD;
      diverticular disease, appendicitis, constipation, haemorrhoids, diabetes, heart disease, gall&#xD;
      stones, and obesity among others. In the line of this hypothesis, many basic laboratory and&#xD;
      clinical works have been done. The term 'dietary fiber' has been used to denote plant&#xD;
      polysaccharides and lignin that are resistant to hydrolysis by human digestive enzymes (5,6).&#xD;
      The detailed chemistry and metabolism of DF have also been studied (7-10). The classification&#xD;
      of fiber is based on their chemical structures (11), and they can be divided into&#xD;
      non-polysaccharides and non-starch polysaccharides. Lignin is the only non-polysaccharide&#xD;
      fiber, which is a polymer of phenolic alcohol that is water insoluble. The non-starch&#xD;
      polysaccharide can be divided into cellulose and non-cellulose fiber. Cellulose consists of&#xD;
      un-branched D-glucose chains in 1,4-ß linkage and is water insoluble. Non-cellulose&#xD;
      polysaccharides include hemicelluloses, mucillages, gums and pectins, and they consists of&#xD;
      various ß linkages of wide variety of hexose and pentose sugars. The polysaccharide chains&#xD;
      are heteroglycans (chains with more than one type of monosaccharide). The hemicellulosic&#xD;
      materials are polymers of xylose, mannose and glucose with side chains of galactose and&#xD;
      arabinose. The pectic substances are polymers of galacturonic acids. Likewise, the gums and&#xD;
      mucillages are branched carbohydrate polymers (e.g. gum, which is a linear mannan with&#xD;
      galactose side chains). Non-cellulose polysaccharides vary in degree of their water&#xD;
      solubilities (7,9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In man, fiber is mainly degraded in the large intestine by the bacterial flora. Many of the&#xD;
      effects of fiber on stool output arise from this degradation. The main products of fiber&#xD;
      fermentation are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate and butyrate,&#xD;
      which are the major anions in the colon. Bacteria utilize SCFAs and proliferate, absorbing&#xD;
      water from the colonic epithelium in the course of their metabolism, and thus decrease the&#xD;
      free water content in the lumen (11). The SCFAs that are not utilized by the bacteria are&#xD;
      largely absorbed by the colon (12). Their transepithelial transport is associated with&#xD;
      stimulation of sodium transport from the colon in several species including human (13-15).&#xD;
      This effect may be particularly important in acute diarrhoeal diseases where purging, and&#xD;
      associated reduced food intake might deplete the colon of SCFAs leading to colonic&#xD;
      dysfunction (16, 17). Thus, luminal SCFAs levels in the colon might influence the clinical&#xD;
      course of acute diarrhoeal diseases. SCFAs have also been shown to be clinically important in&#xD;
      one diarrhoeal disease in animal -transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (18). Animals&#xD;
      infected with the virus develop acute enteritis with marked fluid loss from the small&#xD;
      intestine. Young animals develop severe diarrhoea as their colonic mucosa is incapable of&#xD;
      absorbing fluid, whereas older infected animals has been shown to have increased colonic&#xD;
      absorption by about six-folds over the controls. This compensatory response prevents severe&#xD;
      diarrhoea and is related to the development of colonic fermentation with the production of&#xD;
      SCFAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholera is a disease of humans affecting the small intestine where fluid and electrolyte&#xD;
      secretion is increased while their absorptions are decreased leading to profuse watery&#xD;
      diarrhoea. As the human colon has the capacity to absorb water and electrolyte (19), some&#xD;
      compensation is expected reducing the diarrhoeal loss. In recent studies (20, 21) SCFAs have&#xD;
      been shown to stimulate sodium absorption in the colon, an effect that is not influenced by&#xD;
      c-AMP, and additionally they have been found to inhibit cyclic AMP-mediated chloride&#xD;
      secretion in the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCFA-enhanced colonic absorption of water and electrolytes might be exploited in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute diarrhoeal diseases. Oral rehydration therapy has dramatically changed the&#xD;
      management of acute diarrhoeal disease. Yet, oral rehydration therapy is in the process of&#xD;
      being improved. Cereal-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS) have been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      stool volume by about 30% to 40% compared to the WHO-ORS (22, 23). It is possible that, at&#xD;
      least a part of their effect on stool volume reduction might be attributed to SCFAs produced&#xD;
      by unabsorbed carbohydrate including dietary fiber in the colon. Diversion colitis is an&#xD;
      inflammatory process affecting the bypassed colon and rectum following surgical diversion of&#xD;
      faecal stream (24). The inflammation disappears after surgical re-anastomosis, where topical&#xD;
      steroids are usually ineffective (25). Rectal instillation of SCFAs has resulted in the&#xD;
      disappearance of symptoms and endoscopic change over a period of 4-6 weeks; remission has&#xD;
      been maintained for over a year by regular rectal SCFAs treatment (26). These findings&#xD;
      suggest that SCFAs also play a role in mucosal healing in colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonic epithelial cells utilize SCFAs as source of energy for their various metabolic&#xD;
      activities (27, 28). Human colonocytes use butyrate in preference to glucose, glutamine or&#xD;
      ketone bodies as fuel source (27). Thus, in contrast to small intestinal cells, colonic&#xD;
      epithelial cells derive the major part of their energy supply from the lumen rather than from&#xD;
      the blood. Depriving luminal nutrition of the mucosa has been found to induce fluid secretion&#xD;
      (29). The lack of luminal SCFAs in the colon may be involved in special diarrhoeal states&#xD;
      such as diversion colitis and antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is not uncommon&#xD;
      after abdominal operations, particularly after closure of a temporary colostomy (30).&#xD;
      Although there is no proof, this postoperative diarrhoea might be attributed to lack SCFAs in&#xD;
      the colon, which might perhaps be reversed by the intake of fermentable fiber (31). Lengthy&#xD;
      preoperative bowel preparation by antibiotic and lavage, and diminished oral nutrition&#xD;
      probably contributes to postoperative diarrhoea. Lack of luminal SCFAs can similarly explain&#xD;
      the diarrhoea often seen in the terminal stages of malnutrition and starvation. In these&#xD;
      conditions, intestinal infections might not always be implicated and it seems likely that&#xD;
      diarrhoea is a manifestation of organ-specific malnutrition of the colon (32). Diarrhoea is&#xD;
      often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and colonization by toxin&#xD;
      producing clostridium difficile accounts for only a third of these cases (33). The use of&#xD;
      antibiotics suppresses the formation of SCFAs from fermentable carbohydrate (34), a feature&#xD;
      that might also be responsible for diarrhoea. Although there are lots of data suggesting&#xD;
      antidiarrhoeal effect of fermentable fibers, their therapeutic application in diarrhoeal&#xD;
      disease is yet to be examined. Some recent clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial&#xD;
      effect of dietary fiber in treatment of adult cholera (35) and in the treatment of children&#xD;
      with acute diarrhoea (36). In children with acute diarrhoea, Benefiber-added ORS has been&#xD;
      observed to reduce the mean duration of diarrhoea by 16 hours, (74 vs. 90 h; p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of Benefiber in reducing severity and&#xD;
      duration of cholera, a form of severe dehydrating diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guar gum: a soluble fiber&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guar gum is a dietary fiber obtained from the endosperm of the seeds of the Indian cluster&#xD;
      bean (Cyanopsis tetragonolobus) of the family Leguminosae. The guar plant is a pod bearing,&#xD;
      nitrogen-fixing legume, which has been grown for centuries in India and Pakistan, where it is&#xD;
      one of the principal crops and is used as food for both humans and animals. It is now being&#xD;
      grown in America for use in various industries (food, cosmetic and paper industries) (37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemically, guar gum is a non-starch polysaccharide, a galactomannan, which on contact with&#xD;
      water form a highly viscous gel. In the colon, guar gum is fermented to form SCFAs.&#xD;
      Initially, guar gum was used as thickener and emulsion stabilizer in food processing on the&#xD;
      basis of its gelling property (37). Our present interest about guar gum is its therapeutic&#xD;
      use as a dietary fiber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Benefiber&quot; (partially hydrolyzed guar gum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guar gum forms gel with water, is rather viscous, and thus unsuitable for therapeutic uses&#xD;
      (e.g. in liquid enteral nutrition). Benefiber is a partially-hydrolized (in vitro by the&#xD;
      enzyme endo-B-mannase) guar gum, which is a soluble fiber. It is expected that Benefiber will&#xD;
      be readily utilized by colonic microflora with the production of the same products of&#xD;
      fermentation as the guar gum. The partial hydrolysis of the guar gum (e.g. Benefiber) results&#xD;
      in significant reduction in the viscosity of the solution. It is also expected that it will&#xD;
      not cause any delay in gastric emptying and also will not interfere with normal absorption of&#xD;
      macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein and fat). In one study (38), the addition of Benefiber&#xD;
      to a liquid formulation of diet significantly delayed the colonic transit time without&#xD;
      affecting the oro-caecal transit time. The result of another recent study (39) in Liestal,&#xD;
      Switzerland observed that the Benefiber did not affect the absorption of glucose, amino acid&#xD;
      and fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefiber was chosen for this study for several reasons. First, it is partially-hydrolyzed&#xD;
      guar gum (PHGG), and it completely dissolves in water making a clear solution. Second, other&#xD;
      fibers are usually viscous, and thus not suitable for use in ORS; the amylase-resistant&#xD;
      starch is not soluble and it only makes a suspension. Third, in in vitro studies of&#xD;
      fermentation, using fresh faecal inoculate, SCFAs production was observed to be highest with&#xD;
      PHGG in comparison with the other commercial fiber substitutes (40). Fourth, in our study in&#xD;
      non-cholera diarrhoea in children, we observed PHGG to be clinically useful (36). In this&#xD;
      study (36), we used PHGG in a dose of 20g/L. This dose was selected arbitrarily on the basis&#xD;
      of standard dose used in the preparation of liquid formulation diets. In the proposed study,&#xD;
      we would like to test two different doses (25 g/L and 50 g/L) to determine if there is an&#xD;
      additional benefit of increasing the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the findings of our previous study as well as studies done elsewhere, we are very&#xD;
      hopeful that the addition of Benefiber to WHO-ORS would lead to its fermentation in the colon&#xD;
      resulting in the production of SCFAs, which would improve colonic function including colonic&#xD;
      absorption of salt and water and thus reduce the stool output as well as shorten the duration&#xD;
      of diarrhoea in adults with cholera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety issue of Benefiber&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefiber is a food material obtained from vegetable source has been used in cereals, juices,&#xD;
      shakes, yogurt, soups, backed goods, and as a fiber source in enteral nutrition products. It&#xD;
      has undergone extensive toxicity testing and found to be safe (41). In human volunteer&#xD;
      studies (38, 39), enteral nutrition products supplemented with Benefiber 20 g/L found to be&#xD;
      safe. Two clinical trials (36, Alam et al., unpublished data) in children have been performed&#xD;
      in ICDDR,B recently - in one study ORS was supplemented with Brenefiber 20 g/L and in other&#xD;
      study comminuted chicken-based diet was supplemented with Benefiber 20 g/L. No adverse&#xD;
      effects have been noted in these studies. In the proposed study, Benefiber will be&#xD;
      supplemented with ORS either 25 g/L or 50 g/L for the treatment of adult cholera. As the&#xD;
      cholera patients have profuse watery stools with short transit time, 50% of fibers are&#xD;
      expected to excrete through stool unchanged. As the treatment of cholera is for a short&#xD;
      duration (2-3 days), so we do not anticipate any adverse effects.&#xD;
