    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cixutumumab and temsirolimus in&#xD;
      treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      cixutumumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing&#xD;
      substances to them. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cixutumumab together with temsirolimus may kill more&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability; and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      the combination of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) with temsirolimus in patients with or without&#xD;
      biopsiable advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the biologic effect of each individual drug and this drug combination on&#xD;
      expression/phosphorylation of potential markers of response in patients with biopsiable&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess tumor metabolism by positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report the clinical tumor response of this combination in a descriptive fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE ESCALATION PHASE: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and&#xD;
      cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the MTD is determined,&#xD;
      subsequent patients are enrolled into the MTD expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTD EXPANSION COHORT: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 15 and 22 for course 1 and&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive cixutumumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes on days 15 and 22 for course 1 and&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive temsirolimus IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP C: Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes and cixutumumab IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.&#xD;
