      The overall goal of this project is to identify genes that are involved in the development of&#xD;
      airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in asthmatics, and to determine whether&#xD;
      polymorphisms in these differentially expressed genes predispose individuals to develop&#xD;
      asthma. In this project, we hypothesize that polymorphisms of genes expressed by the airway&#xD;
      epithelia in asthmatics following specific airway challenges predispose individuals to the&#xD;
      development of asthma.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to identify genes that are involved in the development of&#xD;
      airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in asthmatics, and to determine whether&#xD;
      polymorphisms in these differentially expressed genes predispose individuals to develop&#xD;
      asthma. Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that is caused by a number of unique gene-gene&#xD;
      and gene-environment interactions. The search for asthma susceptibility genes has been&#xD;
      complicated by the broad clinical phenotype of asthma, the polygenic inheritance pattern of&#xD;
      this disease, and the substantial role of environmental exposures in the development and&#xD;
      progression of asthma. Inhaled environmental agents induce several biologic responses in&#xD;
      asthmatics; including the induction of acquired and innate immunity that leads to acute and&#xD;
      chronic forms of airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Acquired immune responses to&#xD;
      protein antigens, such as house dust mite allergen, often induce type 2 T lymphocyte-driven&#xD;
      responses (Th2) which appear to be important in atopic asthma. Recent studies by our group&#xD;
      and others demonstrate that innate immunity, initiated by inhalation of bacterial and viral&#xD;
      pathogens, organic dusts, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), air pollution particulate&#xD;
      matter, and ozone, can also cause acute and chronic forms of airflow obstruction, airway&#xD;
      inflammation, and even airway remodeling. Emerging evidence indicates that both acquired and&#xD;
      innate immune responses in the lung may be influenced by polymorphic genes. For instance,&#xD;
      functional polymorphisms in the IL-4 receptor gene are thought to preferentially stimulate&#xD;
      acquired Th2 immune responses to inhaled allergens, and we have recently shown that common&#xD;
      co-segregating mutations in TLR4 (a transmembrane receptor for LPS) are associated with&#xD;
      diminished airway responsiveness to inhaled LPS. These observations suggest that&#xD;
      environmental challenges can be used to narrow the phenotype of asthma and investigate&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility in biologically specific forms of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we hypothesize that polymorphisms of genes expressed by the airway epithelia&#xD;
      in asthmatics following specific airway challenges predispose individuals to the development&#xD;
      of asthma. To test this hypothesis, we plan to identify the genes that are differentially&#xD;
      expressed by airway epithelial cells following challenge with stimuli that induce acquired&#xD;
      (house dust mite) or innate (LPS) immune responses, and then determine whether polymorphisms&#xD;
      in these genes are associated with the development of asthma in a separate, well&#xD;
      characterized, familial cohort of asthmatics. This is a powerful approach that is designed to&#xD;
      identify novel genes that are associated with both asthma pathogenesis (differentially&#xD;
      expressed in the exposure-response study) and asthma susceptibility (genetically associated&#xD;
      with asthma in a linkage/association study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that individuals with the co-segregating Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile mutations in&#xD;
      the TLR4 gene will exhibit a defective immune response to LPS, and that specific components&#xD;
      of altered immunity in these individuals are linked to characteristic airway responses to&#xD;
      LPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Approximately 1000 individuals will be genotyped in order to establish 3&#xD;
      study groups: 10 subjects homozygous for the TLR4 299/399 mutation; 10 subjects heterozygous&#xD;
      for the TLR4 299/399 mutation; and 10 subjects homozygous for wild type TLR 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Ten individuals with wild type TLR4, 10 individuals heterozygous for mutant&#xD;
      TLR4 and 10 individuals homozygous for mutant TLR4 will be phenotyped for airway&#xD;
      responsiveness to inhaled LPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: In vitro immune responses to LPS will be measured in peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytes and PMNs from 10 individuals with wild type TLR4, 10 individuals heterozygous for&#xD;
      mutant TLR4 and 10 individuals homozygous for mutant TLR4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: The in vivo immune response to inhaled LPS will be assessed in&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cells, and airway endobronchial brush biopsy cells in&#xD;
      10 individuals with wild type TLR4, 10 individuals heterozygous for mutant TLR4 and 10&#xD;
      individuals homozygous for mutant TLR4.&#xD;
