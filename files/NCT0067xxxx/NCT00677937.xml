  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify people at high diabetes risk within the local population and then&#xD;
      implement and evaluate a pragmatic and low-cost diabetes prevention programme containing&#xD;
      structured education on lifestyle, physical activity and food choices. An ongoing support&#xD;
      framework will continue to reinforce and maintain the participant's individual goals to&#xD;
      prevent the development of diabetes and reduce cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the principal question is: can we significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes&#xD;
      through structured education in a high risk multi-ethnic UK population?&#xD;

      T2DM is an increasing chronic disease affecting over 2 million people in England alone,&#xD;
      shortens life and consumes 10% of NHS resources. At diagnosis many have established&#xD;
      complications involving damage to the eyes, kidneys, feet and heart. There is a need to focus&#xD;
      efforts to prevent this devastating disease. One in 7 adults have Pre-diabetes (PDM) with 50%&#xD;
      developing T2DM over the next 5-10 years. There is clear evidence that treating subjects with&#xD;
      PDM with an intensive lifestyle modification programme (LSMP) dramatically reduces T2DM.&#xD;
      These programmes are not cost effective, involve intensive use of resources and are unproven&#xD;
      in the UK. Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of T2DM, any LSMP would need to be&#xD;
      culturally sensitive. Our objective is to test if we can develop a low cost but effective&#xD;
      LSMP for the UK. We will develop a training programme to skill healthcare professionals and&#xD;
      non-professionals and so called 'lay' educators to deliver the LSMP. Benefits of lay&#xD;
      educators are patient involvement in a patient centred service and the contribution to&#xD;
      building capacity within the NHS workforce. We will develop a simple self-assessment tool to&#xD;
      identify those at highest risk of T2DM. We will conduct a clinical trial, testing the LSMP in&#xD;
      50 practices and 816 patients. The practices will be randomised to either a control or&#xD;
      intervention 'arm'. Control practices will give information to patients at risk in line with&#xD;
      current best practice. Subjects in the Intervention practices will be invited to the LSMP and&#xD;
      will receive 6 hours of group education over 3 months plus ongoing contact. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 3 years. The LSMP will encourage individuals to scrutinise information, ask&#xD;
      questions, and self-manage their condition, using simple, non-technical language and visual&#xD;
      aids. This approach has been effective in T2DM and we will use this model along with&#xD;
      expertise in physical activity and lifestyle change, working with leading experts. The study&#xD;
      is designed to show if we can significantly reduce the risk of developing T2DM, as well as&#xD;
      the effect on weight, blood pressure, patients' quality of life, physical activity and&#xD;
      dietary behaviours. We will demonstrate its cost effectiveness to ensure relevance to the&#xD;
      NHS. The research team have international expertise in prevention of T2DM.&#xD;
