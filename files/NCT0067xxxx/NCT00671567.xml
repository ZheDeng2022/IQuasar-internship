      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Ramelteon, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), in adult subjects with chronic insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep or complaints of&#xD;
      nonrestorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third&#xD;
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples&#xD;
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were&#xD;
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;&#xD;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the&#xD;
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the&#xD;
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep&#xD;
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ramelteon is a melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda Chemical&#xD;
      Industries, Ltd, for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for the treatment of&#xD;
      Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of 35-day treatment of chronic&#xD;
      insomnia with Ramelteon, using subjective measures of sleep. Total subject participation time&#xD;
      in this study is expected to be approximately 2 months.&#xD;
