      This study will test and compare computerized and paper versions of eye questionnaires.&#xD;
      Questionnaires are used in medicine to gain a better understanding of how a disease can&#xD;
      impact a person's quality of life. Computerized versions of such questionnaires are often as&#xD;
      good as or better than paper versions, but there has been no direct comparison of the two.&#xD;
      This study may help in the development of eye questionnaires used to understand symptoms and&#xD;
      monitor patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 21 years of age and older with ocular surface disease (OSD) and matched control&#xD;
      subjects without OSD may be eligible for this study. All participants undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and eye history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vision test and examination of the front part of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tear measurement: A small piece of paper is placed on the surface of the eye to measure&#xD;
           the amount of tears produced. The consistency of the tears is measured by looking at how&#xD;
           fast they evaporate from the surface of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of either paper-based or computer-based version of a questionnaire 15 minutes&#xD;
           after the eye examination and completion of the other version within 1 week at home.&#xD;
           (Subjects who complete the paper version in the clinic are told how to access the&#xD;
           computer version online at home or on a library computer; those who complete the&#xD;
           computer version in the clinic are given a paper version to take home.)&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to compare the health-related quality of life (visual&#xD;
      function) reported by participants when using web-based questionnaires versus their responses&#xD;
      obtained when using standard paper versions of the questionnaires. This comparison will be&#xD;
      performed in a population of patients diagnosed with ocular surface disease (OSD) and in age-&#xD;
      and gender-matched controls by using a randomized, cross-over study design. This type of&#xD;
      comparative study of patient-reported outcomes has been reported for rheumatology,&#xD;
      cardiology, psychiatry, asthma, alcoholism, pain assessment, gastrointestinal disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, and allergy populations; however, to our knowledge there have been no reports of&#xD;
      such a study from patients with ocular disease. The study will evaluate the agreement between&#xD;
      scores reported via two modes of administration: a web-based version and a paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      version. Components of three questionnaires commonly used to evaluate visual function,&#xD;
      symptoms, and vision-related quality of life in OSD will be included: the initial 5 questions&#xD;
      of the Ocular Surface Index (OSDI), question #15 of the National Eye Institute Visual&#xD;
      Functioning Questionnaire - 25 (VFQ-25), and specified domains of the National Eye Institute&#xD;
      Refractive Error Quality Of Life Instrument-42 (RQL-42) (clarity of vision, near vision, far&#xD;
      vision, glare, symptoms, worry, and satisfaction with correction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate whether there are differences in mean overall score by age,&#xD;
      gender, order of administration, or disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular surface disease, which includes dry eye disease secondary to a variety of etiologies,&#xD;
      is an ophthalmic condition which places a burden not just on functional vision, but also on&#xD;
      overall health related quality of life (HRQoL), with an impact similar to that of moderate&#xD;
      angina3. This study will add to the body of knowledge in the field of patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome measures (PROs), and will be the first to compare the computerized, web-based and&#xD;
      paper-based versions of previously validated questionnaires used to assess QoL in subjects&#xD;
      with ocular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been an increasing interest in assessing PROs in many fields of medicine,&#xD;
      especially in the context of clinical trials where HRQoL is an important component of the&#xD;
      overall evaluation of an intervention or treatment. As the use of computers increases and&#xD;
      accessibility to the internet broadens, there is a tremendous potential in harnessing this&#xD;
      technology in the future as a cost-effective, efficient way to gather clinical data on PROs&#xD;
      for future ophthalmic clinical trials and studies.&#xD;
