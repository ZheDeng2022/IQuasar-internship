    <textblock>
      This study compares two medications for analgesic potency and side effects in a sample of&#xD;
      individuals with moderate pain. After screening, eligible participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to begin blinded treatment with one of two medications. Participants receive 5 daily&#xD;
      doses of medication (no more than 2 days between each dose) followed by crossover to the&#xD;
      opposite treatment condition for 5 additional daily doses. Each study day, participants will&#xD;
      provide a daily pain assessment, receive administration of study medication, and will then be&#xD;
      monitored and assessed for pain and side effects over 6 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of chronic pain typically relies on the effectiveness of opioid analgesics,&#xD;
      however, side effects and the potential for users to develop tolerance and addiction may make&#xD;
      physicians hesitant to prescribe them. The development of opioid analgesics with fewer side&#xD;
      effects and decreased potential tolerance and addiction would increase the ability to safely&#xD;
      and effectively treat pain. This study will determine whether the addition of an ultra-low&#xD;
      dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, to buprenorphine, an opioid analgesic pain&#xD;
      medication, increases the analgesic potency and reduces side effects compared to&#xD;
      buprenorphine alone. Low doses of naloxone added to buprenorphine have been shown to increase&#xD;
      the potency and reduce the side effects of buprenorphine in animal studies and in a human&#xD;
      study with healthy volunteers. The current study aims to extend these findings by assessing&#xD;
      the analgesic potency and side effects of a 15:1 ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone in a&#xD;
      sample of 12 outpatient participants with moderate pain (4 or greater pain intensity) who are&#xD;
      experienced with opioid analgesics. Participants will be randomly assigned to begin blinded&#xD;
      treatment starting with one of two medication regimens: IV buprenorphine + ultra-low-dose&#xD;
      naloxone or IV buprenorphine alone. Participants receive 5 daily doses of medication (no more&#xD;
      than 2 days between each dose) followed by crossover to the opposite treatment condition for&#xD;
      5 additional daily doses. Each study day, participants will provide a daily pain assessment,&#xD;
      receive administration of study medication, and will then be monitored and assessed for pain&#xD;
      and side effects over the next six hours. Outcomes for the study include: (1) pain intensity&#xD;
      as measured using the Brief Pain Inventory, pain intensity numerical rating scale, and the&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory, and (2) self-reported side effects/adverse events. After&#xD;
      completion of study participation, participants will resume pre-study pain treatments with&#xD;
      their own physician.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have chronic pain that is not related to cancer, defined as pain expected to last a&#xD;
             month or more,(i.e. musculoskeletal pain or neuropathic pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Report pain of moderate to moderately-severe intensity during the week prior to the&#xD;
             baseline screening visit (a score greater than or equal to 4 for average pain in the&#xD;
             past week on the 0-10 point Pain Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have used prescription opioid and/or non-opioid analgesics for the pain on at least 15&#xD;
             of the 30 days prior to the initial baseline/screening visit and have clearance from&#xD;
             their prescribing physician to discontinue all non-study-related opiates during study&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing and able to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to provide written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If female, not pregnant or lactating and willing to use an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control (e.g., condoms, IUD, birth control pills, or Depo-Provera)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must not meet any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a history of dependence on opiates, stimulants, alcohol, or benzodiazepines, as&#xD;
             defined by DSM-IV criteria, within the past year (physical dependence on prescribed&#xD;
             opioid analgesics is allowed but opioid dependence according to DSM-IV, i.e. opioid&#xD;
             addiction, is not)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of any illicit or recreational drugs (heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana,&#xD;
             etc.) ; or use of any long-acting opioid (i.e., methadone) in the 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             initial screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concomitant use of medications that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals,&#xD;
             macrolide antibiotics, and HIV protease inhibitors), or medications that induce CYP3A4&#xD;
             activity (e.g., anticonvulsants and rifampin) that may alter the metabolism of&#xD;
             buprenorphine&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a medical condition that, in the study physician's judgment, may interfere with&#xD;
             safe study participation for the individual study candidate. Because medical&#xD;
             conditions may differ in terms of safe participation on an individual basis, this&#xD;
             criterion must be based on a physician's determination after a medical history, exam,&#xD;
             and lab tests and may also involve consultation with a study candidate's primacy care&#xD;
             physician. Some examples of medical conditions that may be exclusionary for a&#xD;
             particular individual, however include active tuberculosis, unstable and/or&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular or liver disease, unstable diabetes (i.e., glycosylated&#xD;
             hemoglobin A1C of 12%), uncontrolled HIV infection, altered renal function (serum&#xD;
             creatinine males and females:&gt;3x upper limit of normal) or clinically significant&#xD;
             elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST greater than 3x the upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a current neurological disorder (e.g., organic brain disease, dementia) or&#xD;
             current major psychiatric disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar illness, or PTSD)&#xD;
             that would make study agent compliance difficult, that would compromise informed&#xD;
             consent, or that would jeopardize safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of suicide attempts in the past 180 days and/or current serious&#xD;
             suicidal risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any history of a seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have a known allergy or sensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Receiving long-acting opioids, such as methadone, LAAM, or sustained release morphine,&#xD;
             for treatment of pain (due to problems with initiating buprenorphine treatment among&#xD;
             patients receiving long-acting opioids)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have recent surgery or a major medical procedure that could potentially interfere with&#xD;
             study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other circumstances that, in the opinion of the investigators, would interfere&#xD;
             with study participation&#xD;
