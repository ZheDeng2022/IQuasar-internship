  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health problem in this country. It is&#xD;
      estimated that at least one out of every seven women in our society have been the victim of&#xD;
      childhood sexual abuse at least once before their 18th birthday. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that stress is associated with damage to neurons of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in&#xD;
      learning and memory. Also, imaging studies of brain function are consistent with dysfunction&#xD;
      of the medial prefrontal cortex during presentation of traumatic cues. We have previously&#xD;
      shown that serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications (paroxetine; Paxil) can change memory&#xD;
      function and hippocampal structure in PTSD. We now propose to perform a placebo controlled&#xD;
      study with Paxil CR (paroxetine hydrochloride controlled-release tablets), which is thought&#xD;
      as paroxetine with less side-effects. The main purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effects of Paxil CR on memory deficits measured with neuropsychological testing, hippocampal&#xD;
      volume measured with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medial prefrontal lobe cortical&#xD;
      function estimated with PET, and cortisol response (reflecting the intensity of stress) in&#xD;
      men and women with PTSD. We plan to recruit 40 subjects. After completing physical&#xD;
      examination and evaluating neuropsychiatric history, patients will undergo an initial group&#xD;
      of tests which includes memory testing, MRI and PET brain scan, and measurement of cortisol&#xD;
      in their saliva. Afterwards, half will receive Paxil CR 12.5 to 62.5 mg and half will receive&#xD;
      a placebo (sugar pill) in the beginning of the first 12 weeks as &quot;Double Blind Phase&quot;. After&#xD;
      12 weeks, they will be administered memory tests, PET and MRI scan for the post-treatment&#xD;
      phase. After this period, Paxil CR will be offered to the placebo group and followed for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks. They will have final memory tests, and a MRI scan. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      Paxil CR exerts its efficacy by acting on abnormal neural circuits, including hippocampus and&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex, in PTSD.&#xD;
