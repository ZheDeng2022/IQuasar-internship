      New evidence suggests that autistic disorder (AD) may be associated with abnormalities in&#xD;
      folate metabolism, which is a process that affects genetic expression by facilitating the&#xD;
      formation of methyl donors for DNA methylation. Limited data show that some children with AD&#xD;
      show behavioral improvements with folic acid (FA) therapy, while others show a worsening&#xD;
      effect. If behavioral worsening is linked with abnormalities in folate metabolism, then&#xD;
      nutritional modifications could normalize these processes and result in clinical&#xD;
      improvements. To address this premise, we propose a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover&#xD;
      pilot study with two phases. The first phase will focus on the behavioral and biochemical&#xD;
      responses of children with AD to high-dose folic acid supplementation. Because FA is an&#xD;
      inactive folate that requires biochemical conversion to become active, and select genotypes&#xD;
      impede this conversion, our general hypothesis is that FA will yield behavioral improvements&#xD;
      in some children but exacerbate problem behaviors in others. During the second phase,&#xD;
      children who had a worsened behavioral response to FA during phase 1 will participate in an&#xD;
      open-label trial of high-dose Metafolin® supplementation. The focus here would similarly be&#xD;
      on the behavioral and biochemical outcomes of participating children following treatment with&#xD;
      the study supplement. Because Metafolin® is an active folate metabolite that should not be&#xD;
      affected by genotypes in the folate pathway, our general hypothesis for phase 2 is that&#xD;
      Metafolin® would yield behavioral improvements without the risk for behavioral worsening.&#xD;
      Results from this project may provide support for continued study of the potential&#xD;
      relationship between folate metabolism and problem behaviors among children with AD,&#xD;
      potentially justifying the need to examine effects of folate supplementation among a larger&#xD;
      sample of affected children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited data on the use of folic acid as a treatment for children with autistic&#xD;
      disorder (AD). Most experimentation thus far has focused on the effects of folic acid&#xD;
      supplementation in small samples of males with fragile X syndrome (FRAX), and many of these&#xD;
      participants did not meet criteria for AD but were said to exhibit autistic-like features.&#xD;
      Initial case reports suggested folic acid might be an effective treatment for FRAX, some of&#xD;
      which noted a reduced expression of the fragile site Xq27 in blood cultures. Subsequent work&#xD;
      found that high doses of folic acid supplementation reduced the percentage of FRAX positive&#xD;
      cells and increased plasma-folate concentrations among 9 males with FRAX. Autistic-like&#xD;
      behaviors were said to improve for the 5 youngest participants (age range 3 years, 5 months&#xD;
      to 9 years, 10 months); however, one adult, aged 49, developed an increase in motor activity&#xD;
      and aggressiveness during treatment. His behavior returned to pretreatment levels following&#xD;
      discontinuation of folic acid. In similar work, researchers employed a crossover design using&#xD;
      4 boys (ages 6 to 14) with comorbid autism and FRAX to assess efficacy of folic acid&#xD;
      supplementation. Favorable behavioral changes were noted for 3 boys; however, for 2 of them,&#xD;
      carryover effects of folic acid into the placebo period may have clouded the magnitude of&#xD;
      potential differences in folic acid versus placebo effects. No changes throughout the trial&#xD;
      were evidenced for the fourth child, who was also the oldest and the only one to have&#xD;
      commenced puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, investigations on folic acid supplementation with small groups of FRAX participants&#xD;
      have yielded inconsistent findings, with favorable behavioral and/or biochemical effects for&#xD;
      some but not others. Moreover, the findings cannot be generalized to the broader population&#xD;
      of children with AD who do not have FRAX. Our search of the literature uncovered only one&#xD;
      report of folic acid treatment prescribed for 2 children without FRAX, one of whom was&#xD;
      described as psychotic with mental retardation and the other, as having a diagnosis of&#xD;
      autism. For both children, behaviors were notably improved with treatment and returned to&#xD;
      problematic levels when folic acid therapy stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these few empirical studies, there are numerous anecdotal reports of families&#xD;
      using folate treatments with their children, most of which are promulgated through Internet&#xD;
      websites and the Autism Research Institute's (ARI) publication, Autism Research Review&#xD;
      International. For the most part, these reports are favorable. Additionally, the ARI recently&#xD;
      published findings from their web-based investigation on the parent-reported use and efficacy&#xD;
      of a wide range of treatments for children with AD. Of the 1437 families who indicated use of&#xD;
      folic acid as a therapeutic supplement, 42% said their children got better, 54% said their&#xD;
      children did not exhibit noticeable changes, and 3% said their children got worse. Taken&#xD;
      together, these limited data support the possibility for folic acid and other folates to&#xD;
      generate favorable outcomes among children with AD; this may hold true particularly for&#xD;
      pre-adolescent children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of empirically sound information about folic-acid efficacy among children with AD,&#xD;
      however, also leaves open the possibility that increased supplementation may not be helpful&#xD;
      and could, in fact, be harmful. There is some evidence to suggest that high doses of folic&#xD;
      acid supplementation produce negative physiological and/or behavioral responses, such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disturbances, sleep difficulties, malaise/irritability, and&#xD;
      excitability/overactivity in a sample of typical adults. Many of these symptoms are similar&#xD;
      if not identical to those described more generally in children with AD. Additionally, just as&#xD;
      there are favorable anecdotal reports of folic acid treatment, there are negative ones, as&#xD;
      well. For example, parents of one teenager with AD told us that, when their son participated&#xD;
      in a stepwise-administered supplement program and folic acid was administered as the final&#xD;
      supplement, he became extremely agitated, self-injurious, aggressive toward parents, prone to&#xD;
      frantic gesturing, and developed sleep difficulties. When the folic acid was withdrawn, his&#xD;
      behaviors gradually subsided to a pre-supplementation level (personal communication,&#xD;
      September 27, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to whether folic acid supplementation might be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; an alternative explanation&#xD;
      is that folic acid may be beneficial in some circumstances and harmful in others. This&#xD;
      explanation is potentially attractive if one hypothesizes that the conversion of homocysteine&#xD;
      to methionine (for which folate is necessary) is beneficial, but that high doses of folic&#xD;
      acid can lead to anti-folate effects by accumulation of &quot;free folic acid.&quot; For individuals&#xD;
      with an imbalanced metabolic profile but adequate levels of B12, it seems that folic acid&#xD;
      supplementation would yield favorable effects by normalizing this profile. However, folic&#xD;
      acid supplementation could lead to problematic behaviors through any one or combination of&#xD;
      biological scenarios, including accumulation of unmetabolized pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) in&#xD;
      serum, B12 deficiency, and/or genotypes known to impede the biochemical conversion of folic&#xD;
      acid. Given that negative responses to folic acid supplementation have typically been&#xD;
      reported among adolescents and adults, it is further possible that this phenomenon is&#xD;
      regulated by maturational processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possibility for achieving maximum folate benefit without the risk of anti-folate effects&#xD;
      is through supplementation with a form of folate, Metafolin, that can serve directly as a&#xD;
      methyl donor. Metafolin is the L-form isomer of 5- methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and,&#xD;
      presumably, a more active compound than folic acid or folinic acid (leucovorin). Metafolin&#xD;
      has been approved for use in the U.S. as a dietary supplement since 2001. While studies&#xD;
      around the globe have tested the safety of 5-MTHF at doses up to 17mg, there have not yet&#xD;
      been any studies to examine its efficacy as a therapeutic agent in specific&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders. However, folinic acid (5,10- MTHF), which immediately precedes&#xD;
      5-MTHF in the folate-metabolism cycle, has been investigated repeatedly as a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic agent for this population. In one such study, James et al. examined the&#xD;
      biochemical effects of folinic acid supplementation in conjunction with betaine and vitamin&#xD;
      B12 on the biochemical outcomes of children with imbalanced metabolic profiles. This team&#xD;
      initially discovered that, compared with a control group, children with AD had significantly&#xD;
      lower baseline concentrations of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and homocysteine and&#xD;
      significantly higher concentrations of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and adenosine--a&#xD;
      metabolic profile that is consistent with impaired capacity for methylation. Following&#xD;
      supplementation with the study treatments, the metabolic imbalance within the AD group was&#xD;
      normalized. This same research team recently published results from an extension of this work&#xD;
      in which they assessed levels of folate-related metabolites and genotypes for select enzymes.&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of children with AD had severely abnormal metabolic profiles; additionally,&#xD;
      &quot;...several susceptibility alleles that perturb a common metabolic pathway were increased&#xD;
      among the autistic children. The hypothesis that a genetic component of autism could involve&#xD;
      multiple susceptibility alleles that interact to create a fragile, environmentally sensitive&#xD;
      metabolic imbalance is worthy of further pursuit,&quot; (electronic copy; no page number&#xD;
      available).&#xD;
