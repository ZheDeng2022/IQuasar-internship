      Primary objective to determine the maximal tolerated (MTD) of dasatinib in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives to describe the toxicity of this combination of therapy; to describe the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters related to this combination; to describe the&#xD;
      clinical activity as defined as the response rate (complete and partial response rate) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival &gt; 6 month; to compare the SRC pathway microarray signature in pre&#xD;
      and post-treatment cancer specimens; to evaluate SRC pathway downstream substrates, FAX,&#xD;
      paxcillin, and CRK-L in pre and post-treatment cancer specimens.&#xD;

      This is a phase I multicenter study designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and toxicity of dasatinib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first&#xD;
      cycle of treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and tubal&#xD;
      carcinoma. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable&#xD;
      patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) due to the combination of dasatinib,&#xD;
      paclitaxel,and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Dasatinib will be administered as an oral dose (tablet) as per the dose escalation (50 mg everyday - 250 mg everyday)continuously on days 2-21 in the first cycle (3 weeks) therapy and continuously (days 1-21) throughout the remainder of therapy.&#xD;
Paclitaxel will be administered on a 21-day schedule. Paclitaxel (150-175 mg/m^2) IV infused over 3 hours on day #1 of each cycle.&#xD;
Carboplatin (AUC=5-6 mg/,l/min) will be infused over 30-60 minutes every cycle via IV on day 1 of every cycle following the paclitaxel administration.&#xD;
All patients will be followed until disease progression or study withdrawal. In addition, following disease progression, patients will be monitored for delayed toxicity and survival for a period of 5 years and data entered into eDC, unless is withdrawn.</description>
