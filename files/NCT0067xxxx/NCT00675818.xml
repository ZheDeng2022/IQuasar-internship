    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit is common, devastating and costly.&#xD;
      However, minimal evidence exists to guide the prescription of optimal renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (RRT). An important area of uncertainty surrounds the relative effects of convective&#xD;
      versus diffusive modes of clearance. Although both clearance modes provide similar degrees of&#xD;
      small molecule clearance, convective modes permit the enhanced clearance of larger-sized&#xD;
      molecules which may mediate kidney and systemic toxicity in the setting of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs) are frequently applied in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with AKI. Convective clearance, as applied through continuous venovenous&#xD;
      hemofiltration (CVVH) and diffusive clearance, as applied through continuous venovenous&#xD;
      hemodialysis (CVVHD), may be readily compared in the context of patients receiving CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger study that&#xD;
      will determine whether convective clearance (hemofiltration) confers improved outcomes as&#xD;
      compared to diffusive clearance (hemodialysis) in patients with AKI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal mode of clearance in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who&#xD;
      require renal replacement therapy (RRT) is unclear. Although both convection (as provided by&#xD;
      hemofiltration) and diffusion (as provided by hemodialysis) provide equivalent removal of&#xD;
      small-sized molecules, hemofiltration offers the potential for removal of large molecules&#xD;
      many of which may be toxic. Hemofiltration and hemodialysis have never been compared in a&#xD;
      rigorous randomized trial to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) are widely used in the management of critically&#xD;
      ill patients with AKI and current CRRT technology provides a practical platform on which to&#xD;
      compare convective and diffusive clearance. We hypothesize that continuous venovenous&#xD;
      hemofiltration (CVVH)- at identical doses of small molecule clearance that are provided by&#xD;
      the comparison treatment of continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)- leads to improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an unblinded pilot RCT designed to test the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      subsequent large scale study that will assess whether CVVH leads to improved patient outcomes&#xD;
      (ie, survival, renal recovery) as compared to CVVHD. Although we will be collecting the full&#xD;
      array of patient-relevant data for up to 60 days following randomization, the main purpose of&#xD;
      this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting, treating and following&#xD;
      patients for a study designed to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment target for this study is 75 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion and exclusion criteria are designed to enroll patients with AKI on the basis of&#xD;
      presumed acute tubular necrosis who would ordinarily be candidates for continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapies (CRRT) in Canada. The overall philosophy is to enroll and begin&#xD;
      applying the study therapy as close as possible to the clinical need to start renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Similarly, we would like to avoid enrolling patients whose risk of death&#xD;
      is so high that the study therapy is unlikely to impact on the clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will employ equivalent doses of hemofiltration (35 mL/kg/hr of replacement fluid) and&#xD;
      hemodialysis (35 mL/kg/hr of dialysate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapies will be administered using Primsaflex machines (Gambro Inc.) using regional citrate&#xD;
      anticoagulation, heparin anticoagulation or no anticoagulation. Hospital-specific protocols&#xD;
      for anticoagulation will be used. We have obtained Health Canada permission to utilize&#xD;
      Prismocal, Normocarb, Hemosol BO and Prismasol 4 as infusates in patients receiving CVVH.&#xD;
