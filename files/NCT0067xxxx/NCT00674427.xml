      This study is for patients with relapsed of disease after allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor's T cells are activated by exposure to 2 compounds or antibodies that bind (or&#xD;
      stick to) two compounds on T cells called CD3 and CD28. When these antibodies stick to both&#xD;
      CD3 and CD28 on the T cells, the T cells becomes stimulated (or &quot;activated&quot;) and grows. CD3&#xD;
      and CD28 are the coating of a T cell and a T cell is part of the body's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that when T cells are exposed to both of antibodies to CD3 and CD28 compounds&#xD;
      at the same time, they become activated or &quot;stimulated&quot; and may be more effective in fighting&#xD;
      infections or cancer cells. We call this therapy &quot;activated donor lymphocyte infusions, or&#xD;
      activated DLI (aDLI)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is being performed to see whether it is safe and effective to administer&#xD;
      higher doses of activated DLI or repeated doses of activated DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard donor lymphocyte infusions first, and in addition will&#xD;
      receive activated donor lymphocytes approximately 12 days later (DLI followed by aDLI).&#xD;
      Depending on the response to this treatment, and depending on possible side effects (such as&#xD;
      graft-vs-host disease as described below), patients in remission will then receive additional&#xD;
      aDLI every 3 months for 4 more times, and patients not in remission within 6-12 weeks will&#xD;
      receive higher dose aDLI. The timing of the higher dose aDLI will be determined by your&#xD;
      physician depending on your disease and the rate of progression of your disease. The aDLI can&#xD;
      be given as early as 6 weeks, or as late as 12 weeks (3 months).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to participate in this research study because your disease has relapsed&#xD;
      after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (putting normal bone marrow from one person into&#xD;
      another that was a brother/sister, a matched family member, or an unrelated donor). This&#xD;
      study is testing a treatment for your relapsed disease after bone marrow transplant (BMT)&#xD;
      that uses infusions of your bone marrow donor's immune cells (system which protects the body&#xD;
      from disease); these immune cells are white blood cells called leukocytes or lymphocytes&#xD;
      (called T cells). In allogeneic BMT, we know that the donor's immune system (system which&#xD;
      protects the body from disease and is comprised primarily of lymphocytes, or white blood&#xD;
      cells) is very important for the control and elimination of leukemia after bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation. Many studies have shown that treatment with transfusions of the bone marrow&#xD;
      donor's lymphocytes can lead to a complete remission in patients that have relapsed after&#xD;
      BMT. This procedure is called donor lymphocyte infusion, or &quot;DLI&quot;. The conventional or&#xD;
      standard way to give donor lymphocyte infusions (referred to as DLI) is to take the&#xD;
      lymphocytes from the blood of the original bone marrow donor blood and infuse them directly&#xD;
      into a patient with relapsed disease without any processing of the lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients have a very good chance of achieving remission after donor lymphocyte infusions&#xD;
      (such as patients with early stages of CML). Standard DLI after allogeneic BMT have been less&#xD;
      effective for patients with advanced leukemia (AML, ALL, or &quot;accelerated phase&quot; and &quot;blast&#xD;
      crisis&quot; CML), or patients with other diseases such as myelodysplasia, CLL, Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because of your disease, your physician estimates a chance of&#xD;
      less than 4 in 10 (40%) or less of responding to standard donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent clinical trial, we tested the safety of a new way to give DLI that might make&#xD;
      this treatment more effective. The donor lymphocytes (or T cells) are activated in the&#xD;
      laboratory before given to patients to try and make them more active. The donor's T cells are&#xD;
      activated by exposure to 2 compounds or antibodies that bind (or stick to) two compounds on T&#xD;
      cells called CD3 and CD28. When these antibodies stick to both CD3 and CD28 on the T cells,&#xD;
      the T cells becomes stimulated (or &quot;activated&quot;) and grows. CD3 and CD28 are the coating of a&#xD;
      T cell and a T cell is part of the body's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that when T cells are exposed to both of antibodies to CD3 and CD28 compounds&#xD;
      at the same time, they become activated or &quot;stimulated&quot; and may be more effective in fighting&#xD;
      infections or cancer cells. We call this therapy &quot;activated donor lymphocyte infusions, or&#xD;
      activated DLI (aDLI)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study in which patients received standard DLI and aDLI, we felt that responses&#xD;
      were at least as good as conventional DLI but too few patients were treated to know if&#xD;
      responses might be better. Unfortunately, as noted in other studies using DLI, about half of&#xD;
      the patients did not respond, and about half of the patients in remission had later relapse&#xD;
      of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is being performed to see whether it is safe and effective to administer&#xD;
      higher doses of activated DLI or repeated doses of activated DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are in remission at 3 months after receiving the initial activated DLI will&#xD;
           be treated with more activated donor lymphocytes every 3 months for a total of 4 more&#xD;
           times (3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after the first infusion) to test if&#xD;
           it is safe to give repeated doses of activated DLI and to see if repeated doses will&#xD;
           prevent subsequent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those patients who are not in remission 6-12 weeks after the initial activated DLI,&#xD;
           we will test whether it is safe and effective to give higher doses of activated donor&#xD;
           lymphocytes. Using the experimental procedures that activate the donor lymphocytes,&#xD;
           lymphocytes can also be grown up in the laboratory and 10 times more lymphocytes can be&#xD;
           given to you than can be obtained using more conventional DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, similar to our previous study with aDLI, all patients will receive standard&#xD;
      donor lymphocyte infusions first, and in addition will receive activated donor lymphocytes&#xD;
      approximately 12 days later (DLI followed by aDLI). Depending of the response to this&#xD;
      treatment, and depending on possible side effects (such as graft-vs-host disease as described&#xD;
      below), patients in remission will then receive additional aDLI every 3 months for 4 more&#xD;
      times, and patients not in remission within 6-12 weeks will receive higher dose aDLI. The&#xD;
      timing of the higher dose aDLI will be determined by your physician depending on your disease&#xD;
      and the rate of progression of your disease. The aDLI can be given as early as 6 weeks, or as&#xD;
      late as 12 weeks (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous study the highest dose of aDLI a patient received is the same as the dose to&#xD;
      be initially administered in this study which is 1 x 108 CD3+ cells/kg. However, this&#xD;
      research study will also include doses higher than those used in the previous study. Patients&#xD;
      in remission will receive the same dose of 1 x 108 CD3+ cells/kg on 4 additional occasions as&#xD;
      long as no unacceptable side effects are observed. Patients that are not in remission will&#xD;
      receive a dose that is 10 times higher.&#xD;
