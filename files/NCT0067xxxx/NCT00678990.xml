      In this study the islets will be surface modified to carry immobilised heparin (Corline&#xD;
      Heparin Conjugate) prior to transplantation. The primary objective is to investigate safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of allogeneic islet transplantation using islets coated with immobilised&#xD;
      heparin. The modification with heparin has been shown to protect the islets from being&#xD;
      attacked by the immediate defence systems in blood (coagulation and inflammation), so that a&#xD;
      larger portion of the islets will survive the initial phase and engraft. Evaluation will be&#xD;
      based on metabolic and blood chemistry parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transplantation of islets of Langerhans isolated from donated organs is a promising therapy&#xD;
      for diabetes type 1. The results so far have, however, not met with the expectations due to&#xD;
      relatively low efficiency. Even in situations where the patients have become insulin-free, it&#xD;
      has been estimated that the transplanted islet mass is less than 25% of the islet mass of a&#xD;
      healthy individual, which in many cases has required repeated use of insulin injections. The&#xD;
      islets are transferred to the patient by an infusion drop to the liver via the portal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches within the Nordic Network for Clinical Islet Transplantation have in a series of&#xD;
      publications shown that the islets are subject to a violent immunological reaction that is&#xD;
      non-specific with regard to the individual patient (IBMIR) during the initial contact with&#xD;
      blood (Moberg et al, Lancet 2002, among several). The IBMIR reaction is in the earliest phase&#xD;
      mediated by coagulation and complement reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the islets will be surface modified to carry immobilised heparin (Corline&#xD;
      Heparin Conjugate) prior to transplantation. The primary objective is to protect the islets&#xD;
      from being attacked by IBMIR so that a larger portion of the islets will survive the initial&#xD;
      phase and engraft. In a paper published by the research group (Cabric et. al., Diabetes, May&#xD;
      2007), the beneficial effects of immobilised heparin on the islets to counteract IBMIR were&#xD;
      shown by experiments at the lab bench and in experimental animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the transplantations in this study will be based on metabolic and blood&#xD;
      chemistry parameters, similar to the evaluations of other transplanted patients within the&#xD;
      Nordic Network.&#xD;
