    <textblock>
      Bosentan has been largely used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). It can&#xD;
      improve exercise capacity, lower Borg dyspnoea score nad these effects are usually associated&#xD;
      with the concomitant improvement in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No physiological study has so far verified the hypothesis that Bosentan may laso have an&#xD;
      effect on the &quot;respiratory side&quot; of the cadio-pulmonary system (i.e. on pulmonary mechanics&#xD;
      and work of breathing)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelins are powerful vasoconstrictor peptides that also play numerous other functions in&#xD;
      many different organs. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most abundant and important of this family&#xD;
      of peptides in blood vessels. Production of ET-1 is increased in the endothelium and the&#xD;
      kidney in salt-dependent models of hypertension ET-1 elicits an inflammatory response by&#xD;
      increasing oxidant stress in the vascular wall, which induces vascular remodeling and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction found in the hypertensive models that exhibit an endothelin-mediated&#xD;
      component. Endothelin receptor antagonists lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
      They could become therapeutic agents for prevention of target organ damage in hypertension&#xD;
      and in type 2 diabetes, chronic renal failure and congestive heart failure. Side effects of&#xD;
      endothelin receptor blockers have prevented up to the present their development for these&#xD;
      indications. Endothelin antagonists have been approved only for the treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, a rapidly fatal condition in which the endothelin system plays an important&#xD;
      role and endothelin antagonists exert favorable effects.The exact mechanism of action of ERAs&#xD;
      on the pulmonary vascular bed remains unclear. Vasodilatation is just a part of the&#xD;
      mechanism, since usually 70%-80% of Idiopathic PAH patients do not respond acutely to&#xD;
      vasodilators. Endothelin is likely to be involved in pulmonary vasoconstriction,&#xD;
      inflammation, cellular proliferation and fibrosis ie. remodelling Recent research illustrates&#xD;
      that bosentan is capable of blunting the vascular remodelling normally associated with PAH If&#xD;
      ERAs could prevent remodelling, they might substantially improve the long-term survival in&#xD;
      patients with mild symptoms (WHO class II or I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bosentan, the most popular endothelin receptor antagonist, has been largely used in the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). It can improve exercise capacity, lower Borg&#xD;
      dyspnoea score nad these effects are usually associated with the concomitant improvement in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary haemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No physiological study has so far verified the hypothesis that Bosentan may laso have an&#xD;
      effect on the &quot;respiratory side&quot; of the cadio-pulmonary system (i.e. on pulmonary mechanics&#xD;
