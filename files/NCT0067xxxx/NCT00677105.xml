    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of the drug (JNJ-24681585 a drug in&#xD;
      development for cancer) in patients with advanced or refractory solid malignancies or&#xD;
      lymphoma on the maximum dose that can be tolerated by these patients. The absorption,&#xD;
      breakdown and elimination of the drug will be studied and in some patients, the effect of the&#xD;
      food on these processes will also be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      JNJ-24681585 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It is a drug in development for&#xD;
      treatment of cancer. In this study, the safety (the effect on the body) of the drug in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or refractory solid malignancies or lymphoma will be studied. The&#xD;
      maximum dose that can be tolerated by patients will be determined. The absorption, break&#xD;
      down, and elimination of the drug will be studied and in some patients the effect of food on&#xD;
      these processes will be examined. Antitumor activity of JNJ-26481585 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JNJ-26481585 will be administered in a continuous regimen with 21-day treatment cycles. The&#xD;
      dose of JNJ-26481585 will start low and will be increased during the study in groups of 2 to&#xD;
      6 patients. The dose each patient receives at study entry will not increase, but patients who&#xD;
      receive drug at a later enrollment time may receive a higher dose. If a group of patients&#xD;
      does not have severe side effects, the next group of patients will get a higher dose. The&#xD;
      dose will increase until some patients have severe side effects. The dose will then be&#xD;
      decreased to a dose level where severe side effects are observed in less than 1/3 of&#xD;
      patients. Once a safe dose level has been determined an additional group of 12-24 patients&#xD;
      will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of JNJ-26481585 in the blood will be measured and the effect on the disease will&#xD;
      be evaluated in all patients. In some patients, the effect of food on the absorption, break&#xD;
      down, and elimination of the study drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility within 4 weeks before study treatment is given. The&#xD;
      treatment will consist of 21-day treatment cycles in a continuous once daily dosing regimen.&#xD;
      The duration of treatment will depend on adverse effects and whether there is benefit from&#xD;
      the treatment. The design of a cycle may be adjusted during the course of the study to&#xD;
      include days when there is no treatment (a pause) as guided by clinical observations. The&#xD;
      dosing regimen may be adjusted to twice daily or three times daily intake as guided by&#xD;
      information on how rapidly your body breaks down and eliminates the study drug. Patients will&#xD;
      be informed if there are changes in the design of a cycle or the dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first treatment cycle, patients are required to stay in the hospital for 3 or 4&#xD;
      nights. In addition there are 8 or 9 daytime visits during Cycles 1 and 2 (combined) that may&#xD;
      take up to 12 hours after the morning dose at 2 or 3 occasions and up to 4 hours after the&#xD;
      morning dose at the other 6 occasions. From Cycle 3 onwards, there is only 1 daytime visit&#xD;
      per treatment cycle, and these visits usually take up less time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, especially during Cycles 1 and 2, patients will undergo frequent blood&#xD;
      and urine tests, procedures to assess safety including heart function, and tests to assess&#xD;
      the course of the patients illness. Two weeks after the last dose of the study drug, patients&#xD;
      are required to return to the study site for follow-up assessments. JNJ-26481585 will be&#xD;
      provided as capsules and will be taken by mouth once daily throughout treatment. The starting&#xD;
      dose level will be 2 mg but the dose received by an individual patient will be determined at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment. Modifications to the treatment schedule or dosing regimen may be&#xD;
      explored during the course of this study. Patients can continue receiving treatment as long&#xD;
      as there is benefit as evaluated by the study doctor and there are no unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
