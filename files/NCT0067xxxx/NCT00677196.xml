      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the LMA StoneBreakerTM to the current standard of&#xD;
      pneumatic lithotripsy, the Swiss LithoClastR, during percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) is the preferred treatment modality for renal stones&#xD;
      greater than 2cm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pneumatic lithotriptor functions as a pneumatic jackhammer, providing either a single&#xD;
      pulse or a train of pulses at 2Hz as determined by the operator. Its chief advantage is its&#xD;
      ability to fragment even the hardest calculi. The pneumatic lithotriptor, while extremely&#xD;
      effective, does not utilize thermal energy and therefore has no risk of thermal damage to the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue. The pneumatic lithotriptor currently in use, the Swiss LithoClast is&#xD;
      powered by compressed medical air. The primary disadvantage of this device is that the&#xD;
      residual calculi must be individually removed with forceps following fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The StoneBreaker, manufactured by the Laryngeal Mask Airway Company, is a novel hand-held&#xD;
      pneumatic lithotriptor. This device is powered by a compressed carbon dioxide cartridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LMA StoneBreaker, provides more efficient lithotripsy of renal calculi treated by PNL&#xD;
      over the existing pneumatic intracorporeal lithotriptor the Swiss LithoClast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be recruited to the study from the clinical population who present for stone&#xD;
      management at VGH. None of the physicians involved has a financial interest in either of the&#xD;
      devices being evaluated. The purpose is to compare the pneumatic lithotripsy devices and is&#xD;
      not an evaluation of PNL, a procedure whose safety and efficacy is well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consented to PNL for management of their renal stone would be approached about&#xD;
      entry into the study by either of the primary surgeons, the research coordinator, or the&#xD;
      research fellows. Patients would understand that PNL is not an experimental procedure and&#xD;
      that the research project specifically is comparing the two lithotripsy devices with similar&#xD;
      mechanism of action and safety profile. The goal in all cases would be to render the patient&#xD;
      stone free. The patients care would not deviate from our standard PNL care protocol,&#xD;
      summarized below, with the exception of the use of a different lithoclast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively, the patients are assessed in the Preanaesthetic clinic as necessary. Blood&#xD;
      tests including CBC and differential, blood type and antibody screen, creatinine and&#xD;
      electrolytes are routinely obtained. Urine samples will be sent preoperatively for culture&#xD;
      and sensitivity. If the urine culture is positive, organism specific antibiotics will be&#xD;
      prescribed prior to treatment. If the urine culture is negative, prophylactic antibiotics&#xD;
      will be ordered and administered, prior to the induction of anaesthesia, by the treating&#xD;
      surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our standard operative protocol for PNL as described next will be followed for all cases.&#xD;
      After receiving a general anaesthetic, cystoscopy and placement of a ureteral catheter on the&#xD;
      affected side may be performed. The will be used to perform retrograde pyelography in order&#xD;
      to determine the optimal access site to the kidney. A Foley catheter will be placed to drain&#xD;
      the bladder throughout the procedure. Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, access to the&#xD;
      affected renal collecting system will be obtained with a needle down which a guide wire is&#xD;
      passed by the interventional radiology department or the operating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tract will be dilated to accommodate the 30F working sheath. The stone will then be&#xD;
      visualized and fragmented with either of the two devices, determined by randomization.&#xD;
      Remaining fragments will be removed using grasping forceps and an ultrasound suction device&#xD;
      until the patient is rendered stone free. A final visual inspection of the collecting system&#xD;
      will ensure the patient is stone free. The choice of renal drainage method after the&#xD;
      procedure will be left to the discretion of the treating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Student's t-test and ANOVA will be used to determine statistical&#xD;
      significance. P-values &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
