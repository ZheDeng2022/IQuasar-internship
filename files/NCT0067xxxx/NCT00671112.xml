      RATIONALE: Everolimus and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when&#xD;
      given together with bortezomib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus (up to 10 mg PO daily) in combination&#xD;
           with bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent or mantle cell&#xD;
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) including cutaneous forms, or relapsed/refractory&#xD;
           aggressive NHL ineligible for hematopoetic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics interactions between these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the response rate and 6-month progression-free survival in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary data to assess associations between tumor characteristics and&#xD;
           response to treatment. in those subjects who underwent biopsy prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients also receive oral everolimus&#xD;
      once daily or once every other day on days 1-21 in all courses. Courses repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo blood sample collection on Cycle 1, Day 11 for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
      Baseline tumor expression of mTOR and NFkB -related proteins (i.e., pS6K, pAKT, and cREL) and&#xD;
      FOXP3 is assessed by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
