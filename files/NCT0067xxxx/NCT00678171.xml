    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is willing and able to understand, sign and date the study-specific,&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved patient&#xD;
             informed consent and applicable privacy regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has a documented diagnosis of DDD with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis&#xD;
             demonstrated by radiographic imaging (by plain film/discography within 12 weeks of&#xD;
             surgery and/or computed tomography (CT scan/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI].&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient requires single level lumbar fusion (L2 to S1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has a history of previous surgery in the lumbar spine with or without&#xD;
             attempted fusion {Note: a history of lumbar decompression surgery is permitted}.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has Grade II, Grade III or Grade IV spondylolisthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has gross spinal instability measured on flexion/extension radiographs of&#xD;
             &gt;25% translation of the vertebrae, or ≥20 degrees of angular motion or has significant&#xD;
             (&gt;10%) scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient is receiving treatment (before, during or after surgery) with a drug that&#xD;
             interferes with bone metabolism or is being treated with a bone growth stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has been treated in the last 6 months with radiation, chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunosuppression or systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has a history of, or has any malignancy or spinal tumor of any type, with&#xD;
             the exception of a history of a treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient is morbidly obese (defined as body mass index [BMI] &gt; 35).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient currently uses tobacco products, within 3 weeks prior to time of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient is known to require at the time of treatment, additional surgery to the&#xD;
             lumbar spinal region within the next 6 months or has symptomatic multilevel&#xD;
             degenerative disease requiring possible instrumented fusion of more than one level.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has previously been treated with or exposed to any Bone Morphogenetic&#xD;
             Proteins (BMPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient is contraindicated for iliac crest autografting in that the Investigator&#xD;
             believes the patient would be unable to provide sufficient quantity or adequate&#xD;
             quality autograft (e.g., osteoporosis as defined by this protocol) from a unilateral&#xD;
             iliac crest harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has a previous diagnosis of Paget's disease, osteomalacia or any other&#xD;
             endocrine or metabolic bone disease that affects osteogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has a documented history of osteoporosis or has a risk of osteoporosis as&#xD;
             defined by an Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI) score of ≥ 9 and a DEXA&#xD;
             Scan T score of ≥-2.5 standard deviations below the normal range within one year of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
