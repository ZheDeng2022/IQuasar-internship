    <textblock>
      Many patients with type 2 diabetes also have conditions that are treated with diuretics. The&#xD;
      patients may also be treated with GSK189075 for their diabetes. This study is planned to&#xD;
      assess possible effects of administering GSK189075 in combination with two frequently used&#xD;
      diuretics.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who are between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI within the range 19-30 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostate-specific antigen level of greater than 10ng/mL (or equivalent to moderately&#xD;
             elevated per the local lab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical procedures requiring ingestion of radioactive agents within one week prior&#xD;
             to dosing with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy within 6 months before the first scheduled dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known or suspected gastrointestinal condition (or minor gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
             within 1 month prior to the first scheduled dose of study drug) that would likely&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption or transit of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject with either documented cirrhosis or history consistent with a diagnosis of&#xD;
             cirrhosis.&#xD;

          -  History of allergy to sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,&#xD;
             thiazides, loop diuretics (other than ethacrynic acid).&#xD;

             screening or Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;

             protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic/Diastolic blood pressure: less than 80/60 mmHg or greater than 150/95 mmHg at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening physical or laboratory&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;

             result within 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study (whichever is longer): 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the&#xD;
             biological effect of the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
