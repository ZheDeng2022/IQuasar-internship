    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer will be identified at the Tom&#xD;
      Baker Cancer Centre (TBCC) and included into the study, if they are going to receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy with anthracyclines and / or Trastuzumab and do not have contra-indications for&#xD;
      the CMR study. Besides the usual clinical care for these patients (e.g. blood samples before&#xD;
      each cycle of chemotherapy; MUGA scans to follow cardiac size and function), the patients&#xD;
      will undergo serial contrast-enhanced CMR studies (before, during and 9-12 months after&#xD;
      completion of the chemotherapy); patients will be seen at an outpatient clinic in the Dept.&#xD;
      of Cardiac Sciences / Heart Function Clinic for a clinical assessment (including ECG,&#xD;
      additional blood test like Troponin-T, BNP, 6-minute-walk-test) and recommendations will be&#xD;
      made to medical treatment in patients with evidence for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time points for the CMR and clinic assessments will be co-coordinated with regularly&#xD;
      scheduled test by the TBCC to avoid unnecessary burden for the patients. The oncologists at&#xD;
      the TBCC will be blinded to the results of the CMR studies and to laboratory results, unless&#xD;
      the participating cardiologists identify a clinical need for communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized CMR protocols will be employed and all interpretations will be blinded to the&#xD;
      time course of the chemotherapy and cardiotoxic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis, whether CMR can be useful in patients with potentially&#xD;
      cardiotoxic chemotherapy to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify patients at risk for the development of grade 2-4 cardiotoxic side effects as&#xD;
           classified by the NCI guidelines (common toxicity criteria, 2001, 1-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify imaging parameters to predict early or late Cardiotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide additional clinical information to optimize medical treatment for heart failure&#xD;

      Study Focus and Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers among white and African American women; its&#xD;
      incidence has increased from one in 20 in 1960 to one in eight today ARMSTRONG 2000. In&#xD;
      Canada alone, approximately 22,000 women are diagnosed each year with breast cancer and over&#xD;
      5,000 die from it VERMA 2007. Surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are the most&#xD;
      commonly used treatment options. Anthracyclines, especially doxorubicin, are a class of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents with efficacy against a variety of solid tumors, including breast&#xD;
      cancer. Unfortunately, cardiotoxic effects occur with cumulative doses and limit the clinical&#xD;
      use of doxorubicin. The incidence of heart failure is less than 5% at doses below 500 mg/m2,&#xD;
      but increases to 18% with doses of 500 - 550 mg/m2 and exceeds 30% at doses of more than 600&#xD;
      mg/m2 1-5. Although several mechanism have been proposed for the cardiotoxic effects, little&#xD;
      is known about prevention and effective treatment of this drug-induced cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), also known as ErbB2, is a member of the&#xD;
      group of transmembrane tyrosine kinases and is involved in the regulation of cell&#xD;
      proliferation GSCHWIND2004. In mice with genetic defects in ErbB2, the ventricle fails to&#xD;
      undergo trabeculation CRONE 2002; mice with reduced expression of HER-2 develop a dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one quarter of patients with breast cancer have increased expression of HER-2,&#xD;
      which is associated with a poorer prognosis including positive lymph nodes, decreased hormone&#xD;
      receptor expression and high proliferative rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of HER-2&#xD;
      CARTER1992 and was approved for treatment of patients with HER-2 positive metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer in the 1990Â´s VOGEL 2002. Later, trastuzumab was approved for the use following&#xD;
      anthracycline-based chemotherapies to decrease disease progression and to improve survival.&#xD;
      The combination of anthracyclines and trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting reduced the risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer relapse by 50% and the risk of death from breast cancer by 33% PICCARD 2005 und&#xD;
      ROMOND 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the proven therapeutic benefits, trastuzumab shows cardiotoxic side effects in up to&#xD;
      25% of treated patients, especially if used in combination with doxorubicin. Approximately&#xD;
      5-10% of all patients treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting develop (mostly&#xD;
      asymptomatic) cardiac dysfunction and 1-3% develops severe and highly symptomatic heart&#xD;
      failure with NYHA functional class III - IV CHIEN 2006. While both early (peaking 4 months&#xD;
      post chemotherapy) and late (up to several years post exposure) cardiac toxicities leading to&#xD;
      congestive heart failure have been described following administration of anthracycline-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the pathophysiology of this toxicity, particularly in the late phase remains&#xD;
      incompletely understood and several mechanism have been proposed; the interruption of the&#xD;
      HER-2 signaling pathway in the heart seems to affect the ability of cardiomyocytes to grow,&#xD;
      repair and survive. Studies in HER-2 knock-out mice have shown that a dilated cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      develops following cardiac stress with anthracycline administration OZCELIK 2002. A direct&#xD;
      toxic effect of the HER-2 blockade on the myocardial tissue level has been discussed, too&#xD;
      OZCELIK 2002, trastuzumab seems to block anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, leading to&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction OZCELIK 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An autopsy series of cancer patients having received anthracyclines demonstrated that 65% of&#xD;
      patients with clinical CHF had microscopic evidence of drug toxicity, but that 35% did not 6.&#xD;
      It may be difficult to distinguish anthracycline cardiac toxicity (ACT) from other causes&#xD;
      using other currently available non-invasive modalities 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trastuzumab-induced left ventricular dysfunction seems to reversible in the majority of&#xD;
      cases, but little is known on the real-world effects of anthracyclines and trastuzumab on&#xD;
      cardiac function during chemotherapy and shortly after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR is the non-invasive gold standard in cardiac imaging for the assessment of cardiac&#xD;
      function and also for the characterization of the myocardium and is used for the assessment&#xD;
      of other acquired myocardial changes as myocarditis 7 and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.&#xD;
      Pilot studies have shown that CMR can detect even sub-clinical cardiotoxic effects in&#xD;
      patients after anthracycline chemotherapy 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our suggested study will prospectively include patients with a first diagnosis of breast&#xD;
      cancer undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy to identify the predictive value of&#xD;
      several CMR-derived identifiers for cardiotoxicity and to evaluate an individually adjusted&#xD;
      follow-up by cardiologists during and after the chemotherapy.&#xD;
