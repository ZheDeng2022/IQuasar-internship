      The aim of this study is to assess whether the energy you burn daily increases after you have&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. Until now, there hasn't been an effective way of measuring all activity on&#xD;
      a daily basis. Physical Activity Monitoring System (PAMS) has been created just for this&#xD;
      purpose. PAMS is a garment that can be worn under your clothes, that records body position&#xD;
      and movement through space. We will use the PAMS along with special water to measure your&#xD;
      total daily energy expenditure right before surgery, and again 6 months and 24 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be initially recruited from OHSU IRB-Approved advertisements. Interested&#xD;
      study subjects will be screened through an informal telephone interview. If there are no&#xD;
      health conditions that exclude participation, subjects will be asked to give IRB-approved&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consenting to undergo three 18 day phases. Each phase will consist of 15&#xD;
      daily visits to the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center (CTRC), and 3 full day and&#xD;
      nights in the CTRC.&#xD;

      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consenting to undergo three 18 day phases. Each phase will consist of 15&#xD;
      daily visits to the Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center (CTRC), and 3 full day and&#xD;
      nights in the CTRC. The CTRC day visits will be 1 hour visits, where subjects will shower,&#xD;
      replace their dirty PAMS with a clean PAMS, have their weight measured and be asked to walk&#xD;
      on a treadmill for a total of 12 minutes with 3 minutes each at 0.0, 0.6, 1.6 and 2.4 mph.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to drink special water on Day 2, and daily urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected for 14 days. On Day 16 subjects will undergo a series of Energy Expenditure tests&#xD;
      using a breath analyzer. Subjects will begin with lying for 30 minutes, then sitting for 20&#xD;
      minutes, standing for 20 minutes, and a transitional period of standing and sitting for 20&#xD;
      minutes. Subjects will then be asked to walk for three 15 minute intervals at 0.8, 1.6, and&#xD;
      2.4 mph. Day 17 will be a repeat of Day 16 but will be followed by Dual Energy X-Ray&#xD;
      Absorptiometry (DEXA) or BodPod (for individuals over 350 lbs) which is device which uses the&#xD;
      movement of air to measure your muscle and fat volumes. Day 18 subjects will begin with lying&#xD;
      for 30 minutes,then be given a breakfast to eat. Their breathing test will then continue&#xD;
      every 15 of 30 minutes after eating breakfast to assess how much energy their body burns&#xD;
      during digestion, for 450 minutes (7.5 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAMS allows physical activity to be measured precisely during daily activities. By attaching&#xD;
      sensors (inclinometers) to the torso and thigh, body posture can be defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lying: torso and thigh sensors indicate horizontal, Standing: torso and thigh sensors&#xD;
      indicate vertical, Sitting: torso sensor = vertical, thigh sensor = horizontal. Duplicate&#xD;
      sensor sets are used in all subjects to gather duplicate data every Â½ second for 14 days. The&#xD;
      physical activity data are combined with the breath measurement data to allow us to measure&#xD;
      all forms of activity. The following are key features; specialized sensors (accelerometers)&#xD;
      are completely integrated with the inclinometers so that data on body position and movement&#xD;
      are continuously gathered; the sensors are attached to the subject using a harnesses that&#xD;
      allows a full range of daytime and nighttime physical activities as well as bathroom use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis is simple requiring a standard PC that runs Excel and written macros programs.&#xD;
      Once this data is downloaded, it will be sent to Mayo Rochester where it will be analyzed for&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time-spent lying, sitting, standing and walking,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average accelerometer output for non-walking activities (lying, sitting and standing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average accelerometer output for walking and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of transitions made between postures (e.g. 'sitting-to-standing'). Breathing&#xD;
           feedback will be used to calculate, in duplicate measurements of the Energy Expenditure&#xD;
           (EE) of sitting, standing, transitions and walking at 0.8, 1.6 and 2.4 mph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posture and activity EE data collection. For the physical activity monitoring period (Days&#xD;
      2-15), the EE for sitting, standing and transitions will be calculated by multiplying the&#xD;
      time engaged in each activity (or number of transitions) by the EE for that activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Exercise Activity EE = EE sitting + EE standing + EE transitions + EE walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The special water will be measured in the urine collected daily. The daily urine samples will&#xD;
      be shipped to and analyzed by University of Wisconsin's special instrument in Dr. Schoeller's&#xD;
      lab. This special water has the ability to tell us your total energy expenditure over the&#xD;
      whole day. The special water has a marker or label attached to the water molecule. The&#xD;
      special instrument reads how many water molecules possess this special label. Body water&#xD;
      excreted through urine can tell us a person's total daily energy expenditure.&#xD;
