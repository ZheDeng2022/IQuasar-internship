    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study a specific acetabular (hip socket) fracture pattern&#xD;
      and how its treatment affects the functional, clinical, and x-ray outcomes. There are no&#xD;
      experimental procedures involved.&#xD;

      This study will identify a small subset of patients that fall outside the Letournel&#xD;
      classification system of acetabular fractures. The fracture pattern, its influence on the&#xD;
      surgical treatment decision making process, and the radiographic and outcomes will be&#xD;
      detailed. In particular, both-column acetabular fractures with significant posterior&#xD;
      deformity have been correlated with poor functional outcomes, increased arthritis&#xD;
      radiographically, and worse prognosis in general. Despite these findings, there has been no&#xD;
      specific study evaluating these injury patterns to date. We present ten patients with both&#xD;
      column acetabular fractures and an associated posterior column/wall piece and their clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in an effort to help guide surgical treatment and offer prognostic guidance.&#xD;

        The study will include 10 patients who have had column fractures with an associated&#xD;
        posterior wall fracture or significantly displaced posterior column fracture that required&#xD;
        a separate approach for reduction and/or fixation of the hip performed at Hershey Medical&#xD;
        Center by two surgeons, Drs. David Goodspeed and J. Spence Reid over a 12 month period&#xD;
        (June 2006 - May 2007). There is no control population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients that underwent surgical fixation of the hip at Hershey Medical Center&#xD;
             between June 2006 and May 2007 by Dr's J. Spence Reid and David Goodspeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They will include patients that are admitted directly from the field or are&#xD;
             transferred from outside hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  will be those acetabular fractures of non-traumatic etiology (e.g.: secondary to&#xD;
             malignancy or fatigue)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fractures that have not undergone operative fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pediatric populations under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  mentally compromised patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those that do not give consent for the clinical evaluation.&#xD;
