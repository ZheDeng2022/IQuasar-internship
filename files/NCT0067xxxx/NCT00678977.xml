    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and to determine the optimal tolerated regimen(OTR) of pazopanib in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine (Arm A) or pazopanib, gemcitabine, and cisplatin (Arm B) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to receive escalating doses&#xD;
      of pazopanib and gemcitabine or pazopanib, gemcitabine and cisplatin. Dose escalation schemas&#xD;
      for each study arm are described in the protocol. For each arm, the OTR will be defined as&#xD;
      the highest dose combination of the agents where no more than one out of six patients&#xD;
      experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. Six to twelve additional patients in each arm will be&#xD;
      studied with the OTR to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. This will allow an assessment&#xD;
      of potential drug-drug interactions. Antitumor activity will be assessed using RECIST&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

    <description>Dose Escalation - Patients will be entered into dose cohorts of three patients. Each cohort will be assigned to a dose level for the duration of the study. There will be no intra-patient dose-escalation. The starting dose will be 400 mg daily of pazopanib, and 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Intermediate dose levels may also be explored. Intravenous gemcitabine will be given on Day 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and each subsequent cycle.&#xD;
Cohort expansion phase - patients will receive gemcitabine alone, at the OTR dose starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pazopanib will be administered at the OTR beginning on Day 2 Cycle 1 after the last blood sample for gemcitabine analysis is collected, and pazopanib administration will continue for the duration of the study. Patients will return to the clinic on Day 8 of Cycle 1 for simultaneous administration of gemcitabine and pazopanib. On Day 1 of Cycle 2 patients will receive the simultaneous administration of gemcitabine and pazopanib</description>
