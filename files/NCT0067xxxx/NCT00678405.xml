    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a Breathlessness Intervention Service&#xD;
      (BIS) on the quality of life of patients and families affected by intractable breathlessness.&#xD;
      The questions to be addressed by this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is BIS more effective than standard care for patients with intractable breathlessness&#xD;
           from advanced malignant or non-malignant disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does it reduce patient and carer distress due to breathlessness, and increase patients'&#xD;
           sense of mastery of the symptom?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the experiences and views of those who use BIS, their informal carers and the&#xD;
           clinicians who refer to it?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does BIS offer value for money for the NHS?&#xD;

      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is BIS more effective than standard care for patients with intractable breathlessness&#xD;
           from advanced malignant or non-malignant disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does it reduce patient &amp; carer distress due to breathlessness, &amp; increase patients'&#xD;
           sense of mastery of the symptom?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the experiences &amp; views of those who use BIS, their informal carers &amp; the&#xD;
           clinicians who refer to it?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is BIS cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess changes in patient outcomes attributable to BIS, a pragmatic RCT design will be&#xD;
      conducted using a fast-track design (design proved highly acceptable at Phase II). Analysis&#xD;
      will focus on comparing patients who have used BIS to those who have not (yet) used BIS (the&#xD;
      use of BIS by the control group will occur subsequent to these measurement points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will be blinded to the allocation of respondents up until discharge/referral&#xD;
      on from BIS for FT patients or at the end of the waiting period for CC patients. This will be&#xD;
      achieved by the researcher conducting study recruitment &amp; collecting baseline measures before&#xD;
      instructing a third party (local clinical trials' nurse) to conduct randomisation &amp; reporting&#xD;
      of allocation (to the patient &amp; BIS) using a random sequence of opaque envelopes previously&#xD;
      generated by a statistician independent of BIS. Subsequently, all data will be handled using&#xD;
      study identity numbers; group allocation identifiers will only be added at analysis. This&#xD;
      model was used successfully in the Phase II pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from the control group once they are in receipt of BIS (after their period on&#xD;
      the waiting list when their group allocation was blinded to the researcher) will be treated&#xD;
      as before/after data &amp; not RCT data. This will allow the collection of qualitative data from&#xD;
      this group at the midpoint of using BIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two broad disease courses, malignant (m) &amp; non-malignant (nm), will be considered&#xD;
      separately due to their different trajectories &amp; needs, &amp; resultant different service models.&#xD;
      The intervention model for patients with non-malignant disease consists of two-three visits &amp;&#xD;
      three telephone contacts (to patient &amp;/or primary care staff) over a four-week period with a&#xD;
      16 week (from first assessment) follow up, whereas the model for patients with malignant&#xD;
      disease consists of one visit in conjunction with a primary care professional/key worker &amp;&#xD;
      two telephone contacts (to patient &amp;/or primary care staff/key worker) over a two-week&#xD;
      period, with a six week (from first assessment) follow up . Thus, the measurement points for&#xD;
      the disease groups will differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data (quantitative/qualitative) will be collected for all respondents at baseline (t1), prior&#xD;
      to randomisation. For those with non-malignant conditions (nm), this will be repeated for the&#xD;
      FT group (nmFT) midway through the intervention (two weeks post commencing BIS; nmFTt2 -&#xD;
      quantitative data only) &amp; at the equivalent time point for the CC group (i.e. two weeks from&#xD;
      entering the waiting list; nmCCt2 - quantitative data only), then again after&#xD;
      discharge/referral on from BIS for the fast track group (four weeks post commencing BIS;&#xD;
      nmFTt3) &amp; four weeks after discharge (nmFTt5). As well as being interviewed at t1&#xD;
      (randomisation) &amp; t2 (midway between randomisation &amp; BIS - quantitative data only), the CC&#xD;
      group (nmCC) will also be interviewed just prior to commencing BIS (nmCCt3), during BIS (two&#xD;
      weeks post commencing BIS; nmCCt4) &amp; then again after discharge/referral on from BIS (four&#xD;
      weeks post commencing BIS (nmCCt5). This will allow identification of whether or not&#xD;
      respondents in the control group deteriorated significantly whilst waiting for BIS &amp; the&#xD;
      impact of this on final outcomes. This model was successfully piloted at Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those with malignant conditions (m), baseline measures (t1) will be repeated for the FT&#xD;
      group (mFT) after discharge/referral on from BIS (two weeks post commencement of BIS; mFTt3)&#xD;
      &amp; two weeks after discharge (mFTt5). For the CC group (mCC) baseline measures (t1) will be&#xD;
      repeated just prior to commencing BIS (mCCt3) &amp; then again after discharge/referral on from&#xD;
      BIS (two weeks post commencing BIS; mCCt5). Thus, due to the shorter time frame of the&#xD;
      malignant service model, there would be no t2 or t4 measurement points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is based on the existing literature &amp; on our experiences at Phase II. The&#xD;
      estimated standard deviation of the primary outcome measure is 2.5. In order to detect a&#xD;
      2-point difference in mean outcome between groups (equivalent to 0.8sd effect size) with 80%&#xD;
      power using a t-test at the 5% level of significance, it will be necessary to recruit 26&#xD;
      patients per arm per disease group (trial) followed up to provide an outcome, which will now&#xD;
      be at an earlier time point to minimize attrition. By adjusting for the baseline of the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure in the analysis using analysis of covariance we anticipate an&#xD;
      improvement in the precision of the estimated intervention effect. We also anticipate an&#xD;
      improvement from the use in the trial of the NRS measure rather than the more highly variable&#xD;
      VAS version from the pilot used in this sample size calculation. Therefore we propose to&#xD;
      recruit 120 patients, 60 per disease group to ensure adequate power, effect size and&#xD;
      allowance for attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be on an intention to treat basis. Primary analysis will be by analysis of&#xD;
      covariance of the NRS at the final time-point with adjustment for baseline NRS in order to&#xD;
      improve precision of the estimated BIS versus comparison effect. Secondary analysis will more&#xD;
      sensitively incorporate all time-points in a repeated measures linear regression to be able&#xD;
      to detect any differences between BIS &amp; comparison emerging/changing over time within the&#xD;
      initial period. All analysis will be documented prior to final data collection in an analysis&#xD;
      plan, will be addressed with two-tailed tests &amp; be assessed at the 5% level of significance.&#xD;
      Effects within &amp; between arms will be summarized using means &amp; 95% confidence intervals. If&#xD;
      randomised effects are similar in malignant &amp; non-malignant groups, a combined effect will be&#xD;
      estimated allowing a narrower overall confidence interval. Analysis will be conducted using&#xD;
      SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of BIS for each patient will be calculated from service activity data combined with&#xD;
      staff salary costs, plus on-costs, overheads &amp; equipment. Information on the use of other&#xD;
      health &amp; social services &amp; informal care (proxy-valued as a homecare worker) will be&#xD;
      collected with the Client Service Receipt Inventory. This will be combined with appropriate&#xD;
      unit cost data (Curtis &amp; Netten, 2006) to generate service costs. Cost comparisons will be&#xD;
      made using bootstrapping methods to account for any skewness in data distribution.&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by combining cost data with that on outcomes including&#xD;
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYS), in the form of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio &amp;&#xD;
      acceptability curves. Qualitative data will be analysed using a framework approach (Ritchie &amp;&#xD;
      Spencer, 1993) conducted using NVivo software.&#xD;

    <description>Breathlessness Intervention Service (BIS) consists of a clinical specialist physiotherapist &amp; palliative care consultant. It aims to manage the symptom of breathlessness in patients with any disease (cancer &amp; non-cancer) using a rehabilitative approach. Interventions include: evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions (psychological, social &amp; physical); palliative care input (e.g. end of life issues, psychosocial issues, family concerns); &amp; pharmacological review. Thus BIS seeks to enhance the self-management of breathlessness. Uniquely, care is located in clinic or in patients' own homes, as appropriate. Referrals come from medical specialists, GPs &amp; allied health professionals (with medical consent).</description>
