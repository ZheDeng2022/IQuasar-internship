  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people undergoing lung transplantation have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), a disease in which the lung airways are partly damaged and obstructed, making it&#xD;
      difficult to breathe. This study will enroll people with COPD who are undergoing a lung&#xD;
      transplant to examine how their quality of life changes after the transplant procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation is one treatment option for people with end-stage lung disease. The&#xD;
      majority of people undergoing a lung transplant have COPD, and while transplantation can&#xD;
      potentially improve survival and quality of life, it may also carry substantial risks,&#xD;
      including surgical complications, infections, and pneumonia. The impact of lung&#xD;
      transplantation on survival and quality of life has not been extensively studied. In the&#xD;
      United States, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is the organization that allocates&#xD;
      donor lungs to lung recipients. Before 2005, the length of time that a candidate had been on&#xD;
      the transplant waiting list was the major determining factor for receiving a donor lung. In&#xD;
      mid 2005, the UNOS system changed and began prioritizing candidates on the basis of risk of&#xD;
      death prior to lung transplantation and the probability of death within the first year after&#xD;
      transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate quality of life factors for lung&#xD;
      transplant patients with COPD, both before and after the lung transplant procedure. In&#xD;
      addition, quality of life of patients in the new UNOS allocation system will be compared with&#xD;
      that of patients in the old UNOS allocation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll all COPD patients undergoing an evaluation for lung transplantation at&#xD;
      the Washington University Medical Center and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits at the time of the transplant evaluation and again just&#xD;
      prior to listing in the UNOS system. After the transplant, participants will attend study&#xD;
      visits at Months 3 and 6 and then once a year for 5 years. During each study visit,&#xD;
      participants will complete a computerized interview and health-related questionnaires that&#xD;
      will assess quality of life factors, including social life, work life, and home life. Study&#xD;
      researchers will also review participants' medical records to collect information on lung&#xD;
      function and blood test results.&#xD;
