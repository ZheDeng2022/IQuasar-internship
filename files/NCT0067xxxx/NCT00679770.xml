    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5%&#xD;
      AN2690 Solutions compared to the vehicle alone in the treatment of distal, subungual&#xD;
      onychomycosis of the great target toenail.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent is for all subjects to complete a 180 day treatment period consisting of 90&#xD;
      consecutive days of once daily treatment with their assigned study treatment followed by an&#xD;
      additional 90 days of three times weekly dosing, even if the treated toenail(s) is evaluated&#xD;
      as a &quot;complete responder&quot; prior to the end of treatment 180 day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 180-Day treatment period, subjects who remain in the study will be&#xD;
      classified as complete responders, partial responders, or non-responders. All complete or&#xD;
      partial responders will continue to be followed for an additional 180 days until the last&#xD;
      evaluation for inclusion in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic efficacy and local tolerance evaluations of the test medication will be performed of&#xD;
      the target great toenail and all other treated toenails. KOH wet mounts and fungal cultures&#xD;
      from the treatment-targeted great toenail will be performed on the same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be queried for adverse events and evaluated for application site&#xD;
      reactions. Clinical laboratory assessment for safety will be made at Screening, periodically&#xD;
      throughout the study, and upon premature discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
