      The main purposes of the study are to compare changes in sexual function, changes in sex&#xD;
      hormones, and changes in body image and marital satisfaction at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months&#xD;
      postoperatively in two groups: individuals who undergo a bariatric surgical procedure and&#xD;
      extremely obese individuals with similar obesity-related comorbidities who do not seek&#xD;
      surgery (treatment comparison group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms by which extreme obesity affects sexual functioning have received little&#xD;
      attention. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that obesity and physical inactivity are&#xD;
      independently related to the likelihood of developing sexual dysfunction over time. For&#xD;
      example, men with a BMI greater than 29 kg/m2 have a 30% greater risk of developing erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction and up to 50 % of ED cases can be attributed to hypertension and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, both commonly associated with obesity. Many treatments for hypertension have also&#xD;
      been shown to interfere with sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in sex hormones with increasing BMI have not received much attention either. Obesity&#xD;
      has been associated with decreases in testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin for men&#xD;
      and increases in testosterone and estrogen for women. Several studies have shown improvement&#xD;
      in sex hormone levels in both men and women following weight loss. Sexual functioning has&#xD;
      never been assessed in association with weight loss and whether through improvements in body&#xD;
      image, sex hormones, or obesity related comorbidities, bariatric surgery may have a profound&#xD;
      effect on sexual functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Ray Rosen, the Principal investigator for this sub study, has conducted a previous&#xD;
      investigation focused on sexual functioning after weight loss in a behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      program. Specifically, he looked at short and long term sexual function outcomes associated&#xD;
      with Type-2 diabetes. His previous work in this area has shown that patients are willing to&#xD;
      participate in studies of sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Psychosocial Changes study assesses sexual function in two ways. Participants first fill&#xD;
      out a packet of questionnaires covering topics related to depression, quality of life, body&#xD;
      image, and marital and sexual functioning. They also give a blood sample in order for us to&#xD;
      assess levels of sex hormones including testosterone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol,&#xD;
      follicle stimulating hormone, and others.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

                  medical conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ambulation: Patients must be ambulatory, given the frequent number of assessments&#xD;
                  (and difficult arranging transportation for non-ambulatory individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Competent: The patient must be able to communicate with the investigator and be&#xD;
                  legally competent, provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Any major illnesses that the surgical team believes present too great a risk for&#xD;
             surgery. These include severe cardiac and pulmonary diseases, as well as uncontrolled&#xD;
             type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of major depression or other psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia,&#xD;
                  bipolar disorder, major depression, bulimia nervosa, etc.) that significantly&#xD;
                  interferes with daily living and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of medications known to significantly increase body weight, such as systemic&#xD;
                  steroids or psychiatric medications including lithium, tricyclic antidepressants,&#xD;
                  and anti-psychotic agents (The use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors&#xD;
                  (SSRIs) will not be excluded because of their widespread use and lesser effect on&#xD;
                  body weight.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are not in an ongoing romantic relationship&#xD;

               -  Any current (past 12 months) substance abuse or dependence disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy or lactation (Those who are pregnant do not undergo bariatric surgery.&#xD;
                  In addition, the hormone changes induced by pregnancy are known to interfere with&#xD;
                  the hormones examined in this study, confounding the findings. Participants who&#xD;
                  become pregnant while in this study will be withdrawn from the study.)&#xD;
