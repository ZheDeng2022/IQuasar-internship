      upon pain and inflammation in the post-operative period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery was introduced by gynaecologists in a search for a minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical approach. Laparoscopy is now generally accepted and widely used in different medical&#xD;
      fields (gynaecology, digestive surgery, oncology, etc.,.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CO2 pneumoperitoneum and pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Carbon dioxide is generally used to induce and maintain a pneumoperitoneum. Following a&#xD;
           diagnostic procedure post-operative pain is generally low. For more extensive&#xD;
           laparoscopic surgery, pain is related to the type of surgery. It has been suggested that&#xD;
           pain also increases with the duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CO2 pneumoperitoneum and inflammation Different immune mediators were already evaluated&#xD;
           during laparoscopic surgery. On peripheral blood interleukin-6, C-reactive protein,&#xD;
           tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, histamine response, total leukocyte counts and&#xD;
           T-lymphocyte populations, delayed-type hypersensitivity and neutrophils activation and&#xD;
           function were evaluated. Local peritoneal host defences such as macrophage activation&#xD;
           and function and leukocyte function have also been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laparoscopic surgery is associated with less post-operative inflammatory reaction and&#xD;
           less immune activation then laparotomy. (1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The degree of alteration in C-reactive proteins was noted to be a 5 fold increase after&#xD;
           laparoscopic cholecystectomy (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Peripheral leukocyte populations may not be the principal determinant of an acute-phase&#xD;
           response as much as an hepatic response to stress and injury. Kloosterman (4) has&#xD;
           demonstrated a transient increase in granulocyte numbers after open cholecystectomy but&#xD;
           not after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interleukin-6 levels have been noted to be reduced in patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
           procedures compared to traditional laparotomy, with a linear correlation between peak&#xD;
           concentrations of IL-6 and C-reactive proteins (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           West (5) investigated the production of cytokines in peritoneal macrophages incubated in&#xD;
           carbon dioxide. Macrophage TNF and IL-1 responses to bacterial endotoxin were lower for&#xD;
           macrophages incubated in carbon dioxide than in either air or helium. A proposed&#xD;
           mechanism for this difference was that carbon dioxide affected the intracellular medium&#xD;
           by creating a more acidic environment. He speculates that the impairment in peritoneal&#xD;
           macrophage cytokine production may contribute to an apparent lack of inflammatory&#xD;
           systemic response during laparoscopic surgery rather than the physiologic stress of the&#xD;
           surgery itself. This provides a potential molecular mechanism to explain peritoneal&#xD;
           macrophage immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of adding 2-4 % of oxygen to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum Adding 4% of oxygen to the&#xD;
           CO2 results in a partial oxygen pressure of 30 mmHg (4% of 760 atmospheric pressure + 15&#xD;
           mmHg insufflation pressure) which is similar to the physiologic 20-40 mmHg partial&#xD;
           oxygen pressure for peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a series of experiments it was demonstrated that adhesion formation decreased by 50%&#xD;
           when 0.7-1% of oxygen was added to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Adding 2-4% of oxygen to&#xD;
           the CO2 pneumoperitoneum completely prevented this effect. This observation is&#xD;
           consistent with the oxygen tensions known to induce hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and&#xD;
           with the normal physiologic peripheral partial oxygen tension around 20-40 mm Hg. (6) In&#xD;
           addition, CO2 resorbtion was profoundly affected by adding 2-4% of oxygen in our rabbit&#xD;
           model. (7) From these studies we concluded that during CO2 pneumoperitoneum the&#xD;
           progressively increasing resorbtion of CO2 is completely prevented by adding 2-4% of&#xD;
           oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pneumoperitoneum and the mesothelial barrier The effect of pneumoperitoneum upon CO2&#xD;
           resorbtion and adhesion formation are consistent with mesothelial hypoxia. This hypoxia&#xD;
           causes the large, flat mesothelial cells to retract and bulge thus exposing increasingly&#xD;
           large areas of extra cellular matrix (ECM) in between the cells as demonstrated in mice&#xD;
           and rats. (8) This moreover may facilitate malignant tumor implantation. Where it has&#xD;
           been suggested to affect adversely intraperitoneal infections. (9-11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Insufflation with oxygen We will use a premixed bottle of CO2 + 4% oxygen to insufflate&#xD;
           the abdomen. The mixture is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 % of oxygen obviously does not cause an electrosurgical risk since air contains 20% of&#xD;
      oxygen. Also the eventual accidental intravenous perfusion of 1L min would result in the&#xD;
      perfusion of 0.04 L/min of oxygen which is considered harmless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume that decreasing the hypoxic damage to the mesothelium by adding 4% of oxygen to the&#xD;
      CO2 pneumoperitoneum will decrease the inflammatory reaction and therefore post-operative&#xD;
      pain and faster normalisation of inflammation parameters.&#xD;
