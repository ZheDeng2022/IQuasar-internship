      1. To find the optimal dose of topotecan that can safely be given directly into the spinal&#xD;
           fluid (called intrathecal administration) of children whose cancer has spread to the&#xD;
           lining of the brain and/or spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out what effects (good and bad) topotecan has when given directly into the&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid in children with neoplastic meningitis (cancer that has spread to&#xD;
           the lining of the brain and spinal cord).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if intrathecal topotecan is beneficial to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To better understand how topotecan is handled by the body after intrathecal&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for signs (markers) of tumor spread.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized pharmacokinetically-guided optimal dosing study of&#xD;
      intraventricular topotecan in children with neoplastic meningitis. Topotecan will be&#xD;
      administered daily for five consecutive days utilizing the schema shown in the Schema below.&#xD;
      Concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease is allowable&#xD;
      provided that the systemic chemotherapy is not an investigational agent or one of the&#xD;
      following: high-dose methotrexate (&gt; 1g/m2), high-dose cytarabine (&gt; 1g/m2), 5-fluorouracil,&#xD;
      capecitabine, thiotepa, a nitrosourea, or topotecan. The starting dose for this trial was&#xD;
      derived from pharmacokinetic simulations that utilized data from a prior phase I study of&#xD;
      intrathecal topotecan. The simulations were performed to estimate the length of time that&#xD;
      ventricular CSF concentrations of topotecan lactone would remain above an optimal &quot;target&#xD;
      level&quot; of 1 ng/mL. One of the primary objectives of this study is to estimate the dose of&#xD;
      intrathecal topotecan that will result in CSF lactone concentrations exceeding 1 ng/mL for at&#xD;
      least eight hours after an intrathecal injection. Dose escalations for patient cohorts will&#xD;
      be conducted following the traditional phase 1 design in order to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be called pharmacokinetically optimal if that dose&#xD;
      achieves the targeted PK parameter in at least 23 of 25 patients treated at that dose level.&#xD;
