  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhotic patients are predisposed to bacterial infection. A large proportion of which is&#xD;
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis(SBP), which are mainly caused by enteric bacteria.SBP in a&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate in the order of 30-80% per&#xD;
      year.It has been demonstrated that cirrhotics who have an ascitic fluid protein concentration&#xD;
      less than 1gm% are most susceptible to develop SBP by virtue of having low opsonising&#xD;
      activity of ascitic fluid.Patients with liver cirrhosis have significant degrees of imbalance&#xD;
      of intestinal flora.Translocation of intestinal bacteria being the major mechanism for the&#xD;
      production of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term antibiotic (norfloxacin) is very effective in preventing SBP caused by gram&#xD;
      negative bacteria.But the problem with the long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is the potential&#xD;
      for the development of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.Further, quinolones have&#xD;
      no effect on gram positive bacteria which is becoming one of the important cause of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such experiences necessitate the need for strategies, other than antibiotic, to prevent&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bacterial translocation and SBP in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis.Probiotics have been used successfully to alter the gut flora in many clinical&#xD;
      conditions where growth and localization of non pathogenic bacteria replaces the pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria in the intestine.The probiotic bacteria, among which the most common are the lactose&#xD;
      fermenting Lactobacilli, inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria by acidifying the gut&#xD;
      lumen, competing for nutrients, and by producing antimicrobial substances. They adhere to the&#xD;
      gut mucosa and by that are thought to prevent bacterial translocation from the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention&#xD;
      of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis with low protein ascites and&#xD;
      those already have developed an episode SBP.&#xD;

      AIMS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of a Probiotics administration in reducing the incidence of first episode&#xD;
      of SBP among cirrhotics who have low protein(&lt;1 gm/dl) ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of a Probiotics administration in reducing the incidence of second&#xD;
      episode of SBP among cirrhotic who have already developed at least one episode of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design : Prospective randomized placebo control efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites having either history of&#xD;
      prior SBP or ascitic fluid protein &lt;1 gm/dl will be included in the study irrespective of&#xD;
      etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients chronically treated with antibiotics or lactulose during past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients having risk factor of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth other than&#xD;
           cirrhosis - diabetes mellitus, history of abdominal surgery, immunomodulator drugs.&#xD;
           Alcoholic cirrhotics who continue to take alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with active or recent G.I. bleed (within prior 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with advanced HCC, renal failure and portal vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in primary prophylaxis group will be randomly allocated to receive either a&#xD;
      Probiotics or placebo. While patients in secondary prophylaxis group will be randomized&#xD;
      between Probiotics and norfloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Probiotics used in this study will be VSL#3. The control will be given similar looking&#xD;
      capsules containing galactose powder.It will be used in the form of capsules. A total dose of&#xD;
      450 billions CFU will be used. Norfloxacin will also be used as similar looking capsules. The&#xD;
      drugs and placebo will be given for one year or till the end points of the study as mentioned&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Each patients will be tested for SBP( Ascitic fluid cell count as well as culture)&#xD;
      at the interval of every 6 weeks till the end point of the study.The effect of Probiotics on&#xD;
      gut flora will be assessed objectively by jejunal fluid culture analysis baseline at 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year of the start of the treatment. This will be done on some of the representative&#xD;
      sample from both the groups. Development of an episode of SBP, hepatic encephalopathy and&#xD;
      variceal bleeding will be noted.All patients will be prospectively followed up from the date&#xD;
      of enrollment to see the primary outcome that is development of SBP. The secondary outcome of&#xD;
      the study will be the development of encephalopathy, variceal bleeding ,renal failure and&#xD;
      death of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. completion of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. development of an episode of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Death.&#xD;
