      Once daily antiretroviral therapy with Viread (tenofovir DF, 300mg) plus Kaletra (LPV/r,&#xD;
      800mg/200mg) will be effective in suppressing and maintaining suppression of HIV RNA to &lt;50&#xD;
      copies/ml in antiretroviral naïve patients through 48 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV prospective, open-label, controlled treatment protocol consisting of&#xD;
      once daily Kaletra dosed at 800mg lopinavir with 200mg ritonavir in four combination tablets&#xD;
      plus Viread dosed as 300 mg tenofovir DF. This will be a single site, multi-investigator,&#xD;
      study for 48 weeks. Consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled into the study to reach&#xD;
      the enrollment goal of 30 patients. Eligible patients will be identified and screened during&#xD;
      routine initial or follow-up visits at the Internal Medicine Specialty Services Clinic. This&#xD;
      clinic serves as the HIV/AIDS specialty care clinic and is a subdivision of the Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences College of&#xD;
      Osteopathic Medicine. The study site currently serves &gt;700 persons living with HIV in&#xD;
      northeast Oklahoma with four to five antiretroviral naïve patients seen each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will receive routine standard of care for our program&#xD;
      as prescribed by the DHHS guidelines. Patients will have a Complete Blood Count (CBC),&#xD;
      Complete Metabolic Profile (CMP), fasting lipid profile, CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA level, and&#xD;
      other prescribed or indicated laboratory preformed at baseline and throughout the study as&#xD;
      described in the Visits and Evaluations section of this protocol. All of the aforementioned&#xD;
      laboratory tests will be performed at the Diagnostic Laboratories of Oklahoma, a division of&#xD;
      Quest Diagnostics. Any antiretroviral resistance testing will be performed at Virologic Labs,&#xD;
      Inc. Adherence will be assessed at discontinuation of the study and when indicated for&#xD;
      evaluation of virologic failure by Memory Electronic Monitoring Systems caps and pharmacy&#xD;
      refill data. Patients will be monitored at each study visit for tolerability and adverse&#xD;
      events. Patients who develop a study related Grade 1 or 2 Adverse Events (Aes) may continue&#xD;
      the study. Those who develop Grade 3 or 4 AEs will have study medications discontinued.&#xD;
      Patients with asymptomatic elevations of triglyceride or Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      cholesterol levels may be treated with appropriate lipid lowering therapy at the&#xD;
      investigators discretion.&#xD;

    <description>Virologic failure is defined by any of the following: 1) &lt;1 log10 decline in HIV RNA by week 8 of therapy; 2) failure to achieve &lt;50 c/mL by week 24; 3) HIV RNA&gt; 500 c/ML on two consecutive occasions (less than 30 days apart), with no evidence of suppression after adherence counseling. When HIV RNA levels are obtained &gt;500 copies/mL it will be repeated within 2 weeks. If after adherence counseling, HIV RNA demonstrates &gt; 1 log 10 decline but remains &gt;500, the patient will receive a final adherence counseling session and have his/her HIV RNA measure repeated at day 30: if a third consecutive HIV RNA remains 500 c/mL the patient will be removed from study, if &lt;500c/mL the patient will remain on study</description>
