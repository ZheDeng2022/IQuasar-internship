      The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine the time to improvement of the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency, urgency, gross hematuria, suprapubic pain,&#xD;
      hesitancy, low back pain) of acute, uncomplicated, symptomatic, lower UTIs in women treated&#xD;
      with Cipro XR 500 mg once daily for 3 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:- Non-pregnant, non-lactating women between the ages of 18 and 65 years&#xD;
        with signs and symptoms of acute, uncomplicated, symptomatic lower UTI were eligible for&#xD;
        enrolment. Dysuria and at least 1 clinical sign or symptom of a lower UTI (frequency,&#xD;
        urgency, suprapubic pain, or gross hematuria) had to be present, with symptom onset &lt;/= 72&#xD;
        hours before study entry. - In addition, 1 pretreatment clean-catch MSU culture had to be&#xD;
        positive for 1 to 2 urinary pathogens (&gt;/= 10.000 colony-forming units {CFU}/mL). Women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential were required to use 2 reliable methods of contraception during&#xD;
        exposure to study drug. Exclusion Criteria:- Men- Women who were pregnant, nursing, or not&#xD;
        using 2 medically accepted, effective methods of birth control- Known or suspected&#xD;
        hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or the quinolone class of antimicrobials- Subjects taking&#xD;
        urinary analgesic medication (phenazopyridine-containing products {eg, Pyridium}) within 24&#xD;
        hours before first dose of study drug and throughout the study for urinary tract pain-&#xD;
        Subjects taking other analgesic medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
        [NSAID], acetaminophen-containing products, etc) for urinary tract pain or any other pain&#xD;
        (eg, headache, back pain, joint pain, dental pain, sore muscles, etc) within 2 dosing&#xD;
        intervals for that medication before first dose of study drug and throughout the study.&#xD;
        More specifically, a subject who had taken a medication for pain could not be entered into&#xD;
        the study until the time elapsed since her last dose of the medication was equal to at&#xD;
        least 2 dosing intervals for that medication.- History of gastrointestinal illness that&#xD;
        could interfere with absorption of orally administered antimicrobials- Subjects requiring&#xD;
        concomitant administration of multivalent cation-containing products such as&#xD;
        magnesium/aluminum antacids, sucralfate, Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or&#xD;
        pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, such as multivitamin&#xD;
        preparations. These medications were not to be taken less than 6 hours before or 2 hours&#xD;
        after study drug administration. - Subjects experiencing vaginitis- Subjects with a&#xD;
        temperature &gt;/= 38.3°C or &gt;/= 101°F, flank pain, chills, or any other manifestations&#xD;
        suggestive of upper UTI - Subjects with evidence of factors predisposing to the development&#xD;
        of UTIs, including calculi, stricture, primary renal disease (eg, polycystic renal&#xD;
        disease), or neurogenic bladder - Subjects currently taking, or who might require,&#xD;
        antibiotics other than Cipro XR during the study period- Subjects who had received any&#xD;
        systemic antibiotic therapy in the previous 48 hours, for any reason- Subjects who, in the&#xD;
        opinion of the investigator, were unsuitable for enrollment and were unlikely to complete&#xD;
        the course of treatment or to be available for follow-up- Subjects unable or unwilling to&#xD;
        comply with the use of an electronic subject diary to record UTI symptoms and impairment of&#xD;
        normal daily activities- Subjects requiring concomitant administration of theophylline -&#xD;
        Inability to take oral medication for any reason - Subjects with &gt;/= 3 episodes of UTIs in&#xD;
        the past 12 months - Subjects with onset of symptoms more than 72 hours prior to study&#xD;
        entry - Subjects with symptoms of a UTI within the 4 weeks prior to the present episode -&#xD;
        Subjects with previous history of tendinopathy associated with fluoroquinolones - Subjects&#xD;
        diagnosed with a rapidly fatal underlying disease (death expected within 6 months) -&#xD;
        Subjects previously enrolled in this clinical study - Subjects with known neutrophil count&#xD;
        &lt; 1000/mm3, CD4 &lt; 200/mm3, or other conditions associated with significant depression of&#xD;
        host defense; HIV testing was not mandatory - Subjects taking an investigational drug in&#xD;
        the last 30 days - Subjects who could not begin answering the first visit baseline&#xD;
        questionnaire by 5:00 pm&#xD;
