  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine people who have pain or fatigue symptoms with a known or unknown&#xD;
      diagnosis to determine eligibility for other research studies. No treatment is offered under&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age or older with symptoms of pain and fatigue may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants undergo standard examinations needed to diagnose or evaluate their&#xD;
      symptoms. The results of the test are used to screen subjects for possible participation in&#xD;
      other Nursing Institute studies. The study requires from one to three visits at NIH over 12&#xD;
      months for procedures that may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination and questionnaires related to symptoms and quality&#xD;
           of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tender point testing. Pressure is applied to areas of the shoulder, hip, neck, chest,&#xD;
           elbow and knee to identify tenderness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This screening protocol is designed to facilitate patient recruitment to the National&#xD;
      Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) clinical research studies on pain and fatigue syndromes.&#xD;
      This protocol will also validate the newly developed Saligan Fatigue Questionnaire. Patients&#xD;
      must meet the specific requirements of an IRB-approved research study; this protocol serves&#xD;
      as a first step for evaluating patients for possible inclusion in a natural history or&#xD;
      intervention protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with medical history/physical examination, routine laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and questionnaires. The physical examination may include the standardized tender point&#xD;
      assessment as specified in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) to diagnose&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, measurements of pain (allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperpathia), edema,&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction (altered skin color, temperature, or sudomotor activity), and extent of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal dysfunction. It will also assess the patients level of pain, fatigue, and&#xD;
      quality of life by providing questionnaires for the patients to complete. When the screening&#xD;
      is completed, patients will be informed of their options to participate in other NINR&#xD;
      interventional or observational clinical research studies. Patients who are not eligible for&#xD;
      these studies will be informed of alternative treatments. No treatment is offered under this&#xD;
      protocol. Information collected in this protocol will be used to determine eligibility to&#xD;
      other NINR protocols.&#xD;
