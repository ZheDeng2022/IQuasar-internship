      A phase IV, observational, survey-based study to measure compliance with Avonex® PS therapy&#xD;
      in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis, and to compare persistence on&#xD;
      therapy 22 months after initial prescription of AVONEX® PS between patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      current MS AllianceTM program versus patients enrolled in this program prior to October 2007.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hundred patients will be enrolled in the prospective portion of the study, all of whom&#xD;
      will receive AVONEX. Patients will join the study by signing the attached Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form (Appendix 1) at their doctor's office at the time of prescription. Innomar will provide&#xD;
      the drug to approximately 40 new patients per month, so it will take about twelve to fourteen&#xD;
      months to enroll all of the study subjects, assuming that all agree to participate. Once the&#xD;
      recruitment period is over, it will take another 22 months to complete the study to the&#xD;
      22-months point for the last subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the retrospective arm of the study, 500 chart reviews will be completed for patients who&#xD;
      had participated in the MS Alliance program two (2) to three (3) years ago to determine&#xD;
      persistence to therapy over a similar 22 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess patients' compliance (as defined above) with AVONEX therapy in the prospective&#xD;
      arm using self-reported patients questionnaire, as well as to compare patients' persistence&#xD;
      on therapy (as defined above) between prospective and retrospective arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate patients' satisfaction with new MSA program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients enrolled in the MSA program will be included in this study. There will be no&#xD;
      interventions above the current standard of care with the MSA program. Two distinct patient&#xD;
      arms will exist for this study: the prospective arm and the retrospective (chart review) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription of AVONEX® PS (prefilled syringes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolment in the MS AllianceTM program&#xD;
