      This study will determine if a rehabilitation exercise program can help people with pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PH) increase their physical activity. Patients with PH have an increase in&#xD;
      blood pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels (artery, vein or capillaries) that leads to&#xD;
      shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people with pulmonary hypertension between 21 and 75 years of age may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walk test: Subjects walk as fast as they can for 6 minutes on a walking track&#xD;
           to determine their ability to participate in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Subjects complete nine questionnaires related to their fatigue, daily&#xD;
           physical activity, mood, and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum treadmill test: The exercise begins at an easy level and gradually increases&#xD;
           until the subject says he or she can no longer continue or the investigator decides it&#xD;
           is not safe to continue. Subjects are fitted with a mask, electrodes and light sensors&#xD;
           to measure how well the heart is working and how well the muscles use oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pulmonary hypertension undergo the following additional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity monitoring: Patients wear a monitor for 3 days that measures movement and heart&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group assignment: Patients are randomly assigned to Group 1 (education plus aerobic&#xD;
           exercise) or Group 2 (education followed by exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 patients will attend classes three days a week at either Inova Fairfax Hospital&#xD;
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center or The National Institutes of Health for 10 weeks. Two&#xD;
           sessions a week will include a 1 hour education session as well as a 30-45 minute track&#xD;
           or treadmill exercise session. The third session will only include exercise. During the&#xD;
           education patients will learn about a healthy lifestyle with pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
           After the 10 weeks of education and exercise, subjects repeat the 6-minute walk test,&#xD;
           maximum treadmill test and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 patients participate in 2; 1-hour educational session at either the Inova&#xD;
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center or The National Institutes of Health for 10 weeks. After&#xD;
           the classes, they repeat the 6-minute walk test, maximum treadmill test and&#xD;
           questionnaires. The following 10 weeks will consist of 3 days a week of 30-45 minute&#xD;
           track or treadmill walking at either Inova or NIH, after which they again repeat the&#xD;
           questionnaires, treadmill and walk tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a randomized trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      for patients who have primary pulmonary hypertension (PH) or PH secondary to interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease (ILD). This project will be the first in a series of studies aimed at&#xD;
      establishing exercise prescription and general rehabilitation guidelines for patients who&#xD;
      have advanced lung diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential treatment for almost all cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders is aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training. The effectiveness of exercise rehabilitation has been established and&#xD;
      exercise rehabilitation has become a standard of care for patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD). However, fundamental information about the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      exercise training and its therapeutic benefits remains lacking for patients who have advanced&#xD;
      lung disease in general and specifically for those with PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be over the age of 21 years. The patients will be enrolled from sites within a&#xD;
      reasonable travel distance from the greater Washington area and will receive their exercise&#xD;
      training at Inova Fairfax Hospital or at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) main campus.&#xD;
      Exercise-based rehabilitation is already common for patients who have PH at the Inova Fairfax&#xD;
      Hospital. Their pulmonary rehabilitation program is well established, and their staff is&#xD;
      experienced in providing exercise therapy for patients with PH and advanced lung diseases.&#xD;
      The Rehabilitation Medicine Department (RMD) at The NIH Clinical Center has established a&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program for this protocol as well as to provide rehabilitation&#xD;
      services for NIH clinic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two primary treatment arms. Patients with PH will be randomized to either&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training plus education (AET) or education only (Ed-only) treatments. A&#xD;
      comparison group of patients with ILD who do not have secondary PH (ILD-only) will also&#xD;
      undergo the AET arm. Exercise training will consist of a 10-week regimen of supervised&#xD;
      treadmill or over ground walking three times a week. Exercise session duration will be 30&#xD;
      minutes and will progress to 45 minutes per session over the 10 weeks. The intensity of the&#xD;
      exercise will be between 70 and 80% of the heart rate reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be two secondary studies. First, the subjects with PH initially randomized to&#xD;
      the education only arm will complete an aerobic exercise training program after participation&#xD;
      in education. In addition, we will also compare baseline tests among patients with PH,&#xD;
      patients with ILD-only and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study outcome measures will be assessed at NIH, RMD. These will include pre- and&#xD;
      post-exercise training comparisons of symptom limited treadmill exercise tests to assess&#xD;
      heart rate, pulse oximetry, EKG, maximum oxygen consumption, bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      cardiography, and near infrared spectroscopy measurements of muscle oxygenation. We will also&#xD;
      assess accelerometry based activity, 6-minute walk distance, and a number of other quality of&#xD;
      life and functional measures questionnaires including: International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Fatigue Severity Scale, SF-36v2 Health Survey, Human Activity Profile, Stages&#xD;
      of Exercise Change, Exercise Self-Efficacy, Profile of Mood States, Cambridge Pulmonary&#xD;
      Hypertension Outcome Review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a unique opportunity to assess the effects of exercise on patients with&#xD;
      advanced lung disease and may open up valuable new treatment options for these patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PH and ILD-only Groups: Subjects of this study will include individuals with ILD and PH who&#xD;
        are referred for Pulmonary Rehabilitation. Patients with ILD, PH or PH comorbid with ILD&#xD;
        will be included. The following list provides more specific inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between age 21-82 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO functional class II or III, will accept WHO functional class I and IV based on 6&#xD;
             minute walk test results (less than or equal to 400 meters for Class I and greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 50 meters for Class IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No recent syncope or significant chest pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior Pulmonary Rehabilitation received within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically inactive, no participation in a structured exercise program 3 or more days&#xD;
             a week for over 30 minutes at each session including pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
             maintenance within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may qualify if they have any one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PAH diagnosed by right heart catheterization defined as resting pulmonary mean&#xD;
                  arterial pressure equal to or higher than 25 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Interstitial lung disease, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),&#xD;
                  non-specific pulmonary fibrosis (NSPF), sarcoidosis or other form of chronic lung&#xD;
                  fibrosis will be based on clinical context via clinic note from primary&#xD;
                  pulmonologist and an echo within one year of enrollment showing an RVSP &lt;40mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. If RVSP is lower than 40mmHg patients with interstitial lung disease will be&#xD;
                       enrolled without the need for a right heart catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. If RVSP is indeterminate on an echo procedure performed within a year of&#xD;
                       enrollment, the patient will undergo another echo test at The National&#xD;
                       Institutes of Health, Echocardiogram Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Only if RVSP is unable to be estimated on an echo at NIH, the absence of the&#xD;
                       following abnormalities on echo will be used: right ventricular enlargement,&#xD;
                       right ventricular hypertrophy, paradoxical movement of interventricular&#xD;
                       septum and/or altered pulmonary flow velocity. If RVSP is unable to be&#xD;
                       estimated and these abnormalities are absent on echo, the patient will be&#xD;
                       enrolled as an ILD-only patient. If any of these echocardiographic&#xD;
                       abnormalities are present the patient will not be enrolled until the results&#xD;
                       of a right heart catheterization can be obtained to verify the absence of&#xD;
                       pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Controls: The controls will include individuals who have never been diagnosed with&#xD;
        primary or secondary PH and are apparently healthy. Controls will be matched to the PH&#xD;
        cohort for age, gender, and body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 21 82 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically inactive, no participation in a structured exercise program 3 or more days&#xD;
             a week for over 30 minutes at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No cardiorespiratory or pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other diseases of the neurological, metabolic, renal, or musculoskeletal system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No medications that would influence aerobic capacity or treadmill performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH PH, ILD-ONLY AND HEALTHY CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since the goal is to examine exercise responses and adaptations as affected by PH, patients&#xD;
        will have no other (except the primary disease in those with secondary PH) medical&#xD;
        conditions that would impair aerobic capacity or the ability to engage in physical&#xD;
        activity. These conditions would include any of those affecting the cardiovascular,&#xD;
        pulmonary, metabolic, neurological, or musculoskeletal systems. Specific exclusion criteria&#xD;
        for the PH and control cohorts are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant Restrictive or Obstructive Lung Disease with a FEV1/FVC ratio less than or&#xD;
             equal to 65 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of ischemic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular dysfunction with the ejection fraction less than 40 or a documented&#xD;
             pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 18 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute cor pulmonale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-idiopathic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant hepatic or renal dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic cancer with a life expectance of less than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disabling stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe psychiatric disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with a history of DKA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mitochondrial disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children: Individuals younger than 21 years will not be included in the protocol&#xD;
             because reference ranges for normative aerobic capacity and aerobic fitness have not&#xD;
             been established for these age ranges.&#xD;
