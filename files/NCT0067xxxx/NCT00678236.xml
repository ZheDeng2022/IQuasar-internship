      The goal of this scientific study is to determine whether there are differences in early&#xD;
      migration and prosthesis-near bone density when a standard knee prosthesis is fixed with&#xD;
      Refobacin Bone Cement R or with Refobacin Plus Bone Cement. Migration will be evaluated with&#xD;
      RSA and bone density around the prosthesis with DEXA. The study will be successful if the&#xD;
      prosthesis is fixed and remains in place throughout the entire period of the study, that is,&#xD;
      that there is no increasing migration as measured by RSA. The cement type that ensures the&#xD;
      largest number of solidly fixed prostheses during the two-year evaluation period will be &quot;the&#xD;
      best&quot;.&#xD;

      Loosening of prosthetic components continues to play a large role in total knee alloplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) and need for revision. Osteolysis is an important part of prosthesis loosening, but we&#xD;
      still do not completely understand the mechanism. Research has shown that mechanical factors&#xD;
      such as weak bone cement and poor contact between cement/bone or cement/implant interphase&#xD;
      contribute to loosening of implants. Survival of cemented TKA components also depend on a&#xD;
      careful balancing of soft tissues around the knee, repair of lower extremity dislocations,&#xD;
      design of the prosthesis and the level of patients' activities. Sclerosis of the proximal&#xD;
      tibia can present a problem with regard to getting the cement to penetrate into the bone.&#xD;
      Poor operative technique, such as high volume or high pressure lavage of the prepared bone&#xD;
      surface, can result in reduced penetration of cement into the spongiosa and early failure of&#xD;
      the prosthesis, measured as progressive radiolucent lines (RLLs). En tourniquet counter acts&#xD;
      bleeding at the implant site and provides for better penetration of cement into the&#xD;
      trabeculae of the bone. If the bone surface at the implantation site is contaminated with&#xD;
      blood before the cement is applied, the shear strength in the bone/cement interphase can be&#xD;
      reduced by up to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prosthesis used in this study includes a tibial plateau with a central stem with&#xD;
      stabilizing wings, the bottom surface of which is recessed by about 1 mm, so that a pocket is&#xD;
      formed surrounded by a lip that provides for an even thickness of the cement layer beneath&#xD;
      the tibial plateau. This assures that the cement is pressed down into the spongiosa during&#xD;
      fixation of the implant. This design doubles the penetration of the cement compared with&#xD;
      prostheses without a depressed baseplate. The company behind this design has had a successful&#xD;
      follow-up of this system for more than 15 years. A good cement/implant interphase lessens the&#xD;
      risk of penetration of debris into the interphase and thus reduces the risk for the&#xD;
      development of osteolysis and aseptic loosening of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixation of knee alloplasties is done in 70% of cases with use of cement. It is uncertain&#xD;
      whether there is a difference in the long-term survival of knee prostheses with the two types&#xD;
      of cement used in this project. Both types of cement in this study are used today in knee&#xD;
      surgery with good, short-term clinical results. It is important to investigate new types of&#xD;
      cement in order to assure future patients the best possible results after knee alloplasty and&#xD;
      fewer re-operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this scientific study is to determine whether there are differences in early&#xD;
      migration and prosthesis-near bone density when a standard knee prosthesis is fixed with&#xD;
      Refobacin Bone Cement R or with Refobacin Plus Bone Cement. Migration will be evaluated with&#xD;
      RSA and bone density around the prosthesis with DEXA. The study will be successful if the&#xD;
