      This study will investigate how patients are informed of their cancer diagnosis or recurrence&#xD;
      and will explore their experience in learning about the diagnosis. Specifically, it will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distinguish methods of telling the diagnosis and identify its relationship to the type&#xD;
           of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if the way a patient is informed of their diagnosis is associated with their&#xD;
           level of satisfaction with the method of being informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify who informs the patient of their diagnosis..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine patient satisfaction with their diagnostic consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify indicators of satisfaction with the diagnostic consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in or being screened for enrollment in a&#xD;
      phase I, II or III clinical trial in the National Cancer Institute's Medical Oncology,&#xD;
      Metabolism, Surgery or Neuro-Oncology branch may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a 15-minute questionnaire that includes questions related to the how&#xD;
      they were informed of their cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
