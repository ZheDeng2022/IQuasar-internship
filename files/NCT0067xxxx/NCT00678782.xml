      To assess the therapeutic efficacy, of the clinical response of intraarticular (IA)&#xD;
      etanercept (E) 12.5 mg or placebo (P: NaCl) injections into single knee arthritic joint of&#xD;
      patients with refractory knee joint synovitis (KJS), administered once every two week, for&#xD;
      eight weeks, with cross over after 2 weeks, in two groups of randomly assigned patients, for&#xD;
      whom traditional systemic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is insufficient or&#xD;
      inappropriate. The primary outcome measure is the Thompson articular index of KJS disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single centre, placebo-controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial, with&#xD;
      randomization of treatment sequence and open-label extension to be conducted in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthropathies patients with resistant knee joint&#xD;
      synovitis (KJS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible if they suffered from persistent active KJS (characterized by pain,&#xD;
      tenderness, and effusion), which had proved resistant to surgical treatment or to repeated IA&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, or unresponsive to a minimum of 6 months second-line drug therapy&#xD;
      with DMARD-, and/or anti-TNFα biologic agent monotherapy and systemic oral corticosteroid&#xD;
      treatment, or to a combination therapy (drug failure is defined as discontinuation because of&#xD;
      intolerable adverse effects or lack of clinical efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Treatments: stable, appropriate doses of DMARDs (methotrexate, sulfasalazine,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine), DMARD combinations or low dose oral corticosteroids (≤10&#xD;
      mg prednisone) with or without non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents will be continued&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be permitted stable doses (no greater than the maximum dose recommended by the&#xD;
      manufacturer) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but will be permitted to use&#xD;
      only one NSAID at any given time. No analgesic could be taken before undergoing assessment on&#xD;
      the day clinical evaluations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Each dose of study drug will be administered as one intraarticular (IA)injection&#xD;
      carried out in each single knee joint that will be randomly assigned to blind treatment with&#xD;
      0.5 ml of etanercept (E) (12.5mg) or placebo (P) (NaCl). The IA injection will be&#xD;
      administered once every two weeks for an eight week period. After 2 weeks time the patients&#xD;
      will be crossed-over and each arthritic knee joint will receive E (12.5 mg) for four times or&#xD;
      P for three times, respectively, administered every two weeks for an eight week period. All&#xD;
      the IA injections will be administered after synovial fluid aspiration by the same operator.&#xD;
      The study, patients with KJS flare up after IA injection will be asked to enter the&#xD;
      open-label IA extension treatment with IA-E injection once every two weeks, for eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment: routine chemistry, haematology and urinalysis assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at the screening, baseline and final examinations. Tuberculosis screening will be&#xD;
      performed at the onset of the study. Patients will be evaluated clinically for adverse events&#xD;
      at each examination. Local tolerance at the injection site(s) will be evaluated at all the&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the patients' response: will be performed at baseline (T0) and at 2 (T2), 4&#xD;
      (T4), 6 (T6), and 8 (T8) weeks, and at the end of the 10 week single-blind, cross-over study&#xD;
      or at the end of the open-label IA extension-study (up to 14 weeks) (Tend).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the Thompson articular index (THOMP) sum of scores for each&#xD;
      knee joint, of pain on movement (0-3), soft tissue swelling (0-3) and warmth (0-3); (range&#xD;
      0-9). Secondary endpoints are: the Knee joint articular index (KJAI): the sum of the&#xD;
      tenderness scores (0-3), joint swelling (0-3), the ballottement of patella or the &quot;bulge&#xD;
      sign&quot; (0-2), and range of knee joint flexion (0-3) and extension (0-3) (KJAI, range 0-14).&#xD;
      Standard joint evaluation comprise: the 66/68 swollen joint number (SJN) and tender joint&#xD;
      number (TJN) (0-1); a modified Ritchie articular index (RAI), by assessment of 30 joints for&#xD;
      tenderness (0-3) (range: 0-90), (including hand and foot distal interphalangeal joints (DIP)&#xD;
      of each side as a group; the pain visual analogue scale (VAS) (0-100mm), the health&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire (HAQ)- disability index (0-3) and the SF36 (range 0-24) at the above&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum CRP, the ESR, and the maximal synovial thickness (measured by grey-scale&#xD;
      ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging) will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
