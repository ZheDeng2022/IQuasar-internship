        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a Physician Responsible, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including history, physical examination, laboratory tests, cardiac monitoring. A&#xD;
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory variables outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied, with the exception of liver transaminases,&#xD;
             troponin I and TSH, may be included only if the Investigator considers that the&#xD;
             finding will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures. Please note that subjects should have liver transaminases, troponin&#xD;
             I and TSH values within the range specified in the exclusion criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea and confirmed by screening follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml or &lt;140 pmol/L.. Females on hormone&#xD;
                  replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT and their post-menopausal status&#xD;
                  confirmed as per above tests prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at&#xD;
                  least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw;&#xD;
                  this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of&#xD;
                  their post-menopausal status, they are not allowed to use HRT during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods as per&#xD;
                  protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;
                  investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of&#xD;
                  pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at&#xD;
                  least 7 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods as per protocol. This&#xD;
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until&#xD;
             at least 7 days post last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No co-morbid Psychiatric Disorders as defined using the Mini International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) scale.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A 12-lead ECG at screening showing no abnormalities that in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As a result of any of the medical interview, physical examination or screening&#xD;
             investigations the Physician Responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject or his/her family has a history of a drug or other allergy which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Physician Responsible contraindicates the participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an unstable medical disorder or a disorder that would likely interfere&#xD;
             with the action, absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of GW823296, may&#xD;
             pose a safety concern, or interfere with accurate assessment of safety.&#xD;

             (AST) &gt;1.5x upper limit of the normal range (ULN); testing may be repeated once to see&#xD;
             if value returns to within acceptance range but any such laboratory abnormality must&#xD;
             be resolved by the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a troponin I value &gt;0.03 ng/mL at screening are not eligible. Testing&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a TSH value above the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) at screening&#xD;
             are not eligible. The subject should be referred to the treating physician for further&#xD;
             evaluation, as appropriate. Testing may be repeated once to see whether the value&#xD;

             until the end of the study period (follow-up visit), unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the&#xD;
             study procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
