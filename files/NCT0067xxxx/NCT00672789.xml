  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence is a true public health problem. Despite advancements in the&#xD;
      molecular understanding of disease and improvements in therapy, patient health outcomes will&#xD;
      not improve unless patients take prescribed medications regularly. Decreasing the gap between&#xD;
      efficacious and effective therapy for patients with SCD is an essential research agenda.&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea has been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and infants. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the prophylaxis depends on adherence to the recommended regimen. Medication&#xD;
      adherence in SCD has previously been found to be sub-optimal in patients taking penicillin,&#xD;
      desferoxamine, and pain medication. Adherence to HU has been studied to some extent in&#xD;
      children with SCD. Based on estimates of adherence in other chronic illness we expect&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients to be &gt;80% adherent with their HU administration. There is no&#xD;
      gold standard for improving adherence to treatment. There have been a few attempts in the SCD&#xD;
      population to improve adherence. These include a day camp to promote education about&#xD;
      desferoxamine and peer support, a combination of a slide-show about SCD and it complications,&#xD;
      weekly phone calls by the clinic social worker and a calendar, and a seven-phase educational&#xD;
      program. Given the striking improvements in the peripheral blood smear findings of patients&#xD;
      with SCD on HU therapy, with reduction in the numbers of sickled cells, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      viewing the peripheral blood smear of patients with poor adherence to HU compared to a blood&#xD;
      smear of someone on HU can be used to improve adherence in non-adherent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a randomized trial between the intervention of regularly showing children and&#xD;
      their parents the peripheral blood smear and standard care, including reminders of the&#xD;
      importance of compliance and review of complete blood count parameters, including WBC, MCV,&#xD;
      and Hgb concentration. The outcome measures will be increase in hemoglobin concentration and&#xD;
      %HbF and increase in perceived QOL. QOL will be measured with age-appropriate and&#xD;
      parent/proxy PedsQLâ„¢. Medication adherence will also be monitored throughout the study with&#xD;
      pharmacy prescription refills, physician assessment, and self-report via a visual analogue&#xD;
      scale. Adherence estimates, hemoglobin concentration, %HbF and QOL will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
