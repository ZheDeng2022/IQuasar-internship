      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving certain combinations of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs before and after surgery, mostly in the outpatient clinic instead of in&#xD;
      the hospital, can result in fewer hospital stays during treatment for osteosarcoma. The drugs&#xD;
      and schedules will vary depending on the status of the cancer and its level of risk for&#xD;
      spreading, but they will include combinations of doxorubicin (non-liposomal), cisplatin,&#xD;
      methotrexate, and ifosfamide, as described below.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment combination used to treat patients with osteosarcoma is doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide. When this treatment combination is&#xD;
      given in the hospital, it can require around 18-22 hospital stays. Somewhat recently,&#xD;
      chemotherapy for osteosarcoma has become possible to give in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn if giving 4 certain drugs (the combination of doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide) in the outpatient setting to eligible&#xD;
      patients will help to decrease the number of hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, all study participants whose tumor(s) can be taken out with surgery will&#xD;
      be offered routine surgery to remove the tumor(s). After surgery, if the doctor believes the&#xD;
      tumor(s) have responded well enough, the standard treatment combination is again doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cisplatin, and methotrexate. If the tumor(s) have not responded well enough, however, the&#xD;
      standard treatment combination is methotrexate and ifosfamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants are considered at &quot;higher risk&quot; for the tumor(s) spreading to the&#xD;
      lungs in the following cases: if the participant's tumor(s) are large at the time of joining&#xD;
      this study, if the cancer has spread to other organs, and/or if standard chemotherapy in this&#xD;
      study has not killed enough tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following drugs are used in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doxorubicin is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to&#xD;
           die.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin has an atom at its center that contains a type of metal called platinum. The&#xD;
           platinum is supposed to poison the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate is designed to disrupt cells (including cancer cells) from making and&#xD;
           repairing DNA and &quot;copying&quot; themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ifosfamide is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to&#xD;
           die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups based on the likelihood that the surgery will be able to control the disease in the&#xD;
      arm or leg that has the bone tumor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 includes participants who are considered to have a &quot;standard&quot; chance that surgery&#xD;
      will be able to control the disease in the arm or leg, participants who will have an&#xD;
      amputation, or participants with cancer in areas other than in an arm or leg at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 includes participants who are considered to have a &quot;higher&quot; chance that the tumor(s)&#xD;
      will be left behind after having surgery that the doctor considers as &quot;incomplete&quot; to control&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Venous Line:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For drugs to be given by vein, your study doctor will likely recommend that you have a&#xD;
      central venous line (CVL) placed. A central venous line is a sterile flexible tube that will&#xD;
      be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain&#xD;
      this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent&#xD;
      form for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, Group 1 participants will receive doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate&#xD;
      followed by leucovorin. Leucovorin is given to help prevent and/or treat the side effects&#xD;
      that methotrexate may cause. Dexrazoxane is used to decrease the risk of side effects to the&#xD;
      heart that doxorubicin may cause. These drugs will be given in an outpatient clinic (without&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization), if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin will be given by vein over 15 minutes, after dexrazoxane by vein over 15 minutes,&#xD;
      on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2 of&#xD;
      Weeks 1 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methotrexate will be given by vein, over 4 hours, on Day 1 of Weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. If you&#xD;
      have difficulty recovering from the effects of the methotrexate therapy, you may only receive&#xD;
      methotrexate twice before surgery, instead of 4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and&#xD;
      then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate&#xD;
      level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood&#xD;
      test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each&#xD;
      methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to&#xD;
      stop the leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, Group 2 participants will receive dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Weeks 1, 4, and 7, dexrazoxane will be given by vein over 15 minutes, followed by&#xD;
      doxorubicin given by vein over 15 minutes and then cisplatin through an artery over 4 hours.&#xD;
      Infusion through an artery requires a hospital stay of 2-4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all eligible study participants, the surgery to remove the tumor(s) will be performed on&#xD;
      either Week 11 or 12. The surgery will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked&#xD;
      to sign a separate consent form for it that will describe its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, you will have routine visits with the surgeon. You will have several routine&#xD;
      scans performed to help plan the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy Regimens after Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery (on or around Week 14), you will receive additional &quot;post-surgery&quot;&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, if you were originally in Group 1, and if the doctor believes the tumor(s)&#xD;
      have responded well enough (specifically, if 90% or more of the tumor cells are dead when&#xD;
      checked under the microscope), you will receive additional chemotherapy that is similar to&#xD;
      what you received before surgery. This is described below as Regimen A. If the doctor does&#xD;
      not believe the tumor(s) have responded well enough (if less than 90% of the tumor cells are&#xD;
      dead when checked under the microscope), however, you will be assigned to Regimen B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who started in Group 2 will be assigned to Regimen B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation and Chemotherapy for Patients Ineligible for Routine Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of participants on this study may need to have radiation therapy to help&#xD;
      control the disease, as part of their routine care. This would only be done if the tumor(s)&#xD;
      cannot be completely taken out with surgery, or if amputation is necessary but refused by the&#xD;
      participant. If needed, and depending on where the tumor(s) are located, your doctor may&#xD;
      decide that radiation is needed. All participants needing radiation or having surgery that&#xD;
      the doctor considers as &quot;incomplete&quot; to control the disease are considered &quot;higher risk&quot; and&#xD;
      will receive Regimen B therapy during and after radiation. (Radiation will usually begin&#xD;
      during Weeks 12-14, but it could be anytime during ifosfamide therapy.) The radiation therapy&#xD;
      will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for&#xD;
      it that will describe its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A includes the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, 25, 29,&#xD;
           and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doxorubicin will be given on Day 1 of Weeks 16, 21, and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2&#xD;
           of Weeks 16, 21, and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate&#xD;
           dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that&#xD;
           the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be&#xD;
           checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be&#xD;
           performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood&#xD;
           level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen B includes the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 20, 21, 26, 27, 32,&#xD;
           33, 38, and 39.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate&#xD;
           dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that&#xD;
           the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be&#xD;
           checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be&#xD;
           performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood&#xD;
           level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ifosfamide will be given by vein, continuously over 5 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22,&#xD;
           28, and 34.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesna will be given by vein, continuously over 6 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22, 28,&#xD;
           and 34. Mesna is used to decrease the risk of bleeding in the bladder and kidneys while&#xD;
           ifosfamide is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Week 5 of treatment, and then again before surgery, you will have the following tests&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be collected for routine tests and tests of&#xD;
           your kidney and liver function. The routine blood tests may be repeated more often&#xD;
           during the weeks you are receiving any of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are receiving cisplatin, you may have a hearing test performed before each dose of&#xD;
      this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an ECHO performed before your fourth dose of doxorubicin on Week 14, and&#xD;
      possibly more often if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete 5 brief questionnaires on 5 different days during this study.&#xD;
      The questionnaires ask about the health-related quality of your life, and include questions&#xD;
      about how you have felt, physically and emotionally, during cancer treatment. The&#xD;
      questionnaires also ask how you and your family have adapted to your having cancer&#xD;
      treatments, and what effects the medicines may have had on whether you have felt healthy or&#xD;
      sick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires will be completed at Week 1, at about Week 7 (before surgery or&#xD;
      radiation), sometime during Weeks 20-22, at the end-of-treatment visit (either the&#xD;
      end-of-Regimen-A visit, the end-of-Regimen-B visit, or the end-of-treatment visit), and 1&#xD;
      year after your first diagnosis of cancer. It should take you about 15-20 minutes to fill out&#xD;
      the questionnaires each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor allows and you agree, some of the blood tests in this study may be&#xD;
      performed outside of M. D. Anderson. The study doctor will discuss this option with you, if&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Regimen-A Visit, End-of-Regimen-B Visit, or End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you complete Regimen A or B as planned or you leave the study early for any reason, the&#xD;
      following procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your&#xD;
           kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECHO, x-rays of the disease area and the chest, CT scans of the chest,&#xD;
           and a bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also have whole-body scans and a hearing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-Regimen-A visit, the end-of-Regimen-B visit, or the end-of-treatment visit,&#xD;
      you will be asked to return for follow-up visits. At these visits, the following procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans of the chest will be performed every 3 months for the first year after your&#xD;
           chemotherapy ends, every 4 months for the 2nd year, every 6 months for the 3rd year, and&#xD;
           once a year for the next 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan every year for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available and commonly used in osteosarcoma. This study is designed to look at the drugs' use&#xD;
      in the outpatient setting, which is considered research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
