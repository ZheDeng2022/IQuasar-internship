      Autism is a developmental and behavioral pattern which includes the triad of impairments, 1.&#xD;
      social interaction 2. social communication 3. imagination. Inevitable difficulties in the&#xD;
      treatment, managing and handle with autistic children are the main problems. Their memories&#xD;
      are seemingly in picture or photo records, which are difference from normal population. There&#xD;
      are many concepts but no concise in causative factors, including useful treatments, useless&#xD;
      and prolong remaining in many studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) is a quite modern treatment in Thailand for nitrogen&#xD;
      imbalance (decompression sickness syndrome or Caisson disease). How can we apply it to treat&#xD;
      the autism? A hypothesis shows evidence that neurons surrounding the permanently damaged&#xD;
      epicenter of injury can be reactivated with increased oxygen. Oxygen exists in the blood in&#xD;
      two forms, combined with hemoglobin and dissolved in plasma. More oxygen is transported by&#xD;
      hemoglobin, but oxygen is delivered to the tissues in dissolved form by the liquid portion of&#xD;
      blood. HBOT can increase in plasma oxygen to the tissues including the brain. A little change&#xD;
      in oxygen can make the better improvements in : cognitive ability, socialization, sleep,&#xD;
      calmness, decreased stimming and language. It can make increased in Glutathione (GSH), and&#xD;
      Glutathione (GSH) can decreased in oxidative stress with effected to remove metal compounds&#xD;
      (mercury) to improve the autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial study divided into 3 group populations 1. general autism 2.&#xD;
      post-treatment chiropractic autism 3. medicated autism. This comparative study shows the&#xD;
      major clinical symptoms before and after the treatment with HBOT. This study results and&#xD;
      analysis are the most important for our further projects planning.&#xD;

      Detailed Description There is a general agreement that early identification of autistic&#xD;
      spectrum disorders in children and intervention is extremely important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to find out beneficial effects for early identification and treatment in the&#xD;
      autism. Another meaning, it declares that the autism is treatable and can be prevention in&#xD;
      the early stage of the symptoms. According to many studies, they had shown brain injury could&#xD;
      be caused by heavy metal effects, chemical poisoning, infection, autoimmune response, poor&#xD;
      blood flow, lack of oxygen. There are many alternative therapies that were claimed to have&#xD;
      some effects to make better results in autistic symptoms, but no definite one which could&#xD;
      absolutely cured to the autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) is a new way in the treatment for decompression sickness&#xD;
      syndrome (Caisson disease) and it can be applied to intervene or concomitant treatments with&#xD;
      some symptoms such as diabetic wounds, burnt wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vachira Phuket Hospital, HBOT center and child development center was established in 2002.&#xD;
      This HBOT center is the only one stand-alone center of provincial hospitals in Thailand.&#xD;
      Enthusiastic questions in our proceedings were how to declare our opportunities to be a&#xD;
      center in HBOT and child developmental center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If HBOT can be an effective method in alternative therapies, we can help our numerous&#xD;
      autistic children. In our proceeding study we found that HBOT was the least interesting&#xD;
      method of alternative therapies for the autism in parental opinions. (Figure 1.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General information, the most of sampling groups (75.68%) are female, 40.54% of&#xD;
           aged-groups are 30-40 years old, 37.84% of occupations are employee and 32.43% of&#xD;
           educations are primary school.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information about opinion of alternative therapies, the most of parents think that the&#xD;
           music therapy is the best way. The second is Chiropractic and the third is Art therapy&#xD;
           but Animal therapy with the pony is the least effective way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the topic of the knowledge about Alternative therapies, the most of parents know about&#xD;
      Chiropractic, Art therapy and Music therapy as sequence. The parents know Hyperbaric Oxygen&#xD;
      Therapy as the least.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They interested in Music therapy, Chiropractic and Art therapy as sequence. But they are&#xD;
      interested in animal therapy with pony and dog as the least. The researchers think that the&#xD;
      parents' knowledge about each therapy affects their decision making to choose for their&#xD;
      children. Vachira Phuket Hospital has Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Chamber) which is the new&#xD;
      therapy for Autistic children but the parents don't have the knowledge about it. So, the&#xD;
      researchers wonder how should we give the information to the parents in order to get the most&#xD;
      benefit from this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1. Autistic parental attitude surveys in effective, knowledge and interesting in&#xD;
      various therapies at Vachira Phuket Hospital, July 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whatever it is our opportunities to prove how effective of HBOT in the treatment for autism&#xD;
      and represent autistic pathology mechanisms in preceding hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administrator's support is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Equipment (HBOT) is in the same place with Development Training Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study by professional physicians in various associated experiences and the developmental&#xD;
           nurse, psychologist who accustom with children and the parents (caretakers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Convenience in transportation, which is in a small province.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This HBOT is solitary equipment, governed beneath Thailand Ministry of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disadvantages&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Publication in knowledge about HBOT is very low in Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Harmful may be unknown hidden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stigmatization is a delicate point in the parents of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Worrying and guilty feelings are easily occurred in the parents when something may be&#xD;
           unexpected happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A small province liked Phuket may be difficult to find volunteers for research or&#xD;
           study's enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Information gathering and assessment processes including scoring forms may be underneath&#xD;
           standardization and not up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems-solving plans&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed knowledge about HBOT, more and more, to the parents and community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-treatment evaluation was carefully evaluated according to good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respected to their honour, patient's right and kept confidential of the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reassured the parents and clarified in details of their concerned issues. Explained the&#xD;
           strategies explicitly and slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Therefore studied in a small group, closed observation was applied to integrated in&#xD;
           details for descriptive study in the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. It could be a pilot study if their any parts of this study were not clearly understood.&#xD;
           And thereafter, study planning in the future will be done in the advance conforming&#xD;
           design and methodology following our knowledgeable experiences.&#xD;
