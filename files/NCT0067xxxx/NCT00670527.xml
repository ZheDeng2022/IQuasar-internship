    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the value of 18F-choline PET/CT for the detection of&#xD;
      regional lymph node metastases from prostate cancer. In addition, the investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate whether 18F-choline PET/CT can replace lymphadenectomy for the staging of prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective trail is to improve the staging of patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators focus on the group of patients with a newly diagnosed prostate&#xD;
      cancer, and specifically the ones who have an intermediate and high risk of disseminated&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to improve staging by replacing the traditional invasive method, the&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy, which has a rather low sensitivity by a non-invasive method, 18F-choline&#xD;
      PET/CT which has a presumably superior sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of patients with prostate cancer relies on the stage of the disease. Patients&#xD;
      with disseminated prostate cancer are incurable and are treated with palliatively. In&#xD;
      contrast, patients with localized prostate cancer are offered curative therapy. Hence, the&#xD;
      stage of prostate cancer is crucial for the choice of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients avoid the surgical trauma including complications and convalescents period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accuracy of the prostate cancer staging is improved, the potential of which is&#xD;
           better survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are 18F-choline PET/CT scanned prior to their lymphadenectomy, the results of&#xD;
      the 18F-choline PET/CT are blinded for the surgeon. The endpoint of the trail is the&#xD;
      comparison of 18F-choline PET/CT and the histopathological investigation of the regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes of prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a prevalence of metastasised prostate cancer of 20% and a true (unknown) sensitivity&#xD;
      of FCH PET/CT of 95%, 205 patients are sufficient to show that the sensitivity of the FCH&#xD;
      PET/CT is greater than 80% with a power of 80% at significance level 5%. The size of the&#xD;
      confidence interval for specificity of FCH PET/CT is expected to become reasonable small. In&#xD;
      opposition to lymphadenectomy, FCH PET/CT results may point to metastases in neighbouring&#xD;
      regions which gives an additional benefit to FCH PET/CT justifying a test level for&#xD;
      sensitivity of 80%.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly 205 patients will be included over 2½ years. The first patients have been&#xD;
      included in January 2008. Interim analyses will be done after 25, 50 and 100 patients.&#xD;

    <description>The patients fast 6 hours before the [18F]Fluorocholine PET/CT scan. [18F]Fluorocholine will be used as tracer with a dosage of 4 MBq per kg bodyweight. PET/CT imaging will be performed after 15 and 60 after the intravenous injection of the tracer. The patient will receive 2 full body FCH PET/CT. The CT scan is with contrast.&#xD;
The radiation exposure from the CT scan is 9 mSv and from the PET scan it is 3 mSv, giving a total of 12 mSv, which equals 4 times the yearly background radiation in Denmark.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a biopsy confirmed prostate cancer who awaits curative treatment and&#xD;
             have&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An elevated level of prostate-specific antigen PSA&gt;10 ng/mL (nanogram per milliliter)&#xD;
             or/and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Gleason score &gt; 6 or/and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A TNM staging of T3&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who withdraw their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a bone scan indicates metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        In the case we detect a patient having an obvious other major illness e.g. lung cancer, the&#xD;
        patient is referred to relevant treatment. Depending on the illness the might be excluded&#xD;
        from the study.&#xD;
