  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although several studies have contrasted the hemodynamics of cerebral arteries using cranial&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound between full-term and preterm infants, the assessments were mostly&#xD;
      conducted in the first days of life. Furthermore, the clinically significant hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameter has been established from a small sample of infants that its validity on other&#xD;
      populations remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the hemodynamics of cerebral arteries in full-term and very low birth weight&#xD;
           preterm infants at term age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the validity of the hemodynamic parameters in relation to concurrent&#xD;
           neurobehavioral function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll normal full-term infants and very low birth weight preterm infants who&#xD;
      have no major neonatal disease. Cranial Doppler ultrasound examination will be performed on&#xD;
      all infants at term age. Hemodynamic parameters will include peak systolic velocity, end&#xD;
      diastolic velocity, resistance index and pulsatility index for the bilateral anterior&#xD;
      cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries. Neurobehavioral development will be&#xD;
      administered on the same day using the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Examination- Chinese version.&#xD;

      We estimate the sample size of this study based on the cerebral blood flow velocity data of&#xD;
      Kempley's study that showed 7.2 ± 3.5 and 10.7 ± 2.4 cm/s for the MCAs in 13 preterm and 8&#xD;
      full-term infants, respectively. As the power is set at 0.8 and the α level is at 0.05, at&#xD;
      least 17 subjects were required for each group. This study will include 20 full-term and 20&#xD;
      VLBW preterm infants who are born at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and the&#xD;
      Mackay Memorial Hospital (MMH), Taipei, Taiwan. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from the parents before participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial Doppler ultrasound and the NNE-C examinations will be performed within 5 days after&#xD;
      birth on full-term infants and at post-menstrual age (PMA) of 40 weeks (± 1 week) on preterm&#xD;
      infants in the baby room. If the examination time occurs after hospital discharge, assessment&#xD;
      will be conducted in the baby room at NTUH or in the ultrasound examination room at MMH. The&#xD;
      examinations will be performed when the babies show stable vital signs in daily activities.&#xD;
      The NNE-C examination will be administered one hour prior to feeding to minimize distress.&#xD;
      The NNE-C examination will be performed immediately after the ultrasound assessment. The two&#xD;
      examinations will be performed by different examiners who were blind to each other's results.&#xD;
      During brain Doppler ultrasound examination, each infant will be placed on the back in a baby&#xD;
      crib or an incubator with his/her head in midline. Infant's behavioral state will be kept in&#xD;
      the behavioral state of 1 (quiet sleep), 2 (active sleep), or 3 (drowsy) on Brazelton's&#xD;
      classification to eliminate the impact on cerebral blood flow velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters will include PSV, EDV, RI, and PI from bilateral ACAs and MCAs as&#xD;
      obtained by the pulse wave color Doppler. The ACA will be approached through the anterior&#xD;
      fontanel on the sagittal plane and its blood flow velocity will be determined at the proximal&#xD;
      part. The MCA will be approached under the transverse plane by placing the transducer on the&#xD;
      temporal bone below the zygomatic arch. The flow velocity measurements will be obtained by&#xD;
      Fourier transform analysis from homogeneous blood flow wave patterns over at least 3 cardiac&#xD;
      cycles with good clear signals. Those signals that show complete and similar waveforms in the&#xD;
      adjacent cycles and have high magnitudes with visible margin recognized from the background&#xD;
      noise will be selected. The RI and PI are the ratio between the different velocities with the&#xD;
      formulas: RI = (PSV-EDV) / PSV, PI = (PSV-EDV) / mean velocity. The whole ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
