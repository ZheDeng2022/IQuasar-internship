  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-country, multicentre, observational prospective data collection cross&#xD;
      sectional study of patients with stable COPD in Latin America. Primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      and characterize COPD symptoms over a period of 24 hours, by collecting information about the&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms experienced at different times of the day and night-time in patients&#xD;
      with stable COPD under real clinical practice conditions. Correlation between each of these&#xD;
      symptoms and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)&#xD;
      classification, adherence to respiratory treatment, level of dyspnea, disease severity,&#xD;
      comorbidities and physical activity as well direct costs will be done as secondary&#xD;
      objectives. Study population are patients of 40 years and older, smokers or ex smokers of &gt;=&#xD;
      10 pack/years with previous COPD diagnosis, attending outpatient specialists consults in&#xD;
      Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico. Sample size is&#xD;
      targeted to 900 enroled patients in order to ensure 860 patients to achieve statistical power&#xD;
      to primary objective.&#xD;

      This is a multi-country, multicentre, observational prospective data collection cross&#xD;
      sectional study of patients with stable COPD in Latin America. Primary objective is to&#xD;
      describe prevalence, severity and interrelationship of early morning, day and night-time&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with stable COPD in Latin America (LatAm). Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the relationship between early morning, day and night-time symptoms and 2013 GOLD&#xD;
      classification, adherence to respiratory treatment (TAI and Morisky Medicaction Adherence&#xD;
      Scale - MMAS-8), level of dyspnea (mMRC), disease severity (BODEX), comorbidities (COTE) and&#xD;
      physical activity (IPAQ) as well direct costs by assessing health resources utilization (HRU)&#xD;
      and exacerbations during last 12 months and respiratory treatment of last 2 months. Study&#xD;
      population are patients of 40 years and older, smokers or ex smokers of &gt;= 10 pack/years with&#xD;
      previous COPD diagnosis, attending outpatient specialists consults in Argentina, Chile,&#xD;
      Colombia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico. Sample size is targeted to 900 enroled&#xD;
      patients in order to ensure 860 patients to achieve statistical power to primary objective.&#xD;
      Data source and study conduct: site staff will retrospectively collect the necessary&#xD;
      information from the patient's medical record to determine eligibility. Consecutively,&#xD;
      patients with diagnosis and stable COPD will be screened and, if eligible, consented and&#xD;
      enrolled. There will be only one study visit. For each patient, the physician will collect&#xD;
      the following data at visit (from medical records or interviewing in study visit): social&#xD;
      demographics, health insurance system, lifestyle, smoking history, comorbidities, level of&#xD;
      dyspnea, disease severity, COPD prescribed treatments including therapeutic class, device,&#xD;
      modality (rescue/maintenance) and posology during last past 2 months, exacerbations history&#xD;
      and healthcare resources utilisation during last 12 months. In addition, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked to provide data on disease-related symptomatology assessed during 24 hs day (early&#xD;
      morning, daytime and night time symptoms), adherence to inhalers, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL) and physical activity. AstraZeneca will develop Data Management Plan (DMP) and a&#xD;
      website database platform for the purpose of this study. Data will be registered by PI&#xD;
      directly in a website data platform. The LASSYC study is an observational cross sectional&#xD;
      study which does not involve or study a specific medicinal product. Because of the&#xD;
      non-interventional nature of this study, a simple monitoring plan is required. 100% of source&#xD;
      data verification (SDV) of 10% of total enrolled patients, estimating that one site per&#xD;
      country would be enough.The Non-Interventional Study will be performed in accordance with&#xD;
      ethical principles that are consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonization (ICH)and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable&#xD;
      legislation on Non-Interventional Studies.&#xD;
