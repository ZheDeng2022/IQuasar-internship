  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Clinical Investigation is to validate that the clinical use of the&#xD;
      VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™ is safe for the operator, patient and third parties, and to confirm&#xD;
      its performance to percutaneously close femoral arterial puncture sites in the range of 18-24&#xD;
      F, post endovascular procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-inferiority study based on safety. Safety will be assessed by incidence and&#xD;
      severity of major complication rates directly related to the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE up to 3&#xD;
      months from implantation is no worse than those associated with cut-down and sutured close.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and performance of the VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE. The study shall not be blinded prior&#xD;
      to, during or post the procedure. All patients undergoing a procedure requiring an&#xD;
      arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery will be screened&#xD;
      against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the requirements of the&#xD;
      clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide informed consent and&#xD;
      shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects shall have an immediately post procedure, 24 hour, 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. Safety data from the follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
