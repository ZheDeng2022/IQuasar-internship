  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, the foetus is therefore chronically exposed to a large number of&#xD;
      substances. A number of studies have started to emphasize the effects of this antenatal&#xD;
      exposure on the newborn infant's morphological parameters (weight, crown-rump length, etc.).&#xD;
      However, in addition to these morphological effects, pesticides may also induce various&#xD;
      effects on physiological functions, as some pesticides act as inhibitors of neurotransmitters&#xD;
      involved in many nervous system regulation pathways in man. This is particularly the case for&#xD;
      organophosphates, which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. A previous study conducted by&#xD;
      the coordinator of the project presented here demonstrated the presence of high levels of&#xD;
      this type of pesticide in meconium (1st stool) in neonates born in Picardy. This inhibition&#xD;
      of the enzyme metabolizing ACh could have an impact on neurophysiological functions mediated&#xD;
      by this neurotransmitter. Sleep or respiratory control, vital functions of the neonate&#xD;
      particularly in preterm neonates, could therefore be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhysioMéco project is therefore designed to study the possible links between antenatal&#xD;
      exposure to pesticides and modifications of respiratory control allowed by peripheral&#xD;
      chemoreceptor in preterm neonates. Antenatal exposure will be determined by pesticide assays&#xD;
      in the meconium of neonates in combination with an exposure questionnaire to determine the&#xD;
      sources of these pesticides. Sleep and respiratory control will be studied in these neonates&#xD;
      nursed in incubators. Hypoxic test will be used in order to assess respiratory control&#xD;
      involving the peripheral chemoreceptors.&#xD;
