  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the disproportionate representation of men who have sex with men (MSM)&#xD;
      in the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic&#xD;
      in Kazakhstan, a country that has seen some of the largest growth in new HIV infections since&#xD;
      the turn of the century. Using a stepped wedge trial across 4 cities in Kazakhstan, the&#xD;
      proposed study will test a strategic and innovative social network-based intervention for MSM&#xD;
      who use drugs in Kazakhstan as a strategy to increase their numbers in the HIV continuum of&#xD;
      care as well as services that address issues that co-occur with HIV, including drug abuse,&#xD;
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, and other sexually transmitted infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is designed to utilize MSM as experts and leverage social network processes&#xD;
      to increase the number of MSM in Kazakhstan to be engaged in the HIV continuum of care. The&#xD;
      unit of randomization will be a city, with the timing of roll-out of the social network-based&#xD;
      intervention in each of the study's cities-Almaty, Astana, Pavlodar, and Shymkent-under&#xD;
      experimental control. Receipt/delivery of an intervention to enrolled participants will&#xD;
      depend on whether the city is in the intervention delivery phase or not. If a participant is&#xD;
      in a city during a time period where the intervention is not being delivered then for that&#xD;
      time period, the participant is in the control condition. If the participant is in a city&#xD;
      during a time period where the intervention is being delivered then the participant (in fact,&#xD;
      all participants in that city) will be considered assigned to the intervention group at that&#xD;
      time. In theory, all participants will have the opportunity to experience and receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Some participants will be enrolled after the intervention has been rolled out&#xD;
      in the city in which they reside; thus, they will only experience the intervention condition&#xD;
      and not the control condition.&#xD;
