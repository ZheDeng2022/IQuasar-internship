  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are known to cause rare but serious side effects such as rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of&#xD;
      muscle tissue) but many patients stop taking statins due to less severe symptoms, such as&#xD;
      muscle pain or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether symptoms occurring during statin use are caused by&#xD;
      statins. The trial will compare patient-reported side effects of statins (20mg atorvastatin)&#xD;
      vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to alternating treatment blocks of either statin or placebo split&#xD;
      into six two-month treatment periods. At the end of each period, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      self-report side effects using a website or mobile app.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Statins reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and are recommended as&#xD;
           part of the treatment strategy for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Although&#xD;
           statins are the most commonly prescribed treatment in the UK, there is uncertainty about&#xD;
           adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe statin adverse effects are rare but there is widespread reporting of less&#xD;
           well-defined statin-related symptoms in the media, notably muscle pain and weakness that&#xD;
           significantly affect statin users. These reports have been prompted by non-randomised,&#xD;
           non-blinded observational studies but have not been confirmed in blinded randomised&#xD;
           controlled trials (RCTs). A major limitation of observational studies is lack of&#xD;
           blinding: patients taking a medication expect to experience adverse effects and&#xD;
           therefore report high levels of symptoms vs. statin-free population. This phenomenon,&#xD;
           the &quot;nocebo&quot; effect, leads to bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many patients believe their muscle symptoms are statin related, leading to therapeutic&#xD;
           discontinuation. GPs face challenging decision making when patients present statin&#xD;
           related symptoms and there is no diagnostic tool to evaluate statin symptom burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
           StatinWISE is a N-of-1 trial and offers patients individual study results. Patients are&#xD;
           their own control, and therefore optimal treatment can be established. StatinWISE will&#xD;
           address some of the criticisms of previous evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TRIAL DESIGN i) Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled N-of-1 trial ii) Patients&#xD;
           who have stopped or are considering discontinuation of their statin due to muscle&#xD;
           symptoms iii) Once-daily oral administration of Atorvastatin (20mg) or placebo iv) Study&#xD;
           treatment is 12-months v) IMP in 2-month treatment periods vi) Quantify the occurrence&#xD;
           of self-reported muscle symptoms vii) 200 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Participants will be recruited directly from GP&#xD;
           Practices or by advertising to the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participating practices will recruit eligible patients from two groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Patients who are considering discontinuation of their statin due to muscle symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
           These patients will be invited to take part in the trial when they visit the GP to&#xD;
           report muscle symptoms believed to be associated with statins and where the patient/GP&#xD;
           is considering stopping statins because of the muscle symptoms. The GP or Research Nurse&#xD;
           will approach the patient and give the patient information sheet. If interested,&#xD;
           patients will be able to consent and complete the screening visit with the GP or the&#xD;
           Research Nurse during this appointment or it can be arranged for another suitable time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Patients who have stopped taking a statin in the last 3 years due to muscle&#xD;
           symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A search of the practice electronic records will be performed by the Research Nurse on a&#xD;
           two-monthly basis for one year (or until recruitment targets are reached) to identify&#xD;
           potentially eligible patients. All screened patients will be documented on a screening&#xD;
           log. The list will be reviewed by the GP to confirm clinical eligibility before patients&#xD;
           are invited to take part. A letter inviting them to attend a screening visit,&#xD;
           accompanied with the patient information sheet for the patient to consider, will be sent&#xD;
           by the trial team from their GP practice. Contact details of the Research Nurse will be&#xD;
           provided should the patient have any questions. A reply slip will be enclosed for the&#xD;
           patient to complete if they wish to attend the screening visit, which will be returned&#xD;
           to the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), during which the trial will be explained, and they&#xD;
           will have the opportunity to ask questions. Patients will be sent a letter of invitation&#xD;
           to consider participation up to a maximum of three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Patients who contact the CTU from advertising: Patients who contact the CTU in&#xD;
           response to advertising material will be sent a letter to request their GP details on a&#xD;
           reply slip. Following receipt of these documents the CTU will contact their GP with&#xD;
           their consent. The GP will be asked to confirm that the patient is potentially suitable&#xD;
           for the trial and to provide brief clinical information to allow eligibility to be&#xD;
           assessed. This information will then be provided to the GP surgery responsible for&#xD;
           recruiting the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 DRUG MANUFACTURE, BLINDING AND SUPPLY OF TRIAL MEDICATION Atorvastatin will be&#xD;
           purchased on the open market. Placebo will be manufactured specially to match the IMP.&#xD;
           Capsules and packaging will be identical in appearance for both IMP and placebo. DBcapsÂ®&#xD;
           capsules have a unique locking mechanism to help with assuring the integrity of the&#xD;
           blind will be used for over encapsulation of both active and placebo treatments. The&#xD;
           blinding process will involve encapsulating the active tablet, complete removal of the&#xD;
           original manufacturer's label and replacement with the clinical trial label bearing the&#xD;
           randomisation number which will be used as the pack identification. Outer pack labelling&#xD;
           will be identical for IMP and placebo and will be in compliance with regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 DATA COLLECTION Baseline data will be collected at each GP practice and will be&#xD;
           entered directly online to the trial database provided by the LSHTM CTU. Follow up data&#xD;
           will be collected directly from each patient at the end of each two-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will choose their most suitable method of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Bespoke mobile app which will require patients to use their own smartphone ii)&#xD;
           On-line database using a computer, phone or tablet iii) Paper forms which they will&#xD;
           receive by post at the same time with their trial treatment and which they can complete&#xD;
           iv) Contact by phone. Trial staff will telephone the patient on each data collection day&#xD;
           and complete the questionnaire based on the patient answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only data outlined on the baseline, follow up, end of trial and adverse events data&#xD;
           forms will be collected as part of this trial database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           END OF TRIAL DATA Patients will receive their individual results at the beginning of&#xD;
           month 14 and have a telephone or face-to-face appointment to discuss these results. At&#xD;
           month 15, trial staff will contact the patient to document their decision on statin use&#xD;
           and whether their results helped reach this decision. This will be the last data&#xD;
           collection point of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Self-reported 'muscle symptoms', defined as pain, weakness, tenderness, stiffness or&#xD;
           cramp to the body of any intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be assessed by the mean difference in VAS scores (range 0 to&#xD;
           100) between statin and placebo treatment periods, estimated via a linear mixed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant belief about the cause of their muscle symptoms, the site of muscle&#xD;
                symptoms, how the muscle symptoms affected the participant and information about&#xD;
                any other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adherence to medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant's decision about statin treatment following the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whether they found their own trial result helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual N-of-1 trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of these is to inform individual patients of the effect of the IMP on their&#xD;
      muscle symptom score. The analysis and presentation of individual level results will be&#xD;
      developed in collaboration with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups and will include&#xD;
      a range of graphical summaries and statistical analyses to identify the most informative&#xD;
      presentation of individual results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined analysis of N-of-1 trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the population level estimate of the trial treatment in VAS muscle symptom score,&#xD;
      data from each N-of-1 trial will be aggregated to form a powerful dataset, using an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who enter data on muscle symptoms at least once during a treatment period with the&#xD;
      IMP and at least once during a treatment period with placebo will be included in the primary&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be a linear mixed model for VAS muscle symptom score with random&#xD;
      effects for participant and treatment. Residual errors will be modelled using a first-order&#xD;
      auto-regressive error structure within each treatment period to account for correlation&#xD;
      between the 7 daily measurements, with robust standard errors to account for non-normality of&#xD;
      the VAS scores. Although VAS muscle symptom scores are unlikely to be exactly normally&#xD;
      distributed, analysing such data using normal-based methods is likely to be a sufficiently&#xD;
      robust approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be two-sided. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar manner to the primary outcome, omitting the&#xD;
      auto-regressive correlation structure since these secondary outcomes are measured once per&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise adherence to randomised treatment, and their&#xD;
      relationship to the IMP and placebo periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence to randomised treatment will underpin an efficacy analysis based around an&#xD;
      instrumental variables approach. Because these analyses require much stronger assumptions&#xD;
      than the intention-to-treat analysis above, the results of the efficacy analysis will be&#xD;
      presented and interpreted as a secondary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes include a single binary measure of whether the participant reports&#xD;
      having muscle symptoms during that treatment period. This will be combined with the follow-up&#xD;
      question pertaining to attribution, to obtain a single binary measure of whether the&#xD;
      participant reports having muscle symptoms that they attribute to the study medication. These&#xD;
      two binary outcome measures will be assessed using a logistic mixed model with random&#xD;
      participant and treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will relate the patients' decision regarding future statin use, and whether&#xD;
      or not the participant found their own result helpful in making their subsequent treatment&#xD;
      decisions, to their individual estimated effect of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no priori subgroup analyses planned.&#xD;
