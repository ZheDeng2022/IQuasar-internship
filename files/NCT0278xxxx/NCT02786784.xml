  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most diagnosed condition in individuals with knee&#xD;
      complaints. Studies revealed that one third of individuals with PFP suffer from persistent&#xD;
      complaints, indicating that current treatments fail to prevent the chronicity of symptoms.&#xD;
      Considering that current treatment-strategies of patients with PFP seem to be unable to avoid&#xD;
      the development of chronic symptoms, the question arises if the underlying factors of PFP are&#xD;
      understood sufficiently. Current research focuses predominantly on muscle strength assessment&#xD;
      by means of a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), even though, weakness might not only be&#xD;
      caused by a reduced voluntary contraction but also by an involuntary ability to contract the&#xD;
      muscle fully, which is named arthrogenous muscular inhibition (AMI). Although AMI has been&#xD;
      proven to be present in a wide range of knee joint pathologies to date it remains unclear&#xD;
      whether patients with PFP are weak or inhibited. It remains also unclear if there exists a&#xD;
      causal link between AMI and biomechanical alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies investigated the influence of exercise treatment on muscular strength,&#xD;
      function and pain. However, to date no study investigated the influence of the currently&#xD;
      recommended exercise treatment on AMI. Thus, the analysis of the effect of a 6 week exercise&#xD;
      treatment might yield further insights if a specific exercise treatment can reduce AMI,&#xD;
      improve functional performance and reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will invite 40 participants with PFP and 40 healthy controls to&#xD;
      take part in the study. As a basis investigation kinematic, kinetic measures, and surface&#xD;
      electromyographic (sEMG) of 4 lower limb muscles will be taken during functional tasks.&#xD;
      Muscle strength and AMI of the quadriceps, muscle flexibility, and a posture assessment of&#xD;
      the patella as well as the foot will be carried out. All participants with PFP will then&#xD;
      receive a 6 week exercise programme to follow. After six weeks, the participants with PFP&#xD;
      will attend the Salford university, where they will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The study will investigate if AMI is present in participants with PFP and&#xD;
      if AMI is directly linked to functional performance. In addition this study will investigate&#xD;
      if a specific exercise treatment can reduce AMI and improve functional performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedures The testing will be performed in the human performance laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of Salford, Manchester. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the participants will be&#xD;
      briefed through the study and the objectives of the investigations and the study equipment&#xD;
      will be explained to them. They will be asked to sign the informed consent form, a health&#xD;
      history questionnaire. The health history questionnaire consists of 13 questions&#xD;
      investigating potential risks associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual will then be asked to change into their shorts and a comfortable t-shirt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength and arthrogenic muscle inhibition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscular inhibition of the quadriceps will be assessed, during a maximal isometric&#xD;
      contraction (MVIC) of the quadriceps with the interpolated twitch technique. The participants&#xD;
      will perform 5 times a maximal contraction of their knee extensor and additional electrical&#xD;
      stimulation will be applied, which will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer (Kin-Com)&#xD;
      with a knee flexion angle of 90Â°. Then the participant will be asked to perform 5 times an&#xD;
      eccentric quadriceps contraction at the angular velocity of 60 degrees/ second, through the&#xD;
      full available range of motion (ROM) from 90 degrees knee flexion to maximum knee extension,&#xD;
      while the quadriceps torque will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants with PFP will then be asked to fill in 3 different questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the KOOS, the AKPS/ Kujala score, and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this recovery break, the posture and flexibility investigation will be executed. The&#xD;
      examination of the foot posture will be performed by using the 6-item foot posture index&#xD;
      (FPI-6). The patella alignment includes a lateral - medial displacement/ lateral -medial&#xD;
      tilt), and a lateral-medial displacement assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flexibility of the hamstrings and the soleus muscle will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, the researcher will attach 40 retro-reflective markers to the skin of the&#xD;
      lower limb on both legs and attach surface electromyographic electrodes to four muscles as in&#xD;
      figure 4 on both legs. The electrode placement will be performed according to the SENIAM&#xD;
      guidelines. Suface EMG (sEMG) data will be collected of vastus medialis, vastus lateralis,&#xD;
      biceps femoris and semitendinosus will be synchronised with the motion capture system on&#xD;
      Qualisys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a static 3-dimensional image from ten infra-red cameras will be obtained. The 3D&#xD;
      kinematics of the ankle, knee, and hip joint and ground reaction forces (GRF) will be&#xD;
      recorded for each participant during a running, a single leg squat and a step down task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 week treatment will be exclusively conducted by physiotherapists at the Salford Royal&#xD;
      Hospital (Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, SRFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapist from the Salford Royal hospital will introduce the treatment programme to the&#xD;
      participants. Additionally, each participants will receive a booklet with a detailed&#xD;
      description of the treatment programme, as well as access to a password protected website&#xD;
      (VIMEO) to watch the videos of all exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the treatment outcomes after 6 weeks At the end of the 6 weeks exercise&#xD;
      intervention, the participants with PFP will then attend the human performance laboratory at&#xD;
      the University of Salford. The muscle strength, AMI, flexibility, posture assessment, as well&#xD;
      as the clinical assessment of running and a step down task of each individual will be&#xD;
      measured to investigate the change in AMI and functional performance due to the treatment.&#xD;
