  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project deals with exercise in acute heart failure in three different groups&#xD;
      (conventional medical treatment; exercise with non-invasive ventilation and exercise with&#xD;
      placebo of non-invasive ventilation).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All of the subjects performed an individualized clinical evaluation right after hospital&#xD;
      admission on day 1 (D1) by the cardiologist and physiotherapis involved in the study.&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests (spirometry), blood sample (brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]&#xD;
      and high sensitive C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]), six-minute walk test (6MWT), and maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) test were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical tests were performed, the patients were randomized into three groups, and&#xD;
      all received standard medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (CTL) received medical treatment and did not perform aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training; the ET+NIV group performed aerobic exercise training associated with NIV once a&#xD;
      day, for 8 consecutive days; and the ET+Sham group performed aerobic exercise with placebo&#xD;
      NIV once a day, for 8 consecutive days. The ET+NIV and ET+Sham groups also received medical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eight consecutive days, all of the patients underwent a new clinical evaluation (D10).&#xD;
      After D10, all of the patients continued to receive only conventional treatment, and they&#xD;
      were followed up for main outcomes (hospital discharge, worsening HF, or death). Worsening HF&#xD;
      was considered when a patient needed to be transferred to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
