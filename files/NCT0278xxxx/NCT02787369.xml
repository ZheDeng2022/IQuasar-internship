  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called ACY-1215 in combination with ibrutinib or&#xD;
      idelalisib as a possible treatment for Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia&#xD;
      (CLL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. The investigators are studying the&#xD;
      combination of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors with ricolinostat, in order to&#xD;
      try to enhance both the initial remission and to help improve the response in those who&#xD;
      relapse after a first inhibitor and are receiving a second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ACY-1215 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease. ACY-1215 or ricolinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, specifically HDAC6.&#xD;
      The FDA has approved idelalisib as well as ibrutinib as treatment options for Relapsed or&#xD;
      Refractory Chronic Lymphocyic Leukemia (CLL).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the ibrutinib arm only: participants must not currently require ongoing&#xD;
             anticoagulation for any reason, or have had any major bleeding events within 6 months&#xD;
             of enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 2X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless&#xD;
                  predominantly indirect and therefore likely due to hemolysis or Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3X institutional upper limit of normal for ibrutinib arm;&#xD;
                  within normal limits on the idelalisib arm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt; 2X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, including at least one of the following: an&#xD;

             100K) together with bone marrow infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the drugs studied in this research protocol on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with an HDAC inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of poor tolerance to either ibrutinib or idelalisib should&#xD;
             not be enrolled on the arm containing that drug, but may be enrolled to the other arm.&#xD;
             Must agree not to share study medication with another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring any medications or substances that are strong inducers or&#xD;
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Those who may discontinue these medications are&#xD;
             eligible after a 7 day washout period. . Mild or moderate inducers or inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 are permitted but moderate inhibitors will require dose reduction of ibrutinib&#xD;
             (see section 5.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ACY-1215, as well as both&#xD;
             ibrutinib and idelalisib, have unknown effects on a developing fetus or newborn.&#xD;
             Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this research&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on CYP3A4 modulating antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ACY-1215, ibrutinib or&#xD;
             idelalisib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require active chemotherapy for another cancer. Those requiring&#xD;
             hormonal therapy or radiation therapy may be considered for enrollment on a case by&#xD;
             case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value &gt; 480 msec at screening;&#xD;
             family or personal history of long QTc syndrome or ventricular arrhythmias including&#xD;
             ventricular bigeminy at screening; previous history of drug-induced QTc prolongation&#xD;
             or the need for treatment with medications known or suspected of producing prolonged&#xD;
             QTc intervals on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, or core antibody; and known or&#xD;
             suspected active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, for the idelalisib arm. On the&#xD;
             ibrutinib arm, patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen may be appropriately&#xD;
             treated and enrolled on this study as long as their HBV DNA / viral load is&#xD;
             undetectable. Patients positive for hepB core antibody and negative for surface&#xD;
             antigen are eligible for the ibrutinib arm, as are patients with hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring anticoagulation with warfarin or vitamin K antagonists are excluded&#xD;
             from the ibrutinib arm. If previously on these drugs and switched, INR must be normal&#xD;
             for 7 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects enrolling on the ibrutinib arm must not have had major surgery within 14&#xD;
             days, or minor surgery within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be able to swallow pills.&#xD;
