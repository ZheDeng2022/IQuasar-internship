  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke occurs in approximately 13.000 persons every year in Denmark, 10 - 15 % now&#xD;
      receives intervenous thrombolytic therapy, which remains the most important acute treatment&#xD;
      in ischaemic stroke. For more than a decade there has been an ongoing discussion if&#xD;
      Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were best before&#xD;
      thrombolysis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging is superior in visualising ischaemia, but&#xD;
      Computerized Tomography is quicker and more easily applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators centre primary imaging in work up of acute stroke during working hours&#xD;
      will alternate between Computerized Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging days based on a&#xD;
      fixed calendar for a 24 months period as a quality development project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to include patients who have acute stroke imagining during this period,&#xD;
      a total of 600 patients is expected. The investigators will compare door-to-needle time,&#xD;
      patient safety, quality of imaging, patients' experience, physicians' decision certainty, and&#xD;
      use of recourses.&#xD;

      Background: Stroke remains the third leading cause of death and the first leading cause of&#xD;
      handicap in adult age in high-income countries even now when causal revascularisation therapy&#xD;
      (intervenous (i.v) thrombolysis and endovascular therapy (EVT) has become generally&#xD;
      available. I.v. thrombolysis has been implemented as routine treatment within 4.5 hours of&#xD;
      symptom onset based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. Treatment benefit is&#xD;
      highly dependent on time from symptom onset to treatment and is therefore strongly related to&#xD;
      organisational issues including selection of imaging modality. I.v thrombolysis registration&#xD;
      was based on trials using non-contrast Computerized Tomography (CT). In, general however,&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered to imply a higher standard of care. MRI is&#xD;
      considered to give more detailed information and improve patient safety. The issue if CT or&#xD;
      MRI is 'best' in i.v. thrombolysis work-up has been discussed by stroke scientists for more&#xD;
      than a decade, both nationally and internationally. MRI is superior in detecting acute&#xD;
      ischaemia and CT is quicker; but the effect of choice of imaging modality on overall efficacy&#xD;
      and safety remains to be determined in spite of completion of more than 74.000 i.v.&#xD;
      thrombolysis treatments in Europe according to the SITS-MOST registry. Access to primary work&#xD;
      up by MRI is frequently regarded as a token of high treatment quality; nevertheless, few&#xD;
      centres worldwide are really primarily MRI based. CT is much faster and has no&#xD;
      contraindications. This may be crucial as the efficacy of thrombolysis decreases with time to&#xD;
      treatment - numbers needed to treat increases with 1 for every 20 minutes, making the&#xD;
      question if MRI is only of academic interest a relevant question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if choice of primary imaging modality (CT vs MRI)&#xD;
      affects efficacy and safety of i.v. thrombolysis in open quasi-randomised design, where&#xD;
      imaging allocation was allocated based on the date of admission. The following items will be&#xD;
      compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiological exclusion of other causes of symptoms than acute cerebral ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contraindications to scanning method in terms of contrast and magnetism&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Delay from admission to thrombolytic treatment in minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Radiological imaging of diagnostic quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identification of stroke mechanism according to TOAST classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Visual Analogue Scale of patient experience of the admission radiological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Visual Analogue Scale of the treating physician's experience of decision support prior&#xD;
           to prescription of thrombolytic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Deviation from radiological Standard Operational Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Time consumption for radiologists and radiographers in minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients admitted with acute stroke during office hours and possibly also during&#xD;
      daytime in weekends in Bispebjerg University Hospital will be included into the study during&#xD;
      a 24 months study period. Based on activity in 2011, the investigators expect a study&#xD;
      population of 600 patients. Door to needle time is the parameter/endpoint strongest&#xD;
      associated with prognosis and therefore the most relevant from the patient's point of view.&#xD;
      This estimate is well within the planned sample size. However, the sample size is extended in&#xD;
      order to allow for analysis of less well-defined endpoints including patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study procedures: Patients are evaluated according to usual standard neurological&#xD;
           outcome (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)) performed on admission and&#xD;
           on Day 1. Risk factors and co-morbidities are recorded and the stroke mechanism&#xD;
           evaluated. The patients or carers are contacted by telephone after approximately 3&#xD;
           months. Recurrence of stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
           (MI) and cardiac revascularization procedures are registered. If the patient is&#xD;
           diseased, time of death and cause of death will be extracted from patient files. The&#xD;
           functional outcome is assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (including death).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient experience of scan: The patient is asked day 1 about their experience of the&#xD;
           scanning procedure by use of visual analogue scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physicians' certainty of having made the right decision concerning thrombolysis: The&#xD;
           doctor notes by using a visual analogue scale (0-10) the strength of the clinical&#xD;
           decision to give or not give tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) immediately after the&#xD;
           bolus, or after the patient is informed that is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resource use: Time from arrival until treatment initiation are recorded. Potential&#xD;
           deviation of resource consumption when derogating from the SOP will be accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Analysis: Imaging is evaluated during the acute phase. Further, the diagnostic&#xD;
           imaging will be systematically and retrospectively evaluated by two senior&#xD;
           neuroradiological consultants that are blinded to clinical information except the side&#xD;
           of symptoms. X2-test, t-test/Mann-Whitney-test will be used depending on the&#xD;
           distribution of the material, as well as uni and multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
           analysis. It will be tested if the age, gender and severity affect the results. Data&#xD;
           relating to risk factors and co-morbidity will be used to characterize the patient&#xD;
           population. Function after 3 months expressed as mRS will be assessed, but the study was&#xD;
           not designed to be able to detect an eventual difference in level of functioning after 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: All patients are worked up according to best clinical practice and in&#xD;
      accordance with Danish, European and American guidelines. As study procedures are added an&#xD;
      interview on patient experience with the radiological procedure and a follow-up MRI, which is&#xD;
      not done in case of contraindications to MRI or at patient's request. Further data on risk&#xD;
      factors, the stroke event and follow up is recorded. There is no known risk related to MRI in&#xD;
      persons with no magnetic metal in the body (e.g. a pacemaker); this is excluded by the same&#xD;
      procedures as in clinical practice. The confined space and the noise of the MRI-scanner may&#xD;
      cause anxiety in some; this will be prevented and handled by experienced radiographers as in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Overall, there is no expected risks to participation in the study and some&#xD;
      chance of treatment benefit by additional follow-up MRI. The study may have considerable&#xD;
      impact on future treatment in patients with acute stroke as it may provide clarification to&#xD;
      which of the methods should be future primary strategy. Patient experience as well as&#xD;
      physicians experience is included in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy: The study is fully financed by a grant from Tryg Fonden. The applicant and research&#xD;
      responsible has no other relations to the foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance and relevance of the study: If the choice of imaging method significantly affects&#xD;
      predictors of good outcome after thrombolytic therapy initial use of the superior method&#xD;
      would lead to a benefit, which for the individual patient will correspond to less disability&#xD;
      after a stroke. Study results can be implemented directly in clinical practice; thought it&#xD;
      will be subject to an eventual need for revised allocation of resources even though the total&#xD;
      number of scans will not be affected. Based on the study's registration of resource&#xD;
      consumption, the health economic effects of the study can be estimated. Since stroke is a&#xD;
      very common and serious disorder, relatively minor improvements in the prognosis may have&#xD;
      noticeable effect on group or community level. Further, this study may close a long-standing&#xD;
      and sometimes emotional scientific discussion, setting as an example that trials remain the&#xD;
      only valid method of answering scientific questions. This set up with a research protocol&#xD;
      complementing a quality project enables us to evaluate this issue.&#xD;
