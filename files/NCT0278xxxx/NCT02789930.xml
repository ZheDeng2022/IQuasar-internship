  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective single center study is to investigate if a developed program&#xD;
      is more accurate than the anesthesia tape (&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;). For this study 1000 patients&#xD;
      are required to collect anonymized data (length, weight, age, anesthesia material used during&#xD;
      anesthesia) for achieving a power of 80% during statistical analysis. The main hypothesis ist&#xD;
      that the program has a better accuracy than the anesthesia tape (&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;).&#xD;

      This prospective single center study is performed at the university children's Hospital&#xD;
      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16&#xD;
      years and with a body length suitable for the emergency tapes can be included in this study.&#xD;
      Patient and parental information is performed during the pre-anesthetic visit. After written&#xD;
      consent the patient will be included. Patient ́s length and weight will be measures earliest&#xD;
      one day before data collection. Data collection during anesthesia has no influence on the&#xD;
      daily anesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and anaesthesia. Patient's data&#xD;
      is made anonymous for further inspection. Data is documented in Microsoft Excel and&#xD;
      statistical analysis calculated with SPSS. 1000 patients are needed for a power of 80%.&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter is length based weight estimation, secondary outcome parameters are&#xD;
      length based age estimation and the correctness of recommended anesthesia material&#xD;
      (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask, oropharyngeal mask and face mask). Both tools (program&#xD;
      and anesthesia tape [&quot;Anästhesie-Lineal&quot;]) will be compared with each other regarding primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome parameters.&#xD;
