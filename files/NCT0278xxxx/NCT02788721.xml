      The study is a First-in-Human, Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      evaluating single and multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG2451 and combined multiple doses&#xD;
      of GLPG2451 and GLPG2222 in healthy female subjects. The purpose of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and tolerability after single ascending oral doses and of multiple doses of GLPG2451&#xD;
      given to healthy female subjects compared to placebo as well as of multiple doses of the&#xD;
      combination of GLPG2451/GLPG2222 compared to GLPG2451/placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female between 18-65 years of age inclusive, on the day of signing informed consent&#xD;
             form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of non-childbearing potential defined as surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy), or post-menopausal (at least 12 consecutive&#xD;
             months without menstruation, without an alternative medical cause [including hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy]). In addition a determination of follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) can be performed with FSH &gt;35 mIU/ml to further confirm postmenopausal status&#xD;
             without menstruation for ≥12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter&#xD;
             monitoring and a laboratory profile prior to the initial study drug administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g., human immunodeficiency&#xD;
             virus [HIV] infection).&#xD;

             ≤ 80 mL/min using the Cockroft formula; if calculated result ≤ 80 mL/min, a 24-hour&#xD;
             urine collection to determine actual value can be done) or other conditions known to&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.&#xD;

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;

             recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on ECG and/or Holter regarding either&#xD;
             rhythm or conduction (e.g. QTcF ≥ 470 msec, or a known long QT syndrome). A first&#xD;
             degree heart block will not be considered as a significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history (if known) of long QT syndrome in a primary relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
