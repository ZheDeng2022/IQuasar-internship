      This open-label, prospective, controlled intervention study involves evaluating tolerance and&#xD;
      acceptability of an Oral Nutrition Supplement (ONS; EnergieShake®) in 16 adult patients who&#xD;
      are already taking an ONS. Following a 2-day baseline data collection on their current ONS,&#xD;
      patients switch to the test ONS, which is taken for a further 8 consecutive days. Patients&#xD;
      revert to their current ONS at the end of the study. Patients act as their own controls and&#xD;
      thus all patients are allocated the same intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily records of GI tolerance and compliance with the prescribed amount of ONS will be kept&#xD;
      for participants throughout the study period. Participants' height and weight will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (weight at end will also be collected), all medications will be&#xD;
      documented, and relevant medical and dietary histories will be recorded. A questionnaire at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period will be administered collecting participants' views on the&#xD;
      acceptability (taste and palatability) of the test ONS. Taste and palatability will be&#xD;
      assessed via a questionnaire that uses a Hedonic scale to quantify preference.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label study involves evaluating tolerance and acceptability of the test ONS in 16&#xD;
      adult participants who are already taking an ONS. Following a 2-day baseline data collection&#xD;
      on their current ONS, patients switch to the test ONS, which is taken for a further 8&#xD;
      consecutive days. Patients revert to their current ONS at the end of the study. Patients act&#xD;
      as their own controls and thus all patients are allocated the same intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient tolerance and acceptability is fundamental to the successful use of an ONS.&#xD;
      Acceptability and tolerance studies for ONS are required by the Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Borderline Substances (ACBS) as part of a submission for a new product to be made available&#xD;
      at NHS expense in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no anticipated risks to participants. Participants will already be taking other ONS&#xD;
      as this is one of the inclusion criteria. Minimal inconvenience to participants is&#xD;
      anticipated as they will be asked to complete a questionnaire on the product's acceptability.&#xD;
      Daily records on the GI tolerance of the product will be recorded by participants or nursing&#xD;
      staff. Most of the study documentation will be completed by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may gain weight or maintain their weight during the intervention. In the future,&#xD;
      if this product becomes available on prescription, a wider variety of ONS available to&#xD;
      patients may lessen taste fatigue associated with taking the same supplements over an&#xD;
      extended period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance (bowel&#xD;
      frequency and consistency using the Bristol Stool Chart, nausea, vomiting, abdominal&#xD;
      discomfort, wind, burping, flatulence) to a Test Oral Nutrition Supplement (EnergieShake®, a&#xD;
      powdered nutritional supplement, classified as a Food for Special Medical Purposes for the&#xD;
      dietary management of disease-related malnutrition) in patients requiring ONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess acceptability of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, prospective, controlled intervention in which participants act&#xD;
      as their own controls. Guidance from ACBS requires that acceptability and tolerance studies&#xD;
      must normally be carried out on at least 15 patients in the intended target group for a&#xD;
      period of 1 week. The design of this study has been based on the guidance provided by ACBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies for Recruitment and Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially suitable participants will be identified by staff at the site. Participants who&#xD;
      may be suitable are those who are currently taking ONS and whose requirement for ONS is&#xD;
      expected to continue for at least a further 2 weeks. They will be approached by staff at the&#xD;
      site and provided with a Participant Information Sheet and letter of invitation from the&#xD;
      sponsor (Anaiah Healthcare Ltd). To ensure this process is free from undue influence,&#xD;
      residents will not be coerced or offered inducements to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the choice of whether or not to withdraw from the study at any stage&#xD;
      for any reason. Should the participant experience any adverse event or discomfort due to&#xD;
      consuming the product, the participant will be advised to stop using the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Subject Withdrawals or Subject Discontinuation of Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant discontinues the study before the intervention is complete, their&#xD;
      permission will be sought to use the data collected on the use of the product. A replacement&#xD;
      of a participant who withdraws will be recruited to meet the requirement target that at least&#xD;
      15 patients provide data on the test ONS.&#xD;
