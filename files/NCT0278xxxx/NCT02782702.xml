  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hailey Hailey and Darier disease are rare genetic dermatoses. Mutations of 2 genes (ATP2C1 or&#xD;
      ATP2A2 respectively) are responsible for the diseases. These genes have a key role in calcium&#xD;
      pump; their defect create abnormal link between keratinocytes' desmosomes and induce skin&#xD;
      lesions. Clinically, patients present with inflammatory lesions located in the folds. Quality&#xD;
      of life is impaired because of pain, pruritus and tendency to infections. Lesions are&#xD;
      permanent but acute exacerbations occur in hot seasons because of increased sweating. Usual&#xD;
      therapies are often not effective (local treatment, laser, phototherapy). Because sweating is&#xD;
      a well established inducing or aggravating factor, botulism toxin could be an effective&#xD;
      treatment for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulism toxin is already used in clinical practice and acts via a decreased sweet secretion.&#xD;
      Improvement of skin lesions in Hailey-Hailey or Darier diseases has been previously reported&#xD;
      in a few cases but there is no study properly evaluating the benefit of such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to study the improvement of quality of life for patients suffering&#xD;
      from Hailey-Hailey or Darier diseases after a injections of botulism toxin in large skin&#xD;
      folds. The principal objective is to estimate the distribution of the variation of quality of&#xD;
      life at M1 vs. baseline.&#xD;
