  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy is one of the most common food allergies and potentially a&#xD;
      fatal one. Early feeding with CMP has been considered in the past as a risk factor for&#xD;
      development of CMP allergy in high risk infants. Although other studies argue with this&#xD;
      assumption and suggest early exposure to CMP might be protective against atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      and CMP allergy. A cohort study that first introduction of CMP after 15-30 days of age,&#xD;
      raised the risk for CMP allergy.The aim of this study is to investigate if early and&#xD;
      continuous exposure to CMF will decrease CMP allergy rate.&#xD;

      Background: Cow's milk protein (CMP) allergy is one of the most common food allergies and&#xD;
      potentially a fatal one. The incidence of milk allergy is 1.5-3% in the first year of life,&#xD;
      but only 60% of the reactions are IgE mediated. CMP allergy tends to resolve in approximately&#xD;
      45-50% of the infants at 1 year of age, in 60-75% at the age of 2, and 85-90% at 3 years. The&#xD;
      range for IgE mediated CMP allergy is 29-76%. A recent study suggested that the natural&#xD;
      history of CMP allergy might have changed over time, with slower rates of resolution and a&#xD;
      higher proportion of children with disease persisting into adolescence and adulthood. In the&#xD;
      past it has been described that there is more incidence of CMP allergy in children from&#xD;
      families with positive history of allergy. Early feeding with CMP has been considered in the&#xD;
      past as a risk factor for development of CMP allergy in high risk infants. Although other&#xD;
      studies argue with this assumption and suggest early exposure to CMP might be protective&#xD;
      against atopic dermatitis and CMP allergy. A cohort study that first introduction of CMP&#xD;
      after 15-30 days of age, raised the risk for CMP allergy. A recent study on peanut allergy&#xD;
      found that continuous early exposure to peanut dramatically decreased the incidence of peanut&#xD;
      allergy. The research in the field of food allergy and especially in CMP allergy is very&#xD;
      alert those days. But as far as the investigators knowledge, there are no prospective studies&#xD;
      from the first days of life that examined the influence of early and continuous exposure to&#xD;
      cow's milk formula (CMF) on CMP allergy. The existing data related to CMP allergy is&#xD;
      controversial and inconclusive. Thus, no one can rely on it to establish clear&#xD;
      recommendations for parents when is the best time to combine CMF in the infants diet. Working&#xD;
      hypothesis and aims: The aim of the study is to investigate if early and continuous exposure&#xD;
      to CMF will decrease CMP allergy rate. The investigators assumption is that the rate of CMP&#xD;
      allergy in the intervention groups and in infants who are only feed by CMF, will be lower&#xD;
      than in the group of infants who are exclusively breast feed. Methods: Recruitment of 2,500&#xD;
      infants from first day of life and divide the participants into 4 groups: 1. Exclusive breast&#xD;
      feeding. 2. Exclusive CMF feeding. 3. Breast feeding with 20 cc of CMF per day. 4. Breast&#xD;
      feeding with one meal per day of CMF. The mother will complete a survey questionnaire before&#xD;
      the labor. Infants will be followed for 1 year. During this follow-up period -the&#xD;
      participants will be examined by an allergologist at the age of 2 month and 1 year. In&#xD;
      between, the infants will be followed by a phone questionnaire once in a month. Specific CM&#xD;
      IgE analysis from umbilical cord blood and skin test at 2 month of age will be performed.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - Term and near term newborns (gestational age of at least 36 weeks),&#xD;
      normal birth weight, normal perinatal follow-up and without congenital defects. Expected&#xD;
      results: The rate of CMP allergy in the intervention groups and in the group on exclusively&#xD;
      CMF feeding will be lower than in the group on exclusive breast feeding. Importance: If the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to prove the study hypothesis (and even if not), it will have a&#xD;
      significant influence on the diet recommendations for infants. Probable implications to&#xD;
      Medicine: If the investigators will get the expected results, the recommendations that exist&#xD;
      today for infant's feeding can be changed.&#xD;
