  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Single center, randomized, open labeled study. The study is conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics Studies of Azilsartan with single-dose oral administration,&#xD;
      multiple-dose oral administration and effects of diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Pharmacokinetics Studies of Azilsartan with Single-dose oral administration: 24 healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly divided into 2 groups evenly, Group I and Group II, with 12&#xD;
      subjects in each group, half are male and half are female. Group I will take Azilsartan&#xD;
      tablet 20mg orally on fasting, while Group II will take Azilsartan tablet 40mg orally on&#xD;
      fasting. Blood sampling time: 0h (before administration starting), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48h after administration. 5ml whole blood from cubital&#xD;
      vein will be placed in a heparinized tube and centrifuged. Duplicated plasma A and B will be&#xD;
      taken and kept in low temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2）Pharmacokinetic Studies of Azilsartan Tablets with Multiple-dose oral administration&#xD;
      Subjects in Group I will take 20mg Azilsartan orally once daily for 7 day (day 3~day 9) after&#xD;
      completing the last time blood sample collection (in day 2, 48h) of the first time&#xD;
      administration (day 1). 5mL blood sample will be collected from vein on day 7, day 8 and day&#xD;
      9 for measuring minimum observed concentration before drug administration. On day 9, after&#xD;
      administration, blood sampling time is the same as single-dose administration study. Blood&#xD;
      sampling time: 0h (before administration starting), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,&#xD;
      10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48h after administration. 5ml whole blood from cubital vein will be&#xD;
      placed in a heparinized tube and centrifuged. Duplicated plasma A and B will be taken and&#xD;
      kept in low temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3）The effects of diet for pharmacokinetic study: The 12 healthy subjects, in group II (in&#xD;
      single-dose administration study), after 7-day washout period after the first administration&#xD;
      (at day 1, 40mg) will receive Azilsartan tablet 40mg after high-fat diet at day 8, and the&#xD;
      blood sampling time point after administration is the same as in single-dose administration&#xD;
      study. The process, storage condition of the blood samples are the same as single-dose&#xD;
      administration study. Blood sampling time: 0h (before administration starting), 0.25, 0.5, 1,&#xD;
      1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48h after administration. 5ml whole blood&#xD;
      from cubital vein will be placed in a heparinized tube and centrifuged. Duplicated plasma A&#xD;
      and B will be taken and kept in low temperature.&#xD;
