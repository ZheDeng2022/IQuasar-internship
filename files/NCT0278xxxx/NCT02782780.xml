  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is a common complaint of Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Because&#xD;
      there is clinical evidence that sleep quality influences pain, fatigue, mood, cognition, and&#xD;
      daily functioning, this study will investigate whether a type of behavioral sleep treatment&#xD;
      called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) can help Gulf War Veterans with GWI.&#xD;
      CBTi is a multicomponent treatment where patients learn about sleep and factors affecting&#xD;
      sleep as well as how to alter habits that may impair or even prevent sleep. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that helping Gulf War Veterans learn how to achieve better sleep with CBTi may&#xD;
      also help to alleviate their other non-sleep symptoms of GWI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common among Veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Moreover, untreated insomnia&#xD;
      is associated with significant medical and psychiatric morbidity. Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is a multicomponent treatment that seeks not only to teach&#xD;
      patients about sleep and factors affecting sleep (e.g., circadian rhythm, age, social and&#xD;
      work schedule) but the therapist will also to work with the patient toward minimizing&#xD;
      unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and&#xD;
      regularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because many Veterans with GWI suffer from a profound loss of physical and functional status&#xD;
      that may prevent them from participating in treatments that require regular clinic visits,&#xD;
      the proposed study will deliver CBTi by telephone to extend this effective form of behavioral&#xD;
      sleep medicine to Veterans who have chronic illnesses and disabilities and/or who live in&#xD;
      rural areas with limited access to trained CBTi providers. Recent studies suggest that&#xD;
      telephone-delivered CBTi is as effective as CBTi delivered in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial will examine the efficacy of telephone-delivered CBTi for alleviating&#xD;
      sleep and non-sleep GWI symptoms in a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Veterans who have&#xD;
      GWI and persistent insomnia disorder will be randomized to a group that will receive CBTi&#xD;
      right away or to a group that will receive treatment-as-usual (i.e., the control group).&#xD;
      Veterans randomized to the control group will have the option of receiving&#xD;
      telephone-delivered CBTi upon completion of post-treatment assessments. The primary outcomes&#xD;
      will be effect sizes base on within-group comparisons of pre-to-post-treatment change and&#xD;
      maintenance of treatment effects at 6 months in the CBTi group.&#xD;

    <measure>Gulf War Illness Symptom Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Due to its novelty, complexity, and variability, no single measure of severity addresses all possible presentations of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Therefore, we used the symptom portion of the Kansas Gulf War Military History and Health Questionnaire to query about fatigue/sleep problems, somatic pain, skin abnormalities, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurologic/cognitive/mood symptoms, based on the Kansas GWI and CDC CMI case definition. To assess current GWI symptoms, participants will be asked about the absence (0), presence, and severity (1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) of the symptoms over the past 2 weeks instead of over the past 6-months. Score range: 0-87; higher scores = more symptoms and/or more severe symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. This outcome will be measured at 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS is a 9-item questionnaire reflecting the consequences of fatigue. It gives a single score (range 0-7, high scores represent high levels of fatigue). A score of 4 has been described as the cutoff for clinical fatigue. This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a 17-item self-rating scale assessing demographic data, use of medications, as well as sensory, and reactive components of pain. The BPI measures two domains: pain intensity (severity) and the impact of pain on functioning (interference). The score range for BPI-Severity is 0-10, higher score = more severe/intense pain. The range for BPI-interference is 0-10, higher score = greater impact of pain on function.&#xD;
This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-report measure that provides a subjective assessment of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sedative-hypnotics, and daytime energy. This index is widely used and has been validated by polysomnography. The score range for the PSQI is 0 to 21, with the higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Efficiency (SE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Efficiency, as determined by self-reported sleep diary, is the total sleep time (TST) divided by the time in bed, multiplied by 100. Good sleepers have high sleep efficiency because they are asleep the majority of time they spend in bed. Insomniacs tend to have low sleep efficiency because they spend a lot of time awake while they are in bed (tossing and turning).&#xD;
This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minutes of Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects; in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Wake After Sleep Onset is the amount of time that a person is awake time during the night, as recorded in a self-report sleep diary. Insomniacs tend to have greater WASO than good sleepers because they wake up a lot in the middle of the might.&#xD;
This outcome will be measured at baseline, post-treatment in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Latency (SL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 8 weeks of study participation in all subjects, in subjects randomized to CBTi, 6 months after study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep latency (SL) is the amount of time that it takes someone to fall asleep. Participants will be asked to estimate this time in their sleep diaries. Good sleepers tend to have low sleep latencies because they can fall asleep quickly. Insomniacs tend to have longer sleep latencies because it takes them a long time to fall asleep.&#xD;
This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

Of the 165 participants enrolled/consented, 27 did not undergo/complete the clinical assessment interview, 42 were ineligible after the clinical assessment interview, and 11 did not complete baseline assessment. Therefore, only 85 participants were randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the first phase of screening, veterans participated in a brief telephone interview to inquire about inclusion/exclusion criteria and to determine probable GWI/CMI and insomnia diagnoses. Only participants who passed the initial telephone eligibility screening were invited to undergo a second round of clinical screening to assess for mental health disorders and other exclusionary conditions (e.g., untreated sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Gulf War Illness Symptom Severity Index</title>
        <description>Due to its novelty, complexity, and variability, no single measure of severity addresses all possible presentations of Gulf War Illness (GWI). Therefore, we used the symptom portion of the Kansas Gulf War Military History and Health Questionnaire to query about fatigue/sleep problems, somatic pain, skin abnormalities, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurologic/cognitive/mood symptoms, based on the Kansas GWI and CDC CMI case definition. To assess current GWI symptoms, participants will be asked about the absence (0), presence, and severity (1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) of the symptoms over the past 2 weeks instead of over the past 6-months. Score range: 0-87; higher scores = more symptoms and/or more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</title>
        <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. This outcome will be measured at 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi): CBTi is a multicomponent treatment that seeks to teach patients about sleep and the factors that affect sleep (e.g., homeostatic regulation, circadian rhythm, age, social and work schedule) and to work with the patients toward minimizing unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and regularity. The intervention is 8-weeks long.</description>

          <title>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</title>
          <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the last month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate more severe insomnia. This outcome will be measured at 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - Pain Severity</title>
        <description>The BPI is a 17-item self-rating scale assessing demographic data, use of medications, as well as sensory, and reactive components of pain. The BPI measures two domains: pain intensity (severity) and the impact of pain on functioning (interference). The score range for BPI-Severity is 0-10, higher score = more severe/intense pain. The range for BPI-interference is 0-10, higher score = greater impact of pain on function. This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi): CBTi is a multicomponent treatment that seeks to teach patients about sleep and the factors that affect sleep (e.g., homeostatic regulation, circadian rhythm, age, social and work schedule) and to work with the patients toward minimizing unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and regularity. The intervention is 8-weeks long.</description>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi): CBTi is a multicomponent treatment that seeks to teach patients about sleep and the factors that affect sleep (e.g., homeostatic regulation, circadian rhythm, age, social and work schedule) and to work with the patients toward minimizing unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and regularity. The intervention is 8-weeks long.</description>

          <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title>
          <description>The PSQI is a self-report measure that provides a subjective assessment of sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sedative-hypnotics, and daytime energy. This index is widely used and has been validated by polysomnography. The score range for the PSQI is 0 to 21, with the higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

        <description>Sleep latency (SL) is the amount of time that it takes someone to fall asleep. Participants will be asked to estimate this time in their sleep diaries. Good sleepers tend to have low sleep latencies because they can fall asleep quickly. Insomniacs tend to have longer sleep latencies because it takes them a long time to fall asleep.&#xD;
This outcome will be measured at baseline, after 8 weeks in both the CBTi and monitor-only groups and at 6 months in subjects randomized to CBTi.</description>

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi): CBTi is a multicomponent treatment that seeks to teach patients about sleep and the factors that affect sleep (e.g., homeostatic regulation, circadian rhythm, age, social and work schedule) and to work with the patients toward minimizing unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and regularity. The intervention is 8-weeks long.</description>
