  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) could prevent depression of the immune system of&#xD;
      patients harboring with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), providing increased life&#xD;
      expectancy, changing the classification of HIV / AIDS into a chronic illness. However&#xD;
      prolonged use of ARTincreases the prevalence of lipodystrophy syndrome (SL), characterized by&#xD;
      inadequate distribution of body fat and changes in lipid profile, associated with a&#xD;
      significantly increased cardiovascular risk, among others. The practice of strength training&#xD;
      (ST) helps in controlling SL, providing improved lipid profile and the quality of life of&#xD;
      these patients. However, due to increased cardiovascular risk and physical weakness resulting&#xD;
      from SL, the ST with vascular occlusion (STOV) could be a viable alternative training, to use&#xD;
      low load (10-30% of maximal work capacity) with similar benefits ST traditional (STT), as&#xD;
      already proven in other populations. The STOV is justified by the lower neuromuscular&#xD;
      overhead, increasing the number of patients able to participate in this complementary&#xD;
      therapy. The objective was to assess the impact of the combined strength training with&#xD;
      vascular occlusion on SL and the skeletal muscle tissue in people harboring with HIV/Aids.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY Type of Study It is a study of the experimental type with equivalent control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample A convenience sample will consist of approximately 60 patients seropositive for HIV /&#xD;
      AIDS, in use of ART. Patients will be invited between routine visits in the clinic at the&#xD;
      Special Unit for Treatment of Infectious Diseases (UETDI) of the Hospital of the Ribeirão&#xD;
      Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo (USP HCFMRP-). They will be invited to&#xD;
      participate voluntarily, provided that (initially) are considered eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the study, later confirmed by medical clearance to practice physical exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of conducting the survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Orientation and Education Center of Adult and Elderly&#xD;
      (House 5) of the Ribeirão Preto School of Nursing, University of São Paulo (EERP / USP) and&#xD;
      UETDI HCFMRP-USP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipodystrophy Syndrome (SL) The diagnosis for SL will be determined by clinical examination&#xD;
      upon patients' reports of fat loss in the limbs, buttocks and face, with or without fat&#xD;
      accumulation in the trunk, waist, breasts - gynecomastia (men) and cervical back, clinically&#xD;
      confirmed by a trained professional as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study began a medical history will be performed to determine factors that are&#xD;
      relevant to the study and pre- and post-training, the procedures to be performed involve a&#xD;
      number of steps involving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination Ankle Brachial Index (ABI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Composition (DC): a regional and total body analysis by examining DXA HCFMRP-USP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, skinfold thickness, perimeters and bone&#xD;
           diameters);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biochemical tests - to evaluate the immunological and metabolic parameters;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food Recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index Ankle / Brachial (ITB) The ABI is calculated by the ratio of systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) of the posterior tibial artery or dorsalis pedis artery with higher SBP brachial or&#xD;
      radial artery (calculated on both hemisphere). With the patient positioned supine for&#xD;
      implementation of these measures. The PAS in both regions will be determined by means of&#xD;
      aneroid sphygmomanometer brand &quot;Premium®&quot; and Doppler Vascular Portable - DV 600, brand&#xD;
      &quot;Martec Med®.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition The CC at the molecular levelwill be determined by scanning Total Body and&#xD;
      Regional by DXA (Hologic®, QDR4500W software, version 11.2 QDR), being determined: bone&#xD;
      mineral content (BMC), mass fat (MG) MG percentage (% BF) and lean soft tissue (TMM). The&#xD;
      portion for each of these components will consider five regional sites: upper (Sup), lower&#xD;
      (Inf), appendicular (Ape, Sup + Inf), trunk (Tro) and total (Tot). Prior to the DXA&#xD;
      participants will be asked to empty the bladder and will wear one hospital gown. During the&#xD;
      examination they should be positioned centrally supine on the scanner table, with&#xD;
      outstretched legs and háluces contact; the upper body must remain extended along the trunk&#xD;
      and hands should not be in contact with the trunk and it is important that patients stay&#xD;
      still during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas BMC is measured by DXA bone ash of bone mass (MO) full, or approximately 95.82%, the&#xD;
      total amount is corrected by multiplying by 1.0436 BMC. As it should be noted that although&#xD;
      there are significant differences in the estimated BMC between DXA commercial systems, this&#xD;
      aspect is a minimum impact on the estimate of the multicomponent CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently for overall changes of fat, bone and muscle tissue will be performed at&#xD;
      processing level 2 DC components (molecular) to level 4 (organ / tissue) according to the&#xD;
      proposed by in muscle tissue for bone tissue and into the adipose tissue, as shown in Table&#xD;
      1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 - Equations of transforming the molecular level DC components to the level organ /&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magazine mass Model (kg) Skeletal Muscle TMM appendage (kg) x *1,19-1,65 Bone 1.85 x MO&#xD;
      Adipose Tissue 1.18 x Fat Mass Body mass determined by DXA will be used for future&#xD;
      comparisons. 3.5.3 Evaluation anthropometric Body weight and height will be determined by an&#xD;
      electronic scale with stadiometer brand &quot;Welmy®&quot; featuring reading scales accurate to&#xD;
      readings of 0.1 kg and 0.5 cm for body weight and height, respectively. Skinfolds, perimeters&#xD;
      and bone diameters are determined by caliper, anthropometric tape and caliper with 0.1 mm&#xD;
      reading accuracy, 0.1 cm and 0.1 mm, respectively, of the brand &quot;Sanny Medical®&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All anthropometric measurements will be carried out according to literature recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical tests A blood sample will be collected during routine consultations for Metabolic&#xD;
      and Immune analysis Viral Load Laboratory - Serology Sector HCFMRP-USP. The concentrations of&#xD;
      total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL), insulin and fasting blood glucose are determined by an enzymatic method&#xD;
      using the kit Wiener Lab.®. For immune responses to viral load level, when the detectable HIV&#xD;
      RNA is&gt; 48 cópias.mL-1. Is determined by Real Time Abbott method using the kit Siemens -&#xD;
      Versant® HIV-1 3.0 RNA and DNA Analyzer System 340® apparatus; and CD4 + and CD8 count by&#xD;
      flow cytometry, using Multitest® kit and Facs Calibur® cytometer (Becton Dickinson - San Jose&#xD;
      CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the insulin resistance in patients, will use the homeostasis index model&#xD;
      assessment - resistence insulin (HOMA-IR), calculated by fasting glucose formula (mmol / l =&#xD;
      mg / dl ÷ 18) x fasting insulin (U / ml) / 22.5. The anthropometric assessment, determination&#xD;
      of ABI and the examination of DXA will take place at HC-FMRP / USP, in a single session, at&#xD;
      least assessors trained for each role. Laboratory tests will be performed at HC-FMRP / USP,&#xD;
      in the morning, with all patients fasted for eight hours, the same skilled professionals&#xD;
      during routine outpatient follow-up in UETDI HCFMRP-USP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocols Strength Training (TF) Overview of Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into three groups, and the TF groups will be formed through the&#xD;
      sample mirroring through the power levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G1 - TFOV (n≈12; intensity of TF: 30% of 1RM). The vascular occlusion pressure members&#xD;
           is determined individually in posterior tibial arteries and brachial or radial (computed&#xD;
           in both hemisphere) through vascular Doppler - DV 600, the mark &quot;Martec Med&quot;, the&#xD;
           patient being positioned in supine and using restrictive cuffs restriction of blood flow&#xD;
           to the brand &quot;Missouri®&quot; (Lower limb: 170X900 mm; Upper limb: 70X730 mm - driving&#xD;
           cuffs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G2 - TFT (n≈12; TF intensity: 80% of 1RM; no vascular occlusion), and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G3 - Subject untrained, control group (n≈12). Individuals of G1 and G2 will undergo 12&#xD;
           weeks of TF, totaling 36 sessions, with weekly frequency of three times, the first two&#xD;
           weeks of adaptation to TF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each training session will be held the measurement of blood pressure (BP), heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) and oxygen saturation in the blood (SpO2), using stethoscope and an aneroid&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer brand &quot;Premium®&quot; cardiofrequency brand &quot; Polar FT7® &quot;and digital oximeter&#xD;
      brand&quot; Oximeter® &quot;. In the absence of vital signs against indicative, begins the training&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises of the following: 10 minutes of heating, with the completion of five minutes on a&#xD;
      stationary bike and a set of 15 repetitions of each exercise with heating for approximately&#xD;
      50% of 1RM. Thirty minutes of exercise: elbow extension in the pulley (triceps); Barbell&#xD;
      curls (biceps); Unilateral knee flexion (hamstring) on the flexor standing; Knee extension&#xD;
      (quadriceps) on the extensor chair, using the exercise machine station such as &quot;Athletic&#xD;
      2000® Extreme&quot; (Full Station), brand &quot;Atletic Way®&quot; (Porto Alegre - RS) (intensity variation&#xD;
      2, 5 270 kg in the independent columns); five minutes with cooling muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity and Volume The exercises will be distributed in two consecutive phases: Phase and&#xD;
      Specific Adaptation Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation of phase (composed of six sessions for both groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For groups 1 and 2, will be offered five training sessions with three sets of 12 to 15&#xD;
           repetitions and intensity of 50% of maximal work capacity (1RM), certain pre indirectly&#xD;
           Adapting Stage by means of the maximum repetition test (RMs). At this stage, the concern&#xD;
           is with respect to learning movement and speed of execution (two-second intervals for&#xD;
           the concentric phase and two seconds for the eccentric phase). To proper adaptation of&#xD;
           the patient to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the 6th training session will be given again the intensity of 1RM through the RMs&#xD;
           test (Brzycki, 1993), to see change in the maximum force during the adaptation phase and&#xD;
           determining the training intensity for Specific Phase. This procedure will be repeated&#xD;
           at the 15th session of the specific period to adjust the intensity and the 30th session&#xD;
           to verify the change of the maximum force at the end of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific phase (consisting of 30 sessions for both groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G1: the first week (three sessions) will be three sets of 10 repetitions for adaptation&#xD;
           occlusion pressure, and in the other three sessions of repetitions until concentric&#xD;
           failure, with the two-second intervals for the concentric phase and two seconds for the&#xD;
           eccentric phase, with 30% of 1RM and intermittent vascular occlusion members (occlusion&#xD;
           used only during the course of the series, being released blood flow during breaks ).&#xD;
           Will be provided one-minute intervals between sets and exercises (with the exception of&#xD;
           the interval between the exercises of upper and lower; being provided at present a&#xD;
           three-minute break for removal and installation of restrictive cuffs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G2: will be three series of repetitions to the concentric failure, with cadence of&#xD;
           movement and intervals similar to the G1. The intensity will be 80% of 1RM without&#xD;
           occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The G3 not attend the TF, but will be considered as a control group, taking part only of&#xD;
           the pre and post intervention assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase security for both types of training, HR and BP patients will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the training session period (between exercises and series). The FC will&#xD;
      be monitored by a heart rate monitor brand &quot;Polar FT7® placed before the training session and&#xD;
      the PA by a stethoscope and an aneroid sphygmomanometer brand&quot; Premium® &quot;that will be placed&#xD;
      at the end of each series. As the PA will be given between 20 and 30 seconds after completion&#xD;
      of the last rep. Before any physiological disorder or complaint, the training will be stopped&#xD;
      and the necessary precautions and measures will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis An exploratory analysis will be used to check the behavior of the data&#xD;
      by normality test (Shapiro-Wilks) to indicate the statistical analysis of the study&#xD;
      variables. The values (central tendency) descriptive of the morphological, metabolic and&#xD;
      immunological characteristics will be presented in the periods (pre- and post-intervention),&#xD;
      variance between groups and their significance levels. ANOVA (or Friedman test) to two&#xD;
      factors will be used for comparisons between groups and moments (pre and post) concerned. All&#xD;
      analyzes will be performed using the SPSS 17.0 software, assuming prior statistical&#xD;
      significance of p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
