    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to search whether glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue,&#xD;
      Liraglutide, by enhancing clock gene and AMPK-SIRT-1 mRNA expression, may reverse the&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, improving overall glycemic excursion,&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines and β-cell function in type 2 diabetes individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim is to compare the effect of 40 days treatment with Liraglutide (LIR)&#xD;
      vs. 40 days with placebo (PLA) in T2D participants on the following end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the oscillation of CG (i.e. CLOCK, BMAL1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2,&#xD;
           Rev-erb-alpha Ror-alpha), AMPK, SIRT1 and inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in&#xD;
           white blood cells (WBCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall daily glycemic variation assessed with continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
           (CBMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  β-Cell function derived from glucose and insulin response to OGTT&#xD;

      Background: Cumulative evidence strongly implicates that the disruption of clock genes (CGs)&#xD;
      plays a causative role in insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and β-cell dysfunction in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). CGs are synchronized by meal timing. Indeed, in animals and patients with&#xD;
      T2D, restricting feeding to specific hours, such as large meals assigned to breakfast with&#xD;
      reduced dinner, can reset and restore CG expression, resulting in improved glycemic control,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and reduction of HbA1c compared to isocaloric diet with a different meal&#xD;
      timing (small breakfast and overeating at dinner). Since glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is&#xD;
      secreted within a few minutes in response to food ingestion and it influences multiple&#xD;
      humoral and neural signaling pathways that may further influence CG expression in many cells,&#xD;
      it has been suggested that GLP-1 may be a resetting signal for the CGs, synchronizing the&#xD;
      food entrainment on CGs expression thereby influencing the glucose metabolism. In fact,&#xD;
      several studies in animal models, documented that GLP-1 analogs either exenatide or&#xD;
      liraglutide, via activation of CG expression and AMPK-SIRT-1 pathway, improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, muscular glucose uptake, reduced hepatic and cardiac steatosis, inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and oxidative stress, and enhanced β-cell insulin secretion and proliferation,&#xD;
      independently of the GLP-1 analog glucose-lowering effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, no systemic study in humans to date has&#xD;
      investigated the changes in the expression of CGs and AMPK-SIRT-1 pathway, concomitantly with&#xD;
      the effect on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, beta cell function, and inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in T2D individuals during treatment with Liraglutide or other GLP-1 analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize, that Liraglutide, by enhancing CG and AMPK-SIRT-1&#xD;
      expression may reverse the metabolic abnormalities of T2D, improving insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      overall glycemic excursion, inflammatory cytokines and β-cell function in T2D individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim is to compare the effect of 40 days treatment with Liraglutide (LIR)&#xD;
      vs. 40 days with placebo (PLA) in T2D participants on the following end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the oscillation of CG (i.e. CLOCK, BMAL1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2,&#xD;
           Rev-erb-alpha, Ror-alpha), AMPK, SIRT1 and inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in&#xD;
           white blood cells (WBCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall daily glycemic variation assessed with continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
           (CBMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  β-Cell function derived from glucose and insulin response to OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a randomized, double blind crossover-within-subject clinical trial, the&#xD;
      investigators will study 18 weight- matched obese and overweight participants with known T2D,&#xD;
      diagnosed &lt; 20 years, and HbA1c 7.0 to 10 %, BMI: 26-32 kg/m2 treated with diet alone or diet&#xD;
      plus metformin, and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (gliflozins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 18 T2D participant will undergo randomization at baseline to two 40 days treatment&#xD;
      periods, either starting with LIR treatment, and then after 2 weeks of wash-out, will&#xD;
      crossover to second treatment period of 40 days with PLA, or vice-versa, starting the first&#xD;
      period with PLA during 40 days and then crossover to 40 days with LIR. The treatment with LIR&#xD;
      and PLA will be up-titrated progressively from 0.1ml to 0.3ml to avoid the secondary effects&#xD;
      of LIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The investigators expect that LIR will lead to enhanced expression of the&#xD;
      diurnal oscillation of the CGs and AMPK, SIRT1 pathway, will reduce serum inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, and overall daily glycemic variation while improving insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      β-Cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study: Showing that GLP-1 analog Liraglutide, improves β-cell function in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic individuals, by enhancing clock genes mRNA expression and the AMPK-SRIT1&#xD;
      pathway, may change the approach of Liraglutide treatment, from being an excellent&#xD;
      anti-diabetic agent with beneficial effect on the diabetic heart, to a drug with the ability&#xD;
      to synchronize body metabolism and improve glucose homeostasis in health and disease.&#xD;
      Presently, there are many available drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but their&#xD;
      mode of action does not make any of them more advantageous. If this GLP-1 analog not only&#xD;
      reduces glucose, body weight and cardiovascular risk, but also synchronizes the circadian&#xD;
      clock, this would make of Liraglutide the drug of choice (immediately after metformin) for&#xD;
      the treatment of obesity, early diabetes and for prevention of T2D complications and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in high risk patients, moreover, Liraglutide by influencing clock genes&#xD;
      expression, may further prevent several other age related disorders linked to the disruption&#xD;
      of clock genes.&#xD;
