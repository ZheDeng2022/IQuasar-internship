    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether giving injections of anakinra is a&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated treatment to give as an adjunct to standard prescribed treatment for&#xD;
      patients who are admitted to the hospital with signs of severe inflammation (macrophage&#xD;
      activation syndrome) that is potentially life-threatening. Anakinra is a commercially&#xD;
      available product (Kineret™) approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is a&#xD;
      replica of a naturally occurring protein called Il-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), made by&#xD;
      humans to inhibit and regulate the action of interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-1 is a mediator of&#xD;
      inflammation that when generated in excess amounts by immune system cells can result in&#xD;
      severe dysfunction of multiple organs that can be life-threatening. The specific primary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to determine if giving anakinra results in no increased infection&#xD;
      complications or mortality. Additional data will be collected to determine whether anakinra&#xD;
      administration results in any other unanticipated side effects in this setting, and the&#xD;
      effects of anakinra administration on inflammation markers, the overall dose of steroids&#xD;
      required to treat the inflammation, and the length of hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a disorder whereby the immune system generates very&#xD;
      high levels of substances (cytokines) that promote inflammation to the extent dysfunction&#xD;
      occurs in multiple organ systems which if unchecked, is frequently fatal to the affected&#xD;
      individual. This can occur in the setting of a number of different immune system disorders&#xD;
      including, systemic lupus, systemic-onset juvenile arthritis, and adult-onset Still's&#xD;
      disease. MAS can also occur in response to infection with certain viruses such as&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and malignancies involving lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high fatality of MAS (&gt;50%), a number of different treatments have been tried&#xD;
      to manage this disorder, including use of high-dose steroids, immune suppressants such as&#xD;
      cyclosporine, and cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments (etoposide) with variable success and/or&#xD;
      severe complications of immune suppression (as may occur with etoposide). A number of recent&#xD;
      case reports and case series have reported success using cytokine-blocking therapies such as&#xD;
      anakinra in the treatment of MAS that is associated with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic&#xD;
      arthritis and adult Still's disease. Anakinra is a bio-engineered form of the naturally&#xD;
      occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), that blocks the action of&#xD;
      interleukin-1, one of the cytokines that is expressed and present in very high amounts in&#xD;
      patients who have MAS. Anakinra/Il-1ra is an attractive treatment for patients presenting&#xD;
      with clinical features of MAS because it has a relatively short half-life and is easy to&#xD;
      administer by subcutaneous injection. In previous trials of its use in patients with clinical&#xD;
      features of bacterial sepsis (fever, elevated heart rate, low/falling blood pressure) , it&#xD;
      was shown that anakinra does not have a harmful effect but also did not appear to have any&#xD;
      benefit with repect to the defined primary outcome of improved survival. However, a recent&#xD;
      re-analysis of the data accumulated in these same previous sepsis trials (for which the&#xD;
      primary defined outcome was survival) indicates that survival was actually increased in the&#xD;
      subgroup of sepsis patients with features of MAS (ferritin elevations in excess of 2,000&#xD;
      ng/ml, signs of coagulopathy, and liver enzyme elevations) who were randomized to receive&#xD;
      anakinra compared to the subgroup of sepsis patients with features of MAS who were randomized&#xD;
      to receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous doses of anakinra up to 3500 mg/day over 72 hours that were employed in the trials&#xD;
      of adult patients with sepsis were noted to be well tolerated without increased adverse&#xD;
      outcomes compared to patients randomized to placebo. Recent case reports have shown that&#xD;
      doses up to 100 mg every 6 hours were efficacious and well tolerated in children with&#xD;
      systemic onset juvenile arthritis complicated by refractory macrophage activation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first controlled study to confirm whether anakinra at dose of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg/day to a maximum of dose of 200 mg/day divided every 12 hours (for children ≤40 kg) or&#xD;
      5 mg/kg/day up to a maximum dose of 400 mg/day divided every 6 hours (children &gt; 40 kg and&#xD;
      adults) does not result in increased mortality or infection complications when administered&#xD;
      in addition to current UAB standard of care treatment (corticosteroids) to children and&#xD;
      adults hospitalized with suspected macrophage activation syndrome.&#xD;
