  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the comparative effectiveness of&#xD;
      obesity counseling as covered by CMS in improving weight loss for adults either with or at&#xD;
      high risk of type 2 diabetes. CMS and most insurers now include obesity screening and&#xD;
      counseling benefits, with no cost sharing to patients. Since overweight patients are at&#xD;
      highest risk for diabetes, improved weight management services could prevent diabetes and its&#xD;
      negative health outcomes. Beneficiaries with obesity are eligible for up to 20 face-to-face&#xD;
      visits for weight counseling in the primary care setting. The investigators propose comparing&#xD;
      weight and diabetes outcomes in three states using EHR and claims data before and after this&#xD;
      policy was implemented by leveraging the novel infrastructure of the Patient-Centered&#xD;
      Outcomes Research Institute-funded PaTH Clinical Data Research Network. Following&#xD;
      developments during the COVID-19 pandemic, the investigators further plan to leverage our&#xD;
      study infrastructure across five health systems to understand the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of telemedicine approaches for providing outpatient care for patients with or at risk of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and how these approaches impact the subgroup of patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of universal preventive service coverage for obesity screening and&#xD;
      counseling on weight loss, diabetes incidence, and diabetes outcomes, in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes or at high risk for diabetes (defined by body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 25). The&#xD;
      investigators will determine how the annual probability of receiving obesity and/or&#xD;
      nutritional counseling (as defined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code) changed pre-&#xD;
      and post-policy across all insurers in a cohort of patients with diabetes and at high risk&#xD;
      for diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that individual patients are more likely to&#xD;
      receive counseling following coverage implementation. Further, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients who receive a greater number of face-to-face visits will have greater weight&#xD;
      loss compared to those who receive fewer visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare patient weight loss and diabetes-related outcomes among those who receive&#xD;
      obesity screening and counseling to those who do not, following implementation of preventive&#xD;
      service coverage. The investigators will examine post-policy impact of obesity screening and&#xD;
      counseling in a cohort of patients with diabetes and at high risk for diabetes. Specific&#xD;
      outcomes to be examined include weight loss, diabetes incidence, and diabetes outcomes&#xD;
      (including hemoglobin A1c, controlled blood pressure, use of a statin medication). Further,&#xD;
      the investigators will determine patient characteristics, including demographics (age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, rurality), and practice characteristics, including provider type, and their&#xD;
      impact on receiving/providing obesity screening and counseling. Understanding patient and&#xD;
      practice characteristics most likely to engage in obesity counseling can identify best&#xD;
      practices and inform how to increase engagement by both patients and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To understand the impact of telemedicine access (telephonic and/or virtual visits)&#xD;
      compared to no telemedicine visits for outpatient care for patients with, or at risk of, type&#xD;
      2 diabetes during the pandemic on patient-centered outcomes including hemoglobin A1c and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, with sub-group analysis of patients with COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To evaluate the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (defined by hospitalization and&#xD;
      mortality) in patients with diabetes and/or elevated BMI, with a focus on identifying&#xD;
      modifiable factors (i.e., medication use, treatment timeline/location, chronic comorbid&#xD;
      conditions) and associated with improved outcomes to inform immediate intervention and future&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
