      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this study is to improve post-operative pain and reduce morphine&#xD;
      consumption following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). We specifically aim to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia infusions on post-operative morphine consumption and.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers (random permutation) and&#xD;
      opaque envelope methods. At closure, one small 2mm catheter belonging to the AutoFuser pain&#xD;
      pump system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity between the onlay mesh and parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum. In the treatment arm patients will receive 275mL of 0.2% ropivacaine at 4mL/h. In&#xD;
      the placebo arm, 275mL of 0.9% normal saline will be used in a similar fashion. The infusions&#xD;
      will run for 68 hours total. All members involved in patient care (with the exception of one&#xD;
      independant research fellow) will be blinded to the above. After 68 hours the pump will be&#xD;
      stopped and the catheter will be removed. Assessment of post-operative pain will be performed&#xD;
      by visual analogue scale, and total opiate consumption will be collected and converted into&#xD;
      morphine equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia has become an important addition to multimodal regimens of analgesia&#xD;
      following surgery. Recent studies have shown that local anaesthetic (LA) wound infiltration&#xD;
      has improved post-operative pain when compared with standard opioid regimens for pain relief.&#xD;
      Only one previous study looked at bupivacaine infusions into the hernia sac for three days&#xD;
      following LVHR. This study found no improvement in post-operative pain or morphine&#xD;
      consumption. We aim to demonstrate improved pain and reduced morphine consumption using an&#xD;
      alternative catheter insertion technique and ropivacaine as the desired LA agent.&#xD;

      Scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A ventral hernia (VH) is a fascial defect located in the anterior abdominal wall. Primary VH&#xD;
      includes epigastric, umbilical and spigelian hernias. A secondary defect or incisional hernia&#xD;
      develops at a previous surgical incision site (1). VHs are a common condition and risk&#xD;
      factors include obesity, previous abdominal surgery and elevated intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      (2). With New Zealand's rising obesity epidemic the incidence of VH is projected to increase&#xD;
      (3-4). Optimising the peri-operative care of patients undergoing VH repair is critical to&#xD;
      cost-effective healthcare of this increasingly significant issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical repair aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications (5-6). Open mesh repair&#xD;
      has been the accepted gold standard since proving superior to open suture repair (7).&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has grown in popularity since its introduction in&#xD;
      1993 (8). Studies have shown advantages over open repair such as fewer infectious&#xD;
      complications and shorter hospital stay (9-12). Importantly, LVHR is favourable in obese&#xD;
      patients (BMI&gt;30) due to lower complication rates and overall cost of care (13-16).&#xD;
      Laparoscopic surgery has been considered less painful in comparison to open surgery, yet&#xD;
      trials report no difference in acute or chronic pain (17-19). Severe pain following LVHR is a&#xD;
      significant clinical problem impacting on wellbeing, quality of life and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      (20). One hypothesis to explain this pain is the use of tacks and sutures for mesh fixation&#xD;
      (21-23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia has become a key adjunct to multimodal post-operative regimens of&#xD;
      analgesia. This is due to fewer side effects such as nausea and vomiting, gut dysmotility and&#xD;
      respiratory depression (24). Local anaesthetic (LA) agents are easily applied directly to the&#xD;
      injury site blocking afferent nociceptive nerves and reducing the local inflammatory response&#xD;
      (25). There are significant benefits to intraperitoneal application of LA agents following&#xD;
      abdominal surgery (26-27). Hence, operative insult to the peritoneum following LVHR may be&#xD;
      controlled with LA directed to the site of mesh fixation in the intraperitoneal cavity (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a randomised double-blinded controlled trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia infusions on post-operative pain and morphine consumption&#xD;
      in patients undergoing LVHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised double-blinded clinical trial to investigating intra-peritoneal infusions of&#xD;
      ropivacaine on post-operative pain scores in patients undergoing LVHR procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval for this project is yet to be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using morphine consumption data from a retrospective study we conducted in evaluating the&#xD;
      total opiate consumption in the first 24 hours following LVHR surgery, in order to detect a&#xD;
      reduction of morphine consumption by 50% in the first 24 hours post-operatively with alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 and power of 0.9, 43 patients are required in each group. We will aim for 48 patients in&#xD;
      each arm anticipating for possible drop outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from surgical outpatient clinics at Manukau Super Clinic (MSC).&#xD;
      Patients who are undergoing LVHR will be invited to partake in the study. As the research&#xD;
      fellow in this study I will be involved in data collection and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers and opaque envelope methods.&#xD;
      In the treatment arm patients will receive 275mL of 0.2% ropivacaine after wound catheter&#xD;
      insertion or in the placebo arm, receive 275mL of 0.9% normal saline in a similar fashion.&#xD;
      One theatre staff nurse who will not be involved in patient care will be given the blinded&#xD;
      envelope and the pre-prepared lidocaine or saline mixtures in the theatre drug room. The&#xD;
      mixtures will be unlabelled and appear similar in color. All members of the staff involved in&#xD;
      patient care including the anaesthetist will be blinded to the solution administered. The&#xD;
      theatre staff nurse will then prepare a small infusion pump (AutoFuser). The mixture used in&#xD;
      the pump will be pre-mixed by one of the clinical pharmacists at Middlemore hospital who will&#xD;
      not be involved in patient care. The staff nurse will be un-blinded to the contents of the&#xD;
      mixtures. The nurse will prepare the pump and load either the local anaesthetic or saline&#xD;
      solution. At closure, one small 2mm catheter, with 30 small fenestrations at the end, will be&#xD;
      placed in the peritoneal cavity between the onlay mesh and parietal peritoneum to infuse&#xD;
      local anaesthetic. This will penetrate through the skin once closure is complete. This will&#xD;
      be attached to the infusion pump (AutoFuser). This pump will contain either 270mls of 0.2%&#xD;
      ropivacaine or 270mls of 0.9% saline. All members involved in patient care including&#xD;
      surgical, anaesthetic and nursing teams will be blinded to the contents of this pump. The&#xD;
      pump will be activated at a set rate of 4mls/hr immediately once the patient is in the&#xD;
      post-anaesthesia recovery room. The pump will run continuously. The patient will continue&#xD;
      recovery on the ward as per the surgical team. After 68 hrs the pump will be stopped and the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed in a similar fashion as routine drain removal.&#xD;
