  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using novel decellularized&#xD;
      tissue matrices to isolate and culture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) collected from patients&#xD;
      with metastatic solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently very few practical or reproducible model systems which recapitulate the&#xD;
      metastatic process well. CTCs are important for the development of metastases and there is&#xD;
      interest in isolating and culturing them ex vivo to better characterize their biology,&#xD;
      metastatic potential, and response to different therapies. The investigators have previously&#xD;
      demonstrated efficient capture and enumeration of CTCs in 4 unique patient cohorts&#xD;
      (metastatic prostate and locally advanced rectal, cervical and head and neck cancers) in the&#xD;
      investigators prospective clinical study, LCCC 1408 (Investigation of Circulating Tumor Cells&#xD;
      from Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy). However, CTCs are difficult to culture&#xD;
      with conventional methods. The investigators propose to culture CTCs using novel&#xD;
      decellularized tissue matrices. Blood will be collected from cancer patients with metastatic&#xD;
      solid tissue tumors prior to starting definitive or palliative radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      investigators will then isolate CTCs and attempt to grow them on various decellularized&#xD;
      matrices. If this study is successful and feasibility is demonstrated, important pilot&#xD;
      information will also be gathered which will then be used in power and sample size&#xD;
      considerations for future CTCs studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any metastatic solid tumor malignancy. Metastatic is defined as biopsy&#xD;
             proven disease involving at least one organ other than the primary tumor organ.&#xD;
             Regional lymph node metastases are not considered metastatic. Patients with newly&#xD;
             diagnosed metastatic disease who have not had systemic therapy in at least six months&#xD;
             or are progressing on systemic therapy will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled to initiate radiation for management of their disease, and schedule&#xD;
             accommodates blood sample collection prior to radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female of â‰¥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients capable of reproduction must agree to use medically&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception, such as an intra-uterine device, diaphragm, with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom with spermicide or abstinence, during radiation therapy. Inclusion&#xD;
             of females of childbearing potential requires a negative pregnancy test within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to study initiation (part of standard of care in radiation oncology).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained and signed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to have blood collection without excessive difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unwilling or unable to complete informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical or psychological inability to complete sample collection for any reason&#xD;
             including but not limited to: inability to tolerate any study procedures, any physical&#xD;
             limitation that would undermine the safety of the subject in the study, or any&#xD;
             psychiatric or neurological condition that inhibits full comprehension of study&#xD;
             requirements and inability to complete informed consent, as determined by treating&#xD;
             physician&#xD;
