    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized and controlled human study to optimize controlled human&#xD;
      malaria infection (CHMI) administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI). 36 healthy adults&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 45 years, will be randomized to one of five groups and will be inoculated&#xD;
      with PfSPZ Challenge DVI. Participation duration is estimated to be 2 months, while the study&#xD;
      duration is planned to be 4 months. The primary objective of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and reactogenicity of PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI using 7G8 and NF54 P.&#xD;
      falciparum strains.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single center, randomized and controlled human study to optimize&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI). 30&#xD;
      to 36 participants will be randomized to one of five groups and will be inoculated with PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge DVI. All participants recruited will be healthy adults aged between 18 and 45&#xD;
      years. The study duration is 4 months, participation duration is estimated to be 2 months.&#xD;
      Safety and infectivity data will be collected for each study product and dose-level. Sera&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline and at study day 29 for antibody assays. Participants, and&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory investigators will be blinded to group allocation. The study primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be reached at study day 29, at which time an interim study report will be&#xD;
      generated. The investigators, the sponsor, the data and statistical analysis team, and&#xD;
      Sanaria staff will meet in person or by teleconference on day 43 to review infection,&#xD;
      pre-patent period, and adverse event results. These results will be made available to members&#xD;
      of the International PfSPZ Consortium (I-PfSPZ-C) and if required, to regulatory authorities,&#xD;
      including the FDA, to facilitate other PfSPZ Challenge CHMI studies with the appropriate&#xD;
      disclaimers. Participants will be followed as outpatients for malaria diagnosis, treatment&#xD;
      and follow-up to study day 57. Malaria positivity will be determined by qPCR diagnostics with&#xD;
      microscopy as a backup. Participants who test positive for malaria and those who remain&#xD;
      negative at study day 29 will be treated with oral atovaquone-proguanil. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of PfSPZ Challenge&#xD;
      administered by DVI using 7G8 and NF54 P. falciparum strains. Secondary objectives are to 1)&#xD;
      assess the infectivity of four escalating doses of direct venous inoculation (DVI) of the 7G8&#xD;
      clone in comparison with an established dose (100% infective) DVI of the NF54 strain and 2)&#xD;
      assess the time to malaria patency for escalating doses of the 7G8 clone compared to a single&#xD;
      dose of the NF54 strain.&#xD;
