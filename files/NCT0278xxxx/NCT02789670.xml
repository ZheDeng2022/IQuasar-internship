    <textblock>
      New therapeutic approaches of MS are emerging, targeting different actors of the immune&#xD;
      system. Some of them target a specific population of white blood cells: B lymphocytes&#xD;
      composed of different subpopulations. The subsets of B cells express different functional&#xD;
      properties that control the immune response, but these regulation mechanisms have yet to be&#xD;
      clearly described. Some subpopulations could amplify inflammation through IL-6 production for&#xD;
      example, whereas some ones contribute to its regulation through the production of IL-10.&#xD;
      Using samples collected in a large cohort of individuals with risk of MS and treatment-naive&#xD;
      patients in the early onset of the disease, the investigators aim to develop a 2 year&#xD;
      follow-up study of the different blood B cells subset distribution and their functional&#xD;
      properties in terms of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in MS. This approach&#xD;
      can identify new biomarkers for monitoring of MS patients and lead to better define the&#xD;
      indication use of depletive B cell drugs and not to counteract the regulatory action of these&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive immuno-inflammatory and degenerative disease of the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) and represents the second most common cause of disability in&#xD;
      young people. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are complex and effective therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies have yet to be defined. Moreover it's today evident that treatment approaches have&#xD;
      to be performed in a personalized point of view. In this context, biomarkers evaluating the&#xD;
      course of the disease but also predicting efficacy of therapy are particularly needed in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data underlines the direct role of B-cells in MS. Such comprehensive data have led to&#xD;
      new therapeutic strategies using biotherapies in order to deplete, or modulate, the functions&#xD;
      of peripheral B cells. Such approaches have led to contradictory results of efficacy. Today,&#xD;
      it remains unclear whether B-cells exert diminished regulatory effects or instead potentiate&#xD;
      the pathogenic response of T-cells. Such dual properties may depend on the release of&#xD;
      inhibitory (e.g. interleukin-10) or pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6) and/or&#xD;
      direct interactions with other cells, especially T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to longitudinally evaluate quantitative and functional changes in&#xD;
      peripheral blood B-cell subsets (1) at the initiation phases of MS, i.e. radiological&#xD;
      isolated syndrome (RIS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (2) during progression of MS&#xD;
      and (3) between the two clinical forms of MS in naïve treatment patient: Relapsing-Remittent&#xD;
      MS (RRMS) and Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). B-cell subsets are defined by a combination of&#xD;
      membrane markers and enumerated at different time points (inclusion (before treatment) and at&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, 24 months of treatment initiation) in a whole blood flow cytometric (FCM) analysis.&#xD;
      The absolute counts and relative proportions of transitional, naïve, memory, and marginal&#xD;
      zone-like B-cell subsets are being followed up prospectively in patients with a&#xD;
      radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS, n= 20), with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, n=&#xD;
      20), in MS patients with relapsing remitting form (RRMS, n = 20) and in MS patients with&#xD;
      primary progressive evolution of the disease (PPMS, n = 20). Control samples are being&#xD;
      collected from patients affected by other inflammatory diseases with neurological symptoms&#xD;
      (Devic syndrome, Neurobehcet, neurosarcoidosis n = 20) or without neurological symptoms&#xD;
      (systemic sclerosis, SSc, n= 20) and from blood donors (n = 40). In order to evaluate&#xD;
      functional properties of B cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from each group&#xD;
      of patients are activated with CD40 ligand and CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), and&#xD;
      IL-10-producing B-cells are enumerated by FCM after a brief incubation with phorbol myristate&#xD;
      acetate, ionomycin, and brefeldin A as a protein transport inhibitor agent. In selected CIS&#xD;
      and MS patients whose changes in B-cell subpopulations associated with onset or progression&#xD;
      of the disease are representative, the B-cell subpopulations will be purified and activated&#xD;
      with CD40 ligand and CpG ODNs to be co cultured with anti-CD3-activated autologous T-cells to&#xD;
      evaluate inhibitory or potentiating effects on T-cell production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (e.g. IFN-gamma, IL-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All phenotypic analyses and cell cultures are performed using previously validated protocols.&#xD;
      Our ultimate goal is to correlate quantitative and functional changes of subsets composing&#xD;
      the systemic B-cell population with the grading and evolution of MS. Such a strategy could&#xD;
      lead to identify which MS patients should receive treatment targeting B cells and when.&#xD;
      Further, it may offer a rationale for alternative forms of cell therapy that could introduce&#xD;
      for example autologous purified B regulator cells after depletive strategies.&#xD;
