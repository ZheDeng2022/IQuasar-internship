  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic, severe disease resulting in a misperception of reality,&#xD;
      major social withdrawal and cognitive disturbances. Executive dysfunctions are widely&#xD;
      considered as primary determinants of functional outcome. However, classic neuropsychological&#xD;
      executive function measures poorly represent patients' functional outcome and seem&#xD;
      inappropriate to evaluate the real-world functional impact of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this perspective, Shallice and Burgess have developed for brain-damaged patients, the&#xD;
      Multiple Errands Test (MET) allowing to assess planning, adaptation, problem solving and&#xD;
      mental flexibility in real life settings, thus better capturing day-to-day abilities and&#xD;
      including contextual (social, perceptive) influences. Setting the assessment outside the&#xD;
      laboratory can help to identify subtle executive impairment not systematically expressed in&#xD;
      standard care conditions and consequently improve the future care solutions. MET is based on&#xD;
      the Supervisory Attentional System (SAS) model of executive functioning and attention control&#xD;
      that specifies how thought and action schema become activated or suppressed for routine and&#xD;
      non-routine circumstances .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MET has been designed to measure real-world executive performance confronting the&#xD;
      participants to unpredictable affordances and interpersonal interactions while planning and&#xD;
      problem solving. Patients are asked to accomplish several tasks of variable complexity in an&#xD;
      unknown commercial district. A number of rules must be respected and thus an action plan,&#xD;
      strategy formulation, time and space management with very little assistance of the examiner&#xD;
      are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies involving MET were conceived for patients with acquired brain damage.&#xD;
      LeThiec offered an extensive protocol with the initial scoring system (in terms of&#xD;
      inefficiencies, rule breaks, interpretation failures and task execution failures). Simplified&#xD;
      versions of MET were also suggested to be more suitable in hospital settings. Only one study&#xD;
      was done in SZ including a single patient, it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions&#xD;
      about clinical utility in SZ. To date, no other studies investigated the suitability of MET&#xD;
      in patients with psychosis, while executive impairment is well documented in this population&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the Multiple Errands Test (MET), an ecological assessment&#xD;
      of executive function has a better ability to measure everyday adaptative functioning SZ,&#xD;
      compared to conventional EF assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are: (1) establish normative data and (2) study discriminant&#xD;
      validity of this tool with a large panel of EF measures.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 clinically stable SZ patients and 60 controls will be administered MET, as well as two&#xD;
      measures of executive function: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - 64, 6 Elements Test. Functional&#xD;
      outcome will be assessed through Behavioural Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF-A),&#xD;
      ECHELLES LAUSANNOISES D'AUTO-EVALUATION DES DIFFICULTES ET DES BESOINS (ELADEB scale) and&#xD;
      Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF scale). Clinical measures will be recorded in&#xD;
      patients (Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Y&#xD;
      (STAI-Y A), Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) and Family Interview for Genetic&#xD;
      Studies (FIGS)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step1: The investigators will first compare patients and controls on all variables of MET and&#xD;
      establish normative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: The investigators will then study the discriminant validity of MET. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare MET with traditional measures of executive functioning. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess the correlation between each executive measure and functional outcome.&#xD;
