    <textblock>
      A large body of evidence points to impairment in the decoding of emotional stimuli in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). These changes seem to be related to dysfunction of the&#xD;
      mesocorticolimbic projections leading to dysfunction of the limbic cortico-subcortical loop&#xD;
      that, throughout the basal ganglia, projects to limbic cortical regions such as the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, which are known to be involved in emotional&#xD;
      processing. Thus, presumably the occurrence of non-motor psychic symptoms and fluctuations in&#xD;
      PD would also rely on the degeneration of this circuitry. Dopamine modulation of emotions has&#xD;
      been frequently reported both in healthy subjects or PD patients, but the effect of&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) over mood symptoms is more controversial&#xD;
      and there is still a paucity of data demonstrating its role in emotional processing. The&#xD;
      objective of our study is to assess and compare the behavioral and electrophysiological&#xD;
      effects of both dopamine and STN-DBS in PD during emotional processing. To do so, the&#xD;
      Emotional Stroop task, a version of the classical Stroop test developed to investigate&#xD;
      inhibition of emotional interference, will be performed by STN-DBS PD patients in four&#xD;
      different treatment conditions while high resolution electroencephalographic cortical mapping&#xD;
      is conducted. Using this approach, the investigators expect to better separate the mechanisms&#xD;
      of psychic features related to either disease, dopaminergic treatment, subthalamic&#xD;
      stimulation or the association of both, with the final aim of optimizing the clinical&#xD;
      management of PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and particularly mood manifestations such as&#xD;
      apathy, depression and anxiety have gained attention in the last few decades due to its high&#xD;
      frequency and impact in patient's quality of life. In addition, these psychic non-motor&#xD;
      features have been shown to fluctuate alike motor symptoms do, concurring to non-motor&#xD;
      fluctuations (NMF) that can be more disabling than motor symptoms. The physiopathological&#xD;
      basis of psychic NMF is unclear but mesolimbic dopaminergic denervation has been suggested to&#xD;
      underlie mood manifestations during off-periods . At the same time, it has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that PD patients suffer from abnormal emotional processing deficits in facial expression&#xD;
      recognition and emotional prosody especially concerning negative valanced emotions, and that&#xD;
      these impairments could also be linked to mesolimbic dopaminergic mechanisms. The mesolimbic&#xD;
      pathway is one of the functional cortico-subcortical loops in which basal ganglia are&#xD;
      segregated. It lies in the ventral subportion of each nucleus (ventromedial in the case of&#xD;
      the subthalamic nucleus) and through the mediodorsal thalamus projects to the orbito-frontal&#xD;
      cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), limbic cortical areas that robust evidence&#xD;
      has involved in the pathophysiology of mood disturbances and emotional processes like facial&#xD;
      expression recognition or emotional conflict resolution. In summary, in the same way that&#xD;
      dopamine depletion of the nigrostriatal pathway is at the origin of the parkinsonian motor&#xD;
      triad, the lack of dopamine in the mesolimbic loop would account for non-motor psychic&#xD;
      manifestations including apathy, anxiety, depression and disturbances in emotional decoding.&#xD;
      A proper way to explore these phenomena is through tasks that involve exposure to affective&#xD;
      stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stroop Test is a tool that allows exploring selective attention, cognitive conflict&#xD;
      resolution (inhibition of irrelevant reading automatism) and processing speed, and is usually&#xD;
      applied to evaluate executive functions. A modified version, the facial Emotional Stroop&#xD;
      (ES), was developed in order to address the interference of irrelevant affective distractors.&#xD;
      With this task, the authors demonstrated in healthy volunteers, that dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex and the amygdala are the areas implicated in emotional conflict monitoring whereas&#xD;
      rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation associates with emotional conflict&#xD;
      resolution through a top-down inhibition of the amygdala in order to avoid the interference&#xD;
      of new irrelevant emotional distracters. The same group designed a variant of the task by&#xD;
      adding non-emotional cognitive trials in which subjects had to identify the gender of the&#xD;
      faces instead of the affect. Through this paradigm, they were able to dissociate neural nets&#xD;
      involved in cognitive conflict resolution from those specifically involved in emotional&#xD;
      conflict resolution. Hence, while lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was shown to resolve&#xD;
      non-emotional conflict, the pregenual part of the anterior cingulate cortex, that is, the&#xD;
      rACC is involved in emotional conflict resolution. On the contrary, the detection of both&#xD;
      types of conflict share activation of a common region of the dorsal anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the ES task, our group has recently demonstrated in a functional MRI study with PD&#xD;
      patients that dopamine modulates emotional conflict resolution by &quot;normalizing&quot; the activity&#xD;
      of rACC, which was hypoactivate in the off-drug state compared to the on-drug state and to&#xD;
      healthy controls. The rACC receives massive dopamine projections from the ventral tegmental&#xD;
      area (VTA), and thus is part of the cortico-subcortical limbic loop. Therefore, these&#xD;
      findings would support the implication of this circuitry in emotional decoding disturbances&#xD;
      in PD and match with the hypothesis proposed that dopaminergic mesolimbic degeneration would&#xD;
      underlie mood manifestations and psychic NMF of the disorder. It is well demonstrated that&#xD;
      STN-DBS improves levodopa-sensitive motor symptoms of PD. STN-DBS does not change overall&#xD;
      cognitive function, except for some impairment in executive functions like verbal fluency&#xD;
      but, in an experimental scenario, it has been proved to increase impulsivity during cognitive&#xD;
      tasks in PD patients. However, its clinical effect in the affective domain of PD is highly&#xD;
      controversial and there is only very limited data regarding emotional processing. A few&#xD;
      available studies comparing patients before and after surgery point to a worsening in facial&#xD;
      emotion and prosody recognition. These findings could not be replicated in a more recent&#xD;
      work. Such studies however do not take into account the desensitization of the dopaminergic&#xD;
      system related to marked decrease in medication after STN DBS. Because of the major changes&#xD;
      in dopaminergic treatment and chronic desensitization all studies which do not compare&#xD;
      stimulation conditions should be interpreted very cautiously. In our opinion, due to the&#xD;
      large available clinical data that demonstrate behavioral changes after STN-DBS, and&#xD;
      considering the anatomic overlapping of STN functional subdivisions, it is likely that&#xD;
      stimulation would exert some effect over the limbic basal ganglia loop even with electrodes&#xD;
      that are well implanted in the sensorimotor territory and thus, induce changes in both motor&#xD;
      and affective domains, even though with some dissociation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this rationale, the investigators aim to reproduce in an electrophysiological&#xD;
      perspective the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidences of limbic cortical&#xD;
      regions involvement in emotional decoding processes and to differentiate them from those&#xD;
      involved in cognitive conflict. In addition, the investigators want to confirm dopamine&#xD;
      modulation when dealing with emotional conflict, and elucidate STN-DBS effect in behavioral&#xD;
      and cortical electrophysiological terms.&#xD;
