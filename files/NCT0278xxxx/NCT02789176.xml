      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the duration of treatment with phenobarbital&#xD;
      has an impact on neurodevelopmental and epilepsy outcomes, as well as parent and family&#xD;
      well-being, after neonatal seizures.&#xD;

    <measure>WIDEA Neurodevelopmental Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA FS) allowed us to compare the functional development between newborns who received short duration phenobarbital treatment and prolonged phenobarbital treatment. There were 50 questions with response options of 1(Never) to 4(all the time). WIDEA range was on a scale from 50-200 (At 24 months, the normal population mean score is 172±10).The higher the score the better the child's developmental function. Mean scores were calculated using data from any participant who completed surveys at 24 months.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Post-neonatal Epilepsy</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of epilepsy and the details of seizure types and frequencies were determined by telephone interview with the parent and corroborated by medical record review.</description>

    <time_frame>length of stay, measured in days, will be recorded during a chart review when the child is 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of medication exposure (dose and duration) during the admission as a predictor of the number of days the infant requires care (length of stay)</description>

    <measure>Impact of Treatment Duration on Parent and Family Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surveys selected with the help of our Parent Partners were given at 12, 18, and 24 months to assess the impact of neonatal seizure treatment duration on parent and family quality of life and well-being. The 24 month data is presented, as they align with the primary outcome. The study team reviewed the HADS 24 month Anxiety and Depression Score range of possible scores from 0-21 (higher = more depressed/more anxious), the 24 month Transformed WHO Overall Quality of Life and General Health score range of scores 0-100 (higher=better quality of life), the 24 month Impact on Family Scale overall impact scale range from 15-60 (higher = more impact on family), the 24 month Post Traumatic Growth Inventory scale range from 0 -105 (higher = better/more growth), and the 24 month Impact of Events Scale-Revised scale range from 0 - 88 (higher score = worse impact).</description>

They were asked to return to the hospital for a 1 hour EEG to monitor brain activity between 2-4 months of age, and complete surveys regarding development, epilepsy, and family impact prior to discharge from the NICU and at 12, 18, &amp; 24 months of age.</description>

        <description>The Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA FS) allowed us to compare the functional development between newborns who received short duration phenobarbital treatment and prolonged phenobarbital treatment. There were 50 questions with response options of 1(Never) to 4(all the time). WIDEA range was on a scale from 50-200 (At 24 months, the normal population mean score is 172±10).The higher the score the better the child's developmental function. Mean scores were calculated using data from any participant who completed surveys at 24 months.</description>

        <title>Impact of Treatment Duration on Parent and Family Well-being</title>
        <description>Surveys selected with the help of our Parent Partners were given at 12, 18, and 24 months to assess the impact of neonatal seizure treatment duration on parent and family quality of life and well-being. The 24 month data is presented, as they align with the primary outcome. The study team reviewed the HADS 24 month Anxiety and Depression Score range of possible scores from 0-21 (higher = more depressed/more anxious), the 24 month Transformed WHO Overall Quality of Life and General Health score range of scores 0-100 (higher=better quality of life), the 24 month Impact on Family Scale overall impact scale range from 15-60 (higher = more impact on family), the 24 month Post Traumatic Growth Inventory scale range from 0 -105 (higher = better/more growth), and the 24 month Impact of Events Scale-Revised scale range from 0 - 88 (higher score = worse impact).</description>
