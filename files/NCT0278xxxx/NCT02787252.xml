    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy of stimulation on over all pain relief&#xD;
      as reported in an initial cohort of 6 patients treated with the Freedom High Frequency Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Stimulator (SCS) System for low back and/or leg pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, short-term study for a maximum duration of 12 weeks in which 6&#xD;
      patients will receive a Freedom SCS System. Subjects will have chronic, intractable pain of&#xD;
      the trunk and/or lower limbs refractory to standard medical treatment; including unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral pain. Stimulators will be placed in the epidural space and over exiting nerve&#xD;
      roots at vertebrae levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Bilateral T9-T10 epidural; B. Bilateral L1-L4 epidural. All Patients will be treated below&#xD;
      perception threshold with High Frequency settings (10.000 Hz, 30 μs).&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is defined as the percentage of subjects who respond (50% average or more pain relief for back and leg pain) to SCS therapy at the end of 12 weeks post-implant of the system as compared to baseline with no increase in medication. The primary outcome will be measured with the VAS (100 mm line).</description>
