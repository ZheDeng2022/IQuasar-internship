    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to gain initial insights into the biologic and clinical&#xD;
      effects of Atezolizumab in patients with Asymptomatic Multiple Myeloma (AMM). The data may&#xD;
      provide novel insights into anti-PDL-1-induced immunologic changes, which could potentially&#xD;
      be relevant to its future development in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and other indications.&#xD;

             dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;

                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;

                  sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
