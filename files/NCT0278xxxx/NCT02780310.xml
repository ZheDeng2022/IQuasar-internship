  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drug lenvatinib&#xD;
      has on the patient and on adenoid cystic carcinoma. This type of cancer study is called a&#xD;
      phase II study. Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will shrink the cancer by at&#xD;
      least one-quarter compared to its present size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if lenvatinib is a&#xD;
      useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have pathologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
             Cancers arising from non-salivary gland primary sites are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially&#xD;
             curative surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;

             for bevacizumab- containing regimens) or radiotherapy with resolution of all&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or tolerable grade 2) or&#xD;
             back to baseline (except for alopecia, lymphopenia, or hypothyroidism). Any number of&#xD;
             prior therapies for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that&#xD;
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded&#xD;
             for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic&#xD;
             imaging study performed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (progression of&#xD;
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Note: This assessment will be performed by&#xD;
             the treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for&#xD;
             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are&#xD;
             acceptable. (If less than twenty unstained slides are available, the patient may be&#xD;
             able to participate at the discretion of the investigator.)&#xD;
