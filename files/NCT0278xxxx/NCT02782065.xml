    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research will be to evaluate the reliability and validity of the HASS&#xD;
      tool in a cohort of patients' ages 7 to18 years old against the gold standard of spirometry,&#xD;
      and in ages 2 to 6 against spirometry, if possible, and the most similar validated tool, the&#xD;
      PRAM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children aged 7-18 years will have a HASS score obtained by two providers. After scoring is&#xD;
      complete, a pulmonary technician will perform the spirometry test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 2 to 6 years old will concurrently (but separately) have their asthma severity&#xD;
      graded by 2 individual measurers using the HASS tool and the PRAM tool. If consented to&#xD;
      perform spirometry, this test will be performed after the tool(s) scores have been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spirometry tests will be interpreted by a board-certified pediatric pulmonologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used for preliminary analysis to describe the sample&#xD;
      characteristics, outliers, and representativeness of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1. To describe the inter-rater reliability for the HASS as scored by 2 individual&#xD;
      health care providers Data Analysis 1. Use of an overall percentage of agreement, weighted&#xD;
      and unweighted kappa and the intraclass correlation coefficient will show the inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability of the HASS tool. For each measure, percent agreement between raters and Cohen's&#xD;
      kappa statistic (rater agreement adjusted for chance agreement) will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2. To evaluate construct validity of the HASS tool in a cohort of patients' ages&#xD;
      7 to18 years old as compared to forced expiratory volume through spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis 2. Treating the outcomes as continuous, a correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      computed for HASS and %Forced Expiratory Volume 1. Sub-analyses will also be performed by age&#xD;
      group and by %Forced Expiratory Volume1 severity level to see whether the correlation of HASS&#xD;
      and %Forced Expiratory Volume1 is consistent across age and asthma severity strata. Treating&#xD;
      the outcomes as categorical, if the HASS and %Forced Expiratory Volume1 are each categorized&#xD;
      into three levels (mild, moderate, severe), then the investigator could classify each of the&#xD;
      nine cells of a 3 by 3 table (HASS X %Forced Expiratory Volume1) as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. concordant (three cells; complete agreement: both tests say 'Severe', for instance),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. discordant (four cells; e.g. one test says Moderate while the other say Mild) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. grossly discordant (two cells; one test says Severe when the other says Mild). For the&#xD;
           Receiver Operating Curve analysis, the Forced Expiratory Volume will be dichotomized as&#xD;
           Severe (%Forced Expiratory Volume1&lt;60% predicted) versus Less Severe (%Forced Expiratory&#xD;
           Volume1â‰¥60% predicted). In analyzing these data, the correlation (continuous), 3 by 3&#xD;
           table (categorical), and Receiver Operating Curve (dichotomous %Forced Expiratory&#xD;
           Volume1) treatments will be presented, with the continuous result considered primary. A&#xD;
           high level of agreement is expected between the HASS and the spirometry severity score&#xD;
           to make the case that the HASS can be used in place of the %Forced Expiratory Volume1&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 3. To evaluate construct validity of the HASS tool in a cohort of patients'&#xD;
      ages 2 to 6 years old as compared to forced expiratory volume through spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis 3. Treating the outcomes as continuous, a correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      computed for HASS and %Forced Expiratory Volume1. Treating the outcomes as categorical, if&#xD;
      the HASS and %Forced Expiratory Volume1 are each categorized into three levels (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe), then the investigator could classify each of the nine cells of a 3 by 3&#xD;
      table (HASS X %Forced Expiratory Volume1) as concordant, discordant or grossly discordant (as&#xD;
      described in Data Analysis 2). An adequate level of observed agreement would be 80% of&#xD;
      observations in agreement cells, 18% discordant, and 2% in grossly discordant cells. In&#xD;
      analyzing these data, both the correlation (continuous) and 3 by 3 table (categorical)&#xD;
      treatments will be presented, with the continuous result considered primary. A high level of&#xD;
      agreement is expected between the HASS and the spirometry severity score to make the case&#xD;
      that the HASS can be used in place of the spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 4. To evaluate construct validity of the HASS tool in a cohort of patients'&#xD;
      ages 2 to 6 years old as compared to the Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) Data&#xD;
      Analysis 4. Treating the outcomes as continuous, a correlation coefficient will be computed&#xD;
      for HASS and PRAM. If the HASS and PRAM are each categorized into three levels (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe), then the investigator could classify each of the nine cells of a 3 by 3&#xD;
      table (HASS X PRAM) as either concordant, discordant, or grossly discordant (as described in&#xD;
      Data Analysis 2). An adequate level of observed agreement would be 80% of observations in&#xD;
      agreement cells, 18% discordant, and 2% in grossly discordant cells.&#xD;
