    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm unblinded prospective study of the safety of pancreatic&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with unresectable, borderline&#xD;
      resectable, or recurrent pancreatic/periampullary cancers who have previously undergone&#xD;
      treatment with chemotherapy, surgery, photodynamic therapy, conventionally fractionated&#xD;
      radiation treatment, or any combination of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To estimate rates of acute (within 3 months of treatment) grade 3 or greater&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity in patients treated with Linac-based SBRT for&#xD;
      pancreatic or periampullary cancers who have previously received other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate rates of late (&gt; 3 months after treatment) grade 2 gastritis, enteritis,&#xD;
           fistula, and ulcer, or any other grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity in&#xD;
           patients treated with Linac-based SBRT for pancreatic or periampullary cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate rates of local progression, overall survival, metastasis-free survival, and&#xD;
           progression-free survival in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancers treated&#xD;
           with fractionated Linac-based SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of Linac-based SBRT to provide pain control in patients with&#xD;
           pain related to a pancreatic or periampullary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate quality of life in patients undergoing treatment with Linac-based SBRT for&#xD;
           pancreatic or periampullary cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive 5 fractions of 5 gray (Gy) or 6.6 Gy delivered over a five-day period&#xD;
      based on whether or not they have received prior radiation therapy to the pancreatic region.&#xD;
      Treatment may be delivered over 2 weeks, provided that the patient receives at least 2&#xD;
      fractions per week. Initial patient positioning will be based on volumetric kV (cone-beam&#xD;
      computerized tomography) imaging with shifts to bony anatomy as appropriate. Orthogonal kV/MV&#xD;
      or kV/kV projection imaging will be used to verify the location of the fiducials prior to&#xD;
      delivery of the first treatment beam. A secondary shift based on the location of fiducials&#xD;
      may be utilized, as indicated by the position of the fiducials. For free-breathing&#xD;
      treatments, kV fluoroscopic images should be obtained to confirm the anticipated position of&#xD;
      these fiducials during the entire respiratory cycle. Active monitoring of treatment delivery&#xD;
      accuracy will be accomplished using kV and/or MV projection imaging, either immediately&#xD;
      before or during all (or a subset of) treatment fields. Patient-specific dosimetric quality&#xD;
      assurance (QA) will be performed as per standard practice in the Department of Radiation&#xD;
      Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine.&#xD;

             the majority of the histopathologic specimen must be identified as adenocarcinoma as&#xD;
             opposed to another histologic subtype. In patients with a diagnosis of recurrent&#xD;
             disease (based on radiographic progression and/or rising CA19-9 levels) and a history&#xD;
             of a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or the ampulla of Vater, repeat&#xD;
             biopsy of the recurrence site is not required for participation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pancreatic or periampullary tumors must be less than 8.0 cm in greatest axial&#xD;
             dimension at the time of treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with any combination of surgical resection and&#xD;
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant conventional chemoradiation therapy for resectable disease or&#xD;
             conventional chemoradiation as definitive treatment for unresectable or borderline&#xD;
             resectable disease are eligible for the study, provided that at least 180 days have&#xD;
             elapsed since completing any previous radiation treatment. Patients who have been&#xD;
             receiving continued chemotherapy following their initial radiation treatment are&#xD;
             eligible regardless of when the most recent chemotherapy was received. Those patients&#xD;
             who have received prior radiation therapy will constitute Cohort A and will receive&#xD;
             stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) as 5 gray (Gy) x 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not previously undergone radiation therapy can have a history of&#xD;
             treatment with either chemotherapy (for unresectable/borderline resectable disease) or&#xD;
             any combination of surgery and chemotherapy (for resectable disease). Patients with no&#xD;
             history of prior radiation treatment will constitute Cohort B and will receive SBRT as&#xD;
             6.6 Gy x 5. Please note that patients must have received at least two cycles of&#xD;
             chemotherapy (with selection of drugs at the discretion of the treating oncologist)&#xD;
             before SBRT treatment on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acceptable organ and marrow function as defined below (within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             radiotherapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/Î¼L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500Î¼L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/Î¼L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin â‰¤1.5x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST(SGOT))/Alanine transaminase (ALT(SGPT)) &lt;2.5x&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine â‰¤ institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance &gt;60&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radio-opaque markers must be present within the tumor bed. In patients who have&#xD;
             undergone surgical resection, radio-opaque surgical clips within the tumor bed can be&#xD;
             used as fiducials. Patients without surgical clips in the tumor bed must be able to&#xD;
             have fiducials placed endoscopically, laparoscopically, or through a CT- or&#xD;
             ultrasound-guided technique. If not, the tumor must be posterior and adjacent to the&#xD;
             aorta, and treatment will only be permitted at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (or infections requiring systemic antibiotic treatment), active upper GI&#xD;
             ulceration or hemorrhage, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, non-invasive bladder&#xD;
             cancer, early stage prostate cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with&#xD;
             a previous non-pancreatic, non-periampullary malignancy without evidence of disease&#xD;
             for &gt; 5 years will be allowed to enter the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded as are women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of&#xD;
             the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are not post-menopausal (as defined in Appendix III) and have a positive&#xD;
             urine or serum pregnancy test or refuse to take a pregnancy test.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of gross tumor invasion into the lumen of the stomach or small&#xD;
             bowel are not eligible; if imaging suggests luminal invasion of tumor, this must be&#xD;
             ruled out endoscopically before the patient can be enrolled on study.&#xD;
