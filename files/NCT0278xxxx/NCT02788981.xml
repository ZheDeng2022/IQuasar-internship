  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial of nab-paclitaxel with&#xD;
      or without mifepristone for advanced, glucocorticoid receptor-positive, triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer. A total of 64 patients will receive nab-paclitaxel. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either receive placebo or to receive mifepristone daily on the day prior to and&#xD;
      day of each dose of nab-paclitaxel. Patients will be enrolled over 12 months and followed for&#xD;
      12 months following completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To expand and follow up on the investigators understanding of a potential pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) interaction between nab-paclitaxel and mifepristone, investigators will perform PK&#xD;
      studies in the first 20 patients enrolled at pre-specified &quot;PK sites&quot;.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with nab-paclitaxel +&#xD;
      placebo and patients treated with nab-paclitaxel + mifepristone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To correlate percentage glucocorticoid receptor (GR) positivity in the most recent&#xD;
           metastatic tumor biopsy (or in primary tumor if only primary tumor is available) with&#xD;
           PFS in mifepristone and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To perform an exploratory assessment of overall response rate in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect information regarding overall survival in both treatment cohorts.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with stage&#xD;
             IV or unresectable stage III disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. To be&#xD;
             considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in&#xD;
             short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no&#xD;
             greater than 5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Triple-negative breast cancer (defined as estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone&#xD;
             receptor (PR) &lt;10% positive; HER2 0-1+ by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence&#xD;
             in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio &lt;2.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have tumor block or slides available for testing, and tumor must be&#xD;
             glucocorticoid receptor positive (defined as GR &gt;10% moderate to strong staining by&#xD;
             central lab). A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical or core needle biopsy&#xD;
             obtained from the primary tumor or from a metastasis and containing viable tumor&#xD;
             tissue is required for this evaluation. Fine needle aspirates or other alternative&#xD;
             cytology samples are not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and up to two prior chemotherapy for&#xD;
             metastatic or locally recurrent disease. No prior nab-paclitaxel or mifepristone&#xD;
             therapy for metastatic disease will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of Nab-Paclitaxel in combination with Mifepristone in patients &lt; 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin&lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt; 5 X ULN if bone&#xD;
                  mets are present&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  adequate renal function: creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of child-bearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who has not&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or who has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months prior to study enrollment) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Commit to abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use effective&#xD;
                  contraception without interruption beginning at least 28 days prior to starting&#xD;
                  protocol therapy and while on study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and agree to ongoing&#xD;
                  pregnancy testing during the study dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male subjects must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while&#xD;
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following&#xD;
             protocol discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must have &lt; Grade 2 pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (per CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they&#xD;
             have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known brain metastases will be eligible as long as they have completed&#xD;
             radiation to the brain, and have been off of corticosteroid therapy for at least 7&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to mifepristone or paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             mild infusion reactions with paclitaxel who were able to continue to receive&#xD;
             paclitaxel with corticosteroid premedication will be eligible to participate, as these&#xD;
             cases were likely related to cremaphor and not paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Mifepristone can both inhibit CYP3A4 and induce CYP3A4. Addition of mifepristone to a&#xD;
             pre-existing drug regimen may cause a mild and temporary increase in plasma drug&#xD;
             concentration of drugs with significant CYP3A4 metabolism. Medications that are strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,&#xD;
             primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort may decrease plasma&#xD;
             mifepristone levels. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medications are expected to cause the&#xD;
             largest increases in plasma mifepristone concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Mifepristone may increase the plasma drug concentration of concomitant medications&#xD;
             with metabolism mediated by CYP2C9/CYP2C8. Drugs with the largest increases will be&#xD;
             those whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C9/2C8 and include:&#xD;
             Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Mifepristone is an abortifacient&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with Mifepristone, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother wishes to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Mifepristone. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No history of long-term use of corticosteroids or concurrent short term use of&#xD;
             corticosteroids is allowed.&#xD;
