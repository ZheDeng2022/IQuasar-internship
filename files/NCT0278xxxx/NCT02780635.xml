  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In layperson's language state the purpose of the study in 3-5 sentences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has demonstrated that intimate partners can positively influence those with&#xD;
      PTSD to seek treatment. The investigators have preliminary evidence to demonstrate that&#xD;
      mobile apps, such as PTSD Coach can be helpful for those with PTSD, and the current study&#xD;
      will provide Veterans with PTSD and their partners with a mobile app designed to promote&#xD;
      engagement with evidence-based treatments for PTSD. The purpose of this PILOT study is to&#xD;
      evaluate methods for delivering a couples-based intervention to reduce PTSD symptoms and&#xD;
      improve relationship quality in Veterans and their intimate partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) State what the Investigator(s) hope to learn from the study. Include an assessment of the&#xD;
      importance of this new knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding ways to improve the public health impact of public-facing, evidence-based&#xD;
      mobile apps is critical. This study will test a low-cost, &quot;high-touch&quot; approach to improving&#xD;
      the outcomes associated with use of the PTSD Coach and PTSD Family Coach mobile apps,which&#xD;
      are already available to the general public and used by over 55,000 new users per year.This&#xD;
      study will test whether the involvement of an intimate partner in the use of a mobile app for&#xD;
      PTSD will result in changes in how the mobile apps are used and in relationship quality and&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms over time. Additionally, this study will test whether the addition of a&#xD;
      discussion board can improve engagement with the apps and/or outcomes. The study will also&#xD;
      provide useful qualitative data that can inform the development of subsequent dyadic&#xD;
      interventions using mobile technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project. (i.e. purpose of study is to&#xD;
      test efficacy of investigational device in individuals with specific condition; purpose of&#xD;
      study is to examine specific behavioral traits in humans in classroom or other environment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how Veterans and their partners interact with&#xD;
      evidence-based mobile apps for improving PTSD symptoms.&#xD;

      Please SUMMARIZE the research procedures, screening through closeout, which the human subject&#xD;
      will undergo. Refer to sections in the protocol attached in section 16, BUT do not copy the&#xD;
      clinical protocol. Be clear on what is to be done for research and what is part of standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the study team will attempt to recruit 100 couples in which one partner is a&#xD;
      community-dwelling Veteran with significant, untreated symptoms of posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms. All participants will receive access to a mobile app designed by&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs (VA). Veterans will receive access to the PTSD Coach mobile app, and their&#xD;
      partners will receive access to the PTSD Family Coach mobile app. Potential participants will&#xD;
      be identified from targeted Facebook and other social media outreach efforts. Those who view&#xD;
      an advertisement will be directed to the study website, hosted by Stanford's Qualtrics&#xD;
      domain, where they will be provided with information about the study, screened for&#xD;
      eligibility,and then provided with an informed consent document. Upon completing the informed&#xD;
      consent process, participants will be asked to complete a baseline survey and then to share&#xD;
      information about the study with their partner. Veterans and their partners will be connected&#xD;
      only by a subject identification number. After completing the baseline survey, all&#xD;
      participants will then be encouraged to use the PTSD Coach app or the PTSD Family Coach app&#xD;
      as often or as little as they like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using random assignment, half of the dyads will also be provided with a) access to a secure,&#xD;
      confidential discussion board, where they will be able to post new messages and respond to&#xD;
      messages posted by others and b) mailed information packages that contain information about&#xD;
      coping with PTSD, coping with a spouse's PTSD, and strategies for managing relationship&#xD;
      distress associated with PTSD. Those dyads who do not receive access to the discussion board&#xD;
      will still receive access to the mobile apps but will not have access to either the&#xD;
      discussion board or the mailed information packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be evaluated using objective measures of engagement with the apps, changes in&#xD;
      attitudes toward use of mental health services, relationship quality,changes over time in&#xD;
      PTSD and stress symptoms, and qualitative experiences associated with use of the apps.&#xD;
      Barriers to implementation and identified strategies for overcoming barriers will be&#xD;
      catalogued over the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of PTSD Coach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a link to download PTSD Coach (freely available on iTunes&#xD;
      and Google Play Stores or through myvaapps.com) and brief recommendations for how to use the&#xD;
      app over the subsequent 8 weeks of the study. PTSD Coach is a mobile app for iPhone and&#xD;
      Android, developed by the VA National Center for PTSD in collaboration with National Center&#xD;
      for Telehealth and Technology (T2) and the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient Care&#xD;
      Services. PTSD Coach was initially developed and launched in March, 2011, with usability and&#xD;
      focus group data derived from a sample of 80 veterans with PTSD, many of whom were explicitly&#xD;
      requesting &quot;something I can do when I'm stressed, wherever I am.&quot; The app provides 4 primary&#xD;
      treatment components: 1) psychoeducation about PTSD, 2) self-monitoring tools, 3) immediate&#xD;
      tools for symptom management, and 4) immediate access to public and private support&#xD;
      resources. The psychoeducation component provides text and audio informational topics about&#xD;
      PTSD, with an emphasis on normalizing the condition, and information about ways to begin&#xD;
      engaging with mental health services. The self-monitoring tools component administers the&#xD;
      PTSD Checklist Civilian version (PCL-C), provides tailored feedback on symptom level and&#xD;
      changes since the last assessment, and allows and encourages users to create reminders to&#xD;
      self-monitor their symptom levels. The symptom management component provides specific tools&#xD;
      tailored for managing reminders of trauma, avoiding trauma-related triggers, overcoming&#xD;
      feelings of being disconnected from others, overcoming feelings of being disconnected from&#xD;
      reality,improving sleep, and reducing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worry, anxiety, or&#xD;
      anger.These tools include audio-based relaxation exercises, guided deep breathing, making&#xD;
      plans for social activities, engaging in pleasant activities, tips for distraction from&#xD;
      unpleasant sensations, and other simple exercises. The support component encourages users to&#xD;
      create a personal support network (from their phone's contact list) and provides users with&#xD;
      information about additional resources for veterans (e.g., crisis and help-line numbers).&#xD;
      Evidence for PTSD Coach is described in detail in the Preliminary Studies section. In brief,&#xD;
      use of PTSD Coach alone is associated with significant within-session changes in ratings&#xD;
      ofdistress43 and demonstrates a small but clinically meaningful effect on PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms(d=.30, f~.15) relative to a wait-list control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners will be provided with a link to the PTSD Family Coach app. PTSD Family Coach&#xD;
      provides four main intervention elements: Learn, Support, Tools for Managing Stress, and&#xD;
      Self-Assessment. The &quot;Learn&quot; section of the app provides extensive, mobile-friendly&#xD;
      information about the basics of PTSD and how to best support their loved one with PTSD, how&#xD;
      to take care of on self while living with someone with PTSD, how to take care of&#xD;
      relationships with children and with one's partner, and how to most effectively encourage&#xD;
      their partner to engage in professional care. The &quot;Support&quot; section of the app provides&#xD;
      information about how to get immediate crisis help (e.g., for medical emergencies, suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts, or threats of violence), how to get help in talking with a partner about PTSD, how&#xD;
      to find family-specific services, resources for parents and children, and resources for the&#xD;
      Veteran. The &quot;Tools for Managing Stress&quot; section of the app contains interactive relaxation&#xD;
      tools, cognitive strategies for managing stress, mindfulness exercises, encouragement to&#xD;
      engage in pleasant activities and to engage in social activities, safety-planning tools, tips&#xD;
      for good sleep hygiene, and grounding techniques. Finally, the &quot;Self-Assessment&quot; section of&#xD;
      the app provides tools for self-monitoring stress symptoms and tracking these symptoms over&#xD;
      time.Description of the Discussion Boards to be used in this study:All discussion boards will&#xD;
      be privately hosted on the secure https://www.health-space.net sight maintained by the PI and&#xD;
      can only be accessed with a unique API key and valid invitation code stored in the mobile&#xD;
      app, so that only those who have been provided with both a research version of the study app&#xD;
      and a valid invitation code will be able to access the discussion board. There will be 2&#xD;
      unique discussion boards: one for family members (i.e., accessed from the PTSD Family Coach&#xD;
      app) and one for Veterans (i.e., accessed from the PTSD Coach app). Those who choose to post&#xD;
      a message to the discussion board will be identified only by their invitation code (a random&#xD;
      string of 6 characters and/or digits), and all messages will be reviewed by the investigators&#xD;
      in order to ensure safety and appropriateness before they can be viewed by any other&#xD;
      participants. As soon as a message is posted, an automated email will be sent to each of the&#xD;
      investigators, who will be asked to log-in to a secure website in order to approve the&#xD;
      submitted message so that it can viewed by other participants. Should any safety or&#xD;
      privacy-related concerns arise, or the message is deemed inappropriate for any other reason,&#xD;
      the participant who submitted the message will be contacted and provided with additional&#xD;
      information necessary for either obtaining additional assistance or modifying the message to&#xD;
      make more appropriate or private as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, each participant will be mailed an information packet (i.e., 4&#xD;
      packets in total for each participant) that will provide additional information on managing&#xD;
      stress and conflict in relationships,increasing positive interactions in the relationship,&#xD;
      problem-solving in relationships, and increasing positive communication in relationships.&#xD;
      Information packets will contain general information, a list of available resources that can&#xD;
      provide additional information, and suggested exercises to practice with their partner or by&#xD;
      using the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten weeks after being randomized, Veterans and their partners will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      follow-up survey using the Qualtrics web survey tool. Those participants who are willing to&#xD;
      take part in a telephone interview will be contacted by telephone to participate in a&#xD;
      30-minute qualitative interview about the app, communication with their partner about PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms,and suggestions for optimizing partner-based interventions using mobile apps.&#xD;
