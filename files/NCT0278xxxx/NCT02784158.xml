  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide brigatinib for those patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      and/or metastatic patients with ALK+ NSCLC on an expanded access basis due to their inability&#xD;
      to meet eligibility criteria for on-going recruiting trials, inability to participate in&#xD;
      other clinical trials (e.g., poor performance status, lack of geographic proximity), or&#xD;
      because other medical interventions are not considered appropriate or acceptable.&#xD;

    <description>Brigatinib will be administered orally to eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who are resistant or intolerant to a prior ALK inhibitor at a dose of 180 mg QD with a 7 day lead-in at 90 mg QD, continuously, with or without food.</description>
