      The purpose of this study is to see whether it is possible to give 8 doses of a combination&#xD;
      of chemotherapy called FOLFIRINOX before surgery in subjects whose pancreas cancer can be&#xD;
      removed with surgery.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the percentage of pancreatic cancer patients able to complete&#xD;
      the full 4 months of preoperative chemotherapy and undergo a resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the percentage of patients able to complete all therapy, including&#xD;
           preoperative chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess treatment-related toxicity during preoperative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess intra-operative and post-operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the histopathologic (R0/R1) resection rate after preoperative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine disease free survival (DFS) for patients who undergo resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS) for all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival (OS) from the date of first treatment&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Resectable primary tumor of the head, body or tail of the pancreas defined per NCCN&#xD;
             Guidelines version 2.2015:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No extra-pancreatic disease, aside from lymphadenopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No arterial tumor contact (celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, or common&#xD;
                  hepatic artery)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No tumor contact with the superior mesenteric vein or portal vein or ≤ 180°&#xD;
                  contact without vein contour irregularity&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmation of resectability by surgical oncology consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No previous therapy for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Short removable metal stents rather than plastic stents are strongly encouraged but&#xD;
             not required for palliation of initial obstructive jaundice&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No CVA within 6 months, no MI within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of mFOLFIRINOX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Negative pregnancy test in females of reproductive age&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Anticoagulation is permitted but patients may not be on warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/ per Cockroft-Gault equation for patients with&#xD;
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for pancreatic&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pathologic subtypes other than pure adenocarcinoma; acinar cell carcinoma, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancer, and mixed types are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with borderline resectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan or&#xD;
             oxaliplatin or to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, active liver disease including viral or non-viral hepatitis and cirrhosis,&#xD;
             chronic diarrhea or inflammatory disease of the colon or rectum, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. mFOLFIRINOX is a regimen containing more&#xD;
             than one chemotherapy agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with mFOLFIRINOX, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma&#xD;
             in-situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot;&#xD;
             malignancy if they have completed therapy and have no evidence of recurrence for at&#xD;
             least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Inflammatory bowel disease that is uncontrolled or on active treatment (Crohn's&#xD;
             disease, ulcerative colitis).&#xD;
