    <measure>Percentage of Accurately Identified Pre-treatment Photos</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Success is defined as at least 70% correct identification of pre-treatment images by two out of three reviewers.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through 12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of unanticipated device effects will be tabulated to assess safety of the device and applicator accessory (Crown Cooling Insert). Adverse event data is collected from the time of enrollment through the 12 week follow-up visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction with the treatment experience data will also be collected via a written questionnaire at the 12-week follow up visits. This questionnaire will be composed of 5-point Likert scale questions, as well as free-text responses. Subjects will be asked to determine overall satisfaction with the treatment. The choices will be: 1) very satisfied; 2) somewhat satisfied; 3) neither satisfied nor unsatisfied; 4) somewhat unsatisfied; 5) very unsatisfied.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Accurately Identified Pre-treatment Photos</title>
        <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Success is defined as at least 70% correct identification of pre-treatment images by two out of three reviewers.</description>
