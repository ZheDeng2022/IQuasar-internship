  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of esketamine nasal spray&#xD;
      in participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (the researchers and participants know the treatment the participant is&#xD;
      receiving) long-term extension study. The study will consist of 2 open-label Phases: 4-week&#xD;
      Induction phase (if applicable) and Open-Label Optimization/Maintenance phase (variable).&#xD;
      Participants will enter the study Induction Phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064),&#xD;
      ESKETINTRD3002 (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868), ESKETINTRD3005 (NCT02422186) and&#xD;
      ESKETINTRD3006 (US sites only). Participants will enter the study Open-Label&#xD;
      Optimization/Maintenance phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064), ESKETINTRD3002&#xD;
      (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868) (if appropriate at week 16) or ESKETINTRD3006 (US&#xD;
      sites only). In the Open-Label Induction Phase, participants will self-administer&#xD;
      flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray. During first 4 weeks in Optimization/Maintenance Phase&#xD;
      responder participants from the induction phase of study 54135419TRD3008, will continue on&#xD;
      the same dose of esketamine nasal spray from the induction phase and have a weekly intranasal&#xD;
      treatment session frequency. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from&#xD;
      study ESKETINTRD3005 will also have a weekly intranasal treatment session frequency. However,&#xD;
      as the ESKETINTRD3005 intranasal study medication is blinded at the time of entry into the&#xD;
      current study, the dose of esketamine nasal spray will be administered as outlined in&#xD;
      protocol. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from study ESKETINTRD3003&#xD;
      (Direct Entry) or ESKETINTRD3004 who were ongoing in the Optimization, Maintenance, or&#xD;
      Optimization/Maintenance phase, respectively, will have the option to have their current&#xD;
      intranasal dosing frequency adjusted at the time of entry into 54135419TRD3008 study and&#xD;
      should remain on the selected frequency from week 1 to week 4. A one-time dose change will be&#xD;
      permitted at study entry. After 4 weeks, esketamine nasal spray treatment sessions will be&#xD;
      individualized to either once weekly or once every other week at the fixed 2-week interval&#xD;
      (based on clinical global impression - severity [CGI-S] performed at that visit), and every 4&#xD;
      weeks for participants dosed at the 4 week interval. Participants safety will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From the start of Induction Phase to End of Optimization/Maintenance Phase (approximately 5 years 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). Lower scores indicate worsening. EQ-5D scores include EQ-5D valuation index score (a weighted scoring of the 5 dimension scores with a possible range from 0 to 1) and EQ5D descriptive system scores (five scores reflecting each of the 5 EQ-5D health dimensions ranging from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [incapacity]).</description>

    <description>EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20 centimeter (cm) vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (perfect health. A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.</description>

    <description>The QLDS is a disease specific PRO designed to assess health related quality of life in patients with Major Depressive Disorder. The instrument has a recall period of &quot;at the moment&quot;, contains 34-items with &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; response options and takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The score range is from 0 (good quality of life) to 34 (very poor quality of life).</description>
