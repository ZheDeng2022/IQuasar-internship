  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with at least two teeth with dentinal hypersensitivity and who meet the study&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled onto this double blind, randomised, parallel, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. After enrolment, suitable subjects will use a fluoride toothpaste for 4 weeks (wash&#xD;
      out period). Baseline dentine hypersensitivity assessments will be conducted using tactile&#xD;
      stimuli, air blast, and VAS methods. Tactile methods of assessment will include use of the&#xD;
      Yeaple Probe and the Jay Sensitivity Sensor probe. Air blast assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      using the Schiff cold air sensitivity scale. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed at four defined time points during the study. The baseline&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted on the two teeth identified during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the baseline assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to product.&#xD;
      Dentinal hypersensitivity assessments will be repeated after 18, 28 and 56 days of product&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
