      The aim of this study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the marginal bone&#xD;
      level changes when partially edentulous patients, treated with implants, received a&#xD;
      multiunits screw retained fixed dental prosthesis with a Co/Cr milled framework with an&#xD;
      Internal or External connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Soft tissue status by assessment of bleeding on probing (BoP) and probing pocket depth&#xD;
           (PPD) at baseline and after 1,3,5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prosthetic survival rates including screw or abutment loosening, framework or veneer&#xD;
           fractures.&#xD;

      A randomized pilot study is designed to determine marginal bone changes between patients&#xD;
      treated with a milled framework in Co/Cr if the connection is Internal or External for the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of a partially edentulous area with a multiunit screw retained bridge. The&#xD;
      investigation will be performed in one clinical centre affiliated to the Department of oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgery, Faculty of Odontology, Malmö University . In this center the&#xD;
      clinician and the examiner will be the same person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a screening examination, subjects who will meet the inclusion criteria, will sign&#xD;
      the Informed Consent and will be enrolled in the study. The period of patient enrollment will&#xD;
      begin on October 1st 2015 and ends September 31st 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized with a method based on the use of sealed opaque envelopes.&#xD;
      The cases will be assigned to two different treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- Co/Cr milled framework with internal connection (Test) Group B- Co/Cr milled&#xD;
      framework with external connection (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pre-treatment Patient data, medical history, clinical and radiographic examination will be&#xD;
      recorded for each patient. Clinical photographs will be taken in frontal, occlusal and&#xD;
      lateral projections Periodontal, endodontic and open caries lesions will be treated prior to&#xD;
      implant installation. All patients will receive careful oral hygiene instructions and&#xD;
      training in self-performed plaque control measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopantomogram at constant magnification and CT scan computed exams will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaster models and diagnostic wax-up will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -First Surgical Phase (Implant Installation) The patient will receive antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      (Amoxicillin 1gr) one hour prior to surgery and after the completion of implant installation&#xD;
      until suture removal with 1gr three times a day. (If the patient is allergic to amoxicillin&#xD;
      the examiner prescribes antibiotics at his own discretion at the same posology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment will be performed under local anaesthesia. In case of remaining teeth,&#xD;
      they will be extracted with conventional technique before implants' placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants will be placed according to the guidelines described in the Astra Tech Osseospeed&#xD;
      EV® manual &quot;Surgical procedures&quot;, using a two-stage protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant spinning during the positioning of the cover screw will be registered as positive, if&#xD;
      present, or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation will be finalized by a careful adaption of the flaps by means of an accurate&#xD;
      suture in order to obtain a full periosteal coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoral clinical photographs before, during and after surgery will be taken.&#xD;
      -Post-operative care The patients will be instructed to rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12%&#xD;
      mouthrinse and will be told to rinse with the antiseptic solution three times a day for 2&#xD;
      weeks. The patients will be advised to take NSAIDs for pain relief at their own discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid and semisolid food will be prescribed for the first post-operative week, after which&#xD;
      the sutures will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the operation the denture will be properly relined until the second stage&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be controlled at third and sixth weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Prosthetic procedures After eight weeks (+ 2) of implants healing a second stage surgery&#xD;
      will be applied and Healing Abutment will be performed groups A while a Uni Abutment 33°&#xD;
      connection procedure will be performed. In group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression with a customized spoon and Impregum material will be taken after one week from&#xD;
      the second surgery and prosthetic procedure will be performed according to the Atlantis-Isus&#xD;
      Dentsply Astra-tech prosthetic manual recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 weeks (+ 2) from impression the definitive fixed dental prostheses screw retained&#xD;
      multiunits bridge will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prosthesis will be made to accomplish the normal hygienic procedures. All prosthetic&#xD;
      procedures will be made in accordance to the Astra Tech procedures &amp; products manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of bridge cantilevers will be duly calculated to minimize implant overloading&#xD;
      according to the Atlantis-Isus recommendations for both group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Post-prosthetic measurements Clinical measurements Clinical examinations will be performed&#xD;
      immediately following the installation of the definitive prosthesis (Baseline-Loading) and&#xD;
      after 1, 3, and 5 years. In particular, plaque and soft-tissue inflammation will be&#xD;
      registered. Clinical photographs will be taken at each interval point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque: the presence of plaque will be scored at each implant site as well as at level of the&#xD;
      remaining teeth on four surfaces (buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal). The mean&#xD;
      percentage of plaque harboring surfaces will be calculated using the case as the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft-tissue inflammation: the presence of soft-tissue inflammation (bleeding on probing) will&#xD;
      be assessed on buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial, distal aspects of each implant. The mean&#xD;
      percentage of inflamed sites will be calculated using the case as the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Radiographic measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-apical radiographs will be taken at prosthesis insertion (Baseline) and after 1, 3, and&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographs will be taken with an X-ray apparatus supplied with a long cone by the&#xD;
      examiner each visiting time. Rinn centrators will be used to ensure reproducibility in the&#xD;
      measurement of marginal bone level change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic images will be analysed at the Department of Radiology of Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      Academy, Gothenburg University by experienced radiologists who will be otherwise not involved&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be presented by appropriate descriptive and inferential statistic. Demographic&#xD;
      and other baseline characteristics will be presented by means of descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented by means of number of observations (N), minimum (min),&#xD;
      median, maximum (max), mean and standard deviation (std). Discrete variables will be&#xD;
      presented by frequency and percentage.&#xD;
