  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although treatments significantly increase the life expectancy of cancer patients, their&#xD;
      quality of life is more or less reduced. The development of supportive care, such as physical&#xD;
      activity, is one of the tools that should be promoted to maintain quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      treatment side effects, including fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was developed to understand the different biopsychosocial effects of a physical&#xD;
      activity program carried out with patients suffering from various types of cancers, and to&#xD;
      facilitate and improve the implementation of this type of activity in health care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study randomized, controlled, cross-over intervention evaluating a 12-week supervised and&#xD;
      adapted physical activity program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were assigned to one of two groups: Group A which first follows a 12-week&#xD;
      physical activity program, then undergoes usual care for 12 additional weeks, or Group B,&#xD;
      which continues usual care for 12 weeks (control group) and then starts the physical activity&#xD;
      program for 12 additional weeks. Quality of life (with questionnaires for 2 groups) ,&#xD;
      well-being, fatigue, physical capacity, leptin concentration, goal setting and level of&#xD;
      physical activity are evaluated during this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By understanding the multidimensional effects of a physical activity program for various&#xD;
      cancer types, depending on the time of proposing the program, by evaluating the correlations&#xD;
      among all these variables, and by evaluating long-term effects, the IPCAPA study contributes&#xD;
      to identifying the physical activity program which will be effective, viable and feasible for&#xD;
      all patients undergoing chemotherapy, whatever the type of cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in the world, with an estimated incidence of&#xD;
      14.1 million per year (2012) in the world, and 355,000 in France. Despite an increase in&#xD;
      survival rates after cancer treatment, the psychological impact of the diagnosis and the&#xD;
      aggressiveness of treatments such as chemotherapy tend to significantly decrease the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients during and after cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helping patients to support regular treatment is a crucial point in increasing compliance&#xD;
      with treatment and thus increasing the cure rate, and many supportive care have been&#xD;
      developed and implemented. Physical activity, now regarded as a non-drug therapy, provides&#xD;
      many benefits, both in tertiary and secondary prevention during cancer treatment. Many&#xD;
      studies have shown a decrease in mortality with physical activity during and after treatment,&#xD;
      especially for breast, colon and prostate cancer. Regular physical activity during treatment&#xD;
      increases patients' quality of life, for many types of cancer. The prevalence of fatigue&#xD;
      during cancer is well described, as well as the need to effectively treat cancer related&#xD;
      fatigue in order to enable patients to better withstand their treatment. Within the last&#xD;
      decade, it has been pointed out that physical activity is one of the most efficient ways to&#xD;
      combat cancer related fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a psychological point of view, physical activity can decrease anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      stress, and can also increase self-esteem, perceived control, and overall mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise physiologically increases physical capacity, strength, endurance and flexibility,&#xD;
      and decreases physical symptoms such as pain and nausea. Biologically, physical activity&#xD;
      often results in beneficial changes in the circulation level of adiponectin, leptin, insulin,&#xD;
      and C-reactive protein, especially during breast, prostate and gastric cancer. Overall,&#xD;
      physical activity during cancer treatment results in improvement in general quality of life,&#xD;
      including mental, physical and social dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although physical activity during cancer treatment is known to induce many benefits,&#xD;
      depending on the cancer and the type of treatment, it is difficult to clearly investigate the&#xD;
      effects of physical activity during cancer and how they interact or are sequential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the close relationship between the psychological and physiological&#xD;
      aspects might allow us to better understand the effects of physical activity during cancer.&#xD;
      Exercise programs used during cancer treatment vary from one study to another in their&#xD;
      duration, intensity and frequency. Furthermore, not all patients are included and not all&#xD;
      types of cancers and treatment are considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, named Institut Paoli Calmettes Adapted Physical Activity, was developed to&#xD;
      understand the different biopsychosocial effects of a physical activity program carried out&#xD;
      with patients suffering from various type of cancers, and to facilitate and improve the&#xD;
      implementation of this type of activity in health care facilities.&#xD;
