      Compare serum tryptase levels of premature babies (&lt;37 weeks of amenorrhea) to children born&#xD;
      at full term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the evolution of serum tryptase levels in premature babies(&lt;37 weeks of amenorrhea).&#xD;
      Study the relationship between the onset of infectious complications, mainly the type of&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis seen in premature babies (&lt;37 weeks of amenorrhea) and the&#xD;
      evolution profile of serum tryptase levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It seems appropriate to believe that prematurity associated or not with a genetic-related&#xD;
      sensitivity, involving several signaling pathways, makes children more vulnerable to&#xD;
      different environmental, infectious factors that could trigger the different pathologies of&#xD;
      premature babies. Mast cell, via its mediators, seems to play a key role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of serum tryptase levels which is easily accessible and the work by Vitte let us&#xD;
      imagine that the younger the child, the greater the mast cell expression, thus opening a&#xD;
      capital pathway in the comprehension of immune system phenomena in premature babies and&#xD;
      investigators can hope that by performing regular workups of serum tryptase levels,&#xD;
      investigators could validate that some premature babies will express this activity in a more&#xD;
      important manner. The relationship to eventual pathological phenomena such as necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis, but also bronchopulmonary dysplasia could then be highlighted.&#xD;
