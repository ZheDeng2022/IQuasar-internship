  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to know about the quality of life of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma who are being treated with sunitinib, pazopanib or sorafenib, and who&#xD;
      suffer from fatigue and hand-foot syndrome, with personal inter-variability, and to explore&#xD;
      measures that can be taken in terms of both everyday lifestyle and treatment to mitigate or&#xD;
      cure such side effects that affect patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicentre, observational study in patients with metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (mRCC) receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as first-line treatment according to&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, designed to evaluate the incidence of fatigue and hand-foot&#xD;
      syndrome in order to determine how these affect the baseline characteristics of the patient&#xD;
      and his/her disease (age, gender, baseline status, tumour histology, etc.) and the patient's&#xD;
      lifestyle as such side effects develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory analysis will be performed of measures that clinicians may adopt to improve&#xD;
      patients' quality of life with regards to daytime naps, medication administration time,&#xD;
      off-treatment periods, dose reductions and treatment breaks.&#xD;

          <title>Heng Prognostic Criteria</title>
          <description>Heng prognostic model identified Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of less than (&lt;) 80 at treatment initiation, period from mRCC diagnosis to previous systemic treatment &lt;1 year, anemia, hypercalcemia, neutrophilia, thrombocythemia as independent poor prognostic factors. Participants classified into prognosis group: favorable(0 factor), intermediate(1-2 factors), poor(3-6 factors). KPS measured ability of participants with cancer to perform ordinary tasks. KPS scores range: 0 percent (%) (dead) to 100% (normal, no complaint). High score=participant better able to carry out daily activities.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>FACIT-F was a 13-item questionnaire which assessed self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale based on their experience of fatigue during the past 7 days (0= not at all; 1= a little bit; 2= somewhat; 3= quite a bit; 4= very much). FACIT-F score was calculated by summing the 13 items (range 0 [not at all] to 52 [very much]); higher scores represented less fatigue and better status of participants.</description>

          <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score at Week 36</title>
          <description>FACIT-F was a 13-item questionnaire which assessed self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale based on their experience of fatigue during the past 7 days (0= not at all; 1= a little bit; 2= somewhat; 3= quite a bit; 4= very much). FACIT-F score was calculated by summing the 13 items (range 0 [not at all] to 52 [very much]); higher scores represented less fatigue and better status of participants.</description>

        <description>Best response was recorded from start of treatment with TKI until best complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or disease progression (DP) was achieved. RECIST v1.1, a) CR: disappearance of all lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (target lesions [TLs]) or non-target lesions (non-TLs) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm; normalization of tumor marker level for non-TLs; b) PR: &gt;=30% decrease in sum of diameter of all TLs, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters; c) DP: &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameter of all TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline measurement), sum must also be absolute increase of &gt;=5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non TLs. Appearance of at least 1 new lesion; d) SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in lesions to qualify for PD referring smallest sum diameter. Participant whose best response was not determined were classified as &quot;Undetermined&quot;.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Best Response Per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours Version 1.1. (RECIST v1.1)</title>
          <description>Best response was recorded from start of treatment with TKI until best complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or disease progression (DP) was achieved. RECIST v1.1, a) CR: disappearance of all lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (target lesions [TLs]) or non-target lesions (non-TLs) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm; normalization of tumor marker level for non-TLs; b) PR: &gt;=30% decrease in sum of diameter of all TLs, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters; c) DP: &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameter of all TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline measurement), sum must also be absolute increase of &gt;=5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non TLs. Appearance of at least 1 new lesion; d) SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in lesions to qualify for PD referring smallest sum diameter. Participant whose best response was not determined were classified as &quot;Undetermined&quot;.</description>

          <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per CTCAE version 4, Grade 1= mild AE; Grade 2= moderate AE; Grade 3= severe AE; Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5= death related to an AE. In this outcome measure number of participants with HFS event graded per CTCAE version 4.0 at Week 36 are reported.</description>
          <population>Analysis population included all eligible participants who were included in this study. Here, 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed' signifies participants with HFS event at Week 36.</population>
