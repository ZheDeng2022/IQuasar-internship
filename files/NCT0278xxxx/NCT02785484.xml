  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether constituent&#xD;
      disclosures on cigarette packs increase intentions to quit smoking. Previous studies have&#xD;
      been informative, but they have evaluated candidate graphic warnings, not constituent&#xD;
      disclosures. Furthermore, they typically expose participants to messages in controlled but&#xD;
      artificial experimental settings for a short period of time, using much lower frequency and&#xD;
      shorter duration of message exposure than found in the real world. This study addresses these&#xD;
      issues by evaluating the impact of constituent disclosures by randomly assigning smokers to&#xD;
      have their cigarette packs labeled with constituent disclosure messages or cigarette butt&#xD;
      littering messages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Federal law requires the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to disseminate information&#xD;
      about tobacco constituents. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act grants&#xD;
      FDA broad authority to regulate tobacco products, including helping the public to better&#xD;
      understand harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) present in tobacco products&#xD;
      and tobacco smoke. According to Section 206 of the Act, using the appropriate federal&#xD;
      rulemaking channels and procedures, FDA may require disclosure of tobacco constituents if the&#xD;
      disclosed information benefits public health and increases consumer awareness of the health&#xD;
      consequences of tobacco products. This study will assess the impact of constituent&#xD;
      disclosures on smokers' cigarette packs in a randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Smokers will first undergo screening online or call the study center to complete&#xD;
      the screening questionnaire over the phone. Study staff will schedule eligible smokers for 5&#xD;
      in-person visits. For each of their 5 visits, smokers will be asked to bring the number of&#xD;
      cigarettes they expect to smoke in an 8 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Prior to consenting smokers, research staff will visually inspect photo&#xD;
      identification of smokers who report or appear to be under age 27. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      first appointment, study personnel will explain the consent form and ask the smoker to read&#xD;
      the form. Once the participant has finished reading the form, the study personnel member will&#xD;
      ask the participant if he or she has any questions. Then both parties will sign the consent&#xD;
      form and the participant will receive a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: At the week 2 visit, study personnel will randomly assign participants to one&#xD;
      of the two study arms. The investigators will determine the randomization order a priori.&#xD;
      Smokers have an equal chance of being randomized to have labels with constituent disclosure&#xD;
      messages or labels with litter messages applied to their cigarette packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Participants will complete 5 computer-based surveys during the study. The first&#xD;
      appointment will take around 60 minutes and each subsequent visit will take around 30-45&#xD;
      minutes to complete. At all 5 visits, participants will complete a survey. At visits 2-4,&#xD;
      participants' will have their cigarette packs labeled based on their condition. Cigarette&#xD;
      packs will be tracked at all 5 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the intervention: Each week participants will bring in 8 days' of&#xD;
      cigarettes (one extra day to provide a buffer in case of rescheduled appointments or smoking&#xD;
      more than anticipated) for labeling and tracking. Additionally, they will bring in any unused&#xD;
      labeled packs from the previous visit when applicable. While participants are taking the&#xD;
      survey, research staff will count participants' cigarette packs. Study staff will mark packs&#xD;
      with a code indicating the date of the visit and label them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the intervention arm will have labels with constituent disclosure&#xD;
      messages applied to their cigarette packs during visits for weeks 2-4. Constituent&#xD;
      disclosures that include text about chemicals in cigarette smoke and health effects of the&#xD;
      chemicals will be applied to participants' cigarette packs as labels on the right side (the&#xD;
      Surgeon General's warning is on the left side). At the week 2 visit, participants' packs will&#xD;
      be labeled with 1 of 3 disclosures selected at random; at the week 3 visit, they will get one&#xD;
      of the 2 remaining disclosures selected at random, and at the week 4 visit they will get the&#xD;
      remaining disclosure. Study investigators developed the text and design of these labels.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the control arm will have labels with litter messages applied to the&#xD;
      right side of their cigarette packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will instruct participants in both arms to smoke or not smoke as they&#xD;
      normally would. The investigators will assess how many cigarettes participants smoked from&#xD;
      packs previously brought to a visit and other sources to calculate intervention dose (% of&#xD;
      cigarettes smoked from labeled packs). At the end of the study, participants will receive a&#xD;
      list of cessation resources.&#xD;
