    <textblock>
      Postoperative wound healing complications following preoperative radiotherapy represent a&#xD;
      severe problem in the treatment of malignant soft tissue tumors, and are reported to be 34%&#xD;
      and more. The literature discusses intensely the advantages and disadvantages of this&#xD;
      multimodal treatment concept and there are different opinions. The Canadian prospective&#xD;
      randomized NCIC SR2 trial showed increased wound complication rates in the study arm&#xD;
      receiving preoperative radiation. The Sarcoma Center Zurich pursues mainly this treatment&#xD;
      concept and the results shall now be analysed and published. The approach is to show that not&#xD;
      only the complication rates are comparable to international bench marks, but also the (still&#xD;
      intermediate time) local control rates.&#xD;

      Introduction: The Canadian prospective randomized NCIC SR2 trial tested the sequence of&#xD;
      radiation and surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. Similar disease control&#xD;
      rates following pre- versus postoperative non-intensity modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (non-IMRT) was found, with increased wound complications (17% vs 35%) in the preoperative&#xD;
      radiation arm, [95% CI 5-30], p=0Â·01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assessed a single center preoperative IMRT (or IMRT-equivalent highly&#xD;
      conformal three dimensional conventional RT (3DcRT)) cohort with respect to the wound&#xD;
      complication rate (WCR). The hypothesis was that a lower WCR rate was achieved in the era of&#xD;
      IMRT as compared to the non-IMRT era when the Canadian Trial was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 67 consecutive patients irradiated with 50Gy in 25 fractions between 3/2008-3/2016&#xD;
      with preoperative IMRT (n=48, 72%) or highly conformal IMRT-equivalent 3DcRT dose&#xD;
      distribution (n=19, 28%) were assessed. All patients were previously discussed at the weekly&#xD;
      interdisciplinary sarcoma board of the Sarcoma Center Zurich.&#xD;
