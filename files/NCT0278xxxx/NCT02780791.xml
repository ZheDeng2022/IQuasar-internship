    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pelvic wall or the ovary represents a&#xD;
      better location for the maturation of follicles in the context of ovarian transplantation&#xD;
      after cryopreservation of ovarian tissue before cytotoxic therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of modern medicine made it more likely for oncological patients to survive.&#xD;
      Also, there are a lot of young female patients with a persistent wish for kids. After an&#xD;
      aggressive chemotherapy, premature ovarian failure (POF) is a possible consequence of the&#xD;
      therapy. Therefore, efficient fertility protective interventions are requested. The&#xD;
      transplantation of ovarian tissue after cryopreservation is a valuable method, which could&#xD;
      remain fertility after POF induced by cytotoxic therapies. Especially for girls suffering&#xD;
      from cancer, who didn't reach puberty yet, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only&#xD;
      opportunity to preserve a chance of restoring fertility after POF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two locations, which could be used for the retransplantation of the cryopreserved&#xD;
      tissue: the remaining ovary and the pelvic wall. Both, the ovary and the subperitoneal pocket&#xD;
      in the pelvic wall present a location, where the maturation of follicles is possible. The&#xD;
      remaining question is: where do more follicles grow? To answer this question, a study will be&#xD;
      necessary. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pelvic wall or the ovary&#xD;
      represents a better location for the maturation of follicles in the context of ovarian&#xD;
      transplantation after cryopreservation of ovarian tissue before cytotoxic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian tissue will be transplanted into two different locations; subperitoneal into the loge&#xD;
      of the adnexa of uterus and contralateral into the ovary. The assignment of the two parts of&#xD;
      ovarian tissue to the place of transplantation (pelvic wall vs. ovary) will be randomised.&#xD;
      The study-specific interventions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplantation of the same amount of ovarian tissue into both locations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly sonographic controls and determination of estradiol, LH, FSH and progesterone&#xD;
           from the 3rd on to the 12th month after the transplantation. Therefore, blood samples&#xD;
           will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly documentation of the duration of the cycle from the 3rd on to the 12th month&#xD;
           after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year after the transplantation, the investigators will be able to determine which&#xD;
      location is more likely to grow follicles. With the gained knowledge, standardized&#xD;
      recommendations could be formulated which help to improve the whole process of medical care&#xD;
      of female oncologist patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of follicle maturation in transplanted tissue between pelvic wall and ovary</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning 3 months after the transplantation until 12 months after the transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will get an assessment of the follicle maturation on both sides (pelvic wall and ovary) each month beginning 3 months after the transplantation until 12 months after the transplantation. Overall, 10 assessments will take place. The maturation of follicles will be detected with sonography and measured in mm.&#xD;
Along with the sonography, blood samples will be taken and examined for their amount of estradiol, FSH and progesterone. A follicle â‰¥15mm with a concentration of estradiol &gt;500 pmol/L (&gt;136pg/ml) is considered a mature follicle.&#xD;
The primary outcome contains the quantitative comparison of mature follicles grown on both sides.</description>
