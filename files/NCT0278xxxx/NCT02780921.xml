  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative chemotherapy is the gold standard treatment in the resectable and advanced&#xD;
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of this strategy has been demonstrated in two&#xD;
      randomized studies (1,2). It reduces tumour size before surgery, treats micrometastases and&#xD;
      evaluates chemosensitivity. Disease free and overall survival rates were significantly&#xD;
      improved with perioperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone. However, the limitation&#xD;
      of these studies is that among all patients requiring chemotherapy, almost 70% of patients&#xD;
      will not have the complete sequence. This sequence is defined by the administration of 2 to 4&#xD;
      cycles before and 2 to 4 cycles after the surgery, according to the protocol. The major cause&#xD;
      of absence or impossibility of realization of postoperative chemotherapy was the presence of&#xD;
      postoperative complication, postoperative serious asthenia and impaired nutritional and&#xD;
      physical status (1,2). Poor physical condition assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing,&#xD;
      reflecting a reduced physiological reserve, is predictive of postoperative complications&#xD;
      (3,4). A physical training, even during a short period and on a various population, is&#xD;
      beneficial in improving physical condition, cardiopulmonary function and muscular mass of the&#xD;
      patient (5-8). A prehabilitation over a 6 week period between surgical consultation and&#xD;
      surgery decreases postoperative morbidity and the hospital stay in cardiovascular surgery but&#xD;
      no study has ever been performed in the gastric or oesophageal cancer (7,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation revolves around three axes: 1) a physical training based on initial&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (VO2peak, anaerobic threshold (AT) and 6-min walk test&#xD;
      (6MWT)), 3 times by week, supervised by a physical therapist 2) a nutritional care to ensure&#xD;
      the compliance of the nutrition program and adapt the nutritional management based on protein&#xD;
      and energy needs and on the level of spontaneous oral intake and 2) a psychological treatment&#xD;
      by a psychologist to reduce preoperative anxiety. To our knowledge, no study ever focused on&#xD;
      the gastroesophageal cancer. The benefit of prehabilitation in this cancer may be&#xD;
      particularly important because 1) this surgery is associated with a high postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity (40%, especially respiratory) and mortality (5%) 2) the physical and nutritional&#xD;
      status of these patients is often precarious (cancer cachexia, gastroesophageal obstruction),&#xD;
      and 3) the need to preoperative chemotherapy declines physical reserves and is associated&#xD;
      with a lengthening of the time between consultation and surgery of more than 3 months (10).&#xD;
      Also, the investigators hypothesize that with a physical training, a personalized nutritional&#xD;
      support and a psychologist management may decrease postoperative complications, increase&#xD;
      postoperative nutritional status and so, would allow for more patients to receive their full&#xD;
      cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      the effect of prehabilitation compared to conventional care, the percentage of patients&#xD;
      reaching the complete oncological treatment decided in a multidisciplinary tumour board.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interventions After the first visit with his surgeon, the patient will be presented at the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary tumour board to validate the inclusion criteria and to schedule the number&#xD;
      of cycles of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy. After this step, a second consultation with&#xD;
      the surgeon will allow to verify all inclusion and exclusion criteria and perform the&#xD;
      randomization. For the two groups, an initial (before chemotherapy) and final (one week&#xD;
      before the surgery) evaluation will be performed. The evaluation includes cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing (VO2peak, AT and 6MWT), nutritional evaluation (albumin), bioelectric&#xD;
      impedance analysis, evaluation of physical activity and ingesta, evaluation of the level of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and anxiety with the HADS questionnaire and the quality of life (5Q-FD&#xD;
      questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehab group Exercise intervention: The total-body exercise will consist of up to 1 hour of&#xD;
      supervised exercise for at least 3 days per week, for a total of 18 cycles, alternating&#xD;
      between aerobic and resistance training. Exercise intensity will be prescribed based on the&#xD;
      rate of the 6MWT, AT and VO2peak. The participant will exercise in the presence of the&#xD;
      kinesiologist who will provide corrective feedback if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition intervention: Initially, a nutritionist will perform a medical and biological&#xD;
      examination of the nutritional status to provide individualized care to each patient.&#xD;
      Individual protein requirements will be calculated as 1.2 g of protein per kilogram of body&#xD;
      weight (adjusted body weight was used for obese patients), as per European Society for&#xD;
      Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines, regarding surgical patients (12).&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consume the protein supplement within one hour of their exercise&#xD;
      regimen to capitalize on postexercise muscle protein synthesis (13). Then, a dietician will&#xD;
      assess the compliance of the nutritional support at each cycle of chemotherapy and will&#xD;
      adjust it if necessary. After the preoperative chemotherapy, a second evaluation by a&#xD;
      nutritionist will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologist intervention: Patients will receive up to a one hour visit with a trained&#xD;
      psychologist who will provide techniques aiming to reducing anxiety, such as relaxation&#xD;
      exercises based on imagery and visualization, together with breathing exercises. Each patient&#xD;
      will practice these exercises with the psychologist initially and at each cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and at home two to three times per week. The psychologist also provides&#xD;
      suggestions on how to enhance and reinforce patients' motivation to comply with the exercise&#xD;
      and nutritional aspects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be treated according to conventional care; will not receive any&#xD;
      specific intervention before surgery except nutritional support and physiotherapy at the&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
