      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive forms of respiratory support have been developed to manage respiratory distress&#xD;
      and failure in premature newborns without exposing them to the risks associated with invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. It has been difficult to synchronize non-invasive ventilation due to&#xD;
      the large air leaks, high respiratory rates, and small tidal volumes inherent to this&#xD;
      interface and population. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a novel mode of&#xD;
      ventilation that uses a functional naso/orogastric tube with embedded electrodes which detect&#xD;
      diaphragmatic contractions (called the Edi signal). NAVA uses this Edi signal to synchronize&#xD;
      ventilator support to the patient's own respiratory efforts and to support these efforts as&#xD;
      needed. Few studies have examined the use of NAVA with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in&#xD;
      preterm neonates. A group at Arkansas Children's Hospital recently completed a study, looking&#xD;
      at work of breathing in an animal model comparing NIV NAVA with the unsynchronized nasal&#xD;
      intermittent positive pressure (NIPPV) mode currently used at this hospital. They were able&#xD;
      to show that work of breathing was lower with NAVA in this model. This study will take what&#xD;
      was shown in the animal model and translate this to the bedside. Using respiratory inductance&#xD;
      plethysmography to measure thoracoabdominal asynchrony, this study will compare work of&#xD;
      breathing during NIPPV versus NIV NAVA in preterm neonates with respiratory insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work of breathing as estimated by the phase angle (θ) using respiratory inductance&#xD;
      plethysmography will be decreased with the use of NIV NAVA in comparison to unsynchronized&#xD;
      NIPPV in premature neonates with respiratory insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen premature neonates of between 1-2 kilograms' current weight, with gestational age at&#xD;
      birth between 24-34 weeks, and receiving non-invasive ventilation will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study after consent is obtained. The infants will be ventilated using NIV NAVA and NIPPV&#xD;
      applied in random order for 15 minutes each while using respiratory inductance&#xD;
      plethysmography to measure thoracoabdominal asynchrony as an estimate of work of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify whether or not NIV NAVA has advantages over NIPPV for improving work&#xD;
      of breathing in premature neonates.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure have been frequent sources of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in premature neonates. Intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      has been a life-saving therapy for many of these patients, but is not without risks. These&#xD;
      risks include pulmonary complications such as volutrauma, extrapulmonary air leak syndromes,&#xD;
      and traumatic injury to the large airways; non-pulmonary complications such as retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity; and long-term complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [Miller, Badiee].&#xD;
      Concern over these effects of prolonged mechanical ventilation has led to the development of&#xD;
      non-invasive forms of respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a frequently used modality of respiratory support for&#xD;
      premature neonates in the setting of respiratory insufficiency or recent weaning from&#xD;
      invasive ventilation. Synchronized NIV is effective at decreasing respiratory effort as&#xD;
      compared to unsynchronized NIV and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) [Chang].&#xD;
      Synchronizing NIV in premature neonates to the patient's own respiratory efforts is difficult&#xD;
      because of the large air leaks, weak inspiratory efforts, and high respiratory rates inherent&#xD;
      to this population [Vignaux].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel method of synchronization, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses&#xD;
      electrodes on a functional naso/orogastric tube (Edi catheter) to detect diaphragm&#xD;
      contractions and time the onset, duration, and peak inspiratory pressure of supporting&#xD;
      breaths with the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) [Sinderby]. NAVA can be used with&#xD;
      both invasive and non-invasive ventilation modalities, and there have been several small&#xD;
      studies examining invasive NAVA in children and adults [Stein, de la Olivia]. Fewer studies&#xD;
      have examined NIV NAVA in these populations, and only two clinical trials have examined NIV&#xD;
      NAVA in premature neonates [Beck, Lee]. Beck and colleagues in Canada showed feasibility and&#xD;
      preservation of synchrony during NIV NAVA in premature neonates [Beck]. Lee and colleagues in&#xD;
      Korea showed fewer asynchrony events, lower trigger delay, and lower peak inspiratory&#xD;
      pressures with NIV NAVA compared to non-invasive pressure support ventilation in premature&#xD;
      neonates [Lee]. Neither study examined work of breathing (WOB) in preterm neonates ventilated&#xD;
      with NIV NAVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work of breathing during assisted ventilation is the portion of the driving pressure for&#xD;
      ventilation contributed by the patient's respiratory muscles. A research team at Arkansas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital was able to demonstrate that NAVA achieves reduced response time, work of&#xD;
      breathing, and asynchrony with neurally triggered breaths as compared to pneumatically&#xD;
      triggered breaths in an animal model [Heulitt]. This team was also able to show similar&#xD;
      results in a clinical study of intubated pediatric patients with bronchiolitis [Clement]. A&#xD;
      recently completed study at this institution looked at work of breathing in neonatal pigs&#xD;
      comparing NIV NAVA with the unsynchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure (NIPPV) mode&#xD;
      currently used at this hospital. Using the pressure-time product (PTP) as a measure of WOB&#xD;
      this study was able to show that WOB was lower with NAVA. The PTP cannot be reliably used in&#xD;
      infants on NIV because the nasal prong interface allows large air leaks at the nose and&#xD;
      mouth, which interfere with accurate measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA) is an important correlate of WOB and increased respiratory&#xD;
      load in preterm infants and can be measured without invasive monitoring. TAA can be measured&#xD;
      using a respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) bands around the patient's chest and&#xD;
      abdomen to quantify chest wall and abdominal movement. The degree of asynchrony between the&#xD;
      two compartments is reflected in the phase angle (θ), which can be calculated from the RIP&#xD;
      band measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine estimated WOB in a population of premature neonates with respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency currently on non-invasive support. Infants will serve as their own controls and&#xD;
      will be studied on NIV NAVA and NIPPV. Order of assignment will be randomized. Researchers&#xD;
      will use RIP bands to measure thoracic and abdominal movement, then calculate the phase angle&#xD;
      (θ) as an estimate of WOB. Study personnel will measure other respiratory parameters&#xD;
      correlating with ventilation and gas exchange including the following: tidal volume&#xD;
      (arbitrary units, AU), minute ventilation (AU/min), respiratory rate, transcutaneous oxygen&#xD;
      and carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation and FiO2 requirement, peak inspiratory pressure, and&#xD;
      delivered end expiratory pressure. Investigators will also evaluate measures of breathing&#xD;
      asynchrony to include trigger delay (time between initial increase in Edi signal and&#xD;
      initiation of delivered ventilator flow) and asynchrony index (number of asynchrony events&#xD;
      divided by total events, as a percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Procedures/Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen premature neonates of between 1-2 kilogram current weight, with gestational age at&#xD;
      birth between 24-34 weeks, and receiving non-invasive ventilation will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Inclusion criteria will be as follows: respiratory insufficiency currently requiring&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation (either NIPPV or NAVA), current FiO2 requirement less than 0.40, and&#xD;
      clinical stability. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: ionotropic support, clinical&#xD;
      instability (temperature instability, heart failure, bleeding, active infection, significant&#xD;
      apnea or bradycardia), known major congenital anomalies (congenital heart disease, abdominal&#xD;
      wall defects, gastrointestinal tract defects, cleft palate, or neurologic defects), known&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis, nitric oxide use, and cyanotic congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, RIP bands will be placed around the infant's chest and&#xD;
      abdomen. An Edi catheter will be placed and the current gastric catheter may or may not be&#xD;
      removed. Infants will be ventilated with the Servo i ventilator equipped with NIV NAVA&#xD;
      software {Maquet, Solna, Sweden}. Data will be continuously and simultaneously acquired using&#xD;
      the MP100 Biopac data acquisition system. Data acquired will be as follows: heart rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, transcutaneous CO2 and O2, PIP, PEEP, rib cage and abdominal RIP signals,&#xD;
      summed tidal volume, and Edi. Infants will receive 15 minute trials of NIV NAVA and NIPPV in&#xD;
      random order with the first 10 minutes after changing to be considered a washout period and&#xD;
      the last 5 minutes used for data collection. The data recorded from the two RIP bands will be&#xD;
      used to calculate the phase angle (θ) as an estimate of WOB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants often have gagging and may have vomiting when a gastric tube, such as the NAVA&#xD;
      catheter, is removed or replaced. Rarely, patients could have a gastric tube go into a place&#xD;
      besides the stomach or coil in the esophagus. Researchers should be able to detect if this&#xD;
      occurs using the placement screen on the ventilator because the NAVA catheter has electrodes&#xD;
      on it that detect the electrical activity of the heart and diaphragm, which can be used to&#xD;
      determine the location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In extremely low birth weight infants, transcutaneous monitors (TCOMs) can cause skin&#xD;
      burning. These effects are not seen in larger babies like those included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality inherent in all research. Investigators will&#xD;
      do everything possible to protect the participants' confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may or may not be direct medical benefit to the infants involved in this study. The&#xD;
      infants will have continuous carbon dioxide and oxygen monitoring during the study and if any&#xD;
      patient has any problems, study personnel will be able to detect and respond to this quickly.&#xD;
      If a patient shows improvement while using NAVA, investigators may be able to suggest to the&#xD;
      treatment team that this mode be continued. If using NAVA improves work of breathing in&#xD;
      babies, then the researchers hope the information learned from this study will benefit other&#xD;
      infants needing respiratory support in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling/Recordkeeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will carefully monitor study procedures to protect the safety of&#xD;
      research subjects, the quality of the data and the integrity of the study. Each patient will&#xD;
      be assigned a unique identifying code or number. The key to the code will be kept in a locked&#xD;
      file in the principal investigator's office. Only the principal investigator and&#xD;
      co-investigators will have access to the code and information that identifies the subject in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that phase angle (θ) using respiratory inductance plethysmography&#xD;
      will be decreased with the use of NAVA in comparison to NIPPV in our study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be checked for outliers and extreme values, as well as distributional&#xD;
      assumptions of the parametric statistical tests. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      compare the primary and secondary outcomes under the two ventilation methods when such&#xD;
      assumptions are met. When significant deviation from assumptions is encountered,&#xD;
      nonparametric alternatives will be used. Statistical analyses will be performed using Stata&#xD;
      (College Station, TX) statistical software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size, Power Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to recruit 15-20 neonates who are 24-34 weeks gestation with respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency. Based on the results in the animal model, a 30% reduction in the primary&#xD;
      outcome is expected. Since the average phase angle was found to be variable among preterm&#xD;
      infants (ranged from 2.8-162.9), there are several scenarios of the sample size and power&#xD;
      calculation presented for analysis [Ulm]. A sample size of 15 neonates achieves 82% power to&#xD;
      detect a 30% change in the primary outcome with an estimated standard deviation of&#xD;
      differences of 18.8, 37.5, or 56.3 respectively for an average phase angle of 50, 100, and&#xD;
      150 degrees with the use of NIPPV. All calculations assume a significance level of 0.05 using&#xD;
      a two-sided paired t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations and&#xD;
      University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) research policies and procedures. This&#xD;
      protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by the UAMS Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB). The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, will be&#xD;
      obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure. All subjects for this study&#xD;
      will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information in&#xD;
      language suitable for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this&#xD;
      study. The person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the document and&#xD;
      outline the risks and benefits, alternate treatment(s), and requirements of the study. The&#xD;
      consent process will take place in a quiet and private room or by phone, and subjects may&#xD;
      take as much time as needed to make a decision about their participation. Phone consent will&#xD;
      be obtained with a witness and consent will be faxed to parent(s). Phone consent will only be&#xD;
      obtained in the event that the parents are unable to be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation privacy will be maintained and questions regarding participation will be&#xD;
      answered. No coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process. The consent&#xD;
      form must be signed by the subject, the parent and the individual obtaining the consent. A&#xD;
      copy of the signed consent will be given to the participant, and the informed consent process&#xD;
      will be documented in each subject's research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
