      Primary study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-site, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare&#xD;
      an evidence-based structured program of 30-35 hours of on-line cognitive and social cognitive&#xD;
      training exercises performed over 16 weeks (~2 hours per week), delivered with an innovative&#xD;
      digital app which provides users with a motivation coach to set personalized goals and with&#xD;
      secure social networking for peer support, &quot;PRIME&quot; ; vs. 2) A control condition of computer&#xD;
      games, encouraged at ~2 hours per week over 16 weeks, delivered with &quot;PRIME&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinded Cognitive Training Sub-Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who were randomized to the computer games arm of the trial may be offered access&#xD;
      to the active cognitive training at the end of their 6 month follow up appointments, if they&#xD;
      still meet inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIME Super Users Sub-Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have provided all follow up data to the initial study, including those who&#xD;
      are currently enrolled in the Unblinded Cognitive Training sub-study, may be offered&#xD;
      continued participation in the PRIME community as super-users.&#xD;

      Primary study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use remote methods and scalable interactive neurotechnology&#xD;
      to generate important data on the potential for remote targeted cognitive treatment in people&#xD;
      with psychosis. We will perform a double-blind RCT in 120 participants with psychosis,&#xD;
      comparing: 1) An evidence-based structured program of 30-35 hours of on-line cognitive and&#xD;
      social cognitive training exercises (CT) performed over 16 weeks (~2 hours per week),&#xD;
      delivered with an innovative digital app which provides users with a motivation coach to set&#xD;
      personalized goals and with secure social networking for peer support, &quot;PRIME&quot;; vs. 2) A&#xD;
      control condition of computer games, encouraged at ~2 hours per week over 16 weeks, delivered&#xD;
      with &quot;PRIME&quot; . Both conditions will be administered using personal smartphone devices and&#xD;
      computers and all procedures will be conducted remotely, including on-line recruitment in&#xD;
      locations all over the world. Using both per protocol and intent-to-treat analyses, we will&#xD;
      determine clinical, cognitive, and functional effects after the intervention using&#xD;
      operationalized assessments delivered remotely, and will determine their relationship to&#xD;
      functional outcome measures at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the active condition and the control condition will be provided through identical web&#xD;
      portals designed for the study at no charge by Brain HQ (Posit Science, Inc.). PRIME, the&#xD;
      personalized motivation coaching and social networking app, has been designed and developed&#xD;
      by co-investigator Dr. Schlosser, supported by UCSF and NIMH. We will recruit a total of 204&#xD;
      subjects with psychosis to be stratified by age (18-40, 40-60) and education (&lt; 14 years, &gt;14&#xD;
      years) and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinded Cognitive Training Sub-Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the debrief, participants will be asked if they would like to continue participating&#xD;
      in the study and receive active cognitive training. If the participant agrees, they will sign&#xD;
      a new consent form which covers the details of the next portion of the study. The data from&#xD;
      their 6 month follow up appointment will be counted as their baseline data to reduce&#xD;
      participant burden. They will start immediately with cognitive training and will continue&#xD;
      through the 6 month follow up appointments, as above. Additionally, participants who enter&#xD;
      into this study may be offered simultaneous participation in the PRIME Super Users sub-study&#xD;
      (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIME Super Users Sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a super-user, PRIME members are asked to take on a peer-mentorship role in the community&#xD;
      and maintain a certain level of activity within the application. Before offering&#xD;
      participation in the sub-study, the study team will perform a case review to determine if&#xD;
      PRIME would be beneficial to the individual, that they appear able to fulfill the role of a&#xD;
      peer mentor, that they are likely to be consistently active within the community, and they&#xD;
      are able to adhere to the PRIME code of conduct. Participants will sign informed consent&#xD;
      before rejoining the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As super-users, participants will be asked to be active members within the community and to&#xD;
      maintain activity of once a week, on average. Participants will be asked to notify study&#xD;
      staff if they anticipate or experience any extended absences from the app for any reason so&#xD;
      their access to the community will not be revoked. Super-users will participate in the&#xD;
      community by making posts, sharing moments, and commenting on the posts of other community&#xD;
      members (including ROAM participants, Super-Users, and coaches). They are encouraged to share&#xD;
      stories from their experiences and offer advice to other users for making and achieving&#xD;
      goals, dealing with symptoms, and improving quality of life.&#xD;
