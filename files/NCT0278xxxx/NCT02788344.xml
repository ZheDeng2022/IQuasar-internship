  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter multidisciplinary study designed to investigate patient, provider, and&#xD;
      system-related factors that are associated with the quality and safety of initial management&#xD;
      for suspected ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) evolving for less than 12&#xD;
      hours in daily practice. The primary hypotheses are that delayed reperfusion therapy for&#xD;
      suspected STEMI independently relates to provider practice patterns and system barriers. It&#xD;
      is further postulated that non-compliance with target delays in implementing percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy is associated with worse in-hospital&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. The secondary hypotheses are that the delivery of acute reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy within target delays is associated with increased rates of false-positive cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory activation, inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy, and bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be conducted in three emergency medical services and 23 public and private&#xD;
      (for-profit and non-for-profit) acute care hospitals in Northern Alps in France. Data over&#xD;
      the index hospital stay period will be retrospectively collected for all the patients&#xD;
      included in an ongoing prospective regional hospital-based clinical registry of suspected&#xD;
      STEMI from October, 1st, 2002 to December, 31, 2014. Inclusion of 7435 patients is&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational retrospective study, no specific intervention is assigned to&#xD;
      participants. All diagnostic testing, procedures, and medication ordering are performed at&#xD;
      the discretion of attending physicians. No enrollment or follow-up visits are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness outcome is timely acute reperfusion therapy. The secondary&#xD;
      effectiveness outcomes include false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation&#xD;
      for catheterization candidates and inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy. The secondary medical&#xD;
      outcomes include in-hospital all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and&#xD;
      major bleeding events. Multivariable logistic regression model will be developed to identify&#xD;
      baseline characteristics that are independently associated with timely acute reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy. Propensity score analysis will be performed for comparing clinical outcomes between&#xD;
      timely acute reperfusion therapy recipients and non-recipients.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad objectives of this multicenter and multidisciplinary observational cohort study are&#xD;
      to investigate patient, provider, and system-related factors that are associated with the&#xD;
      quality and safety of initial management for suspected ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) evolving for less than 12 hours in daily practice. The findings of this&#xD;
      study should help identifying areas with room for improvement in clinical pathway for STEMI&#xD;
      patients. The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the independent associations between the delivery of timely acute&#xD;
           reperfusion therapy and patient, provider, and system-related factors, according to&#xD;
           current guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the independent associations between the delivery of timely acute reperfusion&#xD;
           therapy and in-hospital clinical outcomes (including all-cause mortality and major&#xD;
           adverse cardiovascular events)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the independent risk factors for major bleeding (excluding coronary-artery&#xD;
           bypass graft-related bleeding events) among baseline patient and provider&#xD;
           characteristics, processes of care, and system-related factors, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to elucidate the prevalence, risk factors, and in-hospital clinical outcomes&#xD;
           independently associated with false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory&#xD;
           activation or inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine how hospitals are interconnected by transferring patients with suspected&#xD;
           STEMI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses The primary hypotheses guiding this project are that delayed reperfusion therapy&#xD;
      for suspected STEMI independently relates to provider practice patterns and system barriers.&#xD;
      It is further postulated that non-compliance with target delays in implementing primary PCI&#xD;
      or fibrinolytic therapy is associated with worse in-hospital clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are that the delivery of acute reperfusion therapy within target&#xD;
      delays is associated with increased rates of false-positive cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory activation, inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy, and bleeding events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating study centers and setting The project will be conducted at 3 emergency medical&#xD;
      services (EMS/SAMU) and 23 public and private (for-profit and non-for-profit) acute care&#xD;
      hospitals in Northern Alps in France. Northern Alps are a predominantly mountainous area&#xD;
      covering 15,000 kmÂ² with an estimated population of 1,860,000 inhabitants with large seasonal&#xD;
      variations due to tourism. The median distance and driving time from each community hospital&#xD;
      to the closest PCI center are 63 km (range, 4.5-132 km) and 43 min (range, 10-88 min),&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a coordinated regional system of reperfusion therapy for STEMI, all participating&#xD;
      centers have a long collaborative tradition in STEMI management research.The rationale, data&#xD;
      collection methods, verification procedures, and primary outcomes of this registry have been&#xD;
      reported in detail elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective data collection As part of the ongoing registry, attending physicians or&#xD;
           clinical research technicians routinely abstract summary information on demographics,&#xD;
           presenting characteristics (including electrocardiographic findings), coronary&#xD;
           angiography findings, and delivery and timing of acute reperfusion therapy in both&#xD;
           prehospital and hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on patient home address, travel time and travel distance to the nearest community&#xD;
           hospital and PCI-capable hospital will be obtained through calls to commercial Web page&#xD;
           (MapQuest or Via Michelin). ZIP code will replace patient home address when unavailable.&#xD;
           Previous studies have shown that this method provides reasonable estimates. To account&#xD;
           for peak travel time, slowdowns of 20% will be factored in during the hours of 7 to 9 AM&#xD;
           and 4 to 7 PM, Monday through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospective data collection Two clinical research nurses will perform retrospective&#xD;
           chart review using a computerized data collection instrument. The following variables&#xD;
           will be recorded: baseline patient characteristics, clinical variables, comorbid&#xD;
           conditions, laboratory variables, procedural interventions (cardiac catheterization, PCI&#xD;
           [not primary], and coronary artery bypass grafting) at any time during index&#xD;
           hospitalization, medications (on admission, during the first 24 hours, and at&#xD;
           discharge). Index hospitalization includes both admitting and transfer hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics will also be collected for attending physicians (gender, age, discipline) as&#xD;
      well as admitting and transfer hospitals (community vs PCI-capable facility, size, public or&#xD;
      non for profit versus for profit). Consistent with a previous study, PCI centers are defined&#xD;
      as hospitals that offer emergency PCI 24 h a day, 7 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective data collection As part of the ongoing registry, data are prospectively&#xD;
           recorded in duplicate on standardized forms designed to facilitate data collection and&#xD;
           entry. All completed forms are forwarded to the core coordinating facility of the&#xD;
           regional emergency system (RENAU=RÃ©seau Nord-Alpin des Urgences ; www.renau.org), where&#xD;
           the data are entered electronically (single-data entry) and maintained on a local&#xD;
           computer network. The data entry screens are similar to the paper forms. Original data&#xD;
           collection forms are kept in locked file cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data integrity is enforced through two complementary approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Routine edit checks (valid values, range checks, and consistency checks) are&#xD;
                performed at the time of data entry by a clinical research technician at the core&#xD;
                coordinating facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The registry statistician periodically screens data for additional errors using&#xD;
                programs designed to detect missing values or inconsistencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospective data collection To ensure optimal quality, all data collected&#xD;
           retrospectively by chart review will be entered electronically by clinical research&#xD;
           nurses using a personal identification code and password-protected web-based data&#xD;
           collection system. The clinical research nurses will receive formal training in the&#xD;
           methods of data abstraction and recording. An operation manual that includes definitions&#xD;
           and acceptable data sources for all variables will be distributed. Reliability of data&#xD;
           abstraction will be assessed by randomly selecting 30 cases for independent collection&#xD;
           by the two study nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data manager will screen data for additional errors using programs designed to detect&#xD;
      missing values or inconsistencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overview Standard descriptive summary statistics will be used for reporting continuous&#xD;
           and categorical variables. In univariate analysis, inferential comparisons will be&#xD;
           performed using analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Logarithm&#xD;
           transformation may be used for highly skewed variables prior to inferential comparisons.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be analyzed with the use of KhiÂ² or Fisher exact tests.&#xD;
           Trends across ordered groups will be analyzed for statistical significance using the&#xD;
           KhiÂ² test for trends for categorical variables and the non-parametric Wilcoxon-type test&#xD;
           for trends for continuous variables, respectively. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05&#xD;
           will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary effectiveness outcome A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model&#xD;
           will be developed to identify baseline characteristics that are independently associated&#xD;
           with timely acute reperfusion therapy. Covariates entered into the multivariable model&#xD;
           will be prespecified before modelling, without investigating their association with the&#xD;
           primary study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary analysis restricted to the subset of patients with prehospital management will&#xD;
           use multilevel logistic regression, with the 3 levels defined by patients, mobile&#xD;
           intensive care units, and hospitals. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (a Markov Chain&#xD;
           Monte Carlo method) will be used to account for the cross-classification of mobile&#xD;
           intensive care units that transported patients at more than one study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary medical outcomes Because timely acute reperfusion therapy is not randomly&#xD;
           assigned in this observational study, unadjusted comparisons of medical outcomes between&#xD;
           study groups might be confounded by imbalances in baseline characteristics.For this&#xD;
           purpose, propensity score analysis that compensate for differences in measured baseline&#xD;
           characteristics will be performed between timely acute reperfusion therapy recipients&#xD;
           and non-recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Practically, a propensity score will be derived for the receipt of timely acute&#xD;
           reperfusion therapy using a full non-parsimonious logistic regression model that&#xD;
           includes baseline characteristics as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient will be assigned a propensity score, which may range from 0.00 to 1.00 and&#xD;
           reflects the conditional probability of timely acute reperfusion receipt given his&#xD;
           baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare secondary medical outcomes among patients with similar conditional&#xD;
           probability of timely acute reperfusion therapy, a cohort of timely acute reperfusion&#xD;
           therapy recipients and non-recipients matched by propensity score will be also defined.&#xD;
           For this purpose, an algorithm will be used to match each timely acute reperfusion&#xD;
           therapy recipient to a single non-recipient who have the nearest propensity score within&#xD;
           one digit. If this cannot not be done, that timely acute reperfusion therapy recipient&#xD;
           will be excluded from the propensity-matched analysis. The propensity-matched cohort&#xD;
           will be evaluated for significant residual imbalances in baseline characteristics. Then&#xD;
           logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds ratio for each secondary medical&#xD;
           outcomes associated with the receipt of timely acute reperfusion therapy among&#xD;
           propensity score-matched patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary effectiveness outcomes Using the same modelling approach as previously&#xD;
           described (i.e., b. primary effectiveness outcome), multivariable logistic regression&#xD;
           will be performed to identify baseline characteristics that are independently associated&#xD;
           with false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation among patients who are&#xD;
           candidate for primary PCI. A first-order interaction term involving prehospital cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization laboratory activation will be tested for statistical significance. If&#xD;
           appropriate, analysis will be stratified according to prehospital versus hospital&#xD;
           cardiac catheterization laboratory activation. Then medical outcomes will be compared&#xD;
           between false positive and true positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation&#xD;
           after adjusting for quintile of propensity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a separate analysis, multivariate logistic regression will be performed to identify&#xD;
      baseline characteristics that are independently associated with inadvertent fibrinolytic&#xD;
      therapy among fibrinolysis recipients. A first-order interaction term involving prehospital&#xD;
      fibrinolysis will be tested for statistical significance and, if appropriate, analysis will&#xD;
      be stratified according to the receipt of prehospital versus hospital fibrinolysis. Then odds&#xD;
      ratio will be estimated for each medical outcome associated with inadvertent fibrinolysis&#xD;
      after adjusting for quintile of propensity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms and safety In this retrospective observational study, severe adverse events occurring&#xD;
      during hospitalization will be specified as secondary medical study outcomes (mortality,&#xD;
      major adverse cardiac events [reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, heart failure,&#xD;
      stroke], and major bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other prespecified adverse events will be recorded, including atrial fibrillation or flutter,&#xD;
      sustained ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block (Mobitz II or 3rd degree),&#xD;
      mechanical complications (ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, free wall&#xD;
      rupture), venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism), acute&#xD;
      renal failure, thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and non-major bleeding&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected through a structured chart review. There will be no attempt&#xD;
      to determine potential causality.&#xD;
