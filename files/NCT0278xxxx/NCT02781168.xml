      The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the use of headphones in salivary&#xD;
      cortisol levels in newborns (NB) during periods of nap aimed at noise reduction, brightness&#xD;
      and handling NB, measure the concentrations of salivary cortisol before (baseline) and after&#xD;
      the use of hearing protection (response) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A NICU nap periods and compare the influence of the use and non-use of hearing protection in&#xD;
      salivary cortisol levels and sleep patterns of infants during nap periods of the NICU.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the use of headphones in salivary&#xD;
      cortisol levels in newborns (NB) during periods of nap aimed at noise reduction, brightness&#xD;
      and handling NB, measure the concentrations of salivary cortisol before (baseline) and after&#xD;
      the use of hearing protection (response) in the NICU nap periods and compare the influence of&#xD;
      the use and non-use of hearing protection in salivary cortisol levels and sleep patterns of&#xD;
      infants during nap periods of the NICU. Being the chance prosposta the use of headphones&#xD;
      during periods of environmental control has an influence on the level of salivary cortisol&#xD;
      and sleep in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial, controlled, crossover, in which clinical intervention is&#xD;
      introduced by the researcher that controls and varies, featuring experimental research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the intervention being tested is the use of hearing protection in infants. The&#xD;
      ear is employed in certain periods of the day. These periods established by the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU), are intended to promote environmental noise control and&#xD;
      manipulation of the NB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of cortisol present in the saliva of the newborn will be analyzed, allowing to measure&#xD;
      the biologically active free cortisol in the body.&#xD;
