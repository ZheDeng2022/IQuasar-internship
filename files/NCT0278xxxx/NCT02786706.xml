  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic Nerve Ultrasound (ONUS) is a promising non-invasive tool for the detection of raised&#xD;
      Intracranial Pressure (ICP). Variability in the optimal Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter (ONSD)&#xD;
      threshold corresponding to elevated ICP in multiple studies limits the value of ONUS in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The investigators goal is to develop and validate an automated image&#xD;
      analysis algorithm for standardization of ONSD measurement from ultrasound videos. Patients&#xD;
      with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring will undergo bedside ONUS, with&#xD;
      blinded ONSD measurement by an expert investigator. The image analysis algorithm will then be&#xD;
      used to measure ONSD and accuracy determined compared to the &quot;reference standard&quot; expert&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising tool under investigation for the non-invasive estimation of ICP is Optic Nerve&#xD;
      Ultrasound (ONUS). Raised ICP results in distension of the optic nerve sheath (ONS), a&#xD;
      continuation of the dura mater. Ocular imaging, performed by clinicians using point-of-care&#xD;
      ultrasound machines, can detect ONS distension behind the eye. A study conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan identified an ONS Diameter (ONSD) cutoff of &gt;0.51cm as having 98%&#xD;
      sensitivity and 91% specificity for the detection of intracranial hypertension, defined as&#xD;
      ICP&gt;25mmHg. The significant variation seen in the optimal ONSD threshold for identification&#xD;
      of high ICP across several studies, however, greatly limits the practical application of this&#xD;
      technique at the bedside. Much of this variation in the optimal ONSD threshold is likely&#xD;
      related to technique, with variation in the margins used to define the ONS on acquired&#xD;
      ultrasound images by different operators. The ONS, visible as a linear hypodense structure&#xD;
      behind the eye can vary in its visualized dimension based on the angle and plane of&#xD;
      insonation. Automated image analysis may permit standardization of ONSD measurement and&#xD;
      thereby minimize interobserver variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal is to develop a computer image-analysis algorithm to standardize&#xD;
      measurement of the ONSD from ultrasound videos, and to validate against the reference&#xD;
      standard of expert manual measurement of ONSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of image-analysis algorithm: Videos in DICOM format of prior ONUS studies&#xD;
      performed for clinical purposes in the neurointensive care unit will be deidentified and used&#xD;
      for initial development and modification of the automated image analysis algorithm, prior to&#xD;
      prospective enrollment of subjects for determination of accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under IRB approval, the investigators will perform Optic Nerve Ultrasound (ONUS) on eligible&#xD;
      subjects admitted to the ICU following informed consent of the patient or appropriate&#xD;
      surrogate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic Nerve Ultrasound and ONSD measurement: These patients will undergo ONUS in the ICU.&#xD;
      ONUS is performed with the patient's eye closed, and with a linear array transducer placed on&#xD;
      the upper margin of the orbit to obtain a sonographic video clip of the eye, followed by&#xD;
      bedside measurement of ONSD 3mm behind the level of the posterior scleral border. Imaging&#xD;
      will be performed for both eyes for each patient. The expert investigator performing the ONUS&#xD;
      study and manual ONSD measurement will be blinded to the patient's ICP by turning the monitor&#xD;
      away from the sonographer from the time of entry into the patient's room until exit. The&#xD;
      corresponding ICP from the invasive monitor will be separately documented by the bedside&#xD;
      nurse. The ONUS video corresponding to the highest measured ONSD will be submitted in DICOM&#xD;
      format for automated image analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: Sonosite M-Turbo point-of-care ultrasound machine and an L25 linear array&#xD;
      transducer with an ophthalmic preset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple Pearson correlation to allow for visual inspection across a range of values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tukey mean-difference plot (Bland - Altman plot) will be used to assess agreement&#xD;
           between the two methods, the ultrasound video analysis of optic nerve sheath diameter&#xD;
           and ONSD ultrasound interpretation by a clinician. Limits of agreement will be&#xD;
           calculated with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
