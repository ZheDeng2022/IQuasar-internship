      Despite the high prevalence of sleep difficulties in children with disruptive behavior&#xD;
      disorders, little is known about the role of sleep in treating disruptive behavior. The&#xD;
      current study evaluates the addition of a sleep intervention to an existing parent-training&#xD;
      program for caregivers of children ages 3-8 with disruptive behaviors. Objectives are to&#xD;
      examine the impact of a novel sleep treatment program on sleep, disruptive behavior, and&#xD;
      other measures of family functioning, utilizing a variety of self-report and objective&#xD;
      measures (e.g. actigraphy, electrodermal activity). The investigators hypothesize that sleep&#xD;
      intervention will result in improvements in sleep and disruptive behavior compared to control&#xD;
      group receiving a highly plausible addition to the standard parent training intervention, and&#xD;
      that sleep outcomes will moderate overall treatment success.&#xD;

      Overview: The current study, which is a collaboration between Indiana University at&#xD;
      Bloomington (PI: Bates) and Indiana University School of Medicine (PI: Honaker), seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of adding a sleep component to a parenting intervention that has been&#xD;
      shown to effectively treat disruptive behavior in children. A mealtime intervention will&#xD;
      serve as an active control for the sleep treatment component, as the mealtime intervention&#xD;
      targets changes in a family routine but is unlikely to significantly impact sleep.&#xD;
      Participants who receive the sleep component are expected to show significant improvements in&#xD;
      sleep compared to the mealtime group. The investigators further hypothesize that children&#xD;
      receiving the sleep intervention will have reduced presleep arousal levels compared to&#xD;
      baseline, and will show greater reduction in presleep arousal levels than the&#xD;
      mealtime/control group. Finally, because of the documented links between poor sleep and&#xD;
      externalizing behavior problems and theoretical arguments about sleep mechanisms supporting&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral self-regulation, the investigators hypothesize that the participants&#xD;
      who receive the sleep component will show greater reductions in disruptive behavior compared&#xD;
      to the mealtime/control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Design: Participants are 3-8-year-old children who exhibit disruptive&#xD;
      behaviors and their parents. Participants meeting criteria for the parent-training program&#xD;
      offered as part of the general clinic practice would be approached by the therapist to&#xD;
      discuss participation in the study. Following the consent procedure, they would be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups. The sleep intervention group would receive a brief, novel&#xD;
      sleep intervention (The Sleep Train Program) in the context of the parenting program's&#xD;
      Setting Up for Success segment, which focuses on positive routines. Sleep would be addressed&#xD;
      briefly as needed in subsequent sessions. The mealtime/control group would not receive any&#xD;
      particular intervention or guidance regarding sleep, but would instead focus on the routine&#xD;
      of mealtimes. All families would then receive the same core intervention for disruptive&#xD;
      behavior. Following the completion of the data collection, families who received the sleep&#xD;
      component would receive the mealtime component, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The existing parenting skills intervention is largely built on Troubled&#xD;
      Families: A Treatment Program, a manualized treatment approach with extensive empirical&#xD;
      support, selected as it is currently delivered by clinical psychology trainees at the&#xD;
      Psychological Clinic at Indiana University in Bloomington. The sleep intervention and control&#xD;
      intervention focusing on mealtime structure have been designed to be parallel in terms of&#xD;
      structure and length. Though neither intervention has been evaluated (both were developed for&#xD;
      this study), both incorporate treatment strategies with an empirical basis. The sleep&#xD;
      intervention focuses on sufficient sleep, healthy sleep habits, and a positive bedtime&#xD;
      routine, with optional modules to help address bedtime problems, night wakings, fears,&#xD;
      anxiety, and independent sleep. The mealtime intervention focuses on healthy mealtime habits&#xD;
      and mealtime routines, with optional modules to address picky eating and disruptive mealtime&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and measures: Some data will be recorded daily throughout the study,&#xD;
      including parent diary measures of child sleep and the main child misbehaviors&#xD;
      (noncompliance, tantrums, aggression). Other data will be collected in 4 major assessments&#xD;
      periods. The baseline assessment will occur at the end of the initial assessment with the&#xD;
      family and prior to the first treatment session. The midpoint assessment will occur prior to&#xD;
      the start of the discipline intervention, approximately six week after the start of&#xD;
      treatment. This assessment period allows for evaluation of disruptive behavior and sleep&#xD;
      following the sleep component and an introductory segment (Setting Up for Success), but prior&#xD;
      to the initiation of the core disruptive behavior / parenting intervention. In other words,&#xD;
      any improvements in disruptive behavior could be attributed largely to the sleep or mealtime&#xD;
      addition rather than the core parenting intervention. The second midpoint assessment will&#xD;
      occur following the core intervention, but prior to initiating the sleep/mealtime component&#xD;
      not previously covered. This allows for the evaluation of the combined sleep and disruptive&#xD;
      behavior interventions, as well as a comparison in treatment outcomes for those who received&#xD;
      the sleep component and those who received the mealtime/control component. A final assessment&#xD;
      will occur following the conclusion of treatment. Survey data will be collected using on-line&#xD;
      forms created in REDCap, and completed on a tablet that will be loaned to the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures were selected to assess sleep, disruptive behavior, child daytime functioning more&#xD;
      generally, and family functioning. An actigraph is worn by the child for one week during each&#xD;
      of the four assessment periods, with interpretation aided by the accompanying sleep diary. An&#xD;
      Empatica E3 device will be used to assess electro dermal activity (EDA) as a measure of&#xD;
      presleep arousal. The child will be asked to wear this device each evening from the start of&#xD;
      the bedtime routine through sleep onset, at which point the parent is asked to remove the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

      students at Indiana University in Bloomington, specifically Maureen McQuillan, Caroline&#xD;
