  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective equivalency study compares the performance of two Ophthalmic Cameras, the&#xD;
      Eyenez Retina Ophthalmic Camera v200 (OC) and the Optomed Smartscope M5 EY3 (OP). Trained&#xD;
      technicians will take pictures of the same patients' retinas and the quality of the photos&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The study includes healthy patients and patients with a spectrum of&#xD;
      retinal diseases. The study requires that technicians take pictures of the retinas of adult&#xD;
      patients between 18 and 80 years of age using both the OC and OP. The pictures will be&#xD;
      reviewed and compared by a central reader/Ophthalmologist, who will determine if the OC is&#xD;
      equivalent to the OP, based on the quality of the images&#xD;

      Subjects (patients) will be recruited via word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be approximately 1-2 weeks, assuming a recruitment rate of 15&#xD;
      subjects per week. The images will be recorded within 15 minutes and will involve minimal&#xD;
      disruption to the clinical workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Study Environment setting (Foothill Medical Offices), the User Interface will be&#xD;
      evaluated by comparing retinal pictures taken with subject device OC and predicate device OP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient subjects will be given an Information and Consent Form to complete prior to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technicians employed by Foothill Eye Clinic will operate the device on patient&#xD;
      participants by taking a retinal picture using OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technicians will use the predicate device OP to take retinal pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ophthalmologist will compare the results with the pictures taken by OC and OP. The&#xD;
      Ophthalmologist will be blinded to what picture was taken by which camera and record his&#xD;
      assessment of the quality for each picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient subjects will receive a standard of care exam with or without dilation.&#xD;
