      This study will be the first clinical trial to examine the impact of two different weight&#xD;
      loss interventions on novel mechanisms that promote obesity and impede its successful&#xD;
      treatment, including cognitive function and self-regulatory factors. The results will provide&#xD;
      important data about how impaired cognitive function and/or self-regulation promote obesity&#xD;
      and how different weight loss treatments may differentially impact these factors; this&#xD;
      information will be used to identify promising cognitive and self-regulatory treatment&#xD;
      targets for preventing further obesity development and for maintaining weight loss.&#xD;

      This K23 award will allow Dr. Misty Hawkins, a clinical psychologist with expertise in&#xD;
      behavioral medicine and obesity, to further develop into an independent investigator&#xD;
      proficient in physiological, neuropsychological, and self-regulatory research methods and&#xD;
      interventions that will allow her to study novel mechanisms of and treatments for obesity&#xD;
      maintenance. She has a career interest in intervening on the neuropsychological factors&#xD;
      related to obesity. Her research goal is to identify novel cognitive and self-regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms of obesity in this pilot trial which can then be targeted in larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce obesity development or to maintain weight loss. Obesity&#xD;
      continues to be a global epidemic, yet successful interventions for obesity are rare, with&#xD;
      80% of individuals in treatment programs being unsuccessful at achieving long-term weight&#xD;
      loss. The training and research activities in this K23 application will allow her to examine&#xD;
      the complexities of physiological dysregulation, cognitive deficits, and self-regulatory&#xD;
      failure in an obesity treatment study. The application proposes an intensive, 5-year program&#xD;
      of mentored research and formal training activities to enhance Dr. Hawkins' skills and&#xD;
      experience in: 1) basic research on and assessment of cognitive function; (2) assessment of&#xD;
      obesity-related physiological changes; (3) research with patient populations; (4) advanced&#xD;
      assessment of self-regulation (SR); and (5) the conduct of randomized clinical trials and&#xD;
      advanced statistics. In the long term, Dr. Hawkins will apply these translational research&#xD;
      skills to study targeted cognitive and self-regulation interventions as potentially effective&#xD;
      treatments for persons with obesity who may exhibit cognitive deficits or chronic&#xD;
      self-regulatory failure. The research component of this career development award is a&#xD;
      clinical trial examining the impact of two different weight loss treatments on physiological&#xD;
      markers, cognition, self-regulation, and health behaviors in 96 obese persons. The specific&#xD;
      aims are to: 1) Confirm that baseline obesity-related physiological dysregulation is linked&#xD;
      to cognitive deficits, poorer self-regulation, and obesogenic behaviors, 2) Demonstrate that&#xD;
      the two treatment groups have improvements in biomarkers, cognition, SR, and obesogenic&#xD;
      behaviors, less weight gain, and greater weight loss, and 3) Evaluate whether the&#xD;
      acceptance-based treatment (ABT) group has greater improvements in biomarkers, cognition, SR,&#xD;
      and obesogenic behaviors, less weight gain, and greater weight loss than the standard&#xD;
      behavioral treatment group (SBT) from pre- to post-treatment and 1-year follow-up. Oklahoma&#xD;
      State University and its research partner Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center provide&#xD;
      exceptional environments for Dr. Hawkins to gain the skills needed to achieve her goals. The&#xD;
      training component uses academic resources including the College of Arts and Sciences and the&#xD;
      Department of Psychology. Dr. Hawkins' mentors are highly regarded scientists in the areas of&#xD;
      obesity, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, nutrition, and patient-oriented research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **An open trial arm of ABT was added to the study in September 2016 to test feasibility of&#xD;
      ABT among members of Cherokee Nation. This arm is entitled POWER-UP: Pilot Of WEight&#xD;
      Reduction in Underserved Populations. Glucose is the only biomarker being measured in&#xD;
      POWER-UP.&#xD;

    <description>For the Standard Behavioral Treatment (SBT) condition, participants will participate in the standard behavioral weight loss programming, which utilizes strategies from existing obesity treatments (e.g., the Diabetes Prevention Program). These features include the following: 1) nutritional education, 2) diet and physical activity, 3) expectations for daily self-monitoring of calorie intake and activity, 4) stimulus control, behavior shaping, behavior analysis, and relapse prevention strategies, and 5) social support.</description>

    <description>The Acceptance-Based Treatment (ABT) group will receive most features listed in the SBT arm as well as unique ABT training designed to help individuals increase awareness of their cognitive and affective experiences, and the following exercises: 1) identifying weight-related goals from personal life values (e.g., health) and connecting these values to day-to-day eating, 2) increasing awareness of moment-by-moment behavior choices, 3) tolerating aversive internal states that include eating-related states as well as affective states such as stress, sadness, and anxiety (i.e., &quot;urge-surfing&quot;). These strategies that have been empirically tested and found to be effective in the NIH-funded Mind Your Health RCT (R21DK080430).</description>
