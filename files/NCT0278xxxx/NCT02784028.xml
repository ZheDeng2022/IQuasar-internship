  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digestive cancer is the second cause of death worldwide. The presence of peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis is common in the evolution of this type of cancer, as well as increased levels&#xD;
      of ACE. This peritoneal carcinomatosis is often underestimated, this being due to low&#xD;
      sensitivity detection means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, it has been shown that peritoneal carcinomatosis surgery as complete as&#xD;
      possible associated with an intraperitoneal chemotherapy gave better results but still&#xD;
      failures associated with the presence of microscopic residual tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of SGM -101 (developped by SURGIMAB SAS) allows surgeons to detect tumor nodules of&#xD;
      small size very easily, in real-time, during surgery (shown in animals).&#xD;

      failures associated with the presence of microscopic residual tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGM -101 (developped by SURGIMAB SAS) is a fluorescent antibody that binds to ACE which is&#xD;
      overespressed at the surface of tumor cells. The use of this fluorescent molecule allows&#xD;
      surgeons to detect tumor nodules of small size very easily, in real-time, during surgery&#xD;
      (shown in animals).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cytologically or histologic proven primary or recurrent digestive adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
             eligible for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, presume resectable, assessed by imaging (CT&#xD;
             scan (Computed Tomography Scanner) and / or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)) or&#xD;
             during a previous abdominal surgery,,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CEA positivity by immunohistochemistry on specimen of primary tumor or recurrence&#xD;
             lesion, or circulating plasma CEA ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal range (ULN),&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology group) &lt; 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of at least three months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. AST (Aspartate AminoTransferase), ALT (Alanine AminoTransferase) and Alkaline&#xD;
