    <textblock>
      Persistent pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain is common, 2-5% av all women given birth is&#xD;
      suffering from disabling daily pain with high impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective double-blinded randomised controlled trial will be performed with a baseline&#xD;
      assessment 7-10 months after childbirth with follow-up directly and 6 months after a&#xD;
      treatment period with low level laser therapy (LLLT) or sham laser treatment, given at 12&#xD;
      planned treatment sessions during four weeks. 60 women will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If LLLT can reduce pain and improve function there will be a new treatment option for this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective double-blinded randomised controlled trial will be performed with a baseline&#xD;
      assessment 7-10 months after childbirth with follow-up directly and 6 months after a&#xD;
      treatment period with low level laser therapy (LLLT) or sham laser treatment, given at 12&#xD;
      planned treatment sessions during four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 women will be sampled consecutively. Women eligible to participate will be&#xD;
      those women who were registered at a maternal health care unit in the municipalities of&#xD;
      Sundsvall and Timrå with subsequent childbirth registered at the Sundsvall-Härnösand County&#xD;
      Hospital, Sweden. An invitation letter with a prepaid response envelope will be sent by&#xD;
      postal mail to the eligible women by contact information retrieved from the labour ward.&#xD;
      Women who respond will be enrolled and approve their participation by signed informed&#xD;
      consent. The women will be included in the study according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria following a baseline assessment that comprises a urinary test, questionnaires and&#xD;
      clinical examination. After inclusion a blood sample, for serum and plasma, will be drawn at&#xD;
      inclusion and directly after the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding The randomisation sequence will be generated by a statistician not&#xD;
      involved in the study. Randomisation will be done using block randomisation (block size 4 or&#xD;
      6) without stratification. The investigators will use sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes which have been pre-prepared in advance by the statistician. Women who fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomised to active laser treatment or sham laser treatment. A&#xD;
      research assistant not involved in the inclusion assessments will perform the randomisation,&#xD;
      prepare and handle the allocated treatment device before and after each treatment session.&#xD;
      The treatment will be given by a physiotherapist who is blinded to treatment group, the&#xD;
      women's case history, questionnaires and clinical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be handled, stored and analysed at the Department of Public Health&#xD;
      and Caring Sciences at Uppsala University. The analysts will be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      allocation until data of primary outcomes have been analysed and conclusions have been drawn&#xD;
      and signed in writing before the code is broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires At baseline, the women will complete questionnaires which include questions on&#xD;
      socio-demographic data, somatic and mental health, gynaecological and obstetric history, and&#xD;
      lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and follow-ups, the women will report present pain distribution on a pain drawing&#xD;
      (including onset and modality of pain). Pain intensity at present and as worst during the&#xD;
      past week will be measured by a 100 mm VAS (Visual analogue scale). Functioning will be&#xD;
      assessed by Disability Rating Index (DRI), Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) and Short Form&#xD;
      36 (SF-36). Throughout the treatment period, the women will daily record pain intensity in a&#xD;
      pain diary by use of a 100 mm VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up after the treatment period the women will complete a Global Perceived Effect&#xD;
      scale, report any adverse event, and report their opinion on whether or not they have&#xD;
      received active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination The two assessors, a gynaecologist and a physiotherapist, will perform&#xD;
      the examinations without knowledge of assigned treatment, the women's case history,&#xD;
      questionnaire replies and clinical examinations. The test procedure and test sequence will be&#xD;
      the same throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gynaecologic examination, including an ultrasound examination, will be performed by a&#xD;
      gynaecologist at baseline. Provoked pain by a gentle pressure on the following 13&#xD;
      predetermined intra-pelvic anatomical landmarks will be assessed via vaginal palpation: the&#xD;
      coccyx, the lateral part of sacrum at the insertion of the sacrospinous ligament, the middle&#xD;
      part of the sacrospinous ligament, the insertion of the sacrospinous ligament at the&#xD;
      ischiadic spine, the ischium inferior to the ilio-ischial fusion and the lateral and medial&#xD;
      part of the pubic bone. All the structures will be examined bilaterally except for the&#xD;
      coccyx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The musculoskeletal examinations at baseline and follow-ups will be performed by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. It will include examination of the lower back spine, pelvis and assessment&#xD;
      of physical functioning. Briefly, the lower back spine will be examined by palpation of&#xD;
      ligaments and paravertebral muscles, Kemp's foramina test, Valsalva test, SLR (straight leg&#xD;
      raising test) and test of tendon reflexes and sensibility. The pelvis will be examined by the&#xD;
      following tests: P4 test, Menell's test, Patrick's faber test, modified Trendelenburg test&#xD;
      and the pubic symphysis palpation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain provocation tests will be considered positive if they duplicate or aggravate pain from&#xD;
      the sacral area on the tested side, otherwise negative. The women will grade the provoked&#xD;
      pain on a 100 mm VAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical functioning will be assessed at baseline and follow-up by the Six Minute Walk Test&#xD;
      (6MWT), the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), the Active Straight Leg Raising Test (ASLR) and&#xD;
      isometric trunk muscle tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and blood sampling A urinary test will be sampled for test of hCG, human Chorionic&#xD;
      Gonadotropin (pregnancy), at time of inclusion. A blood sample, for serum and plasma, will be&#xD;
      drawn at inclusion and directly after the treatment period. The blood samples will be&#xD;
      analysed directly for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, sexual binding globulin, thyroid&#xD;
      stimulating hormone and prolactin and thereafter discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen The treatment comprises 12 treatment sessions distributed as one treatment&#xD;
      daily at three consecutive days during the first treatment week and then three times a week&#xD;
      every other weekday during the next three weeks. The treatment will be given by a licensed&#xD;
      physiotherapist blinded for the allocated treatment. The treatment will start immediately&#xD;
      after a menstrual period or within one week's time among women with regained menstrual&#xD;
      periods, otherwise at any time convenient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the treatment period the women will be asked to avoid pain provoking activities,&#xD;
      the use of corticosteroid treatment, and sexual intercourse without use of safe&#xD;
      contraception. Before each treatment the women will sign a form stating no unprotected&#xD;
      intercourse since last treatment session. The women report use of pain medication and&#xD;
      physical activity at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment equipment and performance A class IV low level laser (LiteCure LCT-1000®) and a&#xD;
      similar sham laser will be used. Both devices are delivered by LiteCure, LLC, Newark, DE,&#xD;
      USA. The active device delivers its energy by two wavelengths, 20% of the beam with 810 nm&#xD;
      (nanometer) and 80% of the beam with 980 nm. Energy given will be tested before the start of&#xD;
      the study and once every month, using Thor labs power meter PM100D and the photo sensor S 121&#xD;
      C, to make sure the device works correctly. There is also a red aiming beam with a wavelength&#xD;
      of 650 nm and a power of 5 mW (milliwatt). The sham laser delivers solely the aiming beam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is applied to the sacral region by a standard laser probe with a 26 mm quarts&#xD;
      ball at the top, and to the internal pelvis by a 16 cm long fibre-containing transvaginal&#xD;
      probe with a diameter of the bulb-shaped end of 18 mm. The physical therapist and the&#xD;
      participant use safety eyewear during all treatment sessions and the treatment administration&#xD;
      area is closed, have restricted access and no reflective surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment at sacral points, the standard probe is moved 1 cm/second from a starting&#xD;
      point to an end-point repeatedly during treatment time, bilaterally. The standard probe is&#xD;
      held perpendicular to the body surface and pressed to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment vaginally the physiotherapist palpates the anatomical landmarks by vaginal&#xD;
      palpation to guide the transvaginal probe and hold it still on the treatment sites. Due to&#xD;
      reasons of hygiene the transvaginal probe is covered by transparent plastic cover during&#xD;
      treatment. The plastic cover is discarded and both probes are cleaned with ethanol-based&#xD;
      surface disinfection after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment locations on the outside of the pelvis The treatment on the outside of the pelvis&#xD;
      is given on three sites defined by a given starting point and a treatment area. The starting&#xD;
      point of treatment is described by vertical and horizontal coordinates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment locations on the inside of the pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment sites inside the pelvis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the sacrospinous ligament at the insertion on the ischial spine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at the middle of the sacrospinous ligament&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the sacrospinous ligament at the insertion on the sacrum medially and in the level of&#xD;
           the ischial spine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment dose To deliver an appropriate dose of energy according to the best available&#xD;
      evidence and experience, the active treatment group received LLLT with a dual wavelength of&#xD;
      810 nm and 980 nm and a dose of 10 J/cm² vaginally and 10 J/cm² over the sacral areas. The&#xD;
      control group will receive sham treatment by a red aiming beam with a power of 5 mW with the&#xD;
      same treatment time as the active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a woman experiences a negative reaction or does not tolerate the treatment dose, the&#xD;
      treatment will immediately be stopped. The amount of energy given at each treatment session&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Power calculation To show a statistically significant difference of at least 20&#xD;
      mm in pain intensity (considered as a clinically relevant difference) measured by visual&#xD;
      analogue scale between the active treatment group and the control group, at least 32 women&#xD;
      will be needed with the assumptions of type I error of 5% and type II error of 20%. To take&#xD;
      account for data loss the investigators aim at a sample size of at least 30 women in each&#xD;
      group, in total 60 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The analyses of outcomes will be performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      European Medicines Agency's Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials guidelines.&#xD;
      Differences between the treatment groups regarding outcome measures will be analysed by&#xD;
      regression analysis of variance on ranks. Other parametric and non-parametric statistical&#xD;
      methods will be used whenever appropriate. Two-sided tests will be used and 5% statistical&#xD;
      significance level will be chosen for all analyses. To provide unbiased comparisons between&#xD;
      the groups the investigators will be perform an intention-to-treat analysis. Also, a&#xD;
      per-protocol analysis on the women who complete the study according to the protocol will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The use of the LLLT devices is approved by Swedish and European&#xD;
      authorities (Reference number 2014/188, dated140811) and is supposed to have minimal side&#xD;
      effects. The present study is approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala (Dnr&#xD;
      2014 / 188). All women will sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent potential injury or harm, the vaginal probe will be used with care. Also, a&#xD;
      gynaecologic examination will be performed before start of study treatment. The effect of low&#xD;
      level laser irradiation to an early pregnancy is not known; therefore potential harm will be&#xD;
      sought minimised by a test of hCG at study inclusion. Also written statements of no sexual&#xD;
      intercourse without safe contraception will be given before each treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical therapist and the participant will use safety eyewear during all treatment&#xD;
      sessions and the treatment administration area will be closed, have restricted access and&#xD;
      will be without reflective surfaces. Finally, our perception is that the advantages of the&#xD;
      study treatment outweigh ethical problems. All of the researchers declare no conflict of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
