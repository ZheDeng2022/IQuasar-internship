    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled blinded study in patients treated for Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS) in the mixed medical-surgical intensive care units (ICU) of four academic&#xD;
      teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran were conducted to examine the effects of Varied&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Techniques on Survivors of ARDS patients. Patients were randomized in the&#xD;
      emergency department at the time of ICU admission to one of four groups labeled groups 1, 2,&#xD;
      3 and 4, respectively.&#xD;

      The intervention package had three phases including pre-intervention, intervention, and&#xD;
      post-intervention phases. Pre-intervention: During the pre-intervention phase, patients&#xD;
      completed the quality-of-life assessment (SF-36), perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ-14),&#xD;
      and State and Trait Anxiety, Barthel Index (BI) and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale&#xD;
      (K10) questionnaires as well as a Six-minute walk test (6MWT), and 51 times walking per 5&#xD;
      years (at discharge, month 1 to month 42 (each month), and months 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63,&#xD;
      and 66). A rehabilitation plan was formulated incorporating considerations for the patient's&#xD;
      identified strengths' and weaknesses. See the RP section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Once discharged, patients called their study nurse every 2 days to report any&#xD;
      problems or complications. Patients were evaluated by their primary multidisciplinary medical&#xD;
      team including their pulmonologist, intensivist, internist, psychologist, psychiatrist,&#xD;
      physical therapist, and occupational therapist on a weekly basis and at 30 days. At each&#xD;
      visit, the patient was interviewed, underwent a physical examination, pulmonary-function&#xD;
      testing (PFT), posterior-anterior and lateral (PA-Lat) chest radiography (CXR), resting&#xD;
      oximetry, a standardized 6MWT with continuous oximetry, free walking test as long as the&#xD;
      stamina and capability of patient, and laboratory tests as indicated. At other times, if&#xD;
      patients experienced a problem or complication, they notified investigators and presented to&#xD;
      either their multidisciplinary medical team or their primary care provider for evaluation.&#xD;
      Patients in the group 1 received rehabilitation employing the mixed model: Family-Centered&#xD;
      Empowerment Model (FCEM) and Continuous Care Model (CCM). Group 2 received rehabilitation&#xD;
      employing the FCEM, and Group 3 employed CCM, each in 4 stages. Stage 1 of the intervention&#xD;
      was awareness and cognition. The patient was evaluated for their insight into their perceived&#xD;
      illness severity and perceived sensitivity, or the degree to which they felt threatened by&#xD;
      their illness. This was performed by means of 3-5 group sessions in the pre-intervention&#xD;
      phase. Group sessions included 3-5 patients and lasted for 45-60 min each. Session content&#xD;
      included assessments of the participants' psychological and physical conditions as well as&#xD;
      their attitude towards the nature, definition, risk factors, symptoms, medical and nursing&#xD;
      care, and complications resulting from the ARDS. In stage 2, patients were assessed for their&#xD;
      expectations over 3-5 one-hour sessions. Groups of 3-4 patients shared and learnt from each&#xD;
      other under the moderation and guidance of the principal researcher. In stage 3, the degree&#xD;
      of patient acceptance was assessed using an educational participation method in group&#xD;
      discussion. Patients reached practical solutions through using the problem-solving findings&#xD;
      of the previous stage. Stage 4 consisted of formative and summative evaluations. The aim of&#xD;
      the formative evaluation was to encourage patients to internalize their locus of control by&#xD;
      encouraging personal responsibility about issues of health and seeing his/her&#xD;
      self-empowerment. Summative evaluations were performed to evaluate the influence of the&#xD;
      intervention on the study's medical outcomes. The study's medical outcomes were assessed in&#xD;
      pre intervention, measurement 2 (10-day post intervention), measurement 3 (three-month post&#xD;
      measurement 2), and ten following ups includes six three-month periods (6, 9, 12, 15, 18,&#xD;
      21), four six-month periods (27, 33, 39, 45), and two twelve-month period (57, and 69) after&#xD;
      intervention by deploying FCEM and CCM questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention follow-up: Phase 3 began 90 days following pre-intervention (control&#xD;
      group), and 90 days after measurement 3 in three intervention groups. To assess the&#xD;
      durability and stability of patient empowerment, patient knowledge, attitude and practice&#xD;
      (KAP) was assessed over ten follow-up sessions with mentioned intervals. During the 66-month&#xD;
      follow-up period, patients attended a total of 56 support-group webinars addressing topics&#xD;
      including returning to work, intimate relationships, nutrition, sleep hygiene, tobacco use,&#xD;
      exercise, and leisure activities as well as testing and laboratory issues. Follow-up&#xD;
      interviews were conducted during home visits, when available, or with the assistance of&#xD;
      telephone, Skype, Viber or WhatsApp according to patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the Designee: Following informed consent, the designated family member or friend&#xD;
      (hereafter called designee) continued through the study with the patient as a 'unit'. The&#xD;
      designee attended the patient's educational sessions during stages 3 and 4, with stage 2&#xD;
      being according to the family member preference. Recall that stage 2 deals with patient&#xD;
      expectations, stage 3 with patient acceptance and problem-solving, and stage 4 with&#xD;
      evaluations and internalizing his/her locus of control. The designee and the patient attended&#xD;
      the same sessions, and studied the same learning materials. Up to eight family members were&#xD;
      allowed to join in the educational sessions if requested. In stage 3, the designee was&#xD;
      charged with learning and reinforcing educational material with the patient. In stage 4, when&#xD;
      instructed by study investigators, the designee would administer the KAP assessments to the&#xD;
      patient. In addition to scores, the designee would provide additional information on the&#xD;
      patient's home situation and current condition. Patients were assigned a code, and&#xD;
      de-identified data were transmitted from the designee to investigators either by encrypted&#xD;
      email, telephone, mail or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation plan: All patients had similar inpatient rehabilitation programs. For patients&#xD;
      in the three intervention groups, outpatient rehab included daily exercise for 0-2 h/day.&#xD;
      Exercise occurred between 8:00 and 10:00, and types included walking, jogging, bicycle,&#xD;
      swimming, or other exercise according to patient preference or resource availability and&#xD;
      confirmed by multidisciplinary medical team. Daily exercise was supervised by designated&#xD;
      family members. Investigators randomly attended sessions in an unannounced fashion. Although&#xD;
      not routinely involved, multidisciplinary medical team consultations were available on&#xD;
      investigator request. Exercise data were independently collected from the patient and their&#xD;
      designated family member on a weekly basis (κ statistic=0.94). To measure the patients'&#xD;
      walking distance, investigators provided them with a Fit bit (Fit bit, San Francisco, USA).&#xD;
      Routine care included education on smoking cessation and education on food selection.&#xD;
      Patients were provided printed materials, with dietician assessments available on request.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group received the same education and printed materials during their&#xD;
      inpatient course. Patients exercised daily, at any time, for ≤2 h according to patient&#xD;
      tolerance. Sessions were supervised by family members. Investigators did not attend sessions.&#xD;
      Exercise data were independently collected from the patient and their designated family&#xD;
      member on a weekly basis (κ statistic=0.22). Again, walking distance was measured using the&#xD;
      Fit bit. Routine care included education on smoking cessation and education on food&#xD;
      selection. Patients were provided printed materials, with dietician assessments available on&#xD;
      request.&#xD;
