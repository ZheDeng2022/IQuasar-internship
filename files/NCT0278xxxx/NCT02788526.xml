  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancies worldwide and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Surgical resection is still the main radical approach&#xD;
      for HCC, but the recurrence rate after hepatectomy is very high, which hampers the further&#xD;
      improvement of prognosis of HCC patients. The conventional risk factors of recurrence&#xD;
      including: huge tumor, multiple lesions, vessels invasion and tumor rupture. Recently, the&#xD;
      microvessels invasion (MVI) has been recognized a novel risk factor of recurrence after&#xD;
      hepatectomy. The investigators' previous study showed that the recurrence rate is more than&#xD;
      50% for the patients with &gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI. The MVI was confirmed as the only&#xD;
      independent risk factor for the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients in multiple&#xD;
      variables analysis. It is important to reduce the recurrence and prolong the survival of&#xD;
      patients after hepatectomy with effective adjuvant therapy. TACE has been utilized as an&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy, but its significance is still unknown. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators design the current prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of adjuvant TACE to reduce the recurrence in HCC patients at high risk (&gt;5cm solitary tumor&#xD;
      and MVI) after resection, compared to vigilant follow-up.&#xD;

      The patients with solitary tumor more than 5cm and microvessels invasion after radical&#xD;
      hepatectomy were randomized to receive adjuvant TACEï¼ˆ1~2 cycles, 4~6 weeks) or follow-up. The&#xD;
      main endpoint: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival(DFS), and safety were compared&#xD;
      between this two groups.&#xD;
