  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the commonest form of acute flaccid paralysis and the&#xD;
      incidence is high in low-income countries. In Bangladesh, most GBS patients are poor.&#xD;
      Therefore patients cannot afford expensive specific treatments like intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis (PE) in part explaining the high mortality and&#xD;
      disability compared to treated patients in high-income countries. Added difficulty in&#xD;
      traditional PE is its unavailability and specialized device and manpower dependency. Most&#xD;
      research in GBS has been conducted in high-income countries, largely in patients with a&#xD;
      demyelinating form of GBS. Axonal form of GBS is common in low-income and Asian countries&#xD;
      which has a different pathogenesis, clinical course and outcome than the demyelinating form.&#xD;
      Very few therapeutic studies have been conducted in low-income countries due to expensive&#xD;
      existing modalities of treatment. Here, the investigators propose SVPE as a treatment for GBS&#xD;
      in patients from low-income countries. SVPE is relatively cheap, can be done at the bedside&#xD;
      without any special device or electricity and eventually is expected to help poor severely&#xD;
      affected GBS patients in underdeveloped and developing countries. The main outcomes will be&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of SVPE since this is yet to be established in the resource&#xD;
      limited settings. To be able to evaluate the safety of SVPE, additional information will be&#xD;
      acquired about the frequency of complications in non-GBS patients with a central line,&#xD;
      treated during the same time period at the same study facility as the GBS patients. Severe&#xD;
      sepsis due to central line associated blood stream infection and deep venous thrombosis in&#xD;
      the limb where the central venous catheter will be inserted during or following the SVPE&#xD;
      procedure, will be defined as severe adverse effect (SAE) and will be considered as primary&#xD;
      outcome measure for safety. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid and other relevant biological&#xD;
      specimens will be analysed for diagnosis and screening for infections. In addition clinical&#xD;
      and neurological outcome assessment will be monitored until discharge of the patient from the&#xD;
      hospital and up to four weeks since study entry. Confirmation of feasibility and safety, will&#xD;
      eventually lead to a randomized control trial in future with a primary focus on the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of SVPE for the treatment of GBS in developing countries as an alternative for the&#xD;
      conventional treatment with IVIg or PE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this safety and feasibility study, 20 GBS patients will be enrolled for SVPE as per&#xD;
      protocol criteria. Clinometric measurements (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), neurological examination) along with documentation of central line&#xD;
      associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) and other complications related to central venous&#xD;
      (CV) catheter will be conducted daily and throughout the course of SVPE until the 2nd day of&#xD;
      the withdrawal of the CV catheter according to a predefined protocol. Diagnosed or strongly&#xD;
      suspected CLABSI and central venous catheter related deep venous thrombosis (DVT) will be&#xD;
      followed up for definite outcome to determine the frequency of severe adverse events&#xD;
      attributed to CLABSI until the patient discharges from the hospital. Neurological outcome&#xD;
      will be documented according to several disability assessment scales throughout the SVPE&#xD;
      until discharge and up to four weeks from the enrollment of the GBS patients. In addition,&#xD;
      the safety of the SVPE in GBS patients will be compared with the background complication risk&#xD;
      by determining the frequency of complications in non-GBS patients treated with a CV catheter&#xD;
      at the same intensive care unit (ICU) during the same period using the same protocol for&#xD;
      surveillance as in SVPE-treated GBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SVPE kit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SVPE kit will be prepared with one blood transfusion set and two saline infusion sets&#xD;
      connected with a tri channel device. On the other end the blood transfusion set will be&#xD;
      connected with the blood bag, one saline infusion set is connected with 1 liter normal saline&#xD;
      mixed with 2500 unit of un fractionated heparin and one saline infusion set is connected with&#xD;
      500 ml hexa-ethyl starch solution. All the tubes should be made air free by fluid column from&#xD;
      respective bag. The tri channel is then attached to the central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure of SVPE for GBS patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the SVPE set is prepared, patient's whole blood will be drawn from central venous&#xD;
      catheter according to body weight (7 ml/kg) in each session in the blood transfusion bag with&#xD;
      gravitation force placing the blood bag below central venous catheter tip level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood column in the transfusion set and in the central venous catheter will be cleared&#xD;
      with normal saline mixed heparin solution attached previously through the side channel. The&#xD;
      blood bag will be hung beside the patient in a saline stand uninterrupted to separate the&#xD;
      plasma and blood cells which will eventually take 2.5 hours with gravitation. Blood cells&#xD;
      will be infused back to the patient and plasma will be discarded and replaced by Fresh Frozen&#xD;
      Plasma (FFP) and colloid solution alternately in equal volume through the side channel. One&#xD;
      blood bag will be used each day for 6 sessions. At the beginning of each session 70 ml of&#xD;
      heparin solution will be taken in the blood bag from the heparin mixed normal saline as&#xD;
      anticoagulant. Six sessions will be done daily for consecutive 8 days. A total of 48 sessions&#xD;
      will be done in eight days. These six sessions of small volume plasma exchange per day in an&#xD;
      adult patient will remove approximately 1200 ml of plasma daily and eventually 9600 ml of&#xD;
      plasma will be removed in total 48 sessions. All connection ports and tri channels of the&#xD;
      central venous catheter, the blood bag and the saline bag are disinfected by using alcohol&#xD;
      70% then dried on air before sampling blood or (dis)connection. These procedures are&#xD;
      performed aseptically. Internationally, endorsed guidelines on central venous catheter blood&#xD;
      stream infection prevention is followed throughout the entire period of the SVPE procedure.&#xD;
      Total active interference with the patient in each session will be 30 minutes and total daily&#xD;
      active interference with the patient will be three hours with a Daily schedule at 8AM, 11AM,&#xD;
      2PM, 5PM, 8PM and 11PM. Plasma replacement will be done alternately using fresh frozen plasma&#xD;
      and colloid solution (Hexa ethyl starch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (1.5 mg/kg) will be given at least two&#xD;
      hours before the onset of SVPE. Thereafter daily maintenance dose of subcutaneous low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin (1.5 mg/kg) will be continued for eight days or until SVPE&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication of anti-platelet therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with excessive clotting tendency despite receiving low molecular weight heparin will&#xD;
      be subjected for evaluation of platelet activation. If the bleeding time is reduced by &gt;50%&#xD;
      of the baseline of the particular GBS patient, investigators will introduce anti-platelet&#xD;
      medication. A loading oral dose of aspirin (500 mg) and clopidogrel (600 mg) will be given at&#xD;
      least two hours before the next session of SVPE. Thereafter daily maintenance dose of oral&#xD;
      aspirin (150 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) along with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      (1.5 mg/kg) will be continued for eight days or until SVPE completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of SVPE procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the safety of SVPE, the six daily sessions of SVPE will be documented in terms of&#xD;
      duration and amount of the plasma removed in each session, type and volume of replacement&#xD;
      fluid and fresh frozen plasma used, and any inconvenience compromising the SVPE sessions&#xD;
      temporarily or permanently. Any difficulties hampering SVPE, which currently cannot be&#xD;
      anticipated, will be documented as verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of hemodynamic parameters and autonomic disturbance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the procedure, haemodynamic status including blood pressure, heart rate, any&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia, oxygen (%) saturation in peripheral blood, fluid intake and output will&#xD;
      be monitored daily as per standard practice in all ICU patients. Blood coagulability will be&#xD;
      monitored with prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time (BT) every alternate day. Autonomic&#xD;
      parameters will be documented daily as per the presence of high or low blood pressure,&#xD;
      increased or decreased pulse rate, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, bladder and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction, pupillary abnormality, unusual sweating or hyper salivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Features of infections including pyrexia, leukocytosis in peripheral blood, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein and evidence of focal infections like positive blood, throat/tracheal aspirate or&#xD;
      urine culture for pathogenic organisms etc. will be documented per protocol as per respective&#xD;
      standard case record forms for specific hospital acquired infections (HAI). Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory evidence of HAI especially CLABSI will be monitored and explored at anytime during&#xD;
      the SVPE procedure until the second day of withdrawal of the central venous catheter. A&#xD;
      definite or strongly suspected CLABSI will be followed up until discharge to document the&#xD;
      ultimate fate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of HAI and complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infection is considered HAI if all elements of a Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC/NHSN) site - specific infection criterion&#xD;
      are all present on or after the third calendar day of admission to the facility. Any&#xD;
      infection before the third calendar day of admission will be considered as infection present&#xD;
      on admission, except in case of CLABSI; which can occur even on day two of central venous&#xD;
      catheter insertion. CLABSI, primary and secondary bloodstream infections sepsis and severe&#xD;
      sepsis will be the main focus for infection documentation. All the patients eligible as per&#xD;
      the enrolment criteria for CLABSI surveillance will be monitored from admission to the ICU.&#xD;
      Ventilator associated pneumonia and catheter associated urinary tract infection will also be&#xD;
      monitored using established guidelines in order to have a more specific rate of CLABSI and&#xD;
      related complications. Appropriate clinical data, imaging, specimens for biochemical and&#xD;
      microscopic examination and culture will be documented at specific time points defined as per&#xD;
      specific HAI check list . Device associated complications include central venous catheter&#xD;
      occlusion, haemorrhage and deep venous thrombosis. All these safety margin indicators will be&#xD;
      defined as per specific guideline definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use antimicrobial agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any infection will be treated by antimicrobial agents accordingly. Choice of the antibiotics&#xD;
      (oral or intravenous) will be based on the site of infection, specific organisms isolated&#xD;
      and/or severity of the infection reflected in clinical and laboratory features of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response (raised total white blood cell (WBC) count (&gt;11,000/c mm of blood),&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (&gt;40 mg/L) or positive culture of pathogenic organisms) and choices are&#xD;
      made after consultation of a microbiologist. Appropriate lower generations of antibiotics for&#xD;
      predicted site specific infection will be administered first if necessary before considering&#xD;
      subsequent higher generations until the culture sensitivity report is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for withholding plasma exchange:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of severe or terminal concurrent medical illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotension (30 mm Hg decrease of systolic blood pressure or systolic blood pressure&lt;90&#xD;
           or mean arterial pressure (MAP)&lt;65mm Hg) after start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for resuming plasma exchange:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Return of blood pressure to baseline or systolic blood pressure&gt;90 or MAP&lt;65.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After management of anaphylactic reaction following FFP or saline infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for replacement of central venous catheter (CVC) to another site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. CLABSI or catheter insertion site infection associated with CVC is diagnosed or strongly&#xD;
      suspected as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for guide wire replacement of central venous catheter (CVC) to the same site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Complete CVC occlusion despite anticoagulant or thrombolytic administration in absence of&#xD;
      features of CLABSI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication for blood transfusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Anemia with hemoglobin concentration below 7 gm/dl during and after the SVPE procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When to stop the trial (Stopping rule):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For feasibility purpose: A predictive success rate of 75% will be set regarding the SVPE&#xD;
      procedure. If in more than 5 out of 20 SVPE procedure violates the protocol, the procedure&#xD;
      will be considered not feasible and modification of the SVPE procedure will be considered&#xD;
      before any further re-evaluation of modified procedure for feasibility along with safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety purpose: A prior distribution of the success rate with regard to severe adverse&#xD;
      effect (SAE) will be set as 75%. The investigators will consider severe sepsis due to CLABSI&#xD;
      and venous thrombosis related to CVC use as SAE. If &gt;5 patients had SAE at or before&#xD;
      completion of SVPE in 20 GBS patients; the study will be stopped. Otherwise an RCT will be&#xD;
      planned subsequently to evaluate the neurological efficacy of the SVPE procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline documentation and Initial screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood count including haemoglobin in g/L, total and differential WBC and platelet&#xD;
      count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, serum bilirubin and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) will be documented&#xD;
      as baseline status for GBS patients with SVPE along with screening for hepatitis B, C and&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of anti-ganglioside antibodies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum concentration of anti-ganglioside antibodies (GM1 and GD1A) will be measured at the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of SVPE to observe the trend in titre change in the serum of GBS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation at the end of SVPE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second day after removal of the central venous line, baseline documentations will be&#xD;
      re evaluated. These include complete blood count including haemoglobin in g/L, total and&#xD;
      differential WBC and platelet count and ESR, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, serum bilirubin and SGPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of neurological function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological examination will be performed to see the clinical trend of motor, sensory &amp;&#xD;
      autonomic parameters before, during the procedure and subsequently in the follow up of the&#xD;
      patients up to four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Motor function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different clinical assessment scales will be used to monitor changes in motor function. These&#xD;
      are the GBS disability Score, Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score, Rasch-built MRC&#xD;
      score, Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS), Rasch-built Overall Disability Score&#xD;
      (R-ODS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatic and Gnostic sensation over the limbs will be examined bilaterally. Somatic sensation&#xD;
      will be evaluated by examining fine and crud touch and pain sensation over the specific&#xD;
      dermatomal regions and gnostic sensation will be evaluated by position &amp; vibration sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic parameters will be documented as per the presence of high or low blood pressure,&#xD;
      increased or decreased pulse rate, cardiac arrhythmia, bladder and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction, pupillary abnormality, unusual sweating, hyper salivation and abnormality in&#xD;
      hair growth.&#xD;
