      The purpose of this study is to evaluate 4-dose levels of CCRE Lot 94332B1 (0.6, 1.0, 2.0,&#xD;
      and 4.0 ng/kg). This study is known as, an &quot;endotoxin challenge.&quot; Thousands of healthy&#xD;
      subjects worldwide over the last 20 years have participated in endotoxin challenge studies as&#xD;
      part of clinical research and clinical drug development programs. This study will only test&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of CCRE Lot 94332B1.&#xD;

      Normal healthy subjects will be recruited and consented for the study. Following completion&#xD;
      of the study, the bio-marker samples will be sent to Dr. Anthony Suffredini a collaborator&#xD;
      and Deputy Chief &amp; Senior Investigator Department of Critical Care Medicine at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH). All samples will be de-identified and analyzed at the NIH; the&#xD;
      results of which will be reviewed by both Drs. Suffredini and Noveck. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed at the NIH by the Department of Statistics from which manuscripts will be&#xD;
      written for publication.&#xD;

             or &lt;60 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the median of&#xD;
             the three systolic and the median of the three diastolic BP values should be used to&#xD;

             bpm, the HR should be repeated two more times and the median of the three HR values&#xD;

             the subject is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating HR &lt; 50 bpm, QTc &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at&#xD;
             screening of check-in. If the heart rate or QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120&#xD;
             msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the median of the three QTc values&#xD;
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. If the median value for any of&#xD;
             these parameters is outside the limit specified, the subject is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements, especially those&#xD;

             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving endotoxin. Limited use of&#xD;
             non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the&#xD;
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis. Use of any&#xD;
             steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within 7 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) of admission of each period is specifically&#xD;
             prohibited due to potential confounding effects on the study PD endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of frequent headaches (&gt;2 per month) or migraines or headaches from an absence&#xD;
             of caffeine from coffee, tea, chocolate, or other caffeine-related substances&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 56 days prior to dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Surgically sterile (removal of both ovaries and/ or uterus at least 12 months&#xD;
                  prior to dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24&#xD;
                  consecutive months prior to dosing on Day -1 and with an FSH level at screening&#xD;
                  of ≥ 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
                  screening and negative urine pregnancy at check-in, and must agree to avoid&#xD;
                  pregnancy during study. Pregnancy is tested at screening, during check-in, and at&#xD;
                  any given time if deemed necessary by the PI or designate. During the study,&#xD;
                  women of child-bearing potential must use two acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
                  at the same time. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) documented&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization (such as a hysterectomy), (2) barrier methods (such as a&#xD;
                  condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or the use of a condom with a&#xD;
                  spermicide and (3) hormonal contraception (combination oral contraceptives,&#xD;
                  transdermal patch, injectables, implantables or vaginal ring) or (4) an&#xD;
                  intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Abstinence is not an&#xD;
                  acceptable form of contraception in this study.&#xD;

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
