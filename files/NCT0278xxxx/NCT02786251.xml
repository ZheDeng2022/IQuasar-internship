  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has led to a paradigm&#xD;
      shift in adipose tissue biology; it is now believed that adipocytes may play a significant&#xD;
      role in regulating substrate metabolism. Given that the resurgence in the interest in human&#xD;
      BAT is still in its infancy, a number of fundamental questions pertaining to the role of BAT&#xD;
      in human physiology remain unanswered. One area of particular importance, but poorly&#xD;
      understood, is the potential effect of BAT on triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Data from a&#xD;
      series of studies have found that BAT is inversely associated with adiposity, high blood&#xD;
      lipids, and fatty liver in people. However, the role of BAT in the regulation of TG&#xD;
      metabolism in people is not known. The overall goal of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      physiological importance of the human BAT in TG metabolism. To this end, we are planning to&#xD;
      study overweight/obese women with high amounts of BAT (BAT+, n=14) and with no/minimal BAT&#xD;
      (BAT-, n=14) both under thermoneutrality and mild cold exposure (~2 weeks apart). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that BAT+ participants will demonstrate greater plasma very&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) clearance rate compared to BAT- participants,&#xD;
      and higher expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism only in BAT (but not muscle and&#xD;
      white adipose tissue). Infusion of stable isotope tracers and metabolic modeling techniques&#xD;
      will be used to assess VLDL-TG kinetics. Positron emission tomography computed tomography&#xD;
      will be used for the identification and quantification of BAT. Supraclavicular BAT, abdominal&#xD;
      white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle tissue biopsies during cold exposure and&#xD;
      thermoneutral conditions in conjunction with molecular biology techniques will used to&#xD;
      measure expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.&#xD;
