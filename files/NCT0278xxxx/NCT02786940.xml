  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2-3% of emergency department (ED) syncope patients suffer arrhythmia/death within 30-days of&#xD;
      disposition (either as inpatient or at home) and we have recently developed the Canadian&#xD;
      Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS) to predict these outcomes. Currently, only holter&#xD;
      monitoring is used and is applied a few days later. New and innovative remote&#xD;
      (out-of-hospital) external cardiac monitoring technology has made prolonged monitoring&#xD;
      possible .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare diagnostic yield (identification of arrhythmia that&#xD;
      requires treatment) for the following two strategies among higher-risk syncope patients&#xD;
      discharged home from ED: 15-day external cardiac monitoring (intervention arm) versus 48-hour&#xD;
      Holter monitor (control arm) Methods: The study will be a double-blind RCT comparing two&#xD;
      different approaches for detecting serious arrhythmias among high-risk ED syncope patients&#xD;
      who are discharged home. Cardiophone (live monitor) will be used for the intervention arm and&#xD;
      the Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) device will be used for the control arm and both devices&#xD;
      applied prior to ED discharge. For patient safety purposes and to ensure that the patients&#xD;
      are similar in both arms, all of the study patients will be monitored for 15-days. MCT will&#xD;
      function as a holter for first 48-hours and this will be used to compare the diagnostic yield&#xD;
      in the two study arms. After written informed consent, patients will be randomized 1:1 with&#xD;
      allocation concealed by web-based randomization and stratified based on the total CSARS&#xD;
      scores. Data collection: patient demographics, medical history, score predictors, device data&#xD;
      (failure, false alarms, duration worn), patient symptoms and comfort. Primary outcome will be&#xD;
      diagnostic yield at 15-days in the two study arms and primary analysis will compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield by intention to treat principle controlling for the stratification factor.&#xD;
      Sample Size: 300 patients per arm (600 total) to detect a 10% difference in diagnostic yield&#xD;
      between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Our study will increase early identification of patients with serious underlying&#xD;
      arrhythmia by combining the CSARS risk tool with innovative remote monitoring technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is sudden transient loss of consciousness followed by spontaneous complete recovery;&#xD;
      it is a very common problem and can be a precursor to sudden death. This study will increase&#xD;
      the early identification of patients with serious underlying arrhythmia by combining our&#xD;
      Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS) with innovative remote (out-of-hospital)&#xD;
      monitoring technology. Approximately 2-3% of ED syncope patients will suffer arrhythmia or&#xD;
      die from unknown cause within 30-days of ED disposition (in-patient or outside the hospital).&#xD;
      It is the concern for occult arrhythmia and its associated mortality that leads to prolonged&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring in the ED, observation units or by hospitalization; and wide variations in&#xD;
      investigations and hospitalization. New and innovative technology has made remote monitoring&#xD;
      feasible for prolonged periods (15-30 days), and is reliable. This technology allows&#xD;
      arrhythmias to be transmitted live to a central monitoring station automatically based on the&#xD;
      device algorithm or by the touch of a button when patients are symptomatic. However, lack of&#xD;
      tools to identify those at risk has limited the use of this new technology to improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The CSARS tool, developed to predict the 30-day risk of arrhythmia/death showed&#xD;
      that higher-risk (score ≥3) patients have a 17.2% observed risk arrhythmia/death within 15&#xD;
      days. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      15-day event monitor to 48-hour holter monitor (usual care) among higher-risk syncope&#xD;
      patients discharged home at 10 Canadian EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context: Currently, only holter monitoring (records all cardiac beats) for 1-2 days is used&#xD;
      and prolonged monitoring devices are not used for arrhythmia detection. The majority of&#xD;
      syncope patients are not monitored when symptomatic. Arrhythmias are detected only if evident&#xD;
      when patients seek care. The investigators recently completed a multicenter prospective&#xD;
      syncope study and developed the Canadian Syncope Arrhythmia Risk Score (CSARS). Our results&#xD;
      show that most serious conditions are identified within the first few hours in ED among the&#xD;
      low and moderate-risk patients while for non low-risk patients the risk of arrhythmia remains&#xD;
      high up to 15 days indicating the need for prolonged monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies and Rationale: A small randomized study with the old technology that&#xD;
      required patient activation for arrhythmia capture found higher diagnostic yield than holter;&#xD;
      but the utility was limited due to patients' inability to activate the device after symptoms.&#xD;
      Two small studies of unselected syncope patients, one prospective (n=48) and another registry&#xD;
      analysis (n=92) found a diagnostic yield 30 - 38% with prolonged monitoring for 7-33 days.&#xD;
      The diagnostic yield of holter is 1-20% based on the risk of enrolled patients. The role of&#xD;
      prolonged cardiac monitoring among ED syncope patients has not been well studied. Only holter&#xD;
      monitoring is being currently used, but inconsistently and is applied a few days later. With&#xD;
      the technological advances, the investigators hypothesize that 15-day monitoring will lead to&#xD;
      higher diagnostic yield than holter and plan to apply the devices before disposition for&#xD;
      high-risk patients discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the REMOSYNC study is to compare diagnostic yield&#xD;
      (identification of arrhythmia that requires treatment or exclusion of an arrhythmic cause)&#xD;
      for the following two strategies in higher-risk ED syncope patients discharged home from ED:&#xD;
      15-day external cardiac event monitoring (intervention arm) versus 48-hour Holter monitoring&#xD;
      (control arm) Design and Setting: The study will be a multicenter two-arm, double blinded&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two different approaches for detecting serious&#xD;
      arrhythmias among high-risk ED syncope patients who are discharged home. Half of the study&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to 15-day external cardiac monitoring (intervention group) and&#xD;
      the other half will be assigned to 48-hour Holter monitoring (control group and current&#xD;
      practice pattern).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment: Consecutive patients who fulfill inclusion and do not meet any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be approached for recruitment at the participating EDs and enrolled after&#xD;
      informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive a 15-day event&#xD;
      monitor Cardiophone (intervention arm) or a 48-hour holter monitoring with the MCT device&#xD;
      (control arm). Patients will be stratified based on the total CSARS score: 3-4; 5-6; and 7-8&#xD;
      and allocated using randomly permuted blocks of varying lengths. Allocations will be&#xD;
      computer-generated by an independent statistician and concealed by having research staff log&#xD;
      on to a password-protected Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System located within the&#xD;
      coordinating center website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Enrolled patients will receive all outpatient investigations except monitoring&#xD;
      (which will according to the randomization as per the study protocol) as per the discharging&#xD;
      physician. Based on their allocation, patients will receive either Cardiophone or the MCT&#xD;
      device prior to discharge home. The allocation will be concealed and the treating physician,&#xD;
      patient, outcome assessor and the investigator will be blinded to the arm the patient is&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Patient demographics, medical history, CSARS predictors, results of physical&#xD;
      examination and investigations, and patient disposition will be collected. The following&#xD;
      device data will be obtained from the central monitoring station: quality of recordings,&#xD;
      device failure (rhythm not captured during death or when symptomatic), false alarms due to&#xD;
      artefacts, times of patient activation of cardiophone device due to symptoms, any rhythm&#xD;
      abnormalities detected during the symptoms, and monitoring reports for patients in both arms.&#xD;
      Patients will complete a questionnaire during the follow-up visit regarding any serious&#xD;
      conditions suffered, their comfort and how secure they felt because of the cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-ED Care of Study Patients: All patients enrolled in the study will be linked to a local&#xD;
      cardiology group for any urgent and end of study follow-up as needed. Patients will be&#xD;
      advised to keep a diary of symptoms during the 15-day monitoring period. Patients in the&#xD;
      cardiophone arm will have the option of transmitting the rhythm when symptomatic and&#xD;
      symptom-rhythm correlation will be reported. Patients will be advised to return the devices&#xD;
      and the symptom diary to the local cardiology clinic or the ED research team the next&#xD;
      business day after the 15-day monitoring period. All monitoring reports will be completed by&#xD;
      the central monitoring station within 24-hours and sent to the study cardiologist. If serious&#xD;
      arrhythmias are detected, then the central monitoring station will contact the patient or the&#xD;
      family member and advise them to call 911 for the patient to be transported to the ED. If&#xD;
      other arrhythmias are identified, the central monitoring station will provide an interim&#xD;
      report to the study cardiologist providing care. The study cardiologist will decide the need&#xD;
      for urgent follow-up and time-frame within which such follow-up should occur. For patients in&#xD;
      the control arm with MCT device, the central monitoring station will provide reports for&#xD;
      48-hour holter monitoring on day 3 and another report on day 16 for cardiac monitoring for&#xD;
      days 3 to 15. Patients in both study arms will be clearly advised to seek care for symptoms&#xD;
      as usual. All patients will be monitored for the entire 15-days regardless of early&#xD;
      arrhythmias detected and will have end of study follow-up and further management as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the cardiologist responsible for the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Participation and Withdrawal: Patients will be part of the study actively for&#xD;
      1-year after recruitment. We plan to conduct a 30-day telephone follow-up and 1-year health&#xD;
      administrative data linkage for serious outcomes related to syncope. Patients will be free to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason and without any penalty or&#xD;
      loss of benefits they are entitled and the number of withdrawals will be monitored. However,&#xD;
      as these monitoring devices will serve to allay fear of arrhythmia or death among patients,&#xD;
      the investigators expect very few withdrawals. There will be no restrictions on medications&#xD;
      or procedures during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be by intent-to-treat and will compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield (arrhythmia detection or exclusion) at the end of 15-days using data from&#xD;
      15-day monitoring in the intervention arm and the 48-hour holter monitoring. Secondary&#xD;
      analysis will include a per-protocol analysis. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used&#xD;
      for the primary outcome, controlling for the stratification factor (CSARS score). The effect&#xD;
      of the intervention will be expressed as a risk difference with 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Secondary analysis will include multivariable logistic regression to control for potential&#xD;
      confounders or imbalances between patients in the study arms. Descriptive statistics for&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, all outcomes, device performance including failure and patient&#xD;
      centered measures (adherence, comfort and safety feeling). Additional analysis will include&#xD;
      comparison of arrhythmias detected that did not require treatment between the groups. There&#xD;
      will no interim analyses for efficacy performed, but the investigators will monitor trial&#xD;
      safety as detailed in the Data Safety Monitoring Board section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Our sample size is 300 patients per arm (600 total) determined to yield 80%&#xD;
      power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in diagnostic yield between the study arms&#xD;
      using a chi-squared test at the 5% level of significance assuming a control arm event rate of&#xD;
      17% and accounting for 5% attrition. A difference of 10% is feasible based on previous&#xD;
      studies which have reported an 18% increase in diagnostic yield with prolonged monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board: This independent committee will be comprised of one emergency&#xD;
      physician, one cardiologist and a biostatistician from outside the participating sites. This&#xD;
      board will be responsible for safeguarding the interests and safety of trial participants by&#xD;
      reviewing adverse events including deaths every 6 months during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Contributions: Our study will be the first to combine risk-stratification and&#xD;
      innovative technology to decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve healthcare efficiency.&#xD;
      This study will create new knowledge regarding the role of prolonged live monitoring among&#xD;
      high-risk syncope patients and application of device prior to ED discharge. As the monitoring&#xD;
      is live, timely management of potentially life threatening arrhythmias is possible and can be&#xD;
      applied to syncope patients not at risk for ventricular arrhythmia and hospitalized solely&#xD;
      for cardiac monitoring. This will represent a paradigm shift as patients can now be monitored&#xD;
      at home at a very low cost decreasing ED and hospital crowding. These devices will alleviate&#xD;
      fears of occult arrhythmia and death and will improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
