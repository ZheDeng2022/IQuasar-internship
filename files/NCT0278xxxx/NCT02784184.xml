      Minipuberty is a term used to describe the transient activation of the pituitary-gonadal axis&#xD;
      2-3 months after birth in both boys and girls. It is, however, not known why infants reach&#xD;
      adult levels of reproductive hormones in early life, nor is the exact timing of the peak&#xD;
      known. Furthermore, what determines the timing of peaks and suppressions of reproductive&#xD;
      hormones from infancy throughout childhood and into adolescence remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to described and evaluate dynamic changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-&#xD;
      gonadal axis in early postnatal life.&#xD;

      Minipuberty is a term used to describe the transient activation of the pituitary-gonadal axis&#xD;
      2-3 months after birth in both boys and girls. It is, however, not known why infants reach&#xD;
      adult levels of reproductive hormones in early life, nor is the exact timing of the peak&#xD;
      known. Furthermore, what determines the timing of peaks and suppressions of reproductive&#xD;
      hormones from infancy throughout childhood and into adolescence remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have investigated minipuberty and one, for example, found that it is affected in&#xD;
      premature infants (before gestation week 37). However, no studies on normative data&#xD;
      throughout minipuberty in infants exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, using minipuberty as a window for diagnosis of endocrine disorders and future&#xD;
      reproductive function has been suggested. Defining minipuberty, both in terms of circulating&#xD;
      hormone levels and urinary metabolites, in healthy infants is therefore essential in order to&#xD;
      utilize this window. Studies using patients with Disorders of Sex Development during&#xD;
      minipuberty have been carried out, but they are hampered by small sample sizes and lack of&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, little is known about the genetic and epigenetic factors that drive the onset,&#xD;
      progression and termination of minipuberty as well as the actual puberty, i.e. the factors&#xD;
      responsible for the quiescence of the HPG axis during childhood and the dis-inhibition&#xD;
      responsible for pubertal onset. Therefore, much attention was drawn on the study performing&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing in patients and relatives with central precocious puberty (CPP). For&#xD;
      the first time, MKRN3 was suggested as the primary factor responsible for HPG inhibition&#xD;
      during mid-childhood. A number of studies support that MKRN3 mutations cause CPP, and genetic&#xD;
      variation of MKRN3 affect pubertal timing in healthy girls. Our findings of declining serum&#xD;
      levels of MKRN3 prior to pubertal onset in healthy girls support MKRN3 as a regulator of&#xD;
      pubertal onset. The exact mechanism through which MRKN3 exceeds its effect remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated; however, its zink-finger structure indicates regulation of superior cellular&#xD;
      processes such as epigenetic regulation of DNA transcription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twin studies suggest that 60% of the inter-individual variation is caused by genetic factors.&#xD;
      However, genome wide association (GWA) studies only explain a fraction of the variation in&#xD;
      age at puberty. Recently, our research group has revealed the largest effect of a single SNP&#xD;
      on age at pubertal onset in girls. The location of the SNPs in genes regulating FSH action&#xD;
      emphasizes the need of a wide focus including downstream processes in the HPG axis when&#xD;
      evaluating factors regulating puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the abovementioned studies have led to a spark in the interest in epigenetic&#xD;
      studies, i.e. studies of genetic changes that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequences&#xD;
      themselves, but rather regulatory mechanisms of DNA expression. Generally, this is thought to&#xD;
      include DNA methylation, histone modifications and small RNAs. Epi-mutations (improper&#xD;
      epigenetic regulation) possibly account for more of the variation in puberty than genetic&#xD;
      factors. Previously, both gene-specific and genome-wide DNA methylation patterns have been&#xD;
      studied. Genome-wide hypomethylation seen in peripheral leukocytes has been shown to be&#xD;
      linked with an array of cancers, including colorectal cancers. As multiple histone&#xD;
      modifications exist and analysis requires special sample treatment procedures, DNA&#xD;
      methylation is the most appropriate epigenetic marker to analyze. A study of rats found that&#xD;
      specific gene hypomethylation was accountable for lack of pubertal onset, but the link&#xD;
      between epigenetics and mini- and pubertal timing and progression has, however, only scarcely&#xD;
      been studied. Understanding this link would greatly add to our knowledge of reproductive&#xD;
      function and normal sex development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) is an umbrella term covering conditions with congenital&#xD;
      disordered development of chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex. Genital abnormalities may&#xD;
      include as many as up to 4-6 in 1000 births, although individual disorders are much rarer,&#xD;
      e.g. 45,X/46,XY mosaicism is seen in about 1 in 15000 live births. Previously DSD diagnoses&#xD;
      were labeled with different and often imprecise terms such as 'intersex', 'sex reversal' and&#xD;
      'hermaphroditism' etc. In 2006, DSD nomenclature was renamed and grouped according to genetic&#xD;
      sex into sex chromosome DSD, 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSD patients are diagnosed at different periods in life depending on their diagnosis,&#xD;
      phenotype and primary and secondary sexual development. Patients with sex chromosome DSD can&#xD;
      be diagnosed at prenatal screenings, patients with affected external genitalia at birth, some&#xD;
      during childhood due to growth abnormalities, some during adolescence due to abnormal&#xD;
      pubertal progression and lastly, some in adulthood due to infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding normal sex development is therefore the key to identifying and optimizing&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of patients with DSD. A project, as the present, that seeks to&#xD;
      investigate normal minipuberty while comparing to minipuberty in patients with DSD is&#xD;
      therefore of great importance. Furthermore, knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic control&#xD;
      mechanisms of minipuberty will aid the understanding of reproductive physiology and in&#xD;
      particular DSD pathology.&#xD;
