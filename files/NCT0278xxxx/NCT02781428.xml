  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicentre observational study to assess the sensitivity of the&#xD;
      UroMark assay to detect bladder cancer in participants with new or recurrent disease. The&#xD;
      study will recruit patients with newly detected or recurrent bladder cancer. The reference&#xD;
      standard will be histopathological confirmation of tumour stage and (Ta, T1, â‰¥T2) and grade&#xD;
      1, 2 or 3 diseases with or without CIS, or CIS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a visual diagnosis of bladder cancer following cystoscopy will be approached&#xD;
      and asked to consent for this study. Consenting participants will be provided with a urine&#xD;
      sample collection kit and asked to provide a urine sample. Samples can be provided at home&#xD;
      and posted to the receiving lab using the stamped addressed envelope. The urine sample must&#xD;
      be obtained before TURBT and following TURBT, patients with NMIBC who require surveillance&#xD;
      cystoscopy will be asked to provide a urine sample at 3 monthly intervals for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in at least 11 NHS trusts. As DETECT II is an observation study&#xD;
      requiring provision of a urine sample, it will be possible for patients in DETECT II to be&#xD;
      recruited to other trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study and participants will receive the standard of care&#xD;
      according to local MDT guidelines for the treatment and surveillance of bladder cancer. As&#xD;
      the study involves collection of a urine sample, subjects are permitted to be entered into&#xD;
      other trials. The DETECT II study will recruit patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent&#xD;
      bladder cancer. As this study is only observational and no intervention is trial related the&#xD;
      patients will be given minimum 24 hours to consider this study and decide to take part as&#xD;
      they will be approached in clinic at first instance. Due to the initial urine sample being&#xD;
      required before any standard of care is received they will be consented within 24 hours of&#xD;
      being informed of the study. Most newly diagnosed bladder cancers are detected in patients&#xD;
      being investigated for haematuria and attending a haematuria clinic. Most recurrent bladder&#xD;
      cancers are detected by cystoscopy at bladder cancer check cystoscopy clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a visual diagnosis or new or recurrent bladder cancer will be eligible for the&#xD;
      DETECT II study. The baseline UroMark urine collection will be collected once the visual&#xD;
      diagnosis of bladder cancer is established. The UroMark sample must be provided before TURBT&#xD;
      in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached following cystoscopy and asked to consent to study entry. The&#xD;
      DETECT II study will involve obtaining a voided urine sample. Patients will be given a&#xD;
      UroMark urine sample kit and asked to provide the urine sample at home and post the sample to&#xD;
      the receiving lab using the stamped addressed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the standard tests and investigations for bladder cancer. The standard&#xD;
      treatment for bladder cancer is summarised as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TURBT following which it is recommended that patients with NMIBC receive a single&#xD;
           instillation of chemotherapy unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermediate risk NMIBC will be considered for a 6 week inductive course of intravesical&#xD;
           chemotherapy after TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk NMIBC may require a second TURBT called re-resection TURBT, usually within 6&#xD;
           weeks of the first. The re--resection or second TURBT is performed for pathological&#xD;
           stage pT1 tumours to exclude residual detrusor muscle invasion (stage pT2 at least).&#xD;
           There are 2 treatment choices when the high risk status has been confirmed clinically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A course of inductive followed by maintenance intravesical BCG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An operation to remove the bladder (a cystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystectomy or radiotherapy are the options for patients diagnosed with MIBC&#xD;
