  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using computerized pupillometry, previous research established that the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system (ANS) is dysregulated in patients who suffer from temporomandibular disorders (TMDs),&#xD;
      suggesting a potential role for ANS dysfunction in pain modulation and the etiology of TMD.&#xD;
      However, pain modulation hypotheses in TMD are still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is involved in the descending modulation of defensive behavior&#xD;
      and pain through μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS) has been extensively used for pain relief, as low-frequency stimulation is able to&#xD;
      activate µ receptors. The aim of the present study is to use ANS polygraph and salivary/serum&#xD;
      biomarkers to evaluate the effect of low-frequency TENS stimulation of ANS in TMD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD, people with myogenous TMD and&#xD;
      matched-controls will be enrolled. All subjects will be randomly assigned to control group&#xD;
      (no tens stimulation) and case group (test stimulation); subsequently, ANS parameters by both&#xD;
      biomarkers and ANS polygraph, before, soon after (end of stimulation), and late after&#xD;
      (recovery period) sensorial TENS will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall statistics will be performed from all conditions recorded comparing controls vs&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results consist in discovering ANS deregulation in TMD with and without TENS&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale &amp; background information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electric Nervous Stimulation (TENS) is extensively used for pain relief.&#xD;
      Notably, Ultra Low Frequency TENS (ULF-TENS) has been used both in research and in dentistry&#xD;
      as a reliable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders (TMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of TENS has been widely investigated and involves local and systemic&#xD;
      effects. In particular, experiments using animal models have shown systemic action trough&#xD;
      involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Endogenous opioid and descending pain&#xD;
      modulatory systems are thought to be involved in central activation during TENS stimulation.&#xD;
      In particular, pain modulation occurs via endogenous opioids and affects the periaqueductal&#xD;
      gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) brain regions. The PAG provides a&#xD;
      neuroanatomical and neuro-functional substrate to couple cortical outflow with the adequate&#xD;
      autonomic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study ANS activity and responses during conditions of rest and stress, heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) and breathing rate (BR) are traditionally used in experiments due to their&#xD;
      repeatability and reliability. To study TENS effects on the autonomic nervous system, HRV has&#xD;
      been used; however, pupillometry, skin conductance, blood flow and skin temperature, are also&#xD;
      reliable indicators that have been used to study ANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data supports the hypothesis that TENS could act on peripheral autonomic effectors via&#xD;
      sympathovagal balance and PAG-opioid activity. Moreover, it has been suggested that PAG&#xD;
      participates in the medial viscero-motor network that represents the link between emotional&#xD;
      and cognitive functions managed by autonomic support. In particular, these neuro-connections&#xD;
      is successfully investigated by the use of HRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to investigate the effects of TENS stimulation on peripheral&#xD;
      autonomic behavior during ULF-TENS stimulation. It is hypothesized that TENS reduces the&#xD;
      peripheral autonomic indexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present proposal is to investigate ANS effects of ULF-TENS stimulation in&#xD;
      patients with and without TMD conducting an observational RTC. The enrolled subject (with and&#xD;
      without TMD) will be randomly assigned to case and control groups. The case group will&#xD;
      receive a total of 40 minutes of TENS stimulation, whereas control group will not. ANS of&#xD;
      both groups will be investigated by ANS polygraph and by the use of serum/saliva biomarkers&#xD;
      such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total antioxidant capacity (TAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total pro-oxidant activity (TPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Noradrenaline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alpha-amylase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology • Autonomic data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic data collection will be performed between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. and with the subjects&#xD;
      will stay in a horizontal supine position on a medical bed. Room temperature (21°C), lighting&#xD;
      (3200 K; 500 lx according to Uni En 12464), and relative humidity (50%) will be controlled.&#xD;
      External and internal noise sources will be excluded. Before recording sessions, patients&#xD;
      will be encouraged to urinate and then will be requested to lie on the medical bed for&#xD;
      clinical examination with their eyes open for at least 10 minutes to adapt to the room&#xD;
      temperature and humidity and also to reduce their anxiety. During this time, the autonomic&#xD;
      sensors will be applied and connected to the polygraph. After connection, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to close their eyes and to maintain their position until the end of the recording&#xD;
      session. During the entire recording session, data collection will be obtained from each&#xD;
      subject using an 8-channel digital polygraph (Procomp Infinity,Thought Technology Ltd,&#xD;
      Montreal, Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • HRV collection and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three electrode (left shoulder, right shoulder and abdomen) electrocardiogram (ECG) will be&#xD;
      recorded at a sampling rate of 2048 Hz. Artifacts and heartbeats that will not be generated&#xD;
      by sinus node depolarization will be manually edited by an ECG expert who is blinded about&#xD;
      the study aims, protocol, and experimental paradigm. Inter beat intervals (IBI) will be&#xD;
      automatically calculated from recurrence rate (RR) intervals. Spectral analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out using a fast Fourier transform to generate the heart period power spectrum. The&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) parameters used were automatically elaborated and included the following:&#xD;
      Heart rate (HR); High frequency band (0.15-0.4 Hz, HF n.u.); Low frequency band (0.04-0.15&#xD;
      Hz, LF n.u.); LF/HF ratio, Root Mean Square Standard Deviation (RMSSD); Percentage of the&#xD;
      normal sinus-initiates IBI (pNN50); Determinism (DET); and RR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Respiratory rate measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate measurement will be obtained by a strain gauge worn by the subjects at the&#xD;
      tenth rib and will be connected to the polygraph. The rate sampling is 24 Hz. The two&#xD;
      highest, subsequent strain values will be used to define the breath frequency rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Surface Electromyography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface Electromyography (sEMG) will be recorded through one channel that is sampled at 2048&#xD;
      Hz using a bipolar electrode (Myotronics-Noromed, Inc., Tukwila, WA, USA). The bipolar&#xD;
      electrode will be positioned on the skin over the suprahyoid muscle to precisely detect the&#xD;
      start and end of TENS and to detect the numbering tasks, thus allowing the correct selection&#xD;
      of study epochs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • TENS procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method for sensory TENS was described previously. Briefly, a J5 Myomonitor TENS Unit&#xD;
      device (Myotronics-Noromed, Inc., Tukwila, WA, USA) with disposable electrodes (Myotrode SG&#xD;
      Electrodes, Myotronics-Noromed, Inc., Tukwila, WA, USA) will be used. This low-frequency&#xD;
      neurostimulator generates a repetitive synchronous and bilateral stimulus delivered at 1.5 s&#xD;
      intervals. The stimulus has adjustable amplitude of approximately 0-24 mA, duration of 500&#xD;
      μs, and frequency of 0.66 Hz. Two TENS electrodes will be placed bilaterally over the&#xD;
      cutaneous projection of the notch of the fifth pair of cranial nerves, which is located&#xD;
      between the coronoid and condylar processes and will be retrieved by manual palpation of the&#xD;
      zone anterior to the tragus. Additionally, a third grounding electrode will be placed in the&#xD;
      center of the back of the neck. The amplitude of TENS stimulation started at 0 mA, with the&#xD;
      stimulator turned on and the rheostat, which controls the amplitude, positioned at 0. The&#xD;
      amplitude of stimulation will be progressively increased at a rate of 0.6 mA/s until the&#xD;
      patients reported a pricking sensation. The duration of each stimulation will be 40 minutes.&#xD;
      Particular attention will be paid to avoid reaching the threshold of motor stimulation; if&#xD;
      any movement of the investigated muscles will be observed, the amplitude of stimulation will&#xD;
      be immediately reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same operator (RC) will apply the polygraph and will deliver the TENS, and both will be&#xD;
      performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Recording procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test and control subjects will naive to the trial protocol and will gone identical polygraph&#xD;
      and TENS connection procedures. The control group will be connected to the TENS stimulation&#xD;
      device in a manner identical to the test subject group; however, in the control group, the&#xD;
      TENS stimulation device will remain off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study experimental protocol. The study subject will entry the experiment room, and TENS, EEG&#xD;
      and EMG electrodes will be placed and will be tested before starting the session. TENS and&#xD;
      ANS polygraphs will be tested and setup for the experiment. Then, the patient will be placed&#xD;
      on the medical bed with their eyes open to allow for room acclimation. After 10' of room&#xD;
      acclimation, the ANS recording session will start. The first 3' will be dedicated to&#xD;
      adaptation and software setup; then, ANS data will be recorded for 5' (basal). At this point,&#xD;
      the test group (represented by red rectangles) will receive sensorial TENS, whereas the&#xD;
      control group (represented by blue rectangles) will not. TENS stimulation will be&#xD;
      administered for 40' in total, allowing 1' for adaptation and 39' of useful recording time&#xD;
      (T1). The end of TENS stimulation will be followed by 1' of recovery. Finally, the effects of&#xD;
      ULF-TENS will be recorded for 5' (recovery). At each phase (Basal, T1, Recovery) serum and&#xD;
      saliva will be sampled using a glycemic stick technique and sterile tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum and saliva analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected samples from saliva and serum will be analyzed simultaneously by the use of&#xD;
      specific ELISA kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the used electrical devices that will be employed with patients are conformity to ISO&#xD;
      13485 and European guideline in medical safety 93/42/CEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be stored in a refrigerator key locked under the jurisdiction of Prof&#xD;
      Annalisa Monaco under the MeSVA unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study database will be designed and created throughout the project year 1. Due to data&#xD;
      safety reasons and to comply with the data privacy protection, the personal data of every&#xD;
      patient will be pseudonymized. This ensures the strictly split between the personal data and&#xD;
      patient-related dataset (trial data).The Remote Data Entry (RDE) system generates&#xD;
      automatically a pseudonym for every new patient. The pseudonym will be a combination of six&#xD;
      alphanumeric characters. All trial data of the patient will be linked with this pseudonym.&#xD;
      Personal data of the patient will not be saved in the trial database at any time. Data&#xD;
      required for the analysis will be acquired and transferred electronically to a central&#xD;
      database at Dental Unit MeSVA department. This system allows the documentation of study data&#xD;
      on electronic case report form (eCRF). Study data will be entered online direct by the sites.&#xD;
      The access to the eCRF requires the authentication by the study participants. All access&#xD;
      rights (read or enter data) will be defined depending on their function in the study&#xD;
      (Principle, clinical investigator, CRA, etc.). At the end of the study the data will be&#xD;
      exported from the database.The study data will be prepared for the statistical analysis. This&#xD;
      data management process contains the plausibility, consistency, identification of missing&#xD;
      data and range checks of the data. Information of missing data will be given to the&#xD;
      respective study centre for possible completion or explanation of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of outcome measures, in dependence of scale level and distribution,&#xD;
      according the post-hoc power-calculation will be performed. The statistical power of&#xD;
      comparisons between cases and controls are evaluated. Difference in mean will be detected&#xD;
      with level of significance 5%. In addition an alpha-adjustment for the entirety of all tests&#xD;
      is planned. Also 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Descriptives for all primary&#xD;
      and secondary clinical, demographic and safety parameters will include absolute and relative&#xD;
      frequencies for categorial variables and mean, standard deviation, median, and range for&#xD;
      quantitative measurements, according the statistical analysis plan (SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional subgroup analyses are planned. Controlling for potential confounders will&#xD;
      performed by using multiple statistical models adjusting for these variables. The&#xD;
      power-calculations and statistical analysis will be performed by Pietropaoli Davide using R&#xD;
      and STATA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of influencing factors and confounders&#xD;
&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Descriptives for all primary and secondary&#xD;
      clinical, demographic and safety parameters will include absolute and relative frequencies&#xD;
      for categorial variables and mean, standard deviation, median, and range for quantitative&#xD;
      measurements, according the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Additional subgroup analyses are&#xD;
      planned. Controlling for potential confounders will performed by using multiple statistical&#xD;
      models adjusting for these variables.&#xD;
