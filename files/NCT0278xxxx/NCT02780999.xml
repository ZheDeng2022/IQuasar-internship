      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of Whale and Colditz static orthosis on pain&#xD;
      and functional abilities of hand in thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis as a unique&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with thumb CMC OA will be recruited at Tecan Hand Center Clinic. Participants will&#xD;
      be assigned using a randomized allocation in two groups. For group A a &quot;Whale orthotic&quot; will&#xD;
      be constructed and for group B a Colditz orthotic. Both static splint will endorse for 3&#xD;
      months. Inclusion criteria for this study were adult over 18 diagnosed with carpometacarpal&#xD;
      joint osteoarthritis with a pain intensity during Activities of Daily Living (ADL's) up to 4&#xD;
      / 10 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded from participation if they had: a neurological disorder affecting the&#xD;
      upper limb; had received previous treatment for their hand problem in the last 6 months&#xD;
      including an intra-articular joint injection to wrist, fingers or thumb; had fractures or a&#xD;
      significant hand injury or previous surgery to the wrist or hand; had hand or finger&#xD;
      tenosynovitis and/ or Dupuytren's disease. Were also excluded patients who did not complete&#xD;
      Dash Spanish version questionnaire or if they did not sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measure will be pain intensity and functional abilities as measured with the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH),&#xD;
      respectively. All measures will be collected at baseline and end of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hand therapy blinded to the subjects' intervention took baseline measurements (Spanish-&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and pain intensity) prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were introduced in an Excel database in order of arrival and were randomized&#xD;
      into 2 equal groups by an automatic program (Group A : Whale orthotic. Group B Colditz&#xD;
      Orthotic). The same low temperature thermoplastic material was used for both orthoses (Orfit&#xD;
      Colors NS 2.0 mm, micro perforated/ Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium). The orthoses were&#xD;
      custom -fabricated for each patient by a hand therapy clinician experienced in orthopedic&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients received identical orthotic wearing instructions. Patients were asked&#xD;
      to use the orthosis during the nighttime and also during daytime ADL's for three to four&#xD;
      hours per day. Each patient was also provided with a data collection sheet in order to&#xD;
      control treatment adherence. All patients were asked to report any discomfort when using the&#xD;
      orthosis. The orthosis was the only treatment intervention received by the participants. No&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises, modalities or other complementary treatments were offered to the&#xD;
      patients in order not to interfere with the individual effectiveness of the orthosis.&#xD;
      Patients were contacted by telephone a week after and were ask about pain intensity. Three&#xD;
      months after first evaluation, participants were cited in hand therapy clinic in order to&#xD;
      collect again outcomes measurements.&#xD;
