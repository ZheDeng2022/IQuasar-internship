    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of axitinib and bosutinib and&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. Axitinib and bosutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the rate of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) of an alternating schedule of&#xD;
      axitinib and bosutinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic phase (CML-CP)&#xD;
      after failure of/intolerance to &gt;= 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) using standard&#xD;
      response criteria. (Chronic Phase Cohort) II. To determine the recommended phase II doses&#xD;
      (RPTDs) of axitinib and bosutinib in combination in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (CML) in accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blast phase (CML-BP). (Advanced phase [AP] patients&#xD;
      must have received &gt;= 1 prior TKI). (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase I Portion) III. To&#xD;
      evaluate the rate of major hematologic response (MaHR) of combined treatment with axitinib&#xD;
      and bosutinib in patients with CML-AP or CML-BP using standard response criteria. (AP&#xD;
      patients must have received &gt;= 1 prior TKI). (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), breast cancer gene&#xD;
      (BCR-ABL/ABL) =&lt; 10% and =&lt; 1%, major molecular response (MMR), molecular response 4-log&#xD;
      (MR4), molecular response 4.5-log (MR4.5), and complete molecular response (CMR), overall and&#xD;
      at different time points. (Chronic Phase Cohort) II. To determine the duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), transformation-free survival (TFS), failure-free survival&#xD;
      (FFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with CML-CP treated with alternating axitinib&#xD;
      and bosutinib after failure of/intolerance to &gt;= 3 TKIs. (Chronic Phase Cohort) III. To&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of alternating therapy with axitinib and bosutinib&#xD;
      after failure of/intolerance to &gt;= 3 TKIs. (Chronic Phase Cohort) IV. To establish the&#xD;
      response rate of concurrent administration of axitinib and bosutinib to patients with CML-AP&#xD;
      or CML-BP. (AP patients must have received &gt;= 1 prior TKI). (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase I&#xD;
      Portion) V. To determine the rate of complete hematologic response (CHR), complete&#xD;
      cytogenetic response (CCyR), BCR-ABL/ABL =&lt; 10% and =&lt; 1%, major molecular response (MMR),&#xD;
      molecular response 4-log (MR4), molecular response 4.5-log (MR4.5), and complete molecular&#xD;
      response (CMR), overall and at different time points of combined treatment with axitinib and&#xD;
      bosutinib in patients with CML-AP or CML-BP. (AP patients must have received &gt;= 1 prior TKI).&#xD;
      (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase I Portion) VI. To determine the DOR, EFS, TFS, FFS and OS for&#xD;
      patients with CML-AP or -BP treated with combined axitinib and bosutinib. (AP patients must&#xD;
      have received &gt;= 1 prior TKI). (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion) VII. To evaluate&#xD;
      the probability of developing Abl kinase domain and other somatic mutations in patients with&#xD;
      CML treated with alternating (CP) or concurrent (AP/BP) axitinib and bosutinib. (Advanced&#xD;
      Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion) VIII. To analyze differences in response rates, duration and&#xD;
      survival according to pre-treatment mutations and patient characteristics in both the CP and&#xD;
      AP/BP cohorts. (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion) IX. To characterize mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance in patients who develop resistance to alternating (CP) or concomitant (AP/BP)&#xD;
      therapy with axitinib and bosutinib. (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion) X. To&#xD;
      evaluate symptom burden in patients with CML receiving axitinib and bosutinib, whether&#xD;
      alternating (CP) or in combination (AP/BP). (Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients with chronic phase CML receive either bosutinib orally (PO) once a day&#xD;
      (QD) or axitinib PO twice a day (BID) alone for 3 months. Patients then switch to the other&#xD;
      drug for 3 months and alternate between the two every 3 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients with accelerated or blastic phase CML receive bosutinib PO QD and&#xD;
      axitinib PO BID for 3 months. Courses repeat every 3 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;
