      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. MS lesions can&#xD;
      appear on the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans in many ways. Sometimes they light up&#xD;
      from the outer edge and fill inward. This is called ring enhancement. Researchers think this&#xD;
      type of lesion may not heal as well as others. Corticosteroids are the standard treatment to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of MS relapse. But there is no standard treatment for people with enhancing&#xD;
      MS lesions without signs of MS relapse. Researchers want to see if a short-term high-dose&#xD;
      course of corticosteroids helps heal those lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of short-term high-dose corticosteroids on ring-enhancing MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 25 and older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have MS and a rim-enhancing lesion on a prior brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are enrolled in another NINDS protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to get either no treatment or 3 days of treatment with&#xD;
      a corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 days of high-dose steroids, intravenous or oral. If IV, participants will receive&#xD;
           methylprednisolone by IV each day. Participants will also be prescribed medicine to&#xD;
           protect their stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits will be at week 13 and week 25 after randomization to treatment or no&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits include medical history and physical exam. Participants will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. Participants will also have neurological exams and MRIs. Participants lie on a table&#xD;
      that slides into a cylinder. They are in the scanner 1.5-2 hours. They get a dye through a&#xD;
      catheter: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.&#xD;

      Objectives. The primary aim of this pilot study is to assess the effects of short-term,&#xD;
      high-dose corticosteroid administration on the 12-week evolution of multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      lesions with centripetal enhancement pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in&#xD;
      particular with respect to the development of a hypointense rim on 7-tesla phase images. In&#xD;
      our prior work, the phase rim has been associated with persistent deleterious inflammation&#xD;
      with poor repair and ongoing neurodegeneration within lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. Up to 30 multiple sclerosis patients with asymptomatic contrast-enhancing&#xD;
      lesions will be enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to either 3 days of corticosteroids&#xD;
      (intravenous methylprednisolone a 1000 mg/day or oral prednisone at 1250mg/day) or to no&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. This is a multi-site study with Johns Hopkins University. Some analysis of&#xD;
      identifiable data will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University JHU under a reliance&#xD;
      agreement. Patients will not be consented to the study or participate in study&#xD;
      interventions/procedures at JHU. Patients undergo serial brain MRIs with gadolinium-based&#xD;
      contrast agent on both 3- and 7-tesla scanners over an approximate 25-week period. 3-tesla&#xD;
      scans are obtained at baseline and week 25. 7-tesla scans are obtained at baseline and at&#xD;
      weeks 13 and 25. Participants with one or more centripetal/rim-enhancing lesions at the&#xD;
      baseline scan are randomized and followed. Clinical evaluation and blood testing are&#xD;
      performed at baseline and weeks 13 and 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the presence or absence, on the week-13&#xD;
      7-tesla scan, of a hypointense phase rim in each of the lesions followed over time. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures include the presence or absence of a hypointense phase rim at week 25, as&#xD;
      well as the lesion volume and intralesional median R1 relaxation rate at weeks 13 and 25.&#xD;
      From 3-tesla scans, we will measure the change in normalized intralesional proton&#xD;
      density-weighted and T1-weighted signal, as well as the R1 relaxation rate, between baseline&#xD;
      and week 25. We will also assess for the presence or absence of a hypointense phase at 3T.&#xD;
      Additional exploratory outcome measures, including clinical and immunological assessments,&#xD;
      will also be collected.&#xD;
