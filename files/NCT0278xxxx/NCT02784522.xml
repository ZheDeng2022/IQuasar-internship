      This study protocol represents an attempt to objectively choose appropriate methods for&#xD;
      internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures in older patients by comparing locking&#xD;
      compression plate with conventional steel plate fixation to improve shoulder function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment for proximal humerus fractures emphasizes the restoration of shoulder function.&#xD;
      Older patients, because of the loss of bodily functions, face enormous difficulties in&#xD;
      fracture healing and shoulder functional recovery after sustaining proximal humerus&#xD;
      fractures. As previously reported, open reduction with conventional locking plate fixation&#xD;
      achieved fair outcomes in 48 cases of proximal humerus fractures in older patients, with an&#xD;
      excellent rate of 85.4% according to the Neer classification system. The investigators'&#xD;
      clinical experience, however, has shown that the stability of internal fixation is inadequate&#xD;
      and must be enhanced. Consequently, the investigators design a microsurgical implantation&#xD;
      using a locking compression plate (LCP) to treat proximal humerus fractures in older&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a search of the Web of Science database, the investigators found a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial reported by Wang et al. in which LCP fixation using microsurgical techniques had better&#xD;
      outcomes in 20 cases of proximal humerus fractures in older patients. However, the limitation&#xD;
      created by the small sample size had profound effects on the reliability of their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No relevant articles were retrieved from the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, and only one&#xD;
      similar article was found on ClinicalTrials.gov: &quot;Proximal Humerus Fractures: Randomized&#xD;
      Study Between Locking Nails and Locking Plates for Neer 2 and 3 Parts&quot; (identifier:&#xD;
      NCT01984112). In this clinical trial, Constant-Murley scores were considered the primary&#xD;
      outcome, and the follow-up period was 12 months. Importantly, the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      study arms were distinctly different from those in the investigators' study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main principle of minimally invasive techniques in orthopedics is to implant a specific&#xD;
      bony plate, which is fixed across a transverse fracture, via small incisions of the&#xD;
      periosteum, skin, and muscle. These implantation devices include less invasive stabilization&#xD;
      systems, dynamic compression plate systems, and LCP systems. Internal fixation with the LCP&#xD;
      system involves two completely different fixation techniques and two opposing osteosynthesis&#xD;
      principles, namely conventional plate and bridging plate osteosyntheses characterized by&#xD;
      direct anatomical reduction. Because of its special design, the LCP can be used as a dynamic&#xD;
      compression plate, as a pure internal fixator using locking head screws, or as both combined,&#xD;
      thus providing a variety of therapeutic options for surgeons. Moreover, the LCP has good&#xD;
      stability and induces less damage to the periosteum; it is therefore beneficial for bone&#xD;
      healing and functional recovery. Given these characteristics, the LCP is likely to have&#xD;
      stronger stability than the conventional locking plate for internal fixation of fractures.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators design a study protocol that compares the LCP and conventional&#xD;
      locking plate using minimally invasive techniques for internal fixation of proximal humerus&#xD;
      fractures in older patients. The investigators hypothesize that the LCP will be more&#xD;
      effective than the conventional locking plate in promoting shoulder function recovery with a&#xD;
      higher excellent rate according to the Neer classification system for proximal humerus&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis, and open access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection: All data, including demographic information, disease diagnosis,&#xD;
           concomitant diseases, allergic history (drug allergy), and adverse reactions, will be&#xD;
           collected on a case report form and summarized in one form. These data will be recorded&#xD;
           electronically using a double-data entry strategy by EpiData software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management: Only the project manager will have the right to query the database, and&#xD;
           changes will not be allowed. All data relevant to this clinical trial will be preserved&#xD;
           by the Affiliated Hospital of Qinghai University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis: All data will be statistically analyzed by professional statisticians.&#xD;
           The statistical report by the statisticians will be given to the project manager&#xD;
           responsible for writing the research report. An independent data monitoring committee&#xD;
           will be in charge of data monitoring and management throughout the entire trial to&#xD;
           ensure scientific accuracy, authenticity, and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open data: Published data will be released at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be completed by statisticians using the&#xD;
      SPSS 19.0 statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) in line with the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. Intergroup comparison for the excellent rate according to the&#xD;
      Neer classification system will be performed using the chi-square test. The operation time,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, fracture healing time, visual&#xD;
      analogue scale scores, and SF-36 scores will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. A&#xD;
      value of P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predicted and unanticipated adverse events will be recorded during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events including dizziness, fever, infection, subacromial impingement, humeral&#xD;
           head necrosis, malunion, and severe pain will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All serious adverse events will be recorded in detail, including the date of occurrence,&#xD;
           type of event, and treatments, all of which will be reported to the project manager and&#xD;
           institution review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
