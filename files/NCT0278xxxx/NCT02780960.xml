      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of HPV self-sampling (self-HPV) in&#xD;
      detecting residual/recurrent disease in women treated by loop electro-surgical excision&#xD;
      (LEEP) for CIN1+.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HPV test is an efficient method to assess the long-term risk of residual/recurrent&#xD;
      disease in women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or worse (CIN1+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women treated by LEEP for CIN1+ will be invited to participate. Follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      performed at 6 months and 12 months after treatment and will include cytology, colposcopy&#xD;
      when indicated and HPV testing. Two weeks before each follow-up visit at the colposcopy&#xD;
      clinic, a home-based Self-HPV will be organized. A sample of 168 women will be included.&#xD;
      Agreement between the two methods (Dr-HPV vs. S-HPV) will be measured using the kappa&#xD;
      statistic (κ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators expect to find that Self-HPV may be an accurate method to predict residual&#xD;
      and recurrent disease in women previously treated by LEEP.&#xD;
