      Activity-related dyspnoea appears to be the earliest and the most frequent complaint for&#xD;
      which patients with PAH seek medical attention. This symptom progresses relentlessly with&#xD;
      time leading invariably to avoidance of activity with consequent skeletal muscle&#xD;
      deconditioning and an impoverished quality of life. Unfortunately, effective management of&#xD;
      this disabling symptom awaits a better understanding of its underlying physiology. Our team&#xD;
      has recently showed that PAH patients may exhibit reduced expiratory flows at low lung&#xD;
      volumes at spirometry (namely instantaneous forced expiratory flows measured after 50% and&#xD;
      75% of the FVC has been exhaled [FEF50% and FEF75%] lower than predicted), despite a&#xD;
      preserved forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) .&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that such a finding (&quot;small airway disease&quot;) could be common in&#xD;
      certain PAH cohorts, have either related it to incidental descriptions of airway wall&#xD;
      thickening with lymphocytic infiltration in PAH or proposed several other speculative&#xD;
      explanatory mechanisms, either biological or mechanical. Whatever its cause, reduced&#xD;
      expiratory flows at low lung volumes imply that the operating tidal volume (VT) range becomes&#xD;
      closer than normally to residual volume (RV) mostly through an increase in RV (elevated&#xD;
      residual volume/total lung capacity ratio, RV/TLC). The reduced difference between forced and&#xD;
      tidal expiratory flows promotes dynamic lung hyperinflation [i.e., a progressive increase in&#xD;
      end-expiratory lung volume (EELV)] under conditions of increased ventilatory demand. Dynamic&#xD;
      lung hyperinflation (DH) is well known to have serious sensory consequences, i.e., increase&#xD;
      in dyspnoea intensity, as clearly shown in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease and chronic heart failure. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      administration of inhaled BDs (β2-agonist and/or anticholinergic), as add-ons to&#xD;
      vasodilators, would be beneficial to PAH patients by reducing and/or delaying the rate of&#xD;
      onset of DH, thus ameliorating the exertional symptoms in patients with stable PAH undergoing&#xD;
      high-intensity constant work-rate (CWR) cycle endurance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Design: 5 visits; V1:&#xD;
      screening, familiarization, incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); V2: constant&#xD;
      work-rate (CWR-CPET); V3, V4 and V5: CWR-CPET after intervention, in a random order: Placebo&#xD;
      (P), Ipratropium Bromide (IB), Ipratropium Bromide + Salbutamol (IB+SALB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)&#xD;
      of ≥25 mmHg at rest and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg, is consistently&#xD;
      associated with reduced exercise capacity and intolerable dyspnoea (respiratory difficulty)&#xD;
      on exertion. Dyspnoea is a complex multifaceted and highly personalized sensory experience,&#xD;
      the source and mechanisms of which are incompletely understood. Activity-related dyspnoea&#xD;
      appears to be the earliest and the most frequent complaint for which patients with PAH seek&#xD;
      medical attention. This symptom progresses relentlessly with time leading invariably to&#xD;
      avoidance of activity with consequent skeletal muscle deconditioning and an impoverished&#xD;
      quality of life. Unfortunately, effective management of this disabling symptom awaits a&#xD;
      better understanding of its underlying physiology. Previous studies on mechanisms of&#xD;
      exertional dyspnoea in PAH have largely and mostly focused on the cardiovascular determinants&#xD;
      of respiratory discomfort. However, respiratory mechanics abnormalities could contribute to&#xD;
      exertional dyspnoea in these patients. For instance, PAH patients may exhibit reduced&#xD;
      expiratory flows at low lung volumes at spirometry (namely instantaneous forced expiratory&#xD;
      flows measured after 50% and 75% of the FVC has been exhaled [FEF50% and FEF75%] lower than&#xD;
      predicted), despite a preserved forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity&#xD;
      ratio (FEV1/FVC). Several studies have shown that such a finding (&quot;small airway disease&quot;)&#xD;
      could be common in certain PAH cohorts, have either related it to incidental descriptions of&#xD;
      airway wall thickening with lymphocytic infiltration in PAH or proposed several other&#xD;
      speculative explanatory mechanisms, either biological or mechanical. Whatever its cause,&#xD;
      reduced expiratory flows at low lung volumes imply that the operating tidal volume (VT) range&#xD;
      becomes closer than normally to residual volume (RV) mostly through an increase in RV&#xD;
      (elevated residual volume/total lung capacity ratio, RV/TLC). The reduced difference between&#xD;
      forced and tidal expiratory flows promotes dynamic lung hyperinflation [i.e., a progressive&#xD;
      increase in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV)] under conditions of increased ventilatory&#xD;
      demand. Dynamic lung hyperinflation (DH) increases the mechanical inspiratory load that the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles must overcome to produce ventilation (V'E), places the diaphragm at&#xD;
      mechanical disadvantage, and reduces the ability of VT to expand appropriately during&#xD;
      exercise, thus imposing &quot;restrictive&quot; mechanics: VT is therefore truncated from below by the&#xD;
      increasing EELV and constrained from above by the total lung capacity (TLC) envelope and the&#xD;
      relatively reduced inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). Dynamic hyperinflation-induced critical&#xD;
      mechanical constraint of VT expansion has serious sensory consequences, i.e., increase in&#xD;
      dyspnoea intensity, as clearly shown in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      and chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, our team has recently confirmed that small airway dysfunction at spirometry&#xD;
      exists in the majority of PAH patients (60%) despite preserved FEV1/VC, and that this&#xD;
      promotes the development of DH under the increased ventilatory demand in response to physical&#xD;
      task: in fact, during the accelerated ventilatory response to exercise, 60% of PAH patients&#xD;
      did increase their EELV (i.e., DH) by an average of 0.50L from rest to peak exercise, whereas&#xD;
      age- and sex-matched healthy subjects did decrease it by an average of 0.45L. Similar levels&#xD;
      of DH have been reported in healthy subjects between 40 and 80 years of age, patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-severe COPD, CHF, and recently also in a heterogeneous group of patients with&#xD;
      precapillary pulmonary hypertension, but at much lower V'E and work-rate than in our more&#xD;
      homogeneous group of PAH patients. Our team did also show that DH had serious sensory&#xD;
      consequences for PAH patients. DH imposed severe mechanical constraints on VT expansion&#xD;
      during exercise on a background of progressively increasing central neural drive: VT was&#xD;
      truncated from below by the increasing EELV and constrained from above by the TLC envelope&#xD;
      and the relatively reduced IRV. It is generally accepted that in this setting dyspnoea&#xD;
      results from the conscious awareness of the increasing disparity between respiratory effort&#xD;
      (or neural drive to breathe) and simultaneous thoracic volume displacement. The notion that&#xD;
      DH and the subsequent constraint of VT expansion contributed to exertional dyspnoea was&#xD;
      bolstered by the strong inverse correlation between dyspnoea intensity and both the increase&#xD;
      dynamic EELV/TLC(%) (R=0.70, p&lt;0.05) and the reduced IRV/TLC(%) (R=-0.78, p&lt;0.05) at a&#xD;
      standardized exercise stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team was able, for the first time, to clearly demonstrate that an abnormal mechanics of&#xD;
      breathing (dynamic lung hyperinflation and the attendant constraint of VT expansion) played&#xD;
      an important role in dyspnoea causation in PAH during cycle exercise. When increased&#xD;
      ventilation/perfusion mismatching is superimposed on pre-existing abnormal airway function,&#xD;
      greater troublesome exertional symptoms are the result. This finding opens up new horizons&#xD;
      for research in the field of dyspnoea mechanisms in PAH: if investigator treats and&#xD;
      ameliorates the &quot;lung function&quot; (i.e., the respiratory mechanics abnormalities&quot;), then our&#xD;
      team could be able to improve the troublesome exertional symptoms that curtail daily-living&#xD;
      activities of PAH patients. The corollary of this is that any therapeutic intervention that&#xD;
      effectively reduces and/or delays the rate of onset of DH-induced critical ventilatory&#xD;
      constraints, such as administration of inhaled bronchodilators (BDs) as add-ons to&#xD;
      vasodilators, should have a positive effect on symptom perception in selected patients with&#xD;
      stable PAH. Determining the magnitude of this effect will be the object of the planned&#xD;
      experiments. However, it should be borne in mind that the relationship between dyspnoea&#xD;
      intensity and the severity of respiratory abnormalities is not linear, but rather&#xD;
      exponential. In other words, when a given disease is already responsible for a very intense&#xD;
      dyspnoea, a small additional deterioration directly or indirectly related to the disease can&#xD;
      make dyspnoea intolerable. Therefore, even small BDs-induced changes in respiratory mechanics&#xD;
      could have major effects on dyspnoea intensity on exertion in selected PAH patients, which&#xD;
      would undoubtedly have a major impact on their quality of life and their ability to perform&#xD;
      daily-living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for the research What is the potential mechanism by which BDs would be able to&#xD;
      ameliorate the exertional symptoms in patients with stable PAH, and, which BDs would be the&#xD;
      best candidate in achieving that? Regardless of the BDs administered, our team anticipates&#xD;
      that the potential mechanism by which BDs are able to ameliorate the exertional symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with stable PAH would be the reduction and/or delay of the rate of onset of&#xD;
      DH-induced critical ventilatory constraints during exercise. In contrast, the nature of the&#xD;
      specific BD (β2-agonist or anticholinergic) would be important in determining the mechanism&#xD;
      by which the reduction in DH-induced critical ventilatory constraints can be achieved. BDs&#xD;
      have been extensively studied in COPD patients, and to less extent in CHF patients. Little is&#xD;
      known in PAH patients. Spiekerkoetter and colleagues have recently pointed out that inhaled&#xD;
      β2-agonists are able to cause a mild but significant increase in resting FEV1, FEF50% and&#xD;
      FEF75% in PAH patients. They also showed that inhalation of β2-agonists determined a&#xD;
      significant increase in resting cardiac output accompanied by an increase in stroke volume&#xD;
      and a decrease in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, in the presence of no change in&#xD;
      heart rate. To date, no information is available on the effects of inhaled β2-agonists on the&#xD;
      ventilatory, mechanical and perceptual responses to exercise in PAH patients. It can be&#xD;
      argued that β2-agonists may reduce and/or delay the rate of onset of DH-induced critical&#xD;
      ventilatory constraints by 1) reducing the ventilatory demand in response to exercise, and/or&#xD;
      by 2) modifying the shape and limits of the maximal flow-volume loop (MFVL). In the first&#xD;
      case, the improved cardiac function and concurrent ventilation-perfusion relations following&#xD;
      β2-agonists would reduce the ventilatory demand, thereby reducing the rate of DH and&#xD;
      enhancing VT expansion during exercise. This, in turn, would be expected to reduce the&#xD;
      perceived exertional dyspnoea, as clearly shown in patients with COPD following BDs. In the&#xD;
      second case, β2-agonists would increase the maximal volume-corrected expiratory flow rates in&#xD;
      the effort-independent mid-volume range where tidal breathing occurs (i.e., increase in&#xD;
      FEF50% and FEF75%), as it has been shown in CHF. This means that PAH patients would now&#xD;
      accomplish the required alveolar ventilation at a lower operating lung volume and, therefore,&#xD;
      at a reduced oxygen cost of breathing during exercise. The corollary of this will be that PAH&#xD;
      patients would increase their end-expiratory lung volume (i.e., DH) to less extent after&#xD;
      inhalation of β2-agonist than before, and this is likely to have salutary sensory&#xD;
      consequences (i.e., reduction in dyspnoea intensity) for patients with PAH, as clearly shown&#xD;
      in patients with COPD. Inhaled anticholinergic agents have not yet been studied, neither at&#xD;
      rest nor during exercise in PAH. Inhalation of anticholinergic agents would increase the&#xD;
      maximal volume-corrected expiratory flow rates in the effort-independent mid-volume range&#xD;
      where tidal breathing occurs, without interfering with the cardiac and pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      functions, as it has been shown in patients with CHF. The attendant increase in FEF50% and&#xD;
      FEF75% (where tidal breathing occurs) following inhaled anticholinergic agents would cause VT&#xD;
      to be accommodated at a lower operating lung volume, thus reducing the extent of DH and the&#xD;
      concurrent ventilatory constraints imposed by the accelerated ventilatory response to&#xD;
      exercise. This, in turn, is likely to have salutary sensory consequences (i.e., reduction in&#xD;
      dyspnoea intensity) for patients with PAH. The interest of our study in dyspnoea evaluation&#xD;
      after BDs in PAH patients is, therefore, evident and appealing, for at least two reasons: 1)&#xD;
      there is no information in the literature about the effect of pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      on dyspnoea intensity (measured by Borg score) during cycle exercise in PAH population, and&#xD;
      2) investigators do not know how much will the dyspnoea intensity (measured by Borg score)&#xD;
      change after BD administration in PAH population because no Minimally Clinically Important&#xD;
      Difference (MCID) has been established for measurements of dyspnoea intensity. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      based on COPD studies, short-term post-intervention changes in dyspnoea intensity of ~1 Borg&#xD;
      unit at a standardized exercise time or V'E appear to be clinically meaningful, therefore our&#xD;
      team can assume that this MCID may also apply to PAH patients undergoing cycle exercise&#xD;
      testing after BD interventions.&#xD;
