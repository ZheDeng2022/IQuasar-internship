  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this study a resistance bout will be performed in order to promote the robust response of&#xD;
      protein synthesis. Type II muscle fibers often exhibit more atrophy than type I fibers in&#xD;
      COPD subjects therefore specifically targeting them in an exercise protocol could have more&#xD;
      beneficial outcome for these individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the following hypothesis will be tested: A bout of resistance exercise will&#xD;
      affect the acute and 24h response in whole-body protein and amino acid metabolism and&#xD;
      cognitive function as compared to baseline values in COPD patients and healthy subjects. To&#xD;
      do this, subjects will complete a baseline visit in which they receive stable amino acid&#xD;
      tracers. The next day they will complete a one-time resistance exercise with an immediate&#xD;
      measurement of the amino acid tracers, and return 24 hours after exercise to repeat amino&#xD;
      acid tracer measurements. This project will provide important clinical information on the&#xD;
      whole body protein and amino acid metabolic response to acute resistance exercise in elderly&#xD;
      subjects with COPD, as well as, the exercise induced changes in physical and cognitive&#xD;
      function, and absolute muscular strength capacity in this population. In this way, this study&#xD;
      will provide preliminary data for the development of standardized, repeatable resistance&#xD;
      exercise protocols that will stop the process of ongoing muscle loss and improve metabolism&#xD;
      and function in COPD subjects.&#xD;
