  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collagens are proteins present in all tissues. Besides their structural role, recent data&#xD;
      showed that they were able to regulate many cellular functions. Many interactions occur&#xD;
      between extracellular matrix macromolecules, especially collagen, and various cell types.&#xD;
      These interactions can be controlled by peptides derived extracellular matrix macromolecules,&#xD;
      called matrikines. Previous work from the investigators laboratory and others have shown that&#xD;
      several C-terminal domain (NC1 domains) from basement membrane-associated collagens could&#xD;
      regulate many cellular activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung is an organ particularly abundant in basement membranes. It is likely that various lung&#xD;
      diseases may affect metabolism of basement membrane associated collagens. To the&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, no study has focused on the expression of collagen XIX α1 chain and&#xD;
      collagen IV chains α3 and α4 chains in lung and studied possible variations of expression in&#xD;
      various pathophysiological situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the presence of collagen IV and XIX (or fragments) in different types of sampling&#xD;
           such as bronchoalveolar lavage, pulmonary aspiration and bronchial biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate quantitative variations of expression of these collagen in different pulmonary&#xD;
           diseases, especially chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy, infectious pneumonia,&#xD;
           pneumonitis or lung cancer.&#xD;

      Experimental Design: Cross-sectional study, with prospective inclusions, single center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Realization of bronchoscopy according to the indications (with or without&#xD;
           bronchoalveolar lavage with or without bronchial biopsy, participation in research that&#xD;
           do not modify patient's care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  samples are sent to the laboratory, centrifuged and stored at -80°C until they were&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  samples were used to specific analysis in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of qualitative expression of collagen IV and XIX by Reverse transcription&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of quantitative variations of these collagens by ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis planification:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of the data (mean and standard deviation),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparison of different groups (non-pathological vs pulmonary disease) by Student's t&#xD;
           test, Wilcoxon, Chi2 or Fisher test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and prospects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators should be able to demonstrate the presence of collagen IV and/or collagen&#xD;
      XIX or different fragments in biological samples. The investigators would then be able to&#xD;
      show variation in expression of these collagens according to different pathological&#xD;
      situations. In the longer term, the objective is to validate these collagens as a markers of&#xD;
      pulmonary pathologies or as therapeutic agents.&#xD;
