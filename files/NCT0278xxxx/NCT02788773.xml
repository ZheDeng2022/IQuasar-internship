    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of giving durvalumab alone or in&#xD;
      combination with tremelimumab on this type of cancer. In addition, this study will look at&#xD;
      the side effects of durvalumab when given alone or in combination with tremelimumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it&#xD;
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and stimulate the immune response. This&#xD;
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has&#xD;
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in nearly 2000 people and seems&#xD;
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to&#xD;
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of&#xD;
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink&#xD;
      tumours in animals and has been studied in nearly 1500 people and seems promising but it is&#xD;
      not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with&#xD;
      durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have&#xD;
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. While the&#xD;
      combination has been studied in 217 people, it is not clear if it can offer better results&#xD;
      than standard treatment.&#xD;

             placed on patients being considered for this trial. The patient's city of residence&#xD;
