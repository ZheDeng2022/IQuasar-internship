      The study design is an open-label, randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at study sites in Uganda and South Africa. The study population will include HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients on first-line antiretroviral therapy with a recent viral load &gt;1,000&#xD;
      copies/milliliter (or dried blood spot viral load &gt;1,000 copies/milliliter). Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to the WHO-based standard of care for management of virologic&#xD;
      failure or immediate resistance testing to guide ART regimen decisions. The primary outcome&#xD;
      of interest will be viral suppression (&lt;200 copies/mL) at 9 months after study enrollment,&#xD;
      and will be assessed using an intention to treat analysis, where missing or absent results&#xD;
      will be considered failures. Secondary outcomes of interest will be viral suppression below&#xD;
      the limit of assay detection, viral suppression on continuation of first-line (non-nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]-based) therapy, drug resistance at study conclusion,&#xD;
      and mortality, among others. The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      addition of routine resistance testing, to guide management of virologic failure and sustain&#xD;
      the successful completion of the HIV continuum of care, improves clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      reduces costs for patients with virologic failure on first-line therapy in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa.&#xD;

      STUDY PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD OF CARE ARM&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Visit 1-SOC: Baseline Visit for Standard of Care Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 1, participants randomized to the SOC will complete the baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      to collect sociodemographic, HIV clinical and treatment history, self-reported ART medication&#xD;
      adherence, quality of life, and resource allocation data. Study staff will review participant&#xD;
      records to collect data on clinic initiation start date, opportunistic infection history, ART&#xD;
      initiation date, ART regimen history, CD4 count and viral load result histories. A single&#xD;
      10cc blood specimen will be drawn for storage for future testing for viral load, resistance&#xD;
      testing, and drug therapeutic monitoring. Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire,&#xD;
      participants will be referred to clinic counselors who will conduct adherence support&#xD;
      counseling as per standard clinical procedures. A follow-up study visit will be scheduled 3&#xD;
      months from the baseline date (or at 1 month for pregnant participants only). Any interim&#xD;
      clinical visits that are indicated by the clinic staff will be maintained. The participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to continue their current ART regimen until at least the next clinical&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Visit 2A-SOC: Repeat Viral Load Testing Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 2A, participants in the SOC arm will undergo blood collection for viral load&#xD;
      testing in keeping with WHO guidelines. An additional tube 10cc tube will be drawn for&#xD;
      storage for future analyses. A study questionnaire will be administered to assess&#xD;
      self-reported ART medication adherence. No other procedures are scheduled at this visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be notified that study staff will contact them as soon as their results are&#xD;
      available, to request return to clinic for further management. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to continue their current ART regimen until at least the next clinical visit. As&#xD;
      soon as the viral load result is available, study participants will be contacted and&#xD;
      requested to return to clinic for review. If the viral load is indeterminate or not completed&#xD;
      for any reason, study staff will request that the participant return for a repeat viral load&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Visit 2B-SOC: Viral Load Testing Results and Therapeutic Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 2B, study clinicians will review the viral load result. Participants with a&#xD;
      viral load ≤ 1,000 copies/mL will continue their first-line (NNRTI-based) ART regimen without&#xD;
      change. Participants with a viral load &gt;1,000 copies/mL will change ART regimen to a&#xD;
      second-line, protease inhibitor (PI)-based or, if available, integrase inhibitor (II)-based&#xD;
      therapy. Clinicians will also be encouraged to change the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      component of the regimen (for example, changing from zidovudine to tenofovir), based on prior&#xD;
      exposures, as well as WHO and national guidelines. All regimen decisions will be made by the&#xD;
      study clinician, in cooperation with clinic staff at the study sites. In the case of complex&#xD;
      management issues, the site principal investigators (Dr. Bosco Bwana in Mbarara and Dr. Yunus&#xD;
      Moosa in Durban) will be contacted to offer input. At the conclusion of Visit 2B-SOC,&#xD;
      participants in the SOC arm will be scheduled for a final study visit approximately 6 months&#xD;
      later. A final visit at 6 months is chosen to allow ample time for drug suppression for&#xD;
      participants with detectable viral load at this 3-month visit. Non-study clinical visits for&#xD;
      routine clinical care will continue in the interim as determined and scheduled by clinic&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Visit 3: Outcome Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 3, participants will undergo repeat blood testing for plasma viral load and,&#xD;
      if the viral load is detectable, reflex resistance testing will be performed. An additional&#xD;
      10cc tube will be drawn for storage for future testing. A study questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered to assess resource allocation, ART medication adherence, and quality of life.&#xD;
      Study staff will review participant records to update interim CD4 count, viral load, and ART&#xD;
      regimen data. Results of viral load and resistance testing from this visit will be&#xD;
      immediately made available to clinic staff for further patient management. At the conclusion&#xD;
      of Visit 3, study procedures will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Missing and Late Appointments&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study participants do not return for study visits, study staff will call them to encourage&#xD;
      return to clinic for continuation or completion of procedures. For participants who do not&#xD;
      return within 7 days of a scheduled visit and unreachable by phone, a study staff member will&#xD;
      attempt to track them at home using a standardized lost-to-follow-up form and procedures&#xD;
      developed and used successfully both for program and clinical care in Mbarara for over 10&#xD;
      years. If participants are located, study staff will encourage them to return to clinic to&#xD;
      complete procedures and/or conduct the blood draw and questionnaire in in the field if the&#xD;
      participant agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO RESISTANCE TESTING ARM&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Visit 1-RT: Baseline Visit for Resistance Testing Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 1, participants randomized to the RT will complete the baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      to collect sociodemographic, HIV clinical and treatment history, self-reported ART medication&#xD;
      adherence, quality of life, and resource allocation data. Study staff will review participant&#xD;
      records to collect data on clinic initiation start date, opportunistic infection history, ART&#xD;
      initiation date, ART regimen history, CD4 count and viral load result histories. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants will undergo phlebotomy for resistance&#xD;
      testing. Participants will be notified that study staff will contact them as soon as their&#xD;
      results are available, to request return to clinic for further management. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the study procedures, participants will be referred to clinic counselors who will conduct&#xD;
      adherence support counseling as per standard clinical procedures. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to continue their current ART regimen until at least the next clinical visit. As&#xD;
      soon as the resistance test result is available, study participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone and requested to return to clinic for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Visit 2-RT: Resistance Testing Results and Therapeutic Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 2-RT, study clinicians will review the resistance testing result. A study&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA drug resistance interpretation guide will be used to help guide decision-making.&#xD;
      Participants without significant drug resistance, as determined by the study clinician in&#xD;
      consultation with the resistance interpretation guide will continue their first-line&#xD;
      (NNRTI-based) ART regimen without change. Participants with therapeutic drug resistance will&#xD;
      change ART regimen to a second-line, protease inhibitor (PI)-based or, if available,&#xD;
      integrase inhibitor (II)-based therapy. Clinicians will also be encouraged to change the&#xD;
      nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase component of the regimen (for example, changing from&#xD;
      zidovudine to tenofovir). All regimen decisions will be made by the study clinician, in&#xD;
      cooperation with clinic staff at the study sites. In the case of complex management issues,&#xD;
      the site principal investigators (Dr. Bosco Bwana in Mbarara and Dr. Yunus Moosa in Durban)&#xD;
      will be contacted to offer input. At the conclusion of Visit 2-RT, participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled for a final study visit approximately 9 months from the time of enrollment. A final&#xD;
      visit 9 months later is chosen to match the approximate 9-month study duration for&#xD;
      participants in the SOC arm. Non-study clinical visits for routine clinical care will&#xD;
      continue in the interim as determined and scheduled by clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Visit 3: Outcome Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Study Visit 3, participants will undergo repeat blood testing for plasma viral load and,&#xD;
      if the viral load is detectable, reflex resistance testing will be performed. An additional&#xD;
      10cc tube will be drawn for storage for future testing for viral load, resistance testing,&#xD;
      and drug therapeutic monitoring. A study questionnaire will be administered to assess&#xD;
      resource allocation and quality of life. Study staff will review participant records to&#xD;
      update interim CD4 count, viral load, and ART regimen data. Results of viral load and&#xD;
      resistance testing from this visit will be immediately made available to clinic staff for&#xD;
      further patient management. At the conclusion of Visit 3, study procedures will be complete.&#xD;

    <description>Follows the 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) HIV treatment guidelines. Study participants will receive adherence support and return for a repeat viral load test in 3 months (or in 1 month for pregnant participants). Treatment failure will be defined by two consecutive viral load measurements greater than 1,000 copies/mL. Participants who meet this criteria will be switched to second-line therapy. Those with a viral load &lt;1,000 copies/mL at repeat testing will be retained on first-line therapy.</description>
