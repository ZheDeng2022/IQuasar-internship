      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health problem in France and worldwide. CRC is the&#xD;
      third most common cancer in incidence and mortality in France. The vast majority of these&#xD;
      cancers are adenocarcinomas that arise sporadically and develop from precursor lesions:&#xD;
      adenoma. All CRC with the same disease stage do not have the same prognosis. Various&#xD;
      parameters have been identified as factors influencing the prognosis and allows adjustment of&#xD;
      the treatment. The poor histoprognostic factors are vessels and nerves invasion by the tumor&#xD;
      or the mucinous adenocarcinoma subtype. At the molecular level, the presence of&#xD;
      microsatellite instability (MSI) improves the prognosis, while the presence of a BRAF&#xD;
      mutation is an independent poor prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different molecular pathways of colonic carcinogenesis are the chromosomal instability&#xD;
      pathway, the microsatellite instability pathway inducing errors in DNA mismatch repair and&#xD;
      the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). The hypermethylation of CpG islands of genes&#xD;
      promoters leads to an over or most frequently under gene expression. CIMP is observed in near&#xD;
      15% of CRC and is associated with specific clinical and pathological features: older&#xD;
      patients, female predominance, right colonic involvement, poorly differentiated or mucinous&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas. From a molecular point of view, the high CIMP phenotype is strongly&#xD;
      associated with the presence of BRAFV600E mutation, the absence of RAS mutation and the&#xD;
      presence of microsatellite instability. The prognostic value of CIMP is actually&#xD;
      controversial. A recent meta-analysis found that the CIMP phenotype was associated with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis. Methylation of some genes promoters as CDKN2A is associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LRP-1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) is a multifunctional endocytic&#xD;
      receptor that belongs to the LDL receptors the family. It mediates the clearance of many&#xD;
      extracellular enzymes involved in the spread of cancer cells: metalloproteinases and serine&#xD;
      proteinases. Decrease of LRP-1 activity or loss of LRP-1 expression correlates with increased&#xD;
      aggressiveness of cancer cells in certain types of cancer. The expression of LRP-1 has almost&#xD;
      never been studied in CRC. Only one immunohistochemical study of LRP-1 protein expression in&#xD;
      colonic adenocarcinoma has been published to date. This study shows that tumor cells express&#xD;
      LRP-1, but in nearly half the cases, weaker than in normal cells colic. The mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the decrease of expression are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An epigenetic mechanism might be involved as hypermethylation of the of LRP-1 gene promoter,&#xD;
      especially as the promoter of this gene is rich in CpG islands (methylation targets).&#xD;
      Clinical and prognostic significance of the LRP-1 gene expression and promoter methylation is&#xD;
      actually unknown.&#xD;

      An epigenetic mechanism might be involved as hypermethylation of the of LRP-1 gene promoter,&#xD;

&#xD;
      The clinical impact of the level of LRP-1 expression on overall survival of cancer patients&#xD;
      has been assessed in two studies: one on patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma and&#xD;
      one on patients suffering from primitive lung adenocarcinomas. In both studies, the decrease&#xD;
      of immunohistochemical and gene expression of LRP-1 correlated with overall survival&#xD;
      decrease. The clinical and prognostic impact of LRP-1 expression in CRC and its association&#xD;
      with a particular molecular or morphological profile has not been studied to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will study the methylation pattern of the LRP-1 gene promoter&#xD;
      in a well-characterized series of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to study by methylation analysis the role LRP-1 promoter&#xD;
      gene methylation in the prognosis of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of CIMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to explore the LRP-1 gene promoter methylation in in CRC. This&#xD;
      study will help to increase knowledge of the prognostic role of LRP-1 gene promoter&#xD;
      methylation in CRC and its possible association with clinical, morphological or molecular&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first design the list of all eligible patients by using a request in&#xD;
      the software DIAMIC of th pathology department with component code &quot;colon&quot;, damage code&#xD;
      &quot;adenocarcinoma &quot; and period &quot;between 2006 and 2012&quot;. Patients suffering from Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      or other familial cancer syndrome will be excluded of the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      send to all the selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients list will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients' medical records will be reviewed for: sociodemographic and clinical data&#xD;
           colonic tumor location, TNM stage, MSI, RAS and BRAF status, presence of synchronous&#xD;
           metastases, treatment type and duration, patient follow up to the date of 01/06/2016&#xD;
           point (metastases occurrence, disease recurrence, patient death, ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A central review of all pathological slides will be performed for these criteria:&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma subtype according to WHO 2010 classification, differentiation,&#xD;
           association with polyps and their types, pTNM stage, invasion front and budding, stroma&#xD;
           type, presence and amount of tumor necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylation analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LRP1 gene promoter methylation analysis by pyrosequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CIMP status determination by High Resolution Melting analysis of MLH1, MINT1,&#xD;
                MINT2, MINT31 and CDKN2A genes promoters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data description: mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables; number and&#xD;
           percentage for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of tumors having a high methylation of the LRP-1 gene promoter and tumors&#xD;
           with not or little methylation of the LRP-1 gene promoter by univariate analysis&#xD;
           (Student's test and the Wilcoxon test, Chi2 or Fisher's exact) and multivariate&#xD;
           (logistic regression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search factors associated with patient outcomes, including the methylation of LRP1&#xD;
           promoter and CIMP status, by univariate analysis (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox&#xD;
           model).&#xD;
