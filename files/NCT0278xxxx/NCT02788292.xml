    <textblock>
      A single-centre triple-blind study looking at the addition of NAC to tumescent solution for&#xD;
      liposuction and fat grafting in healthy patient volunteers already undergoing bilateral&#xD;
      breast reduction. Three-dimensional reconstructions and volumetric analysis will be performed&#xD;
      based on CT scans at 0, 1 and 3 months and then histological analysis will be performed after&#xD;
      fat graft explantation at 3 months to determine fat graft vascularity and quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous fat grafting is an increasingly popular technique for soft tissue reconstruction;&#xD;
      however, the surgical technique is limited by inconsistent graft take, undercorrection, and&#xD;
      requirement for repeat procedures. The authors previously examined whether a widely&#xD;
      available, clinically safe anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), could improve&#xD;
      adipose-derived stem cell survival and subsequent graft take when added to tumescent solution&#xD;
      at the time of fat harvest in mice. The addition of NAC to tumescent fluid during fat harvest&#xD;
      in mice protects ADSCs against oxidative stress, increases their survival and proliferation,&#xD;
      and inhibits their early differentiation into mature adipocytes in vitro. In an in vivo&#xD;
      model, NAC treatment at the time of harvest improved survival and quality of autologous fat&#xD;
      grafts. These observations provide proof-of-principle for the use of NAC in the clinical&#xD;
      setting to optimize fat graft yields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The addition of NAC to the tumescent solution used in fat grafting will improve&#xD;
      fat graft survival in humans to potentially decrease the amount of re-operations and&#xD;
      undercorrection that occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: The study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomized, triple-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to be performed at the QEII Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Nova&#xD;
      Scotia. Subjects will be chosen as healthy female patients already presenting to the&#xD;
      operating room for elective breast reduction surgery. These patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      booked for surgery as they present to clinic and will not be expedited in receiving their&#xD;
      elective surgery if enrolled in the study. Each subject will serve as her own control. The&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested by performing lipoaspiration of the thigh/hip region of healthy&#xD;
      patients after the addition of tumescent solution with or without NAC. Approximately 10&#xD;
      millilitres of the fat graft will be injected into each pre-tibial area depending on the&#xD;
      randomization allocation, as described by Kolle et al. (1) The volume of fat graft will be&#xD;
      measured at 0, 1 and 3 months using computed tomographic (CT) scans according to&#xD;
      institutional standards. The CT images will be exported into Materialise Interactive Medical&#xD;
      Image Control System (MIMICS) and volumetric three-dimensional reconstructions will be made&#xD;
      to measure the size and volume of the grafts at each of the time points. The grafts will then&#xD;
      be explanted at 3 months and weighed. The histologic appearance, graded on the amount of&#xD;
      inflammation, cysts/vacuoles, integrity and vascularity with CD31 staining will be assessed.&#xD;
      The results will be compared using two-tailed t-tests. Statistical significance will be set&#xD;
      at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
