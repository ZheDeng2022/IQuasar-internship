    <textblock>
      Patients with high-risk solid tumors, those that are refractory to standard up front therapy&#xD;
      or relapse after completion of therapy, have a very poor prognosis despite attempts to induce&#xD;
      remission with salvage regimen. Novel therapies are critical for this patient population with&#xD;
      high-risk cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of tumors to be recognized and lysed by the immune system offers a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to aid in tumor eradication by expanding and activating these anti-tumor cells.&#xD;
      Through this ability to harness sophisticated and specific immunotherapy, residual or&#xD;
      relapsed disease that is resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy could be eradicated.&#xD;
      Prior studies have suggested both safety of expanded specific T cells and efficacy in the&#xD;
      setting of melanoma, lymphoma or viral eradication. While this therapy has previously been&#xD;
      limited by the versatility of the tumor to down-regulate antigens and evade a single&#xD;
      immune-target, the use of multi-antigen specific T cells may permit better and more durable&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunity. Thus, the investigators propose to infuse these specific multi-antigen&#xD;
      anti-tumor T lymphocytes into patients with high risk solid tumors. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to demonstrate safety of these cells and generate efficacy and biology data that&#xD;
      may be important for future studies that may enhance tumor immunotherapy.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. In each treatment group (A and&#xD;
      B), patients will be enrolled to one of the following TAA-CTL dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level One: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 4 x 107&#xD;
      cells/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive cells due to the presence of refractory disease and/or high risk for&#xD;
      disease relapse and/or residual detectable disease following HSCT or conventional therapy at&#xD;
      the time of the infusion. Group A and Group B patients will use the dose escalation strategy&#xD;
      described above. Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents&#xD;
      for at least 45 days after the infusion of TAA- CTL (for purposes of evaluation), although&#xD;
      such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to four patients will be enrolled at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined at which point to ensure safety a total 8 patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      MTD. Each patient will receive at least one TAA-CTL infusion and may receive a maximum of 8&#xD;
      doses total. Dose escalation will occur once at least 2 patients have completed the 45 day&#xD;
      follow up period following their first TAA-CTL infusion. The first and second doses will be&#xD;
      administered 45 days apart then additional doses will be spaced every 28 days. The expected&#xD;
      volume of each infusion is 1 to 10 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion cohorts of Group B patients with Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and esophageal cancer will be permitted to enroll up to 6 additional patients&#xD;
      in each disease group, to be treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within group B, a cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory Wilms tumor will be enrolled&#xD;
      and receive a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen followed by TAA-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients with measurable or evaluable disease have a response of stable disease or better&#xD;
      by RECIST criteria at the day 28 evaluation after dose 2 or subsequent evaluations they are&#xD;
      eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs at 28 day intervals. Each subsequent&#xD;
      doseis expected to be at the enrollment dose level (i.e. no subsequent dose escalation).&#xD;
      Following dose 1, if a patient's T cell supply is insufficient for subsequent doses at the&#xD;
      enrollment dose level, further treatments may be administered at a lower dose level at the&#xD;
      treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
