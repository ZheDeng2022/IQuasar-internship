      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effects of neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of high and low frequency and intensity, performed during hemodialysis (HD), on&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity and muscle change and inflammation markers in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial, randomized, parallel, open, two-arm, blinded assessor, prospective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, divided equally into two groups: group&#xD;
      of high frequency and intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (HG) and a group of low&#xD;
      frequency and intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (LG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was stratified according to gender using 4 block. Drug treatment established&#xD;
      for both groups remained unchanged throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments were made on the first working day after hemodialysis, following notification and&#xD;
      consent of the medical teams. Patients initially underwent anthropometric measurements and&#xD;
      vital signs, later carried out the assessment of peripheral muscle strength, pulmonary&#xD;
      function test, submaximal exercise capacity and quality of life questionnaire and depression.&#xD;
      After these procedures, the patients were randomized to select HG or LG by opaque envelopes.&#xD;
      These evaluations were performed at baseline and after 12 sessions of completion of the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it was asked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on hemodialysis who&#xD;
      presented their latest blood tests clearance index (Kt / V), creatinine, glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate. The evaluation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulatory plasma, the&#xD;
      enzyme markers of muscle tropism, oxidative stress and muscle injury in patients with CKD was&#xD;
      always held at the end of each month as routine clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups conducted training with peripheral electrical stimulation isometric form in&#xD;
      lateral and medial bilaterally vast, held three times a week, lasting an hour, the first two&#xD;
      hours of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be applied using portable stimulators with 4 channels. The parameters are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HG: frequency of 50 Hertz (Hz), pulse width of 400 microseconds (μs), rise time and fall&#xD;
           time of 2 seconds (s), on:off stimulation, initially with a 1:2 relation in the first&#xD;
           week (10s of stimulation and 20s of rest, with the objective to adapt and minimize the&#xD;
           effects of muscular fatigue), to be increased to a 1:1 relation in the second week (10s&#xD;
           of stimulation of and 10s of rest).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LG: frequency of 5 Hz, on:off stimulation time of 1:3 (10s of stimulation and 30s of&#xD;
           rest) with pulse duration of 100 μs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the current intensity was adjusted individually in the first application. In&#xD;
      HG, the intensity was gradually increased until visible muscle contraction could be observed:&#xD;
      this was the maximum intensity tolerated by the patient. In LG, the intensity was the least&#xD;
      noticeable by the patient. These values were monitored for further calculation of intensity&#xD;
      evolution throughout the training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure (BP) will be measured at baseline, and 30 minutes after the end of the&#xD;
      session and heart rate (HR) will be monitored every 10 minutes using an oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each session there will be a warm-up period, training and slowdown. The first minute will&#xD;
      starting with 20% of the intensity value used in the last session with a gradual increase of&#xD;
      20% per minute until 5 minutes, followed by a 50 minute training period and finishing with a&#xD;
      5 minute recovery period gradual reduction of 20% intensity every minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after training, patients will be asked about their feelings of fatigue / tiredness&#xD;
      of the lower limbs using the modified Borg scale. If reporting muscle pain, the intensity&#xD;
      will be assessed by visual analogue scale visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are recruited 76 patients of both sexes, accepted for hemodialysis treatment for at&#xD;
      least 6 months. 38 patients are allocated for the HG and 38 to LG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was performed in order to advance in GPower 3.1 program based on&#xD;
      the results obtained in the study conducted neuromuscular electrical stimulation during&#xD;
      hemodialysis in patients with chronic kidney disease. the values of peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength were used before and after treatment respectively 185.4 ± 53 and 222.4 ± 36.6 and&#xD;
      the values for the assessment of pre exercise capacity (401.3 ± 55) and post (428.9 ± 69.2)&#xD;
      waiting for electrostimulation observe a similar effect. Using an error of 5% (80% test&#xD;
      power), it was determined the need for inclusion of 12 patients for the variable peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength and 34 patients for exercise capacity. Recital 10% loss would require the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of 14 and 38 patients to check the effect on peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength and on exercise capacity respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main negative effect of electrical stimulation is muscle discomfort and / or fatigue of&#xD;
      the lower limbs during and after training. Patients will be were asked at the beginning and&#xD;
      end of the training on their sense of fatigue / tiredness members, as well as on the feeling&#xD;
      of muscle pain. In addition, the current was adjusted individually and gradually increased&#xD;
      shape with patient consent. In the case that patients feel a discomfort, the intensity of&#xD;
      electric current was reduced, and if required the protocol was stopped by improvement of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were systematized in IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version&#xD;
      20.0. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median and interquartile range&#xD;
      and frequency. To verify the data normality the Shapiro-Wilk test was applied. To compare the&#xD;
      behavior of the variables between groups was used independent t test for parametric variables&#xD;
      and test U Mann Whitney for nonparametric. As for comparing the average pre and post use of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation was used ANOVA test for repeated measurements or Friedman test and to&#xD;
      check if there is a relationship between respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity&#xD;
      was used Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman, according to the normal distribution of&#xD;
      data. The significance level for the statistical treatment was 5% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
