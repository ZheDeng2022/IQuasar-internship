    <textblock>
      Increasing the success rate of rotator cuff healing remains a tremendous challenge for&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons, which encourage the development of new biological therapies. Among many&#xD;
      approaches, activating resident progenitor cells with the Lipogems® product could be an easy,&#xD;
      safe, practical and cost-effective new therapeutic strategy for increasing rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendon healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate efficacy of infiltration of autologous&#xD;
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, in terms of gain in&#xD;
      post-operative Constant score.&#xD;

      Increasing the success rate of rotator cuff healing remains a tremendous challenge for&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons, which encourage the development of new biological therapies. Among many&#xD;
      approaches, the possibility of activating resident stem cells in situ, without the need of&#xD;
      isolating them from biopsies and successive in vitro culturing, could represent a very&#xD;
      promising therapeutic strategy. Along this line, it has been recently demonstrated that a&#xD;
      lipoaspirate product, such as the Lipogems® product, contains and produces growth factors&#xD;
      that may activate resident stem cells. Recently, it has been discovered that also the human&#xD;
      rotator cuff contains a reservoir of progenitor cells, which can be isolated and expanded in&#xD;
      vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate efficacy of infiltration of autologous&#xD;
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, in terms of gain in&#xD;
      post-operative Constant score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals are to evaluate efficacy of infiltration of autologous micro-fragmented&#xD;
      adipose tissue in arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, in terms of post-operative pain&#xD;
      reduction, gain in post-operative strength in abduction and external rotation; estimate&#xD;
      incidence of re-ruptures at 1 and 2 years post-operatively, quantify the amount of fatty&#xD;
      degeneration of the supraspinatus at 1 and 2 years post-operatively.&#xD;
