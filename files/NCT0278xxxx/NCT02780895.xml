      This trial is a longitudinal, prospective, interventional, uncontrolled study designed to&#xD;
      test, firstly, the safety and secondly, the potential efficacy of intraputaminal grafting of&#xD;
      undifferentiated hfSC for the treatment of PD. Patients were monitored carefully for any&#xD;
      adverse effects. All patients underwent baseline and 6- and 12-month post-surgery&#xD;
      neurological, neuropsychological, MRI, and PET evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procurement, isolation, expansion, and characterization of hfSC, as well as assessment of&#xD;
      patients' immune response to hfSC grafting, were performed at Celavie Biosciences, LLC&#xD;
      (Oxnard, CA USA). Patient selection, pre- and post-surgery neurological, neuropsychological,&#xD;
      and MRI evaluations, as well as stereotactic surgery and post-surgery care, were performed at&#xD;
      Hospital Angeles del Pedregal (Mexico City, Mexico). Synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals and&#xD;
      PET imaging were carried out at the Radiopharmacy-Cyclotron Unit of the Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico). Eight patients with moderate&#xD;
      to advanced PD were selected for this trial. One of the patients was lost to follow up due to&#xD;
      reasons unrelated to this study. Subjects that completed follow up were 2 females and 5&#xD;
      males, with ages ranging between 43-74 years (mean age 56 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procurement and expansion of hfSC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human fetal brain tissue was procured via routine sterile manual aspiration methods with&#xD;
      informed consent from the donor in accordance with NIH guidelines for use of fetal tissue as&#xD;
      well as federal, and state laws. Tissue donor and hfSC recipients remained unknown to each&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal blood samples (sera) were tested for: HIV (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park IL, USA)&#xD;
      hepatitis A, B and C (Abbott); HTLVI (Abbott); VDRL (Baxter Agglutination Slide Test and&#xD;
      reflex FTA), and cytomegalovirus (Quest, Oxnard CA). Women with a history of genital herpes,&#xD;
      cancer, asthma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, vasculitis of autoimmune origin, and&#xD;
      drug abuse were excluded. Gestation was determined according to Carnegie stages. Fetal tissue&#xD;
      was harvested at the sixth week of gestation after elective abortion. Fetal brain was&#xD;
      dissected, minced and triturated to a single cell suspension. Cells were cultured in flasks&#xD;
      incubated at 37°C under hypoxic conditions (5% O2 and 5% CO2) through 4 doublings. At the&#xD;
      second doubling (D2) cell culture was tested for sterility (USP &lt;71&gt;) and at D4 culture was&#xD;
      karyotyped and PCR tested for presence of adventitious agents: HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HIV-1 (A, B,&#xD;
      D, F, H, N), hepatitis A, B and C, T. p. pallidum, CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HPV. Cells were then&#xD;
      transferred to a closed bioreactor system (GE WAVE Bioreactor 2/10 System, Uppsala SWE),&#xD;
      operating under the same physical and chemical conditions. The bioreactor was used to create&#xD;
      the Master Cell Bank (MCB), which was harvested, tested, characterized and rate-control&#xD;
      cryopreserved after a total of seven doublings (D7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the MCB was safety tested and characterized, a portion of the batch was thawed and used&#xD;
      to seed the bioreactor for the Working Cell Bank (WCB) production. Cells were cultured in the&#xD;
      bioreactor until they reached D13. They were harvested (Centritech LAB-III, Carr Centritech&#xD;
      Separation System, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA), aliquoted (Fill-It; TAP Biosystems,&#xD;
      Wilmington, DE, USA), and cryopreserved to create a WCB. The WCB was subjected to release&#xD;
      testing for safety and characterization assays. Safety testing included sterility (USP &lt;71&gt;),&#xD;
      mycoplasma (USP &lt;63), endotoxin (USP &lt;85&gt;), and karyotyping (Cell Line Genetics, Madison WI,&#xD;
      USA). Characterization included flow cytometry testing for: Oct-4 &gt;90% (10H11.2, EMD&#xD;
      Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; AF488 conjugated), Sox-2 &gt;90% (Btjce, eBioscience, San Diego&#xD;
      CA, USA; AF488 conjugated), MHC-I &lt;10% (A4, eBioscience; APC conjugated), MHC-II &lt;10% (CVS20,&#xD;
      Novus Biologicals, Littleton CO, USA; AF488 conjugated), CD105 &lt;10% (SN6, eBioscience; PE-Cy7&#xD;
      conjugated), and tyrosine hydroxylase &lt;10% (EP1532Y, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; FITC conjugated&#xD;
      goat anti-rabbit IgG; Abcam; polyclonal). Both MCB and WCB were stored in gas phase LN2 at&#xD;
      -196°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were performed under aseptic conditions in an ISO 8 clean room, utilizing ISO&#xD;
      5 bio-safety cabinets and laminar airflow hoods, according to validated protocols. Cells were&#xD;
      shown to have a normal karyotype and did not produce teratomas in immunocompromised rodents&#xD;
      (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppression via cyclosporine A at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day was started 10 days prior to&#xD;
      surgery and continued for one month thereafter. Patients also received Indomethacin&#xD;
      225mg/day, starting at 10 days prior to implantation and for six months postoperatively&#xD;
      thereafter. Wide spectrum antibiotic (Zannat 700mg) was given preoperatively and 48 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively. Antiparkinsonian medications were adjusted to patient's requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI-guided stereotactic intraputaminal cell implantation into PD patients was performed using&#xD;
      a Leksell Stereotactic System and Stealth Station Surgical Navigation System (Fridley,&#xD;
      Minnesota, USA). Ropivacaine was used as a local anesthetic for frame placement. For target&#xD;
      locations, measurements were made using CT-scan images fused with previous MR images (both in&#xD;
      DICOM format, in axial sections 1.0 mm thick). With the patient under general anesthesia, the&#xD;
      stereotactic frame was fixed to the operating table with a Mayfield head holder. Bilateral&#xD;
      parasagittal incisions and corresponding 14 mm burr holes (one for each hemisphere) were made&#xD;
      in preparation for cell suspension injections. Two different needle tracks through the same&#xD;
      burr hole were selected for each side. Target locations were determined by height and length&#xD;
      of putaminal nuclei. The lowest Z-coordinates of each track were located in the dorsal&#xD;
      putamen and spaced 4mm apart in the X-direction. Each needle track received 1X106 cells in 1&#xD;
      cc of culture medium. To ensure complete cell suspension delivery, injections were carried&#xD;
      out slowly for 2 min with reciprocal withdrawal of the delivery needle to avoid both damage&#xD;
      to stem cells and brain tissue, as well as to avert reflux or bubble formation. After&#xD;
      surgery, patients were kept in a conventional post-operative care unit for 1 h. The day&#xD;
      following surgery, MR images were obtained to confirm correct placement of cell suspensions.&#xD;
      All patients were discharged 24 h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological endpoints of this study included evaluation of the number and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events after cell grafting, and the efficacy in the improvement of motor responses,&#xD;
      as assessed on the UPDRS part I (mentation, behavior and mood), part II (motor activities of&#xD;
      the daily living), part III (motor performance), and part IV (complications of therapy), as&#xD;
      well as the modified Höehn and Yahr Scale, and the modified Schwab and England Activities of&#xD;
      the Daily Living Scale. Patients were clinically evaluated with these scales at screening (as&#xD;
      baseline, before surgery), and then after the procedure at six and 12 months. At every visit,&#xD;
      patients were asked to discontinue antiparkinsonian medications at least 12 hours before the&#xD;
      UPDRS assessment (for practical purposes, &quot;OFF&quot; state was defined as overnight drug&#xD;
      withdrawal) in order to be rated in their &quot;OFF&quot; state and then, UPDRS &quot;ON&quot; medication&#xD;
      evaluations were performed 1 hour after receiving their usual dose of levodopa. Each patient&#xD;
      received the same preoperative levodopa dose for each assessment. Adverse events, including&#xD;
      those reported by the patients spontaneously and those observed during the evaluations were&#xD;
      recorded. After obtaining signed informed consent from all patients that completed the study,&#xD;
      all &quot;OFF&quot; and &quot;ON&quot; UPDRS evaluations, were videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive performance was evaluated using the following instruments: Mexican adaptations of&#xD;
      Beck and Steer's anxiety [25] and depression [26] inventories; our brief neuropsychological&#xD;
      (NEUROPSI)[27,28] and computerized neuropsychological test batteries, and the Mini-mental&#xD;
      Parkinson State Examination (MMPSE)[29]. Patients reported on their quality of life as&#xD;
      related to their daily living activities; physical and mental well-being (health status);&#xD;
      cognition and communication, and one summary index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's blood was evaluated for increase in titers of hfSC specific antibodies and for&#xD;
      increase in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity after implantation as compared to&#xD;
      baseline values. Samples were drawn one month prior to cell implantation, and then one month&#xD;
      and six months after surgery. Whole blood specimens were collected from each patient and&#xD;
      processed as serum one and six months post-grafting using the lipophilic membrane dye PKH67&#xD;
      (Sigma-Aldrich) as described by the manufacturer for cell tracking in immune response and&#xD;
      cytotoxicity assays by flow cytometry [30,31]. Cytotoxicity assay was performed with 100:1,&#xD;
      50:1, and 25:1 effector to target ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR images were obtained before surgery (baseline) and three times after cell implantation at&#xD;
      24 h, and six and 12 months post-surgery. They were acquired with a 3 Tesla magnet, MR&#xD;
      Systems Achieva release 2.6.3.8 Philips (Best, The Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET molecular imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients underwent PET molecular imaging at baseline, at six months (data not presented), and&#xD;
      at one year after hfSC implantation. Radiopharmaceuticals utilized were&#xD;
      (+)-alpha-[11C]Dihidrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), 6-[18F]Fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA), and [11C]Raclopride&#xD;
      (RAC). All patients underwent DTBZ-PET scans and one additional study with either FDOPA or&#xD;
      RAC, at least one week apart. Patients were asked to discontinue antiparkinsonian medications&#xD;
      at least 12h before each study. Scans were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64 PET/CT.&#xD;
      Thirty-minute brain emission scans were acquired 20 minutes post-injection of DTBZ or RAC,&#xD;
      while 15 min scans were acquired for FDOPA 75 min post-injection. All patients studied with&#xD;
      FDOPA were pre-medicated with 150 mg of carbidopa to prevent peripheral decarboxylation.&#xD;
      Images were reconstructed using an OSEM-2D algorithm and analyzed with the software&#xD;
      Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM v.12). Each individual PET brain image was normalized on&#xD;
      an anatomical MRI atlas to be evaluated within a standard space. Following normalization, FSL&#xD;
      structural atlases were used for definition of the regions of interest. To facilitate the&#xD;
      quantitative analysis, specific uptake ratios (SUR) in the caudate and putamen were&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting the background signal of a reference region with nonspecific uptake&#xD;
      from striatal activity and dividing by reference region activity [(target uptake - reference&#xD;
      uptake)/reference uptake], using occipital cortex (DTBZ and FDOPA) and cerebellum (RAC), as&#xD;
      reference regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between baseline and 12-month follow-up measurements for anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      NEUROPSI, MMPSE examinations, right and left finger tapping in &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; medication&#xD;
      states were performed using the Wilcoxon test. All other end measures were reported as&#xD;
      individual results for each patient.&#xD;

    <description>MRI-guided stereotactic intraputaminal cell implantation into PD patients was performed.&#xD;
For target locations, measurements were made using CT-scan images fused with previous MR images. Bilateral parasagittal incisions and corresponding 14 mm burr holes were made in preparation for cell suspension injections.&#xD;
To ensure complete cell suspension delivery, injections were carried out slowly for 2 min with reciprocal withdrawal of the delivery needle to avoid both damage to stem cells and brain tissue, as well as to avert reflux or bubble formation.&#xD;
After surgery, patients were kept in a conventional post-operative care unit for 1 h. The day following surgery, MR images were obtained to confirm correct placement of cell suspensions. All patients were discharged 24 h after surgery.</description>
