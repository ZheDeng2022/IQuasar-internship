  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition in cancerology is frequent because it's present for thirty to fifty percent of&#xD;
      the patients at the time of the diagnosis. According to the recommendations of the French&#xD;
      Speaking Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP) of November 2012, a five&#xD;
      percent loss of weight compared to the previous weight increases the risk of toxicity of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy and worsens the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the tumors of the head and the neck comes along very often with a loss of&#xD;
      weight (17.4 % after one year of radiotherapy according to the study of Larsson et al.) which&#xD;
      varies with the chosen treatment, and shows a major risk at the patients whose therapeutic&#xD;
      sequence involves a radiotherapy. The irradiation of the upper aerodigestive tract is source&#xD;
      of aftereffects and late complications: xerostomia, oedemas of mucous membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The xerostomia, connected to the damage of the salivary glands, is a frequent complaint of&#xD;
      the patients. It reveals or even increases, a dysphagia. According to Woisard, six months&#xD;
      after the end of treatments, forty percent of the patients suffer from a dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these complications limit quantitatively and qualitatively the food intake. The&#xD;
      adaptation of the texture of the food is necessary by fifty four percent at three months of&#xD;
      the end of treatments according to Logemann et al., and a few patients remain dependent on an&#xD;
      long term enteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond a change of the nutritional state, the feeding difficulties or even the absence of&#xD;
      resumption of an oral feeding are responsible for a social isolation. The meal which lost its&#xD;
      dimension of pleasure becomes a source of fear and obsession for the patient as well as for&#xD;
      his relations, and this fact generates family tensions. The quality of life of the patient is&#xD;
      heavily affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ravasco showed in his study that the impact on the nutritional state of a nutritional care by&#xD;
      dietary advices was more important as the prescription of oral nutritional supplements but&#xD;
      based on a short period (the dietary intervention covered only the duration of the&#xD;
      radiotherapy). But what would happen after the end of treatments? The investigators emit the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a post-therapeutic systematic and regular dietary support has a positive&#xD;
      impact on the prevention of the undernutrition among the patients affected by a first cancer&#xD;
      of the upper aerodigestive tract whom therapeutic sequence involves a radiotherapy.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a prospective randomized, open and multicentric study. This study&#xD;
      has to include 224 patients affected by a head and neck cancer which therapeutic sequence&#xD;
      involves a more or less made sensitized radiotherapy. The beginning of the inclusions is&#xD;
      planned for May 2016, the end of inclusion 36 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional state and quality of life will be evaluated 6 months after radiotherapy.&#xD;
