      The study to explore the development of these abilities with age, and called &quot;Development of&#xD;
      the conflict detection during the reasoning - Decor&quot; will take place at CYCERON center and&#xD;
      will include two groups of 22 participants: adolescents and young adults (N = 44). More&#xD;
      specifically, this study aims to compare the changes in the brain of adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults when conducting reasoning tasks for which there may be a cognitive conflict. Both&#xD;
      groups of participants then spend an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) focused on the brain&#xD;
      and in which they will carry out two classic tasks covering the main areas of reasoning&#xD;
      (probabilistic and economic). Each of these tasks will be manipulated to include, or not, of&#xD;
      making information call intuition to create or not a conflict between the correct answer&#xD;
      (logic, normative) and biased response (intuitive, heuristic). Because of the major&#xD;
      implication of this brain region in cognitive inhibition processes [of intuitive answer],&#xD;
      measured brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during both tasks version&#xD;
      &quot;with&quot; or &quot;no&quot; conflict will be compared between groups. To better understand the links&#xD;
      between the development of the CCA from adolescence to adulthood and conflict detection,&#xD;
      activity measurements will be correlated with a part in morphometric measurements taken from&#xD;
      the same area (volume Substance Grise - SG; characteristics of cortical sulci) and secondly&#xD;
      to cognitive measures (executive functions - inhibitory control). This cross-sectional study&#xD;
      focused on two age groups: 11-15 years and 19-25 years. For each age group, the participation&#xD;
      of men / boys and women / girls will be balanced up.&#xD;
