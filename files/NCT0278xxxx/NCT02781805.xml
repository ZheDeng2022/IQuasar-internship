  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to mechanistically define the potential anticancer activities of&#xD;
      the osteoporosis bisphosphonate (BP) drug alendronate, and extend the analysis to learn novel&#xD;
      information about the impact of BP on gamma delta (γδ) T cells in breast tissues as well as&#xD;
      epithelial breast cell differentiation of high-risk women. To this end, we have designed a BP&#xD;
      &quot;window trial&quot; to examine the effect of 1 - 3 weeks administration of alendronate on women at&#xD;
      high-risk for breast cancer, at the level of immunosurveillance and mammary epithelial cell&#xD;
      differentiation.&#xD;

          -  Patients referred for risk reduction mastectomy (eg. BRCA or other high-risk gene&#xD;
             mutations, strong family history of breast cancer, prior or current LCIS, ADH, ALH and&#xD;
             DCIS undergoing bilateral mastectomy or prophylactic contralateral mastectomy), oe&#xD;
             patients at high-risk for breast cancer (eg. BRCA or other high-risk gene mutations,&#xD;
             strong family history of breast cancer, prior or current LCIS, ADH, ALH and DCIS) who&#xD;
             are not planning for immediate risk reduction mastectomy and are undergoing routine&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are premenopausal defined as an individual with at least six menstrual&#xD;

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Alendronate on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             sexually active heterosexual women must agree to use an effective form of birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of study participation. Women who are NOT having 1) a&#xD;

             their breast surgery will also be required to use an effective form of birth control&#xD;
             for 56 days following the last dose of study medication. In addition to, premenopausal&#xD;
             women who are undergoing routine follow up and are not having surgery will be required&#xD;
             to use an effective form of birth control for 56 days following the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. One of the following methods of birth control must be used by sexually&#xD;
