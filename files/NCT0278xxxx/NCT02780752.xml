  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to add further understanding to the doses of hymecromone that&#xD;
      effectively and safely lead to the inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis. In this study we will&#xD;
      investigate both circulating hyaluronan in the serum, as well as tissue hyaluronan, using&#xD;
      sputum samples as a non-invasive surrogate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a parallel, open-label, single-center, dose-response study of hymecromone in healthy&#xD;
      adults 18 years of age or older. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated for 4 days with study drug. Safety as well as biomarkers of pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic response will be monitored during therapy.&#xD;
