      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect Ulimorelin in patients with enteral&#xD;
      feeding intolerance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled study. The study&#xD;
      consists of 2 parallel-dose treatment groups consisting of ulimorelin and metoclopramide.&#xD;
      Approximately 120 mechanically ventilated, tube-fed patients with EFI will participate in&#xD;
      this trial. To be eligible for study participation, the patients must be intolerant to&#xD;
      continuous gastric tube feedings, with intolerance defined as having a gastric residual&#xD;
      volume (GRV) of ≥ 500 mL on one or more measurements.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and non-pregnant women aged 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving continuous nasogastric, orogastric, or percutaneous gastric tube feeding,&#xD;
             with no contraindication to advancing feedings per the feeding protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 12-Fr or larger nasogastric, orogastric, or percutaneous gastric feeding tube, with&#xD;
             its distal tip at least 10 cm below the gastroesophageal junction and visible in the&#xD;
             stomach on a routine radiographic examination within 24 hours of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enteral feeding intolerance, defined as a GRV of ≥ 500 mL on one or more measurements&#xD;
             Expected to remain intubated, mechanically ventilated, and receiving nasogastric&#xD;
             feeding for at least 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain written informed consent to participate in the study from the&#xD;
             patient or legally authorized representative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use during the current ICU admission of parenteral nutrition or trophic feeding,&#xD;
             defined as a prescription to receive ≤ 20 mL/hr of enteral feeding for more than 24&#xD;
             hours prior to screening [N.B., parenteral nutrition may be initiated post&#xD;
             randomization provided that the supplemental nutrition is coordinated with the&#xD;
             calories and protein targets of the Prescribed Total Volume (PTV) and reduced as&#xD;
             enteral feeding is advanced]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight prior to ICU admission exceeding 150.0 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion or confirmation of active bowel obstruction, perforation, or leakage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of esophageal or gastric surgery prior to or during the current hospital&#xD;
             admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following prokinetic medications during the current ICU admission:&#xD;
             domperidone, cisapride, neostigmine, or opioid antagonists, including alvimopan,&#xD;
             naloxone, naltrexone, or analogs of naloxone or naltrexone; erythromycin or&#xD;
             azithromycin [N.B., azithromycin is permitted for treatment of pulmonary infections up&#xD;
             to 48 hours before randomization, but not thereafter through Day 5. Up to 2 doses of&#xD;
             metoclopramide are permitted, provided that drug is not administered within 10 hours&#xD;
             of the first dose of study drug or at any time through Day 5. If a patient receives&#xD;
             metoclopramide during the screening period, a radiologic examination must confirm that&#xD;
             the feeding tube remains visible in the stomach after the final dose of drug during&#xD;
             screening and to prior to the start of baseline gastric emptying measurements and has&#xD;
             not migrated to the duodenum. Use of clarithromycin for any indication is not&#xD;
             excluded. Propofol must be discontinued before screening. However, its use may be&#xD;
             permitted under special circumstances subsequent to the first dose of study drug but&#xD;
             not in excess of 12 hours administration over the 5-day study period.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's clinical condition is deteriorating rapidly, or the Investigator does not&#xD;
             consider there to be a reasonable expectation that the patient will complete the study&#xD;
             Childs C cirrhosis or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥1000 U/L&#xD;
