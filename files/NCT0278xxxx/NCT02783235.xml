  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at creating video-based tutorials for developing skills in performing&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening using VIA for the Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited&#xD;
      Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Primary Health Workers (PHWs). Cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      is mainly done by the following three methods: Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA),&#xD;
      Cervical Smear Cytology (PAP) and HPV DNA test. VIA is a low cost, low resource cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening method and especially useful for low middle income countries (LMICs) like&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to develop video-based tutorials, such that the ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs could be trained&#xD;
      in performing and interpreting VIA with the use of this tutorial. The ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs have&#xD;
      important roles in delivering health in rural/ semi urban areas and they will be trained&#xD;
      using this tutorial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video-based tutorials will be made according to the 'Spoken Tutorials' methodology,&#xD;
      developed at IIT Bombay. Video-based Tutorials has given skills based training to over 2 lakh&#xD;
      students in the past four years on IT based topics. The tutorials are made available online&#xD;
      free of cost. They are designed to be used without the need of an expert being physically&#xD;
      present.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop video-based tutorials to train ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs in conducting cervical cancer&#xD;
           related health education, screening for cervical cancers using VIA, collection of PAP&#xD;
           smears and HPV samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce the training time required by an expert to train ANMs/ASHA/PHWs as compared to&#xD;
           the traditional training methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the efficacy of the training tool by conducting a pre-test and post-test and&#xD;
           practical test for lesion identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the satisfaction levels of ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs for learning through video-based&#xD;
           tutorials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Creating the Tutorials&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The video-based tutorials will be created with the help of domain experts, Content&#xD;
      generators and Animators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Conducting the Training&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TMH will recruit Medical Social Workers and Health Workers to provide training to 50&#xD;
           ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs at their own centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The training will be staggered into different modules, and will be completed for each&#xD;
           trainee over a period of approximately 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also obtain images after due permissions, of the clinic, preparations&#xD;
      for examination like arrangements of trolleys, preparation of dilute acetic acid, etc. and&#xD;
      the cervical pictures/ videos of the patients before and after VIA after obtaining due&#xD;
      consents (there will be no revealing of identity) to aid the animation and the tutorials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the tutorials will be checked by a pre- and post- tutorial assessment&#xD;
      quiz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and power estimates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, sampling method is a convenience sample of 50 ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs attached to the&#xD;
      TMC, District, Municipal Hospitals and PHCs who have not learned VIA based cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three MSWs will be appointed to co-ordinate with the respective officials of BMC, State&#xD;
      Government, District hospitals etc. and explain the importance of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Workers will approach different BMC hospitals in Mumbai and PHCs and district&#xD;
      hospitals around Mumbai to relieve their ANMs/ASHAs/PHWs to participate in this training.&#xD;
      Newly recruited PHWs in the Preventive Oncology projects will also be enrolled for this&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre training knowledge about various aspects of cervical cancer viz., causes, various&#xD;
           cervical cancer screening techniques, steps required to perform VIA etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The satisfaction level and feed back of the trainees with the course provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in the Post training knowledge about various aspects of cervical cancer&#xD;
           viz., causes, various cervical cancer screening techniques, steps required to perform&#xD;
           VIA etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These will be measured with the help of test scores. Each question in the test will have&#xD;
           marks assigned to it based on difficulty level. (Easy 1 mark, Intermediate 2 marks, Hard&#xD;
           3 marks, Very hard 4 marks). The ANMs will be assigned marks depending on the number of&#xD;
           correct responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ANMs will have to take the tests before the training, immediately after the&#xD;
           training, and three months after the training is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The satisfaction level with the mode of teaching will be done on a survey based on a&#xD;
           likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ability to correctly identify a VIA positive lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be measured based on marks they score during the tests and assignments, where they&#xD;
      will do an image based diagnosis of 15 VIA cases. This will also be scored based on&#xD;
      observation sessions they will have with a doctor who performs VIA on 10 patients. They will&#xD;
      be assessed based on the number of correct identifications of VIA lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry will be done in IIT Bombay and in the Department of Preventive Oncology, Tata&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital, using SPSS version 18. Checks for consistency, data safety and analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out at regular intervals. Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be&#xD;
      generated for describing variables under the study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreement of test scores, pre-training and post-training will be estimated using kappa&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
