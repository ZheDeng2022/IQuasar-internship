  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy is given to breast cancer patients whose cancers are relatively large or&#xD;
      have spread to lymph nodes or both. The primary goal of this treatment is to prevent the&#xD;
      cancer from coming back (recurring) elsewhere in the body, but if it makes the cancer in the&#xD;
      breast and lymph nodes shrink it might be easier to remove. This could allow a patient to&#xD;
      have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy and reduce the number of lymph nodes that the&#xD;
      surgeon has to remove. In some cases, the neoadjuvant therapy works so well that it kills all&#xD;
      of the cancer in the breast and lymph nodes. This is referred to as a pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR). Patients who achieve a pCR have a much lower risk of the cancer recurring&#xD;
      elsewhere in their bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aren't sure which chemotherapy drugs work best with the HER2-targeted drugs,&#xD;
      and what combination of these drugs causes the fewest side effects.Thus, this study has two&#xD;
      main goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To find out if treatment with wPCbTP, weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin given with&#xD;
           trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 3 weeks, leads to as many pCRs as TCHP in patients with&#xD;
           HER2-positive breast cancer, but has fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To find out if HER2-positive patients whose cancers are not responding well after 12&#xD;
           weeks of wPCbTP get a better response when they are switched to a doxorubicin-containing&#xD;
           regimen called AC for 4 cycles (8-12 weeks).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1 Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast, with sufficient tissue available&#xD;
        from needle or incisional biopsy (excisional biopsy not permitted) for ER, PR and HER2&#xD;
        testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resectable - clinical stage I (only with T=2.0 cm), IIA-IIIA - T2 N0-T3N0 or T1-3 N1-N2a&#xD;
        - or unresectable - clinical stage IIIB-C - T4 or N2b-3 - disease. No evidence of M1&#xD;
        disease. Pretreatment clinical stage will be recorded by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Breast tumor measuring at least 1 cm in greatest dimension by ultrasound or MRI;&#xD;
        patients without measurable disease in the breast (TX) by imaging studies are eligible if&#xD;
        they have measurable disease (a node measuring at least 1 cm along its short axis, and&#xD;
        histologically confirmed to contain metastatic disease) in the axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HER2+, defined by either IHC 3+ or amplification of the HER2 gene by FISH analysis&#xD;
        (ratio &gt;2.0 or &gt;6 HER2 targets per cell; patients with equivocal HER2 testing, 2+ by IHC&#xD;
        with a FISH ratio of &lt;2.0 and 4-6 HER2 signals per nucleus, are not eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with multiple foci of invasive cancer in the same breast are eligible if any&#xD;
        single lesion meets the above size criteria and all sampled lesions &gt; 1 cm in maximum&#xD;
        dimension are histologically similar and HER2+. Patients are also eligible , or if there is&#xD;
        a focus of HER2- invasive cancer that is &lt;1 cm in maximum dimension and in a different&#xD;
        quadrant of the breast from the HER2+ cancer, such that its presence will not interfere&#xD;
        with clinical or pathologic assessment of response of the HER2+ cancer. The presence of&#xD;
        DCIS or LCIS in either breast will not render a patient ineligible. Patients with a small&#xD;
        focus of invasive cancer detected in the contralateral breast (clinical T1a/bN0) are&#xD;
        eligible, whether the contralateral tumor is HER2+ or HER2-, while patients with a more&#xD;
        advanced invasive cancer in the contralateral breast are not eligible; in patients with a&#xD;
        small focus of invasive cancer in the contralateral breast or a small focus of HER2- cancer&#xD;
        in the same breast only the histologic response in the HER2+ target lesion will be&#xD;
        considered in determining the patient's pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6 It is recommended that patients have a pretreatment echocardiogram or MUGA scan with an&#xD;
        LVEF above the institutional lower limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Female, age &gt;18, Zubrod PS 0-1. 8. It is recommended that patients have adequate bone&#xD;
        marrow, renal and hepatic function. Examples of this include: ANC &gt; 1000/ul, platelet count&#xD;
        &gt;100,000/ul, HGB&gt; 9.0 g/dl, serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dl or measured creatinine clearance of&#xD;
        &gt;30 ml/min and AST &lt;5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy for this cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, absolute exclusion&#xD;
             for BP &gt;180 (systolic) or &gt;100 (diastolic); for BP 160-180/90-100, assurance from the&#xD;
             treating MD that this is being addressed and that the MD is comfortable initiating&#xD;
             study treatment despite the elevated value(s)uncontrolled clinically significant&#xD;
             arrhythmia or grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease are not eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with BP &gt;180 (systolic) or &gt;100 (diastolic) are excluded; patients with BP&#xD;
             160-180/90-100 are eligible with assurance from the treating MD that this is being&#xD;
             addressed and that the MD is comfortable initiating study treatment despite the&#xD;
             elevated value(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with myocardial infarction, stroke or arterial thrombotic event within the&#xD;
             past 12 months are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant and lactating women are not eligible. All patients of reproductive potential&#xD;
             should have a negative pregnancy test at baseline and be advised to use an effective&#xD;
             barrier method of contraception if sexually active during treatment on the study and&#xD;
             for 2 months post the last treatment. Sites will be asked to confirm the patient's&#xD;
             menopausal status at study entry and that premenopausal women had a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test performed within 7 days of starting treatment, but will not be required to submit&#xD;
             test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active (defined as symptomatic, currently requiring treatment or likely to require&#xD;
             treatment within the 6 months following study enrollment, or likely to affect the&#xD;
             efficacy or tolerability of the study treatment) non-breast malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Baseline grade &gt;2 peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
