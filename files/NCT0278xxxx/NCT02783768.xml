  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determination of the acute pulmonary toxicities of e-cigarettes in young adults is of major&#xD;
      public health importance, as e-cigarette vapor contains established toxicants that as&#xD;
      hypothesized cause acute damage to the airways and the pulmonary microvasculature that may&#xD;
      promote the development of CLD, for which there remain few effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study therefore propose a pilot study using a randomized crossover design in ten healthy&#xD;
      young adults to test the acute effects of a standardized e-cigarette exposure on two&#xD;
      sensitive, safe, non-invasive imaging measures: (1) ventilation defects on hyperpolarized&#xD;
      helium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and (2) pulmonary microvascular blood flow on&#xD;
      gadolinium-enhanced pulmonary magnetic resonance angiography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) measures are promising approaches to&#xD;
      detecting and characterizing the anticipated acute pulmonary toxicities of e-cigarettes.&#xD;
      Hyperpolarized helium (3He)-enhanced MRI may be more sensitive than spirometry, a global lung&#xD;
      function measure, for determination of airway toxicities. 3He-enhanced MRI has been used to&#xD;
      demonstrate the extent of ventilation defects in healthy persons with normal spirometry; to&#xD;
      measure ventilation changes in asthmatics pre- and post-challenge with bronchodilators and&#xD;
      methacholine; and to predict pulmonary hospitalizations in persons with COPD. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      until recently, non-invasive measures of pulmonary vascular toxicities were lacking. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed an innovative measure of pulmonary microvascular blood flow on&#xD;
      gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRA, which the investigators found to be markedly abnormal in early&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, and to be associated with&#xD;
      increased endothelial microparticles, a marker of endothelial dysfunction. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      neither of these sensitive, non-invasive, repeatable, and reproducible measures has ever been&#xD;
      used to assess e-cigarette toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that e-cigarette vapor inhalation will result in an acute increase in&#xD;
      global and regional ventilation defects and an acute decrease in global and regional&#xD;
      pulmonary microvascular perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot work will provide the experience and data to support subsequent funding&#xD;
      applications powered to definitively establish the acute toxicities of e-cigarette vapor of&#xD;
      various compositions (e.g., with and without nicotine, with and without flavoring) in persons&#xD;
      with and without chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma) on pulmonary ventilation and&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion. Furthermore, confirmation of the hypotheses in this sample would&#xD;
      provide important preliminary evidence of e-cigarette pulmonary toxicities to inform interim&#xD;
      regulatory decisions, as well as potentially generating vivid images of e-cigarette harms&#xD;
      that may be meaningful to the general public and therefore suitable for use in public&#xD;
      education campaigns.&#xD;

    <measure>Pulmonary Microvascular Blood Flow (PMBF), Measured on Gadolinium-enhanced MRI, Between E-cigarette Exposed and Unexposed Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>PMBF will be measured on gadolinium-enhanced MRI after e-cigarette and sham exposures. There were four days between the measurements of PMBF (e-cigarette) and PMBF (sham). PMBF is measured in mL(blood)/min/mL(lung volume). Lower PMBF has been observed in adults with COPD and emphysema.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilation Defect Percentage (VDP), Measured on Hyperpolarized 3-helium Enhanced MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>VDP will be measured on hyperpolarized 3Helium-enhanced MRI after e-cigarette and sham exposures. Due to limitations of prior qualitative/visual assessments of MRI, we developed and validated a new deep learning approach to the precise measurement of ventilation defects and report the percent non-fully ventilated lung using this method.</description>

    <measure>Regional PMBF, Measured on Gadolinium-enhanced MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Regional PMBF (ie, in the right versus left, upper versus lower lobes) will be measured on gadolinium-enhanced MRI after e-cigarette and sham exposures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional VDP, Measured on Hyperpolarized 3-helium Enhanced MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Regional VDP in the lower lung was measured on hyperpolarized 3Helium-enhanced MRI after e-cigarette and sham exposures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Function, Measured on Spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function will be measured on spirometry. Two participants had only one valid FEV1 measure, and one participant had no valid FEV1 measures. Hence, 3 participants (2 in &quot;E-cigarette first&quot; and 1 in &quot;Sham first&quot;) were not analyzed. The analysis combines the groups in order to separate the effects of randomization group (order) and exposure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO)</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>DLCO will be measured. There was a malfunction of the machine used to measure the DLCO. Hence, only one participant had paired DLCO values and 3 had unpaired measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Output, Measured on Cardiac MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>After exposure (approximately 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output will be measured on cardiac MRI. In the &quot;E-cigarette first&quot; arm, 2 participants did not have 2 valid measures of CO (one pair was missing, one was invalid). In the &quot;Sham first&quot; arm, 3 participants had one invalid measure of CO. The analysis combines the groups in order to separate the effects of randomization group (order) and exposure.</description>

        <description>PMBF will be measured on gadolinium-enhanced MRI after e-cigarette and sham exposures. There were four days between the measurements of PMBF (e-cigarette) and PMBF (sham).

        <title>Cardiac Output, Measured on Cardiac MRI</title>
        <description>Cardiac output will be measured on cardiac MRI. In the &quot;E-cigarette first&quot; arm, 2 participants did not have 2 valid measures of CO (one pair was missing, one was invalid). In the &quot;Sham first&quot; arm, 3 participants had one invalid measure of CO. The analysis combines the groups in order to separate the effects of randomization group (order) and exposure.</description>
