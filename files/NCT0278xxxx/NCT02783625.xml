  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a study drug called duvelisib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I portion of the study is designed to determine the MTD of duvelisib with&#xD;
      romidepsin and duvelisib with bortezomib. All patients must have a relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma. The design is a standard 3+3 dose escalation of two parallel phase I&#xD;
      studies. Patients will be enrolled in Arms A (Romidepsin + duvelisib) and B (Bortezomib +&#xD;
      duvelisib) of the study starting at dose level 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to six patients will be initially treated in each dose level until the MTD is&#xD;
      determined. If dose level 3 is achieved without exceeding one dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      after 1 cycle that dose level will be deemed the &quot;optimal dose&quot; and the study will proceed to&#xD;
      the cohort expansion phase. Should patients be found to develop significant toxicity or not&#xD;
      tolerate therapy at the MTD with repeated cycles of therapy, the &quot;optimal dose&quot; may be&#xD;
      determined to be at dose levels less than the MTD. Patients with measurable disease treated&#xD;
      in the phase I at the optimal dose will be counted towards the accrual of the expansion&#xD;
      cohorts by disease subtype and all efficacy and toxicity endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Expansion Phase: The expansion cohorts will further assess toxicity and safety and&#xD;
      allow a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the combination to provide background for a&#xD;
      potential future subtype specific phase II study. The assessment of efficacy will be&#xD;
      descriptive.&#xD;

                  prolonging medication or on a stable dose without significant QT prolongation&#xD;
                  (&gt;470 msec). Caution should be used when administering study drugs to patients&#xD;
                  taking medications significantly metabolized by these enzymes refer to&#xD;
                  (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/) for clinically&#xD;
                  relevant medications. Particular attention should be paid to patients receiving&#xD;
                  warfarin. Patient should have coagulation parameters monitored regularly, and&#xD;
                  warfarin dose adjusted accordingly. If these drugs cannot be discontinued or&#xD;
                  replaced enrollment may be allowed after discussion with MSK PI.&#xD;
