  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study compared the effectiveness of 3 approved DAA (direct-acting antiviral)&#xD;
      HCV treatment regimens to learn whether they worked equally well under real-world conditions.&#xD;
      Phase 2 of this study began early 2017 with removal of 1 DAA regimen, limiting randomization&#xD;
      to just 2 FDA approved DAA regimens. Patients receiving HCV therapy in community and academic&#xD;
      clinics were offered the opportunity to consent to be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      (phase 1) or one of two (phase 2) regimens and observed for outcomes. Once randomized, all&#xD;
      medical care, laboratory testing, and any disease or side effect management were assumed by&#xD;
      usual care conditions, and patient-reported outcomes were collected outside clinic in keeping&#xD;
      with pragmatic design principles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1 of this study, consented patients were randomized to 1 of the following 3 HCV DAA&#xD;
      treatments: 1) Harvoni® (SOF/LDV) 2) Viekira Pak™ (PrOD) 3) Zepatier™ (EBR/GZR) with the&#xD;
      optional addition of Ribavirin (RBV) and the length of treatment determined by the individual&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2 of this study, consented patients were randomized to 1 of 2 FDA approved HCV&#xD;
      treatments: Harvoni® or Zepatier™. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 subjects had up to 1 tablespoon&#xD;
      of blood drawn for HCV resistance testing and future biorepository testing (following&#xD;
      appropriate additional consent). The results of testing determined whether a genotype 1a&#xD;
      subject randomized to Zepatier would be provided 12 or 16 wks of Zepatier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment/randomization, participants completed patient reported outcome&#xD;
      questionnaires (PROs) via electronic device or telephone. Following baseline/randomization,&#xD;
      participants were asked to complete surveys again at Wk 4 of treatment, End of Treatment, 1&#xD;
      and 3 year post treatment. Patients continued standard medical care throughout study. Data&#xD;
      was abstracted from test results and medical records throughout treatment and for up to 3&#xD;
      years post treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Voils Medication Adherence Survey (VMAS) was used to evaluate medication adherence during HCV treatment. Participants responded to three questions about the extent of adherence during the past seven days of treatment (during early and late on-treatment occasions). Participants responded using a five-point ordinal scale of missed dosing from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). On each occasion participants were coded as being &quot;Non-adherent&quot; if any response was &gt; 1, otherwise they were coded as &quot;Adherent&quot;. Probability estimates of percentage of patients reporting non-adherence were calculated per HCV treatment (Direct Acting Antiviral-DAA) regimen: 1)EBR/GZV (elbasvir/grazoprevir, 2)SOF/LDV (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir), 3)PrOD</description>

    <time_frame>1 year post treatment discontinuation (Early post-tx)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in HCV-associated symptoms was calculated as the mean differences of mean scores from multiple surveys from the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-- Fatigue, nausea, belly pain, sleep disturbance, and diarrhea) and functional status (well-being) when comparing baseline to early post-treatment and late post treatment surveys. Mean change scores were calculated by comparing baseline to early post-treatment (1 yr) and late post-treatment (approximately 3 years) surveys. Negative numbers suggest better symptoms (improvement in HCV-associated symptoms). HCV-PRO positive estimates suggest baseline functional well-being improvement.</description>

Change in FIB-4 where negative values indicate improvement in liver fibrosis score and positive values indicate worsening of fibrosis score. There is no upper or lower limit for change. FIB-4 = age (years) * AST(IU/L)/Platelets (10^3/L) * ALT^.5(IU/L). In general, Score of 0-1.29 is low risk for advanced fibrosis, 1.30-1.67: intermediate risk for advanced liver fibrosis, &gt;2.67: high risk for advanced fibrosis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were consented at 34 US centers Between June 2016 and March 2018. Patients' insurance was screened for inclusion of SOF/LDV on formulary (the HCV regimen not provided by the study). However, following randomization, participants who were unable to obtain SOF/LDV through insurance received 1 of 2 Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) HCV Treatment regimens 1)EBR/GZR or 2)PrOD during Phase 1 and received EBR/GZR during Phase 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study initially (Phase 1) randomized subjects to receive 1 of 3 HCV DAA regimens (EBR/GZR +/- RBV, LDV/SOF +/- RBV, or PrOD +/-RBV). In phase 2 of this study, randomization to PrOD regimen was discontinued and newly enrolled subjects were randomized to either EBR/GZR +/- RBV or LDV/SOF +/- RBV. Efficacy data was analyzed via original 'randomization' and as subjects were 'actually treated (regimen actually received)' while safety analysis was evaluated by actual treatment received.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Change in Headache-PRO Scores -Phase 1</title>
        <description>Headache was evaluated by the HIT-6 score, a validated, Patient Reported Outcomes survey (PROs) 'PROMIS Headache Impact Test (HIT)' with scores ranging from 36 to 78 with higher score reflecting greater impact. Mean change in headache side effect was evaluated using difference between baseline value of HIT-6 score to the highest (worst) score during treatment. Estimates of mean change and differences obtained from a constrained longitudinal linear mixed-effects model that treated baseline score as one of outcomes. Negative values for mean change represent improvement in symptom.</description>

Median change in headache side effect was evaluated using difference between baseline value of HIT-6 score to the highest (worst) score during treatment. Estimates of mean change and differences obtained from a constrained longitudinal linear mixed-effects model that treated baseline score as one of outcomes. Negative values for change represent improvement, while negative values for 'difference' indicate LDV/SOF performed better than PrOD</description>

          <title>Median Change in Fatigue-Phase 2</title>
          <description>Fatigue severity collected from validated, Patient Reported Outcomes survey (PROs), 'PROMIS Fatigue Short Form'. PROMIS® T-scores were computated to compare difference between baseline value of PROMIS score to the highest (worst) score during treatment. Results presented as computated t-score from baseline to average of on Treatment Scores. A positive (+) score suggests improvements in functional well-being. A negative (-) PRO change score is suggestive of symptom improvement or lack of drug side effect. PROMIS Fatigue Score scale per question: 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, 5=Always with 7 questions for a total maximum score of 35.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in HCV-PRO (Functional Well-being) EBR/GZR vs. SOF/LDV Score-Phase 2</title>
          <description>HCV-PRO, a survey designed to assess functional status of patients with HCV and measures physical, emotional, and social functioning, productivity, intimacy, and perception of quality of life, was used to assess functional well-being. In general, lower score is worst outcome and higher scores indicate greater well-being and functioning. However, for ease of interpretation, HCV-PRO scale has been transformed by using '100 - HCV-PRO' ultimately revising the score to mean 0 (lowest score) is best to 100 (worst outcome). A positive change (End of treatment to baseline) suggests improvements in functional well-being.&#xD;
Total score = (SUM-N)/(4*N)*100, where N is the number of questions answered. End of Treatment -Baseline were used to calculate CHANGE in outcome. Number of subjects reflects participants from both Phase 1 and 2.</description>

        <description>Mean change (delta) in FIB-4, an indirect non-invasive measure of liver fibrosis, calculated as baseline median -long term follow up median, following SVR after any of the study treatment regimens. Change in FIB-4 where negative values indicate improvement in liver fibrosis score and positive values indicate worsening of fibrosis score. There is no upper or lower limit for change. FIB-4 = age (years) * AST(IU/L)/Platelets (10^3/L) * ALT^.5(IU/L). In general, Score of 0-1.29 is low risk for advanced fibrosis, 1.30-1.67: intermediate risk for advanced liver fibrosis, &gt;2.67: high risk for advanced fibrosis.</description>

        <population>Population analyzed limited to cirrhotic patients who had two separate FIB-4 values collected as part of standard care and achieved SVR (defined as undetectable HCV 24 weeks post treatment). Given pragmatic trial design, availability of fibrosis markers is limited thereby restricting analysis (substantially limited sample size) to difference in fibrosis markers following SVR with any HCV treatment used in study.</population>

        <title>Change in Functional Status (HCV-PRO) Within Treatment</title>
        <description>HCV-PRO score, a validated PROMIS survey used to evaluate overall functioning and well-being in HCV patients, was utilized to compare long-term 'within treatment' changes of functional well-being. In general, lower score is worst outcome and higher scores indicate greater well-being and functioning. However, for ease of interpretation, HCV-PRO scale has been transformed by using '100 - HCV-PRO' ultimately revising the score to mean 0 (lowest score) is best to 100 (worst outcome). A positive estimate (Post treatment to baseline) suggests baseline functional well-being improvement.&#xD;
Total score = (SUM-N)/(4*N)*100, where N is the number of questions answered.</description>

        <population>Analysis limited to patients who completed HCV-PRO assessments during post-treatment. For this safety analysis, regimen is based on treatment received versus treatment to which patient was randomized. Arms with and without RBV are combined in consideration that usage of RBV was decided by HCV provider and not part of study randomization.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This pragmatic trial allowed patients who were randomized to SOF/LDV but unable to obtain SOF/LDV (due to limitations in access from insurance, etc.) to be treated with the accessible, alternative DAA regimens. This contributed to the variance from 'as randomized' population to the 'as treated' population. Rapidly changing HCV landscape led to discontinuation of PrOD treatment regimen and modification of initial analysis plan including reduction of original sample size.</limitations_and_caveats>
