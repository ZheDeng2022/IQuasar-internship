    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study is to provide further data on the utilization,&#xD;
      effectiveness, safety and clinical benefit including duration of response of Vismodegib for&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC), inappropriate for surgery or&#xD;
      radiotherapy under real world clinical conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center non-interventional study with 53 patients with locally advanced BCC&#xD;
      who start Vismodegib (received at least one dose) in Q4 2015. Duration of recruitment will be&#xD;
      one year. Patients will be followed prospectively until disease progression, death, or for 3&#xD;
      years from first dose Vismodegib (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness objective for this study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the duration of response defined as duration from first documented response of&#xD;
      complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until disease progression (as determined by&#xD;
      the treating physician, which might include and will be categorized in the following groups:&#xD;
      clinical assessment, histological assessment, imaging assessment) for laBCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary effectiveness objectives for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate (rate of patients with CR or PR) (as determined by the treating&#xD;
           physician, which might include and will be categorized in the following groups: clinical&#xD;
           assessment, histological assessment, imaging assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease control rate (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease&#xD;
           (SD))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence rate: rate of patients who responded (CR or PR) and later progressed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to progression: time from first treatment to progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to death: time from first treatment to death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to response: time from first treatment to response&#xD;
&#xD;
      The explorative objectives of this study are to evaluate the following endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of tumor response evaluation (as determined by the treating physician, which might&#xD;
           include and will be categorized in the following groups: clinical assessment ,&#xD;
           histological assessment, imaging assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment decision for therapy with Vismodegib (tumor board OR decision by&#xD;
           otorhinolaryngologist, surgeon, plastic surgeon, dermato-oncologist, radiotherapist,&#xD;
           ophthalmologist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous treatment for the BCC lesion, which led to therapy with Vismodegib&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BCC therapy after Vismodegib therapy (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment duration of Vismodegib (start and stop dates for therapy with Vismodegib)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of duration and time point of treatment interruptions of Vismodegib&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reason for treatment discontinuation&#xD;
