  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a most common genetic metabolic disease characterized by low platelet&#xD;
      number, liver and spleen enlargement and various forms of bone diseases including low bone&#xD;
      mineral density leading to brittle bones. Various treatment options are now available for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the prevalence of Gaucher disease in&#xD;
      patients with low bone mineral density as observed by DEXA scan, which is a form of X-Ray of&#xD;
      the bone.&#xD;

      Gaucher disease is a potential secondary cause of low bone mineral density and it is&#xD;
      prevalent among patients with low BMD. This cross sectional design study will measure point&#xD;
      prevalence of Gaucher disease in patients with low bone mineral density (BMD).&#xD;

        The study will be conducted in a cross-sectional design measuring point prevalence of&#xD;
        Gaucher disease in patients with low bone mineral density. Low BMD is defined as T-Score&#xD;
        &lt;-1.0. In addition, prevalence stratified by age, gender, and menopausal status will be&#xD;
        determined.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt; or equal to18 years and able to provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a bone density test demonstrating T-score &lt;-1.0 on a DEXA scan&#xD;
             within the past year or those who are prospectively referred for DEXA scan and who are&#xD;
             later identified by their physician to have a DEXA T-score &lt; -1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject unable to read and sign consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Terminally ill subjects or subjects with serious co-morbidities (malignancy), which&#xD;
             would limit the ability of the patient to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with the following disorders or exposures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underlying skeletal dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An endocrinologic/metabolic disease known to cause bone demineralization: including&#xD;
             parathyroid dysfunction, hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, hypogonadism,&#xD;
             panhypopituitarism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to medications that are known to cause low BMD including chemotherapy within&#xD;
             past 2 years, chronic corticosteroid or phenytoin use within past 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation exposure within the past 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vitamin D deficiency is not an exclusion criteria as this is highly prevalent in the&#xD;
             adult population under investigation as well as in patients with Gaucher disease. (9,&#xD;
             10)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously diagnosed with Gaucher Disease&#xD;
