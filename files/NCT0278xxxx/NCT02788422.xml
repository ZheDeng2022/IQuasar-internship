  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thorough, understandable discharge instructions empower caregivers, allowing them to provide&#xD;
      optimum care of their children during illness. Unfortunately discharge instructions are often&#xD;
      incomplete and difficult to understand. The use of video discharge instructions has been&#xD;
      shown to increase patient understanding of their illness. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      know if using video discharge instructions for caregivers of children with middle ear&#xD;
      infections helps to better understand how to take care of children at home, potentially&#xD;
      allowing the child to feel better faster. The investigators will be comparing video discharge&#xD;
      instructions to a paper handout to see if the former leads to improved well-being of the&#xD;
      child and improved caregiver knowledge, satisfaction and anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Providing patients with understandable, comprehensive discharge instructions improves&#xD;
      compliance, thereby reducing symptoms and the functional impact of illness. Comprehensive&#xD;
      discharge instructions also reduce patient anxiety and increases satisfaction. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      in a busy emergency department (ED), discharge instructions are often incomplete.&#xD;
      Furthermore, even when discharge instructions have been provided, patients often have&#xD;
      difficulty comprehending and/or recalling them. Inadequate discharge instructions are linked&#xD;
      to medication errors, suboptimal care post-discharge, and unnecessary return visits to the&#xD;
      ED. Patient dissatisfaction with discharge instructions and anxiety have also been linked to&#xD;
      poor medication compliance, and an increase in return visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that knowledge of pediatric medical conditions can be enhanced&#xD;
      through the use of video technology. Specifically, it has been shown that when video&#xD;
      discharge instructions are used in place of, or to complement written discharge instructions,&#xD;
      patients have a better understanding of their illness and report higher rates of&#xD;
      satisfaction. However, no studies to date have explored if clinically relevant outcomes such&#xD;
      as symptomatology, function and recidivism can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the utility of video discharge instructions for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute otitis media (AOM), a leading cause of health care visits among children. AOM affects&#xD;
      up to 75% of children before school-age and is the most common illness for which antibiotics&#xD;
      are prescribed to children in the United States. In Canada, AOM is associated with&#xD;
      substantial use of health services (3.1 hours in an emergency department and 1.8 hours in an&#xD;
      outpatient clinic on average per visit) and significantly burdens caregivers in the form of&#xD;
      time spent on medical consultations, and time taken off from work. An American study&#xD;
      estimated that the cost of one episode of AOM in a 3-month period following diagnosis was&#xD;
      $1330.58, with the majority of that cost stemming from the indirect costs of illness, 90% of&#xD;
      which was accrued primarily by parental time off work. In Quebec, the total annual cost to&#xD;
      the health care system for otitis media and placement of tympanostomy tubes is more than $10&#xD;
      million dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is often substantial in the early course of AOM. Poorly controlled pain is associated&#xD;
      with suffering and can be emotionally traumatic, causing anxiety for patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers. Efficacious treatment for child pain is paramount in preventing protracted&#xD;
      sensitivity to pain. Despite the magnitude of effects that acute pain can have on a child, it&#xD;
      is often inadequately assessed and treated. In children less than two years of age, 30% of&#xD;
      children continue to experience pain, fever, or both for up to 7 into the illness, thus&#xD;
      highlighting the importance of caregiver education on symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent AOM is common, 5-15% of children under the age of 2 experience four or more&#xD;
      episodes per year. Caregivers of children with recurrent AOM not only judge their child's&#xD;
      quality of life markedly lower than caregivers of children of a general population, but also&#xD;
      lower than those of children with mild-to-moderately severe chronic conditions. Although&#xD;
      uncommon, AOM also has the potential to cause serious complications such as, mastoiditis and&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis, if not treated and monitored appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that video discharge instructions directed at caregivers of&#xD;
      children with AOM will be associated with improved symptomatology and functional outcomes,&#xD;
      along with improved caregiver knowledge, satisfaction, and anxiety compared to the standard&#xD;
      of care, paper-based discharge instructions.&#xD;
