    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pevonedistat&#xD;
      administered as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine in adult east Asian&#xD;
      participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to&#xD;
      treat people with myelodysplastic syndromes MDS (including nonproliferative chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]) and AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) as a single-agent and in&#xD;
      combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look at the safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2/phase 3 dose of pevonedistat administered in combination with&#xD;
      azacitidine, pharmacokinetics and response to treatment in participants who take single agent&#xD;
      pevonedistat compared to participants who take pevonedistat and azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 37 participants. Participants will be assigned into one&#xD;
      of the four treatment groups which will remain disclosed to the patient and study doctor&#xD;
      during the study. Participants will be first enrolled at single-agent low dose level (25&#xD;
      mg/m^2). If this dose is tolerable, participants will be enrolled in parallel at single-agent&#xD;
      higher dose level (44 mg/m^2) and in combination treatment cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pevonedistat 44 mg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pevonedistat 10 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination Participants will receive&#xD;
           pevonedistat infusion intravenously and azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous&#xD;
           route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 24 months. Participants will attend the End of&#xD;
      Study (EOS) visit for safety, 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before&#xD;
      the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy (other than hydroxyurea).&#xD;
