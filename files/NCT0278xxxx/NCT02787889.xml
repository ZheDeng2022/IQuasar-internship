      The investigators determined effects of 8-week dietary protein intake in mixed meals with&#xD;
      uneven or even consumption pattern on the metabolic outcomes of whole-body net protein&#xD;
      synthesis and muscle protein synthesis in older participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demonstrated benefits of increased protein intake on sarcopenia and many physiological&#xD;
      functions is becoming increasingly evident. For this reason, there is growing importance to&#xD;
      ensuring that Americans consume the recommended amount of protein, calculated to be 17-21% of&#xD;
      caloric intake. As it relates to the prevention of sarcopenia, adequate protein consumption&#xD;
      inherently assumes that sufficient protein is ingested to stimulate protein anabolism.&#xD;
      Specifically, adequate essential amino acid precursors, and anabolic triggers such as&#xD;
      leucine, must be present for protein anabolism to occur. Population data from the NHANES&#xD;
      study suggests that American protein intake pattern is skewed towards the evening meal. The&#xD;
      NHANES data also suggests that the average protein consumption of both men and women over the&#xD;
      age of 50 yrs is approximately 1.1 g/kg/d. Thus, the prevalent consumption pattern ensures&#xD;
      that many individuals consume adequate protein, or amino acid precursors sufficient to&#xD;
      stimulate protein synthesis, only with the larger, or dinner meal. The investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated that frequent stimulation of protein synthesis with amino acids preserves&#xD;
      strength and function. Others have demonstrated that adequate protein intake stimulates&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis and increases lean mass. Given these data, The investigators studied&#xD;
      the effects of two different protein intake patterns on metabolic and functional outcomes in&#xD;
      older individuals after 8 wks of dietary control. The mean protein intake for this group of&#xD;
      1.1 g/kg/d was consumed in two distinct meal patterns. Participants consumed high quality&#xD;
      protein in the ratio of 15/20/65% of total protein intake for breakfast/lunch/dinner,&#xD;
      respectively (Uneven protein intake pattern), or protein consumption was distributed equally&#xD;
      among each meal (33% of total protein)(Even protein intake pattern). The investigators&#xD;
      determined the longitudinal effects of this consumption pattern on the metabolic outcomes of&#xD;
      whole-body net protein synthesis and muscle protein synthesis in older participants.&#xD;
