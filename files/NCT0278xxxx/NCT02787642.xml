    <description>Olaparib will be administered per os bi-daily, as appropriate assigned dose level, during 7.5 weeks (D1 to D52). Olaparib should be started one week before the start of radiotherapy and will be continued until the last day of radiotherapy. Beyond this period, Olaparib could be continued at the investigator's discretion and after sponsor authorization, until progression. Radiotherapy consists of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 1.8 Grays (Gy) per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday through Friday) over a period of 6.5 weeks, for a total dose of 59.4 Gy. Radiotherapy starts at D8.</description>
