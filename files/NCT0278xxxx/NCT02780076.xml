  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survivors after hip fracture often report severe pain and loss of physical functioning.&#xD;
      The poor outcomes cause negative impact on the person's physical functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life and put a financial burden on society. It is important to continue and progress the&#xD;
      functional training that already started at the hospital, while the patients are transferred&#xD;
      to short-term stays in a nursing home before they are returning to home. The aim presently is&#xD;
      to examine the effects of a functional training program by a RCT design, initiated by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist and performed by the nurses, on physical functioning while the patients are&#xD;
      at short term stays in primary health care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional training, such as walking and transfers, ought to be an important part of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation after hip fracture. We have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to&#xD;
      continue and progress the functional training that started in the acute phase at the&#xD;
      hospital, also during the sub-acute phase while the patients are at short-term stays in&#xD;
      nursing homes. However, there are indications of lack of resources in the nursing homes and&#xD;
      that the nurses may be less concerned with their role and participation in the patients'&#xD;
      rehabilitation process. Possibly, this creates a discontinuity in the rehabilitation efforts&#xD;
      during short-term stays that may have a negative impact on the patients' recovery of physical&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the aim is to continue and progress the functional training started during&#xD;
      hospital stay, such as training in walking and further on repetitive sit-to-stands, as part&#xD;
      of the daily habitual routine during short-term stays in the nursing homes. This type of&#xD;
      functional training may be motivational and easily recognizable to the patients, and it can&#xD;
      also be carried out by the nursing staff with only initial guiding from a physiotherapist.&#xD;
      There is lack of knowledge on the effect of additional functional training, incorporated as&#xD;
      part of the habitual daily routine during short-term stays, on the patients' immediate and&#xD;
      long term recovery of physical functioning and activity level after hip fracture, compared to&#xD;
      usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing the&#xD;
      effects of additional functional training (functional training group)to usual care alone&#xD;
      (control group) during short-term stays in nursing homes.&#xD;
