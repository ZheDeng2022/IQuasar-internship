    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat in treating pediatric&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that have come back or have not responded to treatment. Entinostat&#xD;
      may block some of the enzymes needed for cell division and it may help to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of entinostat&#xD;
      administered as a single-agent, once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of entinostat administered as a single agent, once&#xD;
      weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in children with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of entinostat within the confines of a&#xD;
      phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) as a marker of the biologic activity of entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
