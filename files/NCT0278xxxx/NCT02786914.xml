    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected tree-nut or sesame allergy based on sensitization on skin-prick tests&#xD;
      (SPT), will be assessed for allergy using component analysis and basophil activation test&#xD;
      (BAT) and entered into oral immunotherapy (OIT). Component analysis and BAT will be repeated&#xD;
      after completion of OIT. Patients with tree-nut or sesame allergy treated with the standard&#xD;
      of care of elimination diet will serve as controls&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from the pool of patients referred to the investigators center for&#xD;
      evaluation of food allergy. For each tree-nut (walnut, pecan, cashew, pistachio, hazelnut or&#xD;
      almond) evaluated, 30 patients (ages 4-45 years old), with allergy to at least one tree-nut&#xD;
      will be recruited from the database pool referred to above. Skin prick tests (SPT) using&#xD;
      standardized 10 mg/ml tree-nut extracts, and BAT will be performed for all suspected&#xD;
      allergens. Sera will be taken and sent to ThermoFisher for IgE and IgG4 binding analysis to&#xD;
      purified components. Open OFCs will be performed for each tree-nut, unless clinically&#xD;
      contraindicated. The results of the OFC will form the basis to determine the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the component testing. Similarly, 40 patients with suspected sesame allergy&#xD;
      will be administered SPT and component analysis for sesame, with correlations to OFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also utilize BAT to directly test whether the identified purified&#xD;
      components are sufficient to elicit reactivity. This objective can be met by either utilizing&#xD;
      saved patient sera on naive basophils or directly on a subsequently obtained blood sample&#xD;
      from the patient. For patients enrolling in OIT (secondary objective), sera will also be&#xD;
      taken after completion of the therapeutic regimen, and IgE as well as IgG4 binding to the&#xD;
      same components will be assessed and compared to pre-OIT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Patients will be grouped by OFC their allergy status result for each tree-nut (patients&#xD;
      with a documented IgE-mediated reaction in the previous year or a positive OFC vs. patients&#xD;
      with regular consumption of the index food or a negative OFC). Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (proportions for categorical variables, means or medians and standard deviations or&#xD;
      inter-quartile range for continuous variables) will be reported for all key participant&#xD;
      variables, including baseline and demographic characteristics, SPT, BAT and component testing&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary objective, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests (wheal for&#xD;
      SPT, and CD63 induction for BAT) and IgE/IgG4 binding to the purified components in&#xD;
      predicting OFC results allergy will be compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      analysis. To this end, the investigators will evaluate molecular allergens singly or in&#xD;
      groups for their predictive utilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary objective, OFC positive patients with documented allergy who undergo OIT&#xD;
      for tree-nuts (n=15 for each tree-nut) or sesame (n=15) will be grouped according to OIT&#xD;
      outcome. Paired t-tests comparing IgE and IgG4 binding of specific molecular allergens in&#xD;
      individual patients before and after treatment will be performed. Additionally, the pre-OIT&#xD;
      IgE and IgG4 profiles against particular molecular allergens will be compared between OIT&#xD;
      outcome groups by t-test. 10 control patients treated with the standard of care of&#xD;
      elimination diet will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Using the Pearson Chi-square test for two proportions, with the assumption&#xD;
      that 75% of all OFC+ to tree-nuts will be positive to at least one specific component, in&#xD;
      order to detect a result with a P-value of &lt;0.05, 15 positive and 15 negative sera for each&#xD;
      tree-nut would yield a power of 0.816. Based on the investigators experience with&#xD;
      immunoreactivity as assessed by western blot, in fact the investigators would expect that&#xD;
      much more than 75% of OFC+ patients would show IgE reactivity against at least one component.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators feel that a total of thirty sera for each tree-nut should suffice for&#xD;
      the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of patients: 180 patients to be evaluated for tree-nut allergy and 40 for sesame&#xD;
      allergy.&#xD;
