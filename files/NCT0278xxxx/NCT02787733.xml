  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Numerous studies have shown the positive effect of a healthy diet and regular&#xD;
      moderate exercise. Although, exercise has also been correlated with an increase in reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher incidence of injury. ROS production seems to&#xD;
      induce muscle damage, which reduces muscle performance and induces fatigue. Increasing muscle&#xD;
      recovery could be an effective way to increase exercise performance. Several food ingredients&#xD;
      have been of growing interest due to their specific functioning on the human body. Citrus&#xD;
      flavonoids are abundantly available in citrus fruits. Prior studies show a positive effect of&#xD;
      citrus flavonoids on endothelial function, by promoting vasodilation. In addition it has a&#xD;
      positive effect on the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, a known compound in regulating&#xD;
      endothelial response. This capacity of citrus flavonoids could be useful in stimulating&#xD;
      performance and recovery after exercise. Additionally, the ability of scavenging ROS could&#xD;
      reduce muscle damage caused by exercise induced oxidative damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determine the 4-week effect of daily citrus flavonoid supplementation on exercise&#xD;
      recovery and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel design, in&#xD;
      which 40 subjects engage in three exercise sessions. The sessions will be subdivided into a&#xD;
      pre-test and test 1 and 2. Between test 1 and 2, participants receive daily for 4 weeks&#xD;
      citrus flavonoid supplement or a placebo. Each day, subjects should consume 2 capsules each&#xD;
      morning, containing in total 500 mg of citrus flavonoids or 500 mg placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The subjects will be healthy normal weight trained males, with an age of 18&#xD;
      - 25. Additionally, subjects are non-smokers and free of a medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be randomly placed in either the citrus flavonoid or placebo&#xD;
      group. Participants will be instructed to ingest 2 capsules each morning for 4 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. Each capsule equals to 250 mg of citrus flavonoids or cellulose in case of the placebo&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the average amount of work load&#xD;
      produced during the 10-minute time trail test. In addition, oxygen per minute will be&#xD;
      determined as well as the heart rate. Finally, for each test, the subjective rating of&#xD;
      perceived exertion (RPE) will be determined during the pre-test and test 1 and 2 by using a&#xD;
      Borg scale.&#xD;
