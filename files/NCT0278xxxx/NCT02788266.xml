      Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of multiple gingival&#xD;
      recessions associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) using a modified coronally&#xD;
      advanced flap in combination with a sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) on restored&#xD;
      root surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty-three systemically healthy subjects, who were positive for the presence of&#xD;
      three cervical lesions associated with gingival recessions in three different adjacent teeth,&#xD;
      were enrolled in the study. The NCCL were each restored prior to surgery by using one of&#xD;
      three different materials: composite resin (group 1), resin-modified glass ionomer cement&#xD;
      (group 2) or giomer (group 3). The defects were treated with SCTG. Clinical measurements,&#xD;
      including plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), relative recession height (rRH),&#xD;
      probing depth (PD), cervical lesion height (CLH), relative clinical attachment level (rCAL),&#xD;
      keratinized tissue height (KTH), keratinized tissue thickness (KTT), percentage of root&#xD;
      coverage (RC), and percentage of cervical lesion height coverage (CLHC) were recorded at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession (GR) is defined as exposure of the root surface due to displacement of the&#xD;
      gingival margin apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). Problems related to gingival&#xD;
      recessions are dentin hypersensitivity, bacterial plaque accumulation, difficulty of&#xD;
      maintaining oral health care and aesthetics, root caries and abrasions and fear of losing&#xD;
      teeth6. Coronally advanced flap (CAF) is an effective periodontal plastic surgical procedure&#xD;
      for the treatment of gingival recessions. The CAF with a subepithelial connective tissue&#xD;
      graft (CAF+ SCTG) technique is reported as the gold standard and does enhance the probability&#xD;
      of achieving complete root coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various dental materials and surgical approaches have been used to manage gingival recessions&#xD;
      associated with cervical lesions for the most predictable combined surgical/restorative&#xD;
      treatment.Restorative materials must be biocompatible to minimize their adverse effects on&#xD;
      periodontal tissues induced by direct contact.Resin composites or resin modified glass&#xD;
      ionomer cements have been commonly used to restore cervical lesions.Resin-ionomer materials&#xD;
      have many properties such as biocompatibility with soft and hard tissues and displaying high&#xD;
      marginal adaptation and minimal surface roughness as well as allowing them to be used&#xD;
      successfully in the subgingival region. Composite resin materials have many advantages&#xD;
      including aesthetics and surface characteristics in terms of finishing and polishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that well-adapted and finished composite resins seem have no adverse&#xD;
      effects on the periodontal margin. It has also been reported that the ageing of the composite&#xD;
      resin restorations may produce gingival inflammation in subgingival areas. Fluoride-releasing&#xD;
      resin materials with pre-reacted glass (PRG), called giomer, has been suggested to have good&#xD;
      color matching, biocompatibility, smooth surface finish, fluoride release and fluoride&#xD;
      recharge potential. It was reported in a randomized-controlled clinical trial that the use of&#xD;
      CTG for treatment of root surfaces restored with giomer was effective over the 6-month period&#xD;
      without any noxious effect on periodontal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate clinically the treatment of gingival&#xD;
      recession associated with NCCL in resin modified glass ionomer cement (RMGI) or nano-filled&#xD;
      resin composite (NRC) or giomer plus SCTG in the first year following surgery.&#xD;
