    <textblock>
      Current standard of care algorithm using high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) requires up to&#xD;
      6.5 hours to diagnose an ACS. Data will be stratified based upon time of symptom onset and&#xD;
      gender. A health economics and outcome model will be applied using the optimal high&#xD;
      sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) cut-off values and draw times to determine the cost and&#xD;
      outcome benefits predicted from optimal utilization of hsTnI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chest pain registry will be set up to compare high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) versus&#xD;
      high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) for all patients who present to the emergency department&#xD;
      and require a blood draw. The outcomes of these patients will be tracked over the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of conducting this study evaluation is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To shorten the chest pain protocol for suitable patients to &lt; 3 hours compared to the&#xD;
           current 6 hours protocol with the latest high sensitivity Troponin I assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the validity of Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 and Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3&#xD;
           with an accelerated algorithm in comparison to the standard of care acute coronary&#xD;
           syndrome (ACS) algorithm and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) assay, to rule-out or&#xD;
           rule-in for an ACS within 3 hours of presentation to the emergency room (ER) with&#xD;
           isolated suspected ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish the local reference norms for hsTnI assays.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. To establish the local reference norms for hsTnI assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will also seek to validate the use of a 3-D Vector ECG system&#xD;
      developed by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, to see whether improved sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of myocardial infarction on ECG can be achieved using vectorcardiography rather&#xD;
      than conventional 12-lead ECG recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Scope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the current clinical algorithm at Singapore General Hospital, ambulatory chest pain&#xD;
      patients (CPP) receive an initial evaluation upon presentation to the ER that includes an ECG&#xD;
      and blood draw. The lab spins and holds the blood to await add-on orders for cardiac markers&#xD;
      if clinically-indicated. Other chest pain patients arriving by ambulance may have ECG taken&#xD;
      in the ambulance and the results faxed ahead to the ER. Those that have an initial ECG&#xD;
      consistent with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) receive immediate intervention.&#xD;
      Patients that do not have STEMI identified are evaluated by an ER physician as soon as&#xD;
      possible for clinical signs and symptoms of ACS, as well as, other diagnoses that require&#xD;
      clinical treatment and/or hospital admission. Patients with suspected ACS require serial&#xD;
      Troponin measurements as essential information for the rule-in or rule-out of a non-ST&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). After seeing the patient, the ER physicians will&#xD;
      add-on an hsTnT measurement to the sample drawn at presentation and held in the lab. This&#xD;
      second hsTnT value is drawn two hours after presentation. Using the current standard of care&#xD;
      hsTnT assay and the universal definition, an acute MI at Singapore General Hospital is&#xD;
      defined as a troponin rise and/or fall with at least one value above 30pg/mL with symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of myocardial ischemia. There is no clear definition of the amount of rise or fall&#xD;
      that is required. The reference range for a single troponin T measurement at Singapore&#xD;
      General Hospital is currently defined as abnormal if above 30pg/mL. This study will compare&#xD;
      the ARCHITECT hsTnI assay and Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assays using respective Abbott&#xD;
      ARCHITECT and Beckman Coulter UniCel DxI 800 immunoassay systems, with hsTnT using Roche&#xD;
      analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponin I is a sensitive marker of myocardial necrosis, which will be elevated due to an&#xD;
      intraluminal coronary thrombus related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or other spontaneous&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) event (MI Type I). STEMI patients will be excluded from this&#xD;
      study. The scope of this study will be limited to the rule-in and rule-out of NSTEMI in ER&#xD;
      patients with suspected ACS and no other known causes for elevated troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare data sets and Singapore General Hospital cost data will be used to assess the cost&#xD;
      impact of an alternative model for NSTEMI diagnosis with a more aggressive hsTnI algorithm. A&#xD;
      30 day, Year 1, 2 and 5 follow-up phone contact in conjunction with medical record review and&#xD;
      screening data will be used by cardiologists to determine diagnosis and confirm patient&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions (NSTEMIs) have subtle changes in morphologies that&#xD;
      may not be obvious on a 12-lead ECG. This limits the 12-lead ECG's ability to affirmatively&#xD;
      indicate the presence or absence of NSTEMIs. The 3-D Vector ECG system developed by Ngee Ann&#xD;
      Polytechnic, which has similarities to vector cardiography (VCG, i.e. the Frank lead system)&#xD;
      is postulated to have better sensitivity to MI than the routine 12-lead ECG. Modern graphical&#xD;
      user interface techniques used by the 3-D Vector ECG system makes interpretation easier than&#xD;
      VCG. Additionally, since the electrode placements are identical to a 12-lead ECG. The&#xD;
      clinical procedure for acquiring the signals is not disrupted, increasing its viability for&#xD;
      integration into existing workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Study Design and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest pain patients will be identified and consented in the ER waiting area following initial&#xD;
      triage and exclusion of STEMI and within 1 hour of initial blood draw at presentation. For&#xD;
      chest pain registry, coordinators will also invite NHCS inpatients to participate. The&#xD;
      Clinical Coordinators, under the guidance of Study Team investigators, will be responsible to&#xD;
      identify appropriate study candidates to join this study. They will assist the study team&#xD;
      investigators to explain the purpose of the study and obtain informed consent for additional&#xD;
      blood draws as well as a follow-up telephone/ medical records outcome survey. Patients will&#xD;
      be invited to join a registry where details regarding their clinical findings, relevant&#xD;
      investigations and clinical outcomes will be stored for possible future reference in a&#xD;
      database. Additionally, patients will also be asked if a 6-minute ECG can be performed on&#xD;
      them. The Clinical Coordinators will perform the 3 phlebotomy draws, which must occur within&#xD;
      the following window periods after the presentation draw to be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Draw Window period after presentation draw 0h 0-30 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. h 60-90 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. h 120 - 150 min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens will be collected in 5.0 ml Gel tubes (Serum Separator Tube). A total of&#xD;
      approximately 15 ml of blood will be collected from each patient. The blood sample will be&#xD;
      processed at National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) laboratory. The clinical coordinators&#xD;
      will store each patient's serum into 2 separate vials and freeze them in the freezer at&#xD;
      ≤-80°C. The frozen serum samples will be used to perform the hsTnI assays on the Abbott&#xD;
      ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer in NHCS and the ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assays on the Beckman Coulter&#xD;
      UniCel Dxl 800 analyzer in SGH Pathology by the study coordinator and SGH Pathology lab staff&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening Case Report Form is required for completion and will gather information on 3&#xD;
      key elements: 1) chest pain onset/characteristics; 2) comprehensive demographics to describe&#xD;
      the study population; and 3) data for TIMI risk score generation (Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the use of 3D-Vector ECG, a target of 1000 12-lead ECGs are to be retrieved from&#xD;
      the electrocardiographs at SGH Emergency Department triage, with the post-analysis to be done&#xD;
      at NHCS. The retrieved ECGs will be converted to 3D-vector ECG and analysed to extract&#xD;
      discriminating parameters which can be reliably used to diagnose and localise the presence of&#xD;
      ischaemia. Accuracy of the diagnoses will be counter checked with the results of further&#xD;
      diagnostic tests performed on the patient in the normal course of treatment. From the&#xD;
      analysis of these 1000 records, the sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-Vector ECG to&#xD;
      localise acute coronary syndrome will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Lab Test Orders, Blood Draws, and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical assessment of the patient by an ER physician, an add-on troponin may be&#xD;
      ordered for clinical purposes by the physician that will be applied to the time zero&#xD;
      &quot;presentation&quot; blood draw. Likewise, a 2-hour troponin may be ordered for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assays will take place on UniCel DxI 800&#xD;
      immunoassay system in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Pathology. Analysis of ARCHITECT&#xD;
      hsTnI assay will take place on Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer in the National Heart Centre&#xD;
      Singapore (NHCS) Laboratory. Calibration, Calibration verification, cross-over validation,&#xD;
      and daily Quality Control for the hsTnI assay will be performed by medical technologists in&#xD;
      conjunction with normal laboratory operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      4,000 patients are expected to have been included in the study in a period of 5 years from&#xD;
      the day of recruitment. Recruitment of new patients will end after 4,000 patients are&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Data Retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data will be stored in the SingHealth Information System. Extraction of the data&#xD;
      will be accomplished by export to an Excel spreadsheet. Clinical data will be printed out and&#xD;
      entered into a computer database using a standardized case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Telephone/ Medical records Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be contacted by telephone/ medical records on Day 30, Year 1, Year 2 and&#xD;
      Year 5 after recruitment for any clinical events or symptoms that will be relevant to&#xD;
      adjudication.&#xD;
