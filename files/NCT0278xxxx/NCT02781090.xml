      This trial will compare the efficacy of Positively Smoke Free on the Web+ (a smoking&#xD;
      cessation program + social network for HIV-infected smokers) to the American Heart&#xD;
      Association Getting Healthy website in promoting abstinence in a group of HIV-infected&#xD;
      smokers. All participants will be offered a three-month supply of nicotine patches.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US: 60% smoke cigarettes and 75%&#xD;
      are interested in quitting. Two-thirds of PLWH use the Internet, making this a promising&#xD;
      avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment. Almost none are currently accessing smoking&#xD;
      cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns. Cigarette smoking&#xD;
      is responsible for 24%--61% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies.&#xD;
      It is driving the alarming rise in lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The&#xD;
      lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services&#xD;
      represents a health disparity of the first order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cessation websites offer smokers convenience, low (or no) cost, and anonymity; however, there&#xD;
      are no publicly available web-based cessation programs specifically designed for PLWH&#xD;
      smokers. Smokers living with HIV have high rates of nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      loneliness, and substance use. The investigators developed Positively Smoke Free on the Web&#xD;
      (PSFW), a theory-driven, culturally tailored web-based program designed to address the&#xD;
      specific needs of PLWH smokers. The investigators' NCI-funded R21 pilot of PSFW demonstrated&#xD;
      moderate-high levels of adherence and yielded higher 3-month abstinence rates compared to&#xD;
      standard care (10% vs. 4%). The investigators' prior research on web-based cessation&#xD;
      interventions has shown that smokers who participate in an online community - whether&#xD;
      passively reading posts by others or actively engaging in online discussions - are more than&#xD;
      twice as likely to achieve abstinence even after controlling for a broad range of covariates.&#xD;
      In preparation for the proposed study, the investigators' partners at Truth Initiative&#xD;
      (formerly known as the American Legacy Foundation) have enhanced and modernized PSFW by&#xD;
      integrating an online community platform (now &quot;PSFW+&quot;), developing a training protocol for&#xD;
      PLWH smoker seed users (to provide a critical mass of social network participants), and&#xD;
      recruiting and training 11 PLWH smokers for this role. The prototype PSFW+ application has&#xD;
      been successfully alpha- and beta-tested in anticipation of the randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study that will compare the efficacy of the PSFW+ smoking&#xD;
      cessation website to an attention-matched website promoting cardiovascular health in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with repeated measures at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be N=550 PLWH smokers interested in quitting in the next 30 days. All&#xD;
      participants will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. It is hypothesized that PSFW+ will&#xD;
      outperform the control condition on the primary outcome of 7-day point prevalence abstinence&#xD;
      at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary aims and exploratory analyses will examine&#xD;
      theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of treatment outcome (e.g.,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness, self-efficacy). Establishing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a web-based smoking cessation program for PLWH that has broad reach and&#xD;
      could be scaled to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US would not only represent an enormous&#xD;
      advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLWH, but would also provide a clearer&#xD;
      understanding of the role of targeted, web-based health interventions in comprehensive HIV&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
