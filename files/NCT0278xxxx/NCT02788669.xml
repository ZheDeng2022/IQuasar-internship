  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health problem in France and worldwide. CRC is the&#xD;
      third most common cancer in incidence and mortality in France. The vast majority of these&#xD;
      cancers are adenocarcinomas that arise sporadically and develop from precursor lesions:&#xD;
      adenoma. All CCR with the same disease stage do not have the same prognosis. Various&#xD;
      parameters have been identified as factors influencing the prognosis and allows adjustment of&#xD;
      the treatment. The poor histoprognostic factors are vessels and nerves invasion by the tumor&#xD;
      or the mucinous adenocarcinoma subtype. At the molecular level, the presence of&#xD;
      microsatellite instability (MSI) improves the prognosis, while the presence of a BRAF&#xD;
      mutation is an independent poor prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LRP-1 is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that belongs to the family of LDL receptors. It&#xD;
      is involved in the clearance of matrix proteases. A loss of expression or a decrease of the&#xD;
      LRP-1 activity is correlated with an increase of aggressiveness of cancer cells. This effect&#xD;
      was demonstrated in vitro in vesicular thyroid carcinomas after LRP-1 blocking. The decrease&#xD;
      in the immunohistochemical expression and LRP-1 genomic in hepatocellular carcinomas and lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas was correlated with a decrease in the overall survival. In CRC, only one&#xD;
      immunohistochemical expression study of LRP-1 in colonic adenocarcinoma has been published to&#xD;
      date. This study shows that tumor cells express LRP-1, but in nearly half the cases, weaker&#xD;
      than in normal colonic cells. The clinical and prognostic impact of LRP-1 expression in colon&#xD;
      cancer and its association with a particular molecular or morphological profile has not been&#xD;
      studied to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will study the immunohistochemical and genic expression of&#xD;
      LRP-1 in a series of colorectal cancers.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health problem in France and worldwide. CRC is the&#xD;
      third most common cancer in incidence and mortality in France. The vast majority of these&#xD;
      cancers are adenocarcinomas that arise sporadically and develop from precursor lesions:&#xD;

      invasion or the mucinous adenocarcinoma subtype. At the molecular level, the presence of&#xD;
      microsatellite instability (MSI) improves the prognosis, while the presence of a BRAF&#xD;
      mutation is an independent poor prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low density lipoprotein related Protein Receptor 1 (LRP-1) is a multifunctional endocytic&#xD;
      receptor that belongs to the family of LDL receptors. He is involved in the clearance of&#xD;
      enzymes responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix: the matrix proteases.&#xD;
      This role of matrix proteolysis modulator associated with a function of cell migration&#xD;
      regulator give to this protein an anticancer role. The antitumor property of LRP-1 has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in thyroid cancers in vitro. In these studies, loss of LRP-1 expression or a&#xD;
      decrease in the LRP-1 activity was correlated with an increase of cancer cells migration and&#xD;
      invasion. However, the opposite effect was observed in prostate cancer cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical impact of the level of LRP-1 expression on overall survival of cancer patients&#xD;
      has been assessed in two studies: one on patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma and&#xD;
      one on patients suffering from primitive lung adenocarcinomas. In both studies, the decrease&#xD;
      of immunohistochemical and gene expression of LRP-1 correlated with overall survival&#xD;
      decrease. In CRC, only one immunohistochemical expression study of LRP-1 has been published&#xD;
      to date. This study shows that adenocarcinomatous cells express LRP-1, but in nearly half the&#xD;
      cases, weaker than in normal colonic cells. The clinical and prognostic impact of LRP-1&#xD;
      expression in colon cancer and its association with a particular molecular or morphological&#xD;
      profile has not been studied to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will study the immunohistochemical and genic expression of&#xD;
      LRP-1 in a well-characterized series of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to study by genic and immunohistochemical approaches the&#xD;
      role of LRP-1 in the aggressiveness of colon adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to search for associations between LRP-1 expression&#xD;
      level and morphological or molecular profiles of colonic adenocarcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to explore the expression of LRP-1 in well characterized colon&#xD;
      cancers of different morphological and molecular profiles. This study will help to increase&#xD;
      knowledge of the prognostic role of LRP-1 in colon cancer and its possible association with&#xD;
      clinical, morphological or molecular parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a retrospective cohort study, single center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first design the list of all eligible patients by using a request in&#xD;
      the software DIAMIC of th pathology department with component code &quot;colon&quot;, damage code&#xD;
      &quot;adenocarcinoma &quot; and period &quot;between 2006 and 2012&quot;. Patients suffering from Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      or other familial cancer syndrome will be excluded of the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      send to all the selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients list will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients' medical records will be reviewed for: sociodemographic and clinical data&#xD;
           colonic tumor location, presence of synchronous metastases, treatment type and duration,&#xD;
           patient follow up to the date of 01/06/2014 point (metastases occurrence, disease&#xD;
           recurrence, patient death, ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A central review of all pathological slides will be performed for these criteria:&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma subtype according to WHO 2010 classification, differentiation,&#xD;
           association with polyps and their types, pTNM stage, invasion front and budding, stroma&#xD;
           type, presence and amount of tumor necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunohistochemical analysis on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue will be&#xD;
           performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation of LRP1 immunoexpression with anti-5A6&#xD;
                and 8G1 antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  RER phenotype research (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 immunohistochemistry) and BRAF&#xD;
                V600E immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular analyzes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  analysis of LRP-1 gene expression on frozen tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for selected cases: search for microsatellite instability, search for BRAF V600E,&#xD;
                KRAS (exon 2, 3 and 4) and NRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4) mutation on formalin fixed and&#xD;
                paraffin embedded tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data description: mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables; number and&#xD;
           percentage for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of tumors having a high expression of LRP-1 and tumors not or little&#xD;
           expressing LRP-1 by univariate analysis (Student's test and the Wilcoxon test, Chi2 or&#xD;
           Fisher's exact) and multivariate (logistic regression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search factors associated with patient outcomes, including the expression of LRP1, by&#xD;
           univariate analysis (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox model).&#xD;
