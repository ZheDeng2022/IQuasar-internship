  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the adjuvant use of cannabidiol&#xD;
      administered twice daily in doses of 5-25 mg/kg/day through the proportion of responsive&#xD;
      patients; that is, participants with at least 50% decrease in the frequency of epileptic&#xD;
      seizures in the last month of the trial relative to baseline (pretreatment with AEDs only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point(s): Rate of responsive patients; that is, participants with at least 50%&#xD;
      decrease in the frequency of epileptic seizures in the last month of the trial relative to&#xD;
      baseline (pretreatment with AEDs only).&#xD;

          -  Impaired liver function: AST, ALP, alkaline phosphatase and γGT values more than 3&#xD;
             times above the upper limit of the reference value. Results of γGT values 3 times&#xD;

             induction caused by concomitant treatment with AEDs and with levels of other liver&#xD;
             enzymes lower than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range.&#xD;
