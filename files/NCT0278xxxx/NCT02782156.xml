  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ear, nose, throat (ENT) and jaw surgery departments, up to 60% of patients suffer from&#xD;
      alcohol dependence (Allen et al., 2009), and may develop an alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)&#xD;
      when undergoing sur-gery. Caring for these patients creates a major challenge for all persons&#xD;
      involved: Health care staff is not only challenged by the primary illness but also by&#xD;
      increased risk of life-threatening complications (infection, bleeding, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction, impaired wound healing, re-operation), higher mortality rate, and longer&#xD;
      duration of hospitalization due to preoperative alcohol use and the development of an AWS&#xD;
      (Delgado-Rodriguez, Gomez-Ortega, Mariscal-Ortiz, Palma-Perez, &amp; Sillero-Arenas, 2003; Eyer&#xD;
      et al., 2011; Foy, Kay, &amp; Taylor, 1997; Genther &amp; Gourin, 2012; Kuo et al., 2008; Mayo-Smith&#xD;
      et al., 2004; McCusker, Cole, Abrahamowicz, Primeau, &amp; Belzile, 2002; Neyman, Gourin, &amp;&#xD;
      Terris, 2005; O'Brien et al., 2007). Moreover, nearly five percent of all patients with an&#xD;
      AWS develop an alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) which, without any therapy, will end&#xD;
      lethally in 15% of all cases. With adequate medical and other interventions lethality is&#xD;
      about two percent (Diener, 2003; Wright, Myrick, Henderson, Peters, &amp; Malcolm, 2006).&#xD;
      Additionally, the occurrence of an AWS and / or AWD represents a threatening, time-intensive&#xD;
      and complex situation for family members (Repper-DeLisi et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2011, in addition to patients undergoing short-term surgery, also patients with&#xD;
      oncological diagnoses are hospitalized in the ENT and Jaw Surgery Department at the&#xD;
      University Hospital Basel (USB). These patients are in need of prolonged surgical treatments&#xD;
      and resulting longer periods of abstinence from food and drink, including alcohol and other&#xD;
      substances, increase the risk of alcohol withdrawal. For instance, in the ENT and Jaw Surgery&#xD;
      Department, in 2011, 74 out of 910 inpatients were at risk for or already experienced an AWD&#xD;
      and 47 of them needed permanent supervision to guarantee their safety. Bridging the period of&#xD;
      abstinence by drinking alcohol pre- and postoperatively is a suboptimal option for these&#xD;
      patients due to the relatively long surgical treatment. This situation called for action:&#xD;
      based on positive experiences within the dementia-delirium-programme of USB (Hasemann &amp;&#xD;
      Pretto, 2006), an evidence-based approach to screen for, detect and treat AWS and / or AWD in&#xD;
      ENT and jaw surgery patients was developed and implemented (Hasemann, 2013). Now, this new&#xD;
      approach needs to be evaluated.&#xD;

      The aims of the proposed study are to describe patient trajectories and to evaluate the&#xD;
      processes and structures of the nurse-led approach in the ENT and Jaw Surgery Department at&#xD;
      USB. The following research questions were generated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1): Who are the patients captured with the algorithm, what are their risk factors, and&#xD;
      how are the patient trajectories in terms of decisions, development, start, duration and&#xD;
      ending of AWS and / or AWD? Specific questions asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which are demographic and medical characteristics of patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients are at risk for AWD / AWS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which decisions do patients make?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the time of onset, duration and ending of AWS and / or AWD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Were additional resources used to guarantee safety of patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2): How is the prevention algorithm adhered to? Specific questions asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients were risk-assessed by a nurse at hospital admission?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients or those who should have been asked were eventually asked to agree to&#xD;
           substitution therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients at risk were assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal&#xD;
           Assessment (CIWA)-Ar?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many times was the delirium expert consultation service contacted due to reasons&#xD;
           stated in algorithm?&#xD;
