      This will be a prospective study of cirrhotics and healthy controls comparing their oral&#xD;
      microbiota, endotoxemia and systemic inflammation at baseline and at 30 days after clinically&#xD;
      indicated systematic oral cleansing and interventions as well as 3-month hospitalizations&#xD;
      post-cleaning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study of cirrhotics and healthy controls comparing their oral&#xD;
      microbiota, endotoxemia and systemic inflammation at baseline and at 10 and 30 days after&#xD;
      clinically indicated systematic oral cleansing and interventions as well as 3-month&#xD;
      hospitalizations post-cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit cirrhotic subjects and age- matched healthy controls from the&#xD;
      hepatology clinics. Subjects will be informed regarding the study and will give the&#xD;
      investigators a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent and evaluation of eligibility, subjects will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      oral health questionnaire and sample collection during the recruitment visit. Patients will&#xD;
      then be scheduled for a dental exam during a separate screening visit up to 7 days after this&#xD;
      recruitment visit at the Dental Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time patients will undergo cognitive testing consisting of a validated cognitive&#xD;
      battery of PHES (psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score) and EncephalApp stroop. In&#xD;
      addition, they will undergo Sickness Impact Profile (a quality of life questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dental exam which will be done during screening visit, the subject will undergo&#xD;
      comprehensive oral evaluation which will include dental xrays (as needed) which are part of&#xD;
      the study, periodontal examination (determination of pocket depth, clinical attachment&#xD;
      levels, bleeding on probing, plaque index) and recording of caries and oral soft tissue&#xD;
      lesions. Dental cleaning is part of the study protocol and not intended to fully treat the&#xD;
      patient's periodontal and dental diseases. Therefore no follow-up dental visits will be&#xD;
      scheduled in the dental clinics after completion of dental cleansing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who do not qualify for the study will be informed of the findings by the dental&#xD;
      professionals and subsequently the patients need to make arrangements for their dental&#xD;
      treatment needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include cirrhotic patients with/without hepatic encephalopathy. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be scheduled for dental cleaning which could occur over 1 or 2 visits as determined&#xD;
      during the screening exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the initiation of oral therapy, plaque and gingival crevicular samples will be&#xD;
      collected for microbiota. The subjects will receive deep dental cleanings (scaling and root&#xD;
      planing) and oral hygiene instructions as per clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be followed at day 10 for clinical exam and day 30 at which point stool,&#xD;
      saliva and blood samples for the similar analyses as before will be collected. There will be&#xD;
      no more dental examinations after the initial assessment and treatment. We will repeat the&#xD;
      cognitive testing at day 30 using alternate forms of the same cognitive tests and also repeat&#xD;
      quality of life testing at day 30 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also follow them for up to 3 months post-cleaning for hospitalizations&#xD;
      using active chart review and follow-up&#xD;
