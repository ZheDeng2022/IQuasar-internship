      This study is a randomized clinical trial that has as objective to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      training with a vibratory platform on body composition, muscular strength functional&#xD;
      capacity, flexibility and biochemical profile on elderly women. It will be done in the city&#xD;
      of Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, with elderly women between the ages of 60 and 80&#xD;
      years-old, within the municipal limits and nearby areas selected randomly by a brown envelope&#xD;
      in which a note will be stating if they belong to the control or vibratory platform group, in&#xD;
      which the participant will be receiving whole body vibrations on the platform. The recruiting&#xD;
      will be done by the institution through e-mail or by public call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be evaluated through anamesis. On the evaluation, a questionaire will be applied,&#xD;
      in order to evaluate if they don´t have counterindications for the vibratory platform. They&#xD;
      will be evaluated in their general health, socio-economical status, and history of physical&#xD;
      activity. Participants will have their doubts cleared about the study, and a written consent&#xD;
      will be signed. Before the intervention with whole body vibrations, nutritional and physical&#xD;
      activity aspects will be evaluated. The treatment period on the vibratory platform will be of&#xD;
      8 weeks, before and after it, anthropometrical, biochemical, strength, flexibility, palmar&#xD;
      prehension strength, metabolic basal load, and functional capacity measurements will be&#xD;
      taken. Before and after every session on the vibratory platform, heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, arterial pressure, and peripheric oxygen saturation will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      interventional procedure will be done with a vibratory platform (Power Plate®, model my7™,&#xD;
      UK) with a frequency of 30 - 40 Hz, with low (2mm) or high (4mm) amplitude. Training will&#xD;
      last 8 weeks with 3 sessions per week, lasting between 30 seconds and 1 minute of training,&#xD;
      and 30 seconds to 1 minute of rest, with the subject positioned in orthosis with a knee&#xD;
      flexion of 15° and a feet width distance of 20 cm. The frequency will be of 35 Hz and the&#xD;
      amplitude of 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to contribute with reducing the body mass index and body fat percentage, to&#xD;
      improve the lean mass, palmar prehension strength, muscular strength on the lower limbs and&#xD;
      flexibility, also obtaining better biochemical profiles after the training period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After evaluating the anamnesis and having the written consent signed and clarified, the&#xD;
      elderly women will be evaluated before and after the intervention period of 8 weeks of&#xD;
      training on the vibratory platform. First, academics from the nutrition degree of the&#xD;
      University of Santa Cruz do Sul (UNISC) will perform nutritional evaluations on the subjects,&#xD;
      asking them their 24 hour eating habits, there will not be any interference on the subjects&#xD;
      diet, also they will have to keep these habits until the end of the trial. Then there will be&#xD;
      a socio-economical indicators evaluation through a questionnaire of socio-economical&#xD;
      classification from the Brazilian Association of Research Companies.The evaluation of their&#xD;
      level of physical activity will be done by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.&#xD;
      The anthropometrical evaluation will consider height, weight, body mass index, waist&#xD;
      circumference, hip circumference, and hip-waist ratio. Body fat percentage, lean mass, and&#xD;
      basal metabolic rate will be obtained through bioimpedance (Biodynamics 450, USA),&#xD;
      recommending 5 hours fasting prior to the procedure. Biochemical tests will be done&#xD;
      collecting blood at the University of Santa Cruz Exercise Biochemistry Laboratory, on the&#xD;
      following variables: hemogram, glycemia, cholesterol, triglycerides, Urea, creatine, uric&#xD;
      acid. Oxidative stress evaluation with the Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)&#xD;
      test will be done after urine collection once a week, before intervention and immediately&#xD;
      after the session. Control group subjects will have urine collected twice: on the day when&#xD;
      cards will be handed in and on the last day of evaluations. Physical evaluation will be done&#xD;
      in the week prior to the intervention with the vibratory platform and in the last week of&#xD;
      treatment, where flexibility through Wells Bank will be evaluated, as well as lower limb&#xD;
      muscular strength by the maximum repetitions test, and palmar prehension strength will be&#xD;
      obtained through dynamometer. Functional Capacity will be evaluated with the six minute walk&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention procedure with the vibratory platform (Power Plate®, model my7™, UK) will&#xD;
      last 8 weeks, 3 times a week with work periods lasting between 30 seconds and 1 hour and rest&#xD;
      periods of 30 seconds to 1 minute with a total session time of 10 to 20 minutes. The&#xD;
      individual will be then positioned in orthosis with a knee flexion of a 15° and a foot width&#xD;
      distance of 20 cm. A frequency of 35 Hz and an amplitude of 2 mm will be used. The protocol&#xD;
      with number of session, time of session, time of vibrations and rest, is as follows: 1st&#xD;
      through 6th session, total time of 10 minutes, with 30 seconds of vibration alternated with 1&#xD;
      minute rest; 7th through 12th session, total time of 10 minutes, vibrations and rest time of&#xD;
      1 minute each; 13th trough 18th session, total session time of 15 minutes, vibrations and&#xD;
      rest time of 1 minute each, 19th through 24th session, total time of 20 minutes, time of&#xD;
      vibration 1 minute and rest time of 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: This will be done using the Statistical Package for Social Science&#xD;
      (Version 23.0 USA) program. To test data normality the investigators will use the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Parametric data will be presented in mean and standard deviation and&#xD;
      non-parametric data in median and interquartile intervals. The intragroup deltas from the pre&#xD;
      and post training periods on the vibratory platform on both groups will be evaluated through&#xD;
      Student´s T Test (paired T test or non-parametric equivalent for intergroup comparisons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate body composition, metabolic rate, palmar prehension strength, flexibility,&#xD;
      muscular strength, distance traveled through the Six minute walking test (6SMWT), biochemical&#xD;
      profile and oxidative stress between the groups evaluated pre and post training period, a&#xD;
      Student´s T test will be used. Significance level will be p &lt; 0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: It was based on a previous study by Rees et al. (2008). To detect a difference&#xD;
      of 8,9 W/Kg between knee flexion torque pre and post training on the vibratory platform,&#xD;
      considering a p value &lt; 0,05, a statistical power of 80% and a 10% loss, 34 subjects will be&#xD;
      needed in each group to be evaluated in pre and post training.&#xD;
