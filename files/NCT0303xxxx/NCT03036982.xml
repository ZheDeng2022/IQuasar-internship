      This study will assess whether adaption of the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and childhood Asthma&#xD;
      Control Test (cACT) for mobile devices improves rate of completion and improves control of&#xD;
      asthma in children and adolescents&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood with an overall prevalence of 10%.&#xD;
      While effective therapies exist to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations, many asthma&#xD;
      patients experience significant morbidity including limitations on daily activities as well&#xD;
      as asthma exacerbations that lead to missed school (and work for care givers) and necessitate&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Among children from lower socioeconomic&#xD;
      statues and in black and Hispanic families, asthma incidence and severity are even greater.&#xD;
      Reasons for this disparity included decreased access to effective asthma care, increased&#xD;
      exposure to tobacco smoke and environmental allergens, and underutilization of controller&#xD;
      medicines. These groups have significantly increased resource utilization due to emergency&#xD;
      department visits and hospitalizations. Optimal care for asthma patients, especially those&#xD;
      with at highest risk, will therefore require new strategies for evaluating ongoing control&#xD;
      and providing direct feedback to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to transform the way asthma care is provided through the use of an innovative&#xD;
      patient centered technology -Trivox Asthma - to improve quality of care and outcomes for&#xD;
      asthma patients while reducing the cost of care. Specifically we will extend Trivox Health to&#xD;
      facilitate closer monitoring of patients with asthma through the existing web platform and a&#xD;
      new mobile interface. This will allow asthma patients, their parents and school nurses to&#xD;
      remotely input data on asthma control through smartphones and/or tablets. We will use the&#xD;
      ACT+, an expansion of a validated measure currently utilized in both primary care and&#xD;
      specialty clinics, to measure both asthma control and risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of this intervention will be measured by examining resource utilization and&#xD;
      ongoing asthma control.&#xD;
