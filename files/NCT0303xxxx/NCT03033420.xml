  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unipolar and bipolar disorder combined account for nearly half of all morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      due to mental and substance use disorders, and burden society with the highest health care&#xD;
      costs of all psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among these, costs due to psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitalization is a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for&#xD;
      monitoring and treatment of depression and mania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group design. Patients&#xD;
      with unipolar or bipolar disorder discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region&#xD;
      of Denmark are invited to participate. Patients are at discharge from the psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitals randomized, separately according to psychiatric diagnosis (thus, the RADMIS trial&#xD;
      consists of two separate trials according to diagnosis, bipolar disorder or unipolar&#xD;
      disorder), to: 1) a smartphone-based monitoring system including a) an integrated feedback&#xD;
      loop between patients and clinicians and b) context-aware CBT modules (intervention group) or&#xD;
      2) treatment-as-usual (control group) for a 6-months trial period. The trial is started in&#xD;
      March 2017. The outcomes are 1) differences in the number and duration of re-admissions&#xD;
      between the intervention group and the control group (primary), 2) differences in severity of&#xD;
      depressive and manic symptoms (manic symptoms only for patients with bipolar disorder);&#xD;
      differences in psychosocial functioning; and differences in number of affective episodes&#xD;
      between the intervention group and the control group (secondary), and 3) differences in&#xD;
      perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms&#xD;
      (only for patients with bipolar disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication,&#xD;
      well-being, ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction between the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group (tertiary).&#xD;

      Background Unipolar and bipolar disorder combined account for nearly half of all morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality due to mental and substance use disorders, and burden society with the highest&#xD;
      health care costs of all psychiatric and neurological disorders. Among these, costs due to&#xD;
      psychiatric hospitalization are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique&#xD;
      platform for monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has&#xD;
      investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent re-admission among&#xD;
      patients discharged from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group design.&#xD;
      Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder are invited to participate&#xD;
      in each their trial when discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark following an affective episode and randomized to either 1) a smartphone-based&#xD;
      monitoring system including a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians&#xD;
      and b) context-aware CBT modules (intervention group) or 2) standard treatment (control&#xD;
      group) for a 6-months trial period. The trial is started in March 2017. The outcomes are 1)&#xD;
      differences in the number and duration of re-admissions between the intervention group and&#xD;
      the control group (primary), 2) differences in severity of depressive and manic symptoms&#xD;
      (manic symptoms only for patients with bipolar disorder); differences in psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning; and differences in number of affective episodes between the intervention group&#xD;
      and the control group (secondary), and 3) differences in perceived stress, quality of life,&#xD;
      self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, well-being, ruminations, worrying,&#xD;
      and satisfaction between the intervention group and the control group (tertiary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Recruitment is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion If the smartphone-based monitoring system is proved effective in reducing the rate&#xD;
      and duration of re-admissions there will be basis for using a system of this kind in the&#xD;
      treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorder in general and in a larger scale.&#xD;
