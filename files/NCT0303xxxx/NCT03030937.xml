      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve&#xD;
      progression free survival compared with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer or adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China. Most patients are unresectable&#xD;
      or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis,so the prognosis is poor.Systemic therapy was&#xD;
      required for the patients with advanced stage. Platinum combined with fluoropyrimidines&#xD;
      always were considered as first line treatment. After failure of initial therapy, single&#xD;
      agent of irinotecan was used as second line treatment,but limited survival benefit.Apatinib,&#xD;
      a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve progression free survival compared&#xD;
      with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.&#xD;
