      This project is designed to address the urgent need for an effective primary prevention&#xD;
      approach to the problem of sexual violence among college students. The project involves&#xD;
      developing, feasibility testing, and testing for effectiveness an innovative new approach to&#xD;
      the primary prevention of sexual violence, alcohol, and drug abuse among college students&#xD;
      utilizing both online e-learning and small group facilitator-led intervention modalities. The&#xD;
      intervention is an adaptation of the successful evidence-based substance abuse and violence&#xD;
      prevention approach called Life Skills Training (LST). The adapted intervention is designed&#xD;
      to address the relationship between sexual violence and substance abuse; positively change&#xD;
      social norms surrounding alcohol/drug abuse and sexual violence; train bystanders to identify&#xD;
      and appropriately respond to problematic situations; and build social, self-regulation, and&#xD;
      relationship skills through interactive learning and behavioral rehearsal scenarios. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study, the investigators expect to be able to widely disseminate and market&#xD;
      a new evidence-based primary prevention intervention for sexual violence for use in a variety&#xD;
      of higher educational settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed to address the urgent need for an effective primary prevention&#xD;
      approach to the problem of sexual violence among college students. It is estimated that 1 in&#xD;
      every 5 college women has been sexually assaulted while in college. There is a dearth of&#xD;
      primary prevention strategies that have demonstrated significant reductions in sexual&#xD;
      violence in college students as part of a rigorously designed evaluation. Research shows that&#xD;
      many victims of sexual assault are abused while drunk, under the influence of drugs, or&#xD;
      otherwise incapacitated, and that incidents of sexual violence typically occur in college&#xD;
      party settings where the victim knows the perpetrator and the perpetrator has been drinking&#xD;
      or using drugs. In Phase I of this study, the investigators established the feasibility,&#xD;
      relevance, and appeal of the new primary prevention program for sexual violence, alcohol, and&#xD;
      drug abuse for incoming college students. The program is an adaptation of a successful&#xD;
      evidence-based substance abuse and violence prevention approach called Life Skills Training&#xD;
      (LST). The LST approach is designed to build personal self-management skills, social skills,&#xD;
      and other life skills needed to reduce substance abuse and violence, increase resilience, and&#xD;
      successfully navigate developmental tasks. In Phase I, the investigators developed the full&#xD;
      scope and sequence of the program which outlines the learning objectives and activities of&#xD;
      the of the online e-learning modules and small group facilitator-led sessions; developed&#xD;
      relevant prototype materials to represent a subset of the full program; conducted formative&#xD;
      research to establish the feasibility, relevance, and appeal of the intervention through a&#xD;
      series of focus groups with college students and key informant interviews with college&#xD;
      prevention staff; and recruited over 40 colleges and universities to participate in Phase II&#xD;
      of the project. In Phase II, the investigators will fully develop the skills building&#xD;
      curriculum materials and conduct a rigorous randomized controlled trial to examine the impact&#xD;
      of the intervention. Forty colleges will be randomized into either an intervention group that&#xD;
      will receive the new intervention or a treatment-as-usual control group that will receive the&#xD;
      existing information on sexual violence provided at the school. At the end of a two-month&#xD;
      intervention period, and at 6- and 12month follow-up assessments, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare changes in behaviors, norms, attitudes, and knowledge regarding alcohol, drug abuse,&#xD;
      and sexual violence. The ultimate intervention holds promise for wide dissemination as an&#xD;
      evidence-based primary prevention approach for sexual violence to four-year colleges,&#xD;
      community or junior colleges, universities, graduate and professional schools, for-profit&#xD;
      schools, trade schools, and career and technical schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fully develop the sexual violence primary prevention skills building curriculum&#xD;
           materials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the intervention;&#xD;
           randomize 40 colleges into either an intervention group that will receive the new&#xD;
           intervention or a treatment-as-usual control group that will receive the existing&#xD;
           information on sexual violence provided at the school;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct an outcome evaluation by assessing changes in the two experimental conditions&#xD;
           with regards to behaviors, norms, attitudes, and knowledge regarding alcohol, drug&#xD;
           abuse, and sexual violence at the end of the two-month intervention period, and at 6-&#xD;
           and 12-month follow-up assessments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Conduct a process evaluation to document and monitor all Phase II project activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Disseminate research findings to the scientific and practice communities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Create a provider training mechanism to promote dissemination and sustainability of the&#xD;
           intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Based on the commercialization plan, implement a marketing strategy for the new primary&#xD;
           prevention program aimed at institutions of higher education across the country.&#xD;
