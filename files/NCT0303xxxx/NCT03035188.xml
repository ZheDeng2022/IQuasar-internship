    <textblock>
      In this study patients with resectable basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who usually undergo surgery&#xD;
      without prior anticancer treatment will be treated with antitumor medication. But since BCC&#xD;
      is mainly localized in clearly visible regions of the body, as e.g. the face, there is also a&#xD;
      need to reduce scars as a consequence of surgery which will be accomplished by neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used medication - vismodegib - displays controllable adverse events and shows a good&#xD;
      efficacy for reduction of BCC lesions. It is expected that the neoadjuvant setting will lead&#xD;
      to minor surgical intervention thus minimising surgical risks and scars for the patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with resectable BCC will receive neoadjuvant vismodegib therapy for a time period of&#xD;
      12 weeks which applies to the routine use of vismodegib. This period is chosen because within&#xD;
      this time side effects are acceptable and response is expected. Tumor examination will be&#xD;
      performed monthly to expeditiously identify patients with progressive disease. This will be&#xD;
      done by non-invasive imaging techniques thus a further objective of this study is the testing&#xD;
      of diagnostic suitability of non-invasive methodology for the evaluation of response status&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this clinical trial will be treated with an effective medication which is&#xD;
      approved for the therapy of metastatic and locally advanced BCC for a time having been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in neoadjuvant setting The same dose as approved for the advanced BCC disease&#xD;
      is used, therefore it can be expected that the side effects will be predictable. Furthermore&#xD;
      there are no hints in literature that the efficacy of the used medication may be decreased in&#xD;
      patients with resectable BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study patients are less sick than those for whom treatment with vismodegib is&#xD;
      approved, surgery would be their therapy according to guideline. Thus the risk of vismodegib&#xD;
      treatment has to be judged against the greater surgical risk if BCC will be operated directly&#xD;
      without prior reduction of tumor lesion. A benefit for the great majority of the patients&#xD;
      will be that smaller lesions result in minor scars and better cosmetically outcome of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
