  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PI is studying if sorafenib/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will have improved efficacy when&#xD;
      compared to sorafenib alone and in patients progressing of sorafenib the addition of HCQ&#xD;
      would lead to disease stability in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC).&#xD;

      Phase 2 study with two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: As second-line treatment, we will add HCQ to SOR dose the patient was tolerating at&#xD;
      the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: SOR-naïve patients receive SOR 400 mg by PO twice daily on Cycle1 Day1 (C1D1). On&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Day 15, HCQ 400 mg PO daily will be started. In clinical practice, dose reduction of&#xD;
      SOR may be required. On C1D15 SOR maybe kept as starting dose or reduced for toxicity. On&#xD;
      Cycle 2 Day 1 of toxicity of HCQ and SOR will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1 to assess&#xD;
      for biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease evaluation every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reductions due to adverse events are allowed for both sorafenib per standard of care&#xD;
      and/or HCQ for grade 3 or more adverse event was related to study medication. Dose reductions&#xD;
      are also permitted based on investigator clinical decision.&#xD;

    <description>Sorafenib (SOR)-naïve patients receive SOR 400 mg by PO twice daily on Cycle1/Day1 (C1D1). In clinical practice, dose reduction of SOR is often required. Therefore, on C1D15, the clinician will dose-reduce sorafenib based on toxicity and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg PO daily will be started. C2D1 of each cohort, toxicity of HCQ will be assessed. Dose reductions due to adverse events (AEs) to each agent are allowed for SOR per standard of care and/or HCQ for grade 3+ AE.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;

             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed Consent - No study specific procedures will be performed without a written&#xD;
             and signed informed consent document. Patients who do not demonstrate the ability to&#xD;
