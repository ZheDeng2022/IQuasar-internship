  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b/2 study in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)or non hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who have failed prior standard&#xD;
      of care therapies including a BTK inhibitor where one is approved for the indication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes 2 parts: phase 1 (dose escalation) and phase 2 (cohort expansion) in&#xD;
      patients with CLL/SLL or NHL who have failed prior standard of care therapies including a BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor where one is approved for the indication. NHL indications include&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM), mantle cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated B-cell&#xD;
      subtype (DLBCL-ABC), and follicular lymphoma (FL). In Phase 1b, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients&#xD;
      are studied at each dose level, starting with 25 mg vecabrutnib BID in oral capsule form.&#xD;
      Following identification of the MTD and/or recommended dose, in Phase 2 only CLL/SLL patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to expansion cohorts to further characterize the clinical activity, safety,&#xD;
      and pharmacology of vecabrutinib. Cycle length is 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Phase 1b portion completed. Sponsor decided not to proceed with P2 portion of study.&#xD;
    Vecabrutinib was very well tolerated, there was insufficient evidence of activity at the doses&#xD;
    tested in the Phase 1b to advance to Phase 2.&#xD;
