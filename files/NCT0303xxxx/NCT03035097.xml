      The purpose of this research study is to establish a research database and biorepository for&#xD;
      patients at National Jewish Health (NJH) who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or&#xD;
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). This study will also include civilian contractors who&#xD;
      worked as part of these military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. The biorepository would&#xD;
      store blood samples obtained from these patients during a clinic visit. The research database&#xD;
      would store prospectively and retrospectively collected clinical and exposure data that would&#xD;
      enable us to comprehensively characterize each case.&#xD;

      If informed consent is obtained, test results and other information collected for clinical&#xD;
      reasons will be entered in a research database designed and maintained by DEOHS staff. The&#xD;
      clinical data collected are part of the routine diagnosis and care of these patients. No&#xD;
      additional procedures are required for the purpose of this research database. Collection of&#xD;
      symptom and exposure data using a questionnaire designed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All NJH patients who served in southwest Asia will be approached for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      This will also attempt to contact patients evaluated previously at NJH for deployment-related&#xD;
      lung disease to obtain informed consent to include data from their medical record and the&#xD;
      research questionnaire in the database.&#xD;

      If patients consent to having blood and tissue collected for the biorepository, the samples&#xD;
      will be collected during a clinic visit. Two DNA PAXgene tubes will be used to collect 17ml&#xD;
      of blood and two RNA PAXgene tubes would be used to collect 5 ml of blood. In addition,&#xD;
      excess bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from a clinically-indicated bronchoscopy would also&#xD;
      be collected. Blood and BAL fluid will be frozen and stored in -80 degree C freezers in the&#xD;
      Occupational Medicine Laboratory until processed. If a patient will have a surgical or&#xD;
      transbronchial biopsy as part of his or her clinical evaluation, any excess lung tissue that&#xD;
      has been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded will also be collected and stored in the&#xD;
      Occupational Medicine facilities.&#xD;

        Patients who served in the southwest Asia will be approached for inclusion in the study. If&#xD;
        patients agree to participate in the biorepository, a one-time blood draw will occur. If&#xD;
        the subject has had a previous bronchoscopy or a surgical lung biopsy and has excess&#xD;
        samples the study would collect those to add to the biorepository.&#xD;
