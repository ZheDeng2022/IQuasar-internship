    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies whether the nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine given to&#xD;
      adults prior to kidney transplantation can help the body build and maintain an effective&#xD;
      immune response during the post-transplant period when they receive immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      to prevent transplant rejection. This study will help inform our scientific understanding&#xD;
      about vaccine-induced immune responses among immunosuppressed individuals.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rates at&#xD;
      12-months post-transplantation among kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of&#xD;
      the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine) &gt;= 30 days&#xD;
      prior to transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the following in adult kidney transplant recipients who receive &gt;= 1 doses of&#xD;
      the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine prior to transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. HPV vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rates at 12-months post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Persistence and stability of HPV vaccine-type-specific geometric mean titers (GMT) at 6&#xD;
      and 12-months post-transplantation, and rise in HPV vaccine-type-specific GMT at the 13 month&#xD;
      post-transplant visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Vaccine safety profile and allograft rejection/opportunistic infections stratified by&#xD;
      number of vaccine doses and time between the last vaccine dose and the transplant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. HPV detection in self-collected samples from the cervix/vagina, and oral cavity at&#xD;
      baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 6- and 12-months post-vaccination, overall and by number of&#xD;
      vaccine doses (1, 2, or 3), sexual behavior, type-specific seroconversion rates, and time&#xD;
      elapsed between the last vaccine dose and the transplant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. Descriptive analysis to explore differences or similarities between the genders from the&#xD;
      secondary objective outcomes above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive the first dose of the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent&#xD;
      vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at baseline, at least 30 days prior to the kidney transplant&#xD;
      surgery. The second dose is given at least one month after the first dose. The third dose is&#xD;
      given at least five months after the first dose and at least three months after the second&#xD;
      dose. The timing of the second and third doses is dependent on the scheduling of the kidney&#xD;
      transplant surgery. Patients are followed up at 6- and 12-months after the kidney transplant&#xD;
      surgery to measure vaccine-induced immune responses. Patients may receive either one, two, or&#xD;
      all three vaccine doses prior to the kidney transplant surgery, and are offered additional&#xD;
      visits at least one year after the surgery to complete any remaining doses of the three-dose&#xD;
      vaccine series.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for renal transplant, expected to undergo transplant surgery &gt;= 30 days and&#xD;
             =&lt; 12 months after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For potential participants on the institutional waiting list for deceased donor&#xD;
                  transplant, a study clinician confirms the candidate is likely to receive a&#xD;
                  transplant within the next 12 months, taking into account the candidate's&#xD;
                  priority on the waiting list, age, medical status, institutional policies, and&#xD;
                  scores like the Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS) Score and Calculated&#xD;
                  Panel Reactive Antibody (CPRA) percentage, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For potential participants expected to undergo a living donor transplant, one or&#xD;
                  more donor(s) have been identified and is/are in work-up (even though all work-up&#xD;
                  status may or may not be complete); a study clinician confirms the living donor&#xD;
                  transplant is likely to be scheduled within the next twelve months after taking&#xD;
                  into account donor work-up progress, age and medical status, and institutional&#xD;
                  policies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Living and deceased donor transplant recipients: The study was originally&#xD;
                       restricted to participants who were expecting to receive only living donor&#xD;
                       renal transplants; however, less than a third of kidney transplants in the&#xD;
                       United States occur with kidneys from living donors; a majority of&#xD;
                       transplants are in the setting of donation of kidneys from deceased donors;&#xD;
                       to permit efficiencies in accrual, the study is amended (from version 3.5)&#xD;
                       to also open enrollment to recipients of deceased donor kidneys&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Transplant recipients of both genders: The study was originally designed to&#xD;
                       be conducted only among women; however, in October 2018, the Food and Drug&#xD;
                       Administration (FDA) approved an age expansion indication for the Gardasil 9&#xD;
                       HPV vaccine for both women and men up to 45 years (from the originally&#xD;
                       approved upper age limit of 26 years), thus opening a new clinical cancer&#xD;
                       preventative option for middle-age adults of both genders; the primary&#xD;
                       endpoint for the study is HPV-vaccine-type-specific seroconversion rates,&#xD;
                       which are not expected to be differential by gender, based on extrapolating&#xD;
                       from the uniformly high (&gt; 99%) seroconversion rates observed regardless of&#xD;
                       gender in studies among immunocompetent individuals; however, HPV&#xD;
                       vaccine-type-specific titer levels (geometric mean titre [GMT]) differences&#xD;
                       by gender will be analyzed as a secondary endpoint, given variability in&#xD;
                       immune response titer levels observed between males and females in&#xD;
                       immunocompetent individuals (related to the differences in body mass index&#xD;
                       or hitherto unproven factors related to hormone-immune interactions);&#xD;
                       another advantage of expanding this study to males will be to facilitate&#xD;
                       efficiencies in accrual, since men constitute the majority (55%-65%) of all&#xD;
                       kidney transplant recipients in the United States; although a majority of&#xD;
                       current HPV-associated cancers among solid organ transplant recipients occur&#xD;
                       among women, there is increasing evidence of the link between HPV infection&#xD;
                       and oropharyngeal cancers that disproportionately affect men; HPV-related&#xD;
                       oropharyngeal cancers are now the most common HPV-related cancers in the&#xD;
                       United States, surpassing even the incidence of cervical cancer; the&#xD;
                       expansion of enrollment to men will also allow this study to look at the&#xD;
                       effect of HPV vaccination on persistence of oral HPV infection as a&#xD;
                       secondary/exploratory endpoint in the context of transplant-related&#xD;
                       immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine on the developing human fetus at the&#xD;
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because there have been&#xD;
             no adequate and well-controlled studies of Gardasil 9 in pregnant women, women who are&#xD;
             able to become pregnant must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test result within&#xD;
             the past 28 days prior to enrollment and must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation; women who have had a both ovaries removed or a&#xD;
             tubal ligation will not be required to have a pregnancy test; should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her study physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and medical release form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous prophylactic HPV vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated desensitization treatment; this decision to exclude a participant who may&#xD;
             need desensitization will be based on the site clinician's judgement; desensitization&#xD;
             procedures vary somewhat among the five participating transplant centers, which does&#xD;
             not permit proposing uniform criteria across all study sites for determining exclusion&#xD;
             due to desensitization; in general, participants who have received a prior transplant,&#xD;
             have unsuitable scores on Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) percentage&#xD;
             (institution-specific thresholds), or an ABO incompatible donor are likely to undergo&#xD;
             desensitization at one or more of the study centers; these factors, among others, will&#xD;
             be used by the study clinician to determine exclusion due to anticipated&#xD;
             desensitization is warranted for a particular participant in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions to yeast or attributed to compounds of similar chemical&#xD;
             or biologic composition to Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female participants: Pregnant or intention to get pregnant, or breastfeeding;&#xD;
             pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
             Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine have not been established in pregnant women; it is not known&#xD;
             whether Gardasil 9 is excreted in human milk; because many drugs are excreted in human&#xD;
             milk, caution should be exercised when Gardasil 9 is administered to a nursing woman;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with Gardasil 9, women who are breastfeeding will&#xD;
             be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cervical cancer or anal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active malignancy, including basal/squamous cell skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness, such as known psychiatric disorders or substance abuse (i.e.,&#xD;
             average alcohol consumption of more than 3 drinks per day), which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators would compromise either the patient or the integrity of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on anticoagulation or with bleeding disorders should be evaluated by a&#xD;
             physician for risk/benefit of bleeding disorders with intramuscular injections prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment; patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding with&#xD;
             intramuscular injections will be excluded&#xD;
