    <textblock>
      The study will compare two invasive methods (FFR -fractional flow reserve and&#xD;
      iFR-instantaneous wave free ratio) for assessment of hemodynamic impact of coronary stenosis&#xD;
      on myocardial perfusion. There is a very good correlation between these methods for the&#xD;
      assessment of hemodynamic significance in a broad spectrum of lesions. However, this&#xD;
      correlation decreases significantly near the cut off points for each method. The&#xD;
      investigators will try to find possible explanations for these differences by detailed&#xD;
      morphology assessment of coronary stenosis using optical coherence tomography (OCT), analysis&#xD;
      of gene polymorphisms that play a role in vasodilatation, and by shear stress analysis. The&#xD;
      head-to-head comparison between FFR and iFR is not simple, because there is no &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; for assessment of hemodynamic significance. Studies comparing these methods have&#xD;
      used hyperemic stenosis resistance (HSR). For this kind of measurement it is necessary to&#xD;
      measure the speed of blood flow. This is usually done by a Doppler analysis of flow.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the Doppler signal can yield many artificial or erroneous indicators, and&#xD;
      obtaining a good quality signal is frequently time-consuming. These are the reasons that HSR&#xD;
      has not been used in routine practice. The investigators have developed a new console and&#xD;
      software that can provide real time analysis of the Doppler signal. It allows us to easily&#xD;
      measure HSR, and to differentiate between the FFR and iFR measures through intrabeat analysis&#xD;
      of microvascular resistance (lowest microvascular resistance is an essential condition for&#xD;
      proper pressure measurement). Using this tool, it is possible to automatically identify the&#xD;
      point of lowest microvascular resistance during each cardiac beat. The pressure gradient can&#xD;
      then be measured at that point. This approach can eliminate almost all uncertainties in&#xD;
      assessment of the pressure gradient produced by coronary stenosis. This tool can potentially&#xD;
      improve the existing methods used to precisely reveal a significant stenosis. This should&#xD;
      increase the number of hemodynamic guided procedures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most frequent&#xD;
      causes of death and disability in developed countries. The main diagnostic method for&#xD;
      detection of CAD is a coronary angiography (CAG. However, the correlation between CAG and&#xD;
      proven hemodynamic significance in borderline stenosis (40-70% of lumen narrowing) is only&#xD;
      about 50%. The main method for detection of flow-limiting lesions is fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      (FFR). FFR is calculated as distal pressure (Pd) divided by proximal pressure (Pa). The&#xD;
      cut-off for hemodynamic significance is 0.8 and less. The use of FFR for lesion assessment&#xD;
      has a level of recommendation of I A in European guidelines for coronary interventions from&#xD;
      2014. The FAME trail revealed that routine usage of FFR measurement decreased the costs of&#xD;
      coronary interventions over two years. The reasons are smaller quantity of implanted stents&#xD;
      and decreased number of procedures for in stent restenosis as a direct result of the lower&#xD;
      incidence of initial stent implantation. FAME-2 trial has shown lower incidence of urgent&#xD;
      revascularization in patients with FFR less than 0,8 treated by coronary intervention&#xD;
      compared to those treated conservatively. This study was preliminary halted before reaching&#xD;
      mortality endpoint for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical condition for proper FFR measurement is maximal vasodilatation. Since we do not have&#xD;
      marker for this condition based on pressure measurement only we can only presume that it was&#xD;
      reached by adenosine administration. There are a lot of limitations for this assumption.&#xD;
      Foremost, technique for proper intravenous and intracoronary adenosine administration must&#xD;
      follow strict rules and therefore can be done incorrectly and leads to wrong result in same&#xD;
      cases. Furthermore, impaired endothelial function leads to lower response to adenosine&#xD;
      administration. This situation can leads to false negative FFR result. The patients with CAD&#xD;
      have frequently significant endothelial dysfunction causing lower response to vasodilatation&#xD;
      stimuli. Endothelial dysfunction will be analyzed by a system named EndoPAT (Itamar Medical,&#xD;
      Israel) that measures ischemia induced vasodilatation on fingers. The hypothesis that has&#xD;
      never been tested is how polymorphism in genes for enzymes playing an important role in&#xD;
      proper endothelial function (HO-1, hemoxygenase-1 and ENOS, endothelial NO synthase) can&#xD;
      influences adenosine-induced vasodilatation and subsequently FFR measurement. These&#xD;
      polymorphisms are not infrequent in population with CAD (they can be found in 40-50% in such&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another possible limitation for FFR measurement is type of blood flow in coronary arteries.&#xD;
      In presence of coronary stenosis, plaque roughness or sharp angle of a lumen the type of flow&#xD;
      can be changed from laminar to turbulent. This type of flow is even accelerated during&#xD;
      hyperemia induced by adenosine administration. It leads to lose of energy and exaggerates&#xD;
      pressure drop behind stenosis that - for this reason- may not be proportional to stenosis&#xD;
      severity. This situation can theoretically causes false positive FFR measurement. To answer&#xD;
      this question the investigators will analyze the endothelial shear stress (ESS) that can&#xD;
      distinguish laminar and turbulent flow and morphological indices (plaque surface, plaque&#xD;
      eccentricity, lumen volume and lumen shape) by optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new index able to identify physiologically significant stenosis has been recently&#xD;
      described. It is instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR). This technique uses a pressure gradient&#xD;
      as well, but -unlike to FFR- iFR compares pressures (proximal and distal to stenosis) only in&#xD;
      a specific phase of diastole (so called &quot;wave free period&quot;), where microvascular resistance&#xD;
      is naturally low and stable .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cut off point for iFR is 0.9. The correlation between FFR and iFR is between 80% and 90%&#xD;
      in all lesions. However, the correlation between FFR and iFR close to their cut-off point is&#xD;
      only 50%-60%. It is substantial caveat, because to estimate hemodynamic significance of&#xD;
      borderline lesions is the main indication for these techniques. Discrepancies between FFR and&#xD;
      iFR can be very confusing a discouraging for lesion hemodynamic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, FFR is the only invasive method for stenosis hemodynamic assessment supported in&#xD;
      the guidelines. However, the iFR is faster, easier and cheaper, and for these reasons it can&#xD;
      be used for more lesions in more patients, which can improve the situation of poor&#xD;
      penetration of hemodynamic guidance for coronary intervention in daily practice. Moreover, an&#xD;
      increasing number of evidences implies that iFR concept can be closer to real situation in&#xD;
      coronary arteries (avoiding non-physiologic vasodilatation). It has been shown that FFR&#xD;
      itself has a factor of variability of 10%. This means that around the cut-off points the FFR&#xD;
      can be just as wrong as the iFR, perhaps even more so. Moreover, the latest study has shown&#xD;
      that iFR provides better pressure-derived diagnostic agreement with CFR (coronary flow&#xD;
      reserve) than FFR. The investigators have been developing, in close cooperation with The&#xD;
      University of Iowa, new technique that improves the quality of flow measurement. It was&#xD;
      successfully tested it in a animal trial. It is a novel way of intravascular Doppler signal&#xD;
      processing resulting in more reliable velocity curve envelope acquisition. This software&#xD;
      improvement allows instantaneous monitoring of real time microvascular resistance during any&#xD;
      phase of cardiac cycle. Detection of during instantaneous wave free period can serve as&#xD;
      verification of the proprietary iFR calculation. The system may also improve iFR measurement&#xD;
      itself, because it can measure precisely in-phase with the lowest microvascular resistance.&#xD;
      The measurement of resistance during wave free period is named iMR (instantaneous&#xD;
      microvascular resistance) and it has never been measured during previous trials. This index&#xD;
      can greatly help to distinguish which method (FFR or iFR) measures the pressure gradient&#xD;
      during lower resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further target is to develop next generation of the software that can detect lowest&#xD;
      microvascular resistance based on pressure measurement only, without necessity of using&#xD;
      Doppler. It could offer very precise and simple methods for hemodynamic assessment of&#xD;
      coronary lesions. This software must be tested and verified in a human study, which will be&#xD;
      done in the General Teaching Hospital (where both intracoronary pressure and flow will be&#xD;
      measured). Its clinical availability will be tested and verified by the international&#xD;
      cooperating centers (where only pressure indices, FFR and iFR will be measured). The foreign&#xD;
      centers will also examine coronary OCT that will be sent to corelab in The University of&#xD;
      Iowa, collect blood samples for genetic analysis that will be done in Prague and, depend on&#xD;
      their possibilities, also endothelial dysfunction by EndoPAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Iowa, Iowa, USA will analyze OCT measurement and perform 3D vessel&#xD;
      reconstruction. This university has a world known team for the unique 3D reconstruction of&#xD;
      coronary arteries based on angiography and optical coherence tomography. This institution&#xD;
      will do an automated analysis of plaque surfaces as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The level of microvascular resistance can be used to distinguish which type of&#xD;
           measurement (FFR or iFR) was done during the lower and more stable stage of&#xD;
           microvascular resistance. This comparison can possibly explain discrepancies between FFR&#xD;
           and iFR measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on new software, using pressure measurements only, it will be possible to&#xD;
           automatically detect the time period with the lowest microvascular resistance. This&#xD;
           could improve accuracy of both FFR and iFR measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Plaque ruptures, erosions, irregularities of plaque geometry and plaque located near to&#xD;
           bifurcations cause turbulence in blood flow. This accelerated pressure drop can lead to&#xD;
           a false positive FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inadequate vasodilation caused by endothelial dysfunction can lead to false negative&#xD;
           FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endothelial dysfunction can be more frequently found in patients with the risk type of&#xD;
           polymorphism in genes playing an important role in vessel vasodilatation (ENOS, HO-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND EXPECTED IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To use new software (developed at the author's workplace in cooperation with The&#xD;
           University of Iowa) to determine which of two methods for the functional assessment of&#xD;
           coronary stenosis (FFR and iFR) perform their measurements during a lower level of&#xD;
           microvascular resistance. This software can measure microvascular resistance in real&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop a new version of software for the detection of microvascular resistance&#xD;
           level, based only on intracoronary pressures without flow analysis. This could&#xD;
           substantially improve the accuracy of both pressure-based measurements, and potentially&#xD;
           increase the correlation between pressure based measurements and flow-based CFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the potential influence of endothelial dysfunction and plaque morphology on&#xD;
           discrepancies between FFR and iFR during functional assessments of coronary stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the influence of gene polymorphisms on endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design Patients with stable angina pectoris with suitable for coronary&#xD;
      angiography will be suitable for the study. We plan to include 250 patients to the study (50&#xD;
      from General University Hospital in Prague and 200 from cooperating centers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional examinations of coronary arteries. Coronary angiography will be performed as a&#xD;
      first procedure for detection of severity and extent of coronary atherosclerosis. Stenosis&#xD;
      between 40-80% (based on CAG) will be suitable for morphological and functional examinations.&#xD;
      Combo wire (Volcano Corp., USA) for pressure and flow measurement will be introduced behind&#xD;
      the lesion and basal indices will be measured during basal flow condition: basal flow speed,&#xD;
      pressure gradient (Pd/Pa), iFR, Pd/Pa during lowest microvascular resistance proven by&#xD;
      Doppler analysis, iMR. Adenosine will be administered either intracoronary as a bolus (240&#xD;
      ug) or in continual infusion (140 μg/kg/min) based on local practice. The hyperemic indices&#xD;
      will be measured: maximal flow speed, CFR, FFR, HSR (hyperemic stenosis resistance.&#xD;
      Cooperating centers will perform pressure measurements (FFR, iFR, Pd/Pa) only and they will&#xD;
      send a raw data for further analysis (off-line calculation of iFR using the new software) in&#xD;
      General Teaching Hospital in Prague.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological examinations of coronary arteries Morphological assessment of the lesions will&#xD;
      be done by OCT (St. Jude Medical, Inc). Catheter will be placed behind stenosis. Pullback&#xD;
      will be done during flushing of contrast dye. OCT measurement will help to choose optimal&#xD;
      treatment strategy by proper measuring of lumen size in a lesion and in the reference&#xD;
      segments. PCI will be done according to local practice. OCT can be use after procedure for&#xD;
      checking results, but this second examination is not part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More detail analyze will be done from 3D vessel reconstruction in The University of Iowa that&#xD;
      is well know center for 3D coronary reconstruction. Scientific team from this university have&#xD;
      received two US patents for 3D coronary reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of 3 D reconstruction of coronary arteries The two-plane angiograms will be&#xD;
      taken immediately prior to the pullback start and cover at least one heart cycle each. They&#xD;
      will be used to extract the catheter path automatically along the expected pullback&#xD;
      trajectory by a dynamic programming approach. From the known imaging geometry, an accurate&#xD;
      3-D model of the catheter path within the respective vessel segment is generated for&#xD;
      end-diastolic heart phase. For OCT acquisition, motorized pullback ensures a constant&#xD;
      pullback speed, thus allowing to asses each OCT image frame a specific location on the 3-D&#xD;
      catheter trajectory model. The relative and absolute orientations of the OCT frames will be&#xD;
      determined using previously reported system for establishing the absolute orientation in 3-D&#xD;
      on IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) images. Visualization will be based on automated encoding&#xD;
      of the derived contour data in VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). Quantitative data&#xD;
      can be derived from the contour data, such as luminal dimensions and plaque-cap thickness,&#xD;
      actually considering the vessel curvature in contrast to conventional OCT reconstruction&#xD;
      systems. The space between adjacent contours is interpolated to form a volume element. In&#xD;
      locations of the plaque cap, integrating over an entire vessel segment or any part thereof&#xD;
      yields the total plaque cap volume enclosed by the inner and outer cap surfaces. The&#xD;
      quantification values can be included into the VRML model by color per vertex encoding, thus&#xD;
      allowing an easy and fast visual assessment of the lesion or the results of the intervention&#xD;
      by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial shear stress analysis. A steady flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis&#xD;
      will be performed in the reconstructed arterial segments in order to analyze for the local&#xD;
      fluid dynamic characteristics along the vessel segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction will be measured by a system&#xD;
      named EndoPAT (Itamar Medical, Israel). EndoPAT uses peripheral artery tone signal (PAT) for&#xD;
      non-invasively measuring arterial tone changes in peripheral arterial beds17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis of polymorphisms in gene for HO-1 and ENOS Patient's DNA will be isolated&#xD;
      from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be prospectively stored in a database and will be processed&#xD;
      using the software JMP®10.0.0, Copyright © 2012 SAS (Statistical analysis software) Institute&#xD;
      Inc. (http://www.jmp.com) in collaboration with a professional statistician.&#xD;
