  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological stress and its sources differ among the population and can be reduced in&#xD;
      various ways. The practice of yoga has been shown to be an effective stress reducing agent.&#xD;
      IVF processes have also been shown to increase stress levels, particularly in patients with&#xD;
      multiple failed IVF cycles. Less is known about stress levels in patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      egg freezing for fertility preservation. The investigators demonstrated in a pilot project&#xD;
      that yoga postures with a yoga focused discussion session decreases stress in infertility&#xD;
      patients compared to controls. The goal of this study is to further explore the capability of&#xD;
      yoga practice to reduce stress in a specific subset of infertility patients, those with a&#xD;
      history of at least one failed IVF cycle and those undergoing elective oocyte&#xD;
      cryopreservation. Additionally, the investigators are aiming to understand which aspect of&#xD;
      the intervention (discussion vs. yoga) had the most impact and whether route of&#xD;
      administration of the intervention (in person vs online) effects results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although stress is likely not a cause of infertility, research has shown negative effects of&#xD;
      psychological stress on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. IVF processes have also been&#xD;
      shown to increase stress in infertility patients. Patients that have had failed at IVF cycles&#xD;
      are noted to have more stress. The practice of elective egg freezing is relatively new and&#xD;
      little is known on the psychological wellbeing of these patients as they start ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation for egg freezing. The practice of yoga has been shown to be an effective stress&#xD;
      reducing agent. The investigators demonstrated in a pilot project that yoga postures coupled&#xD;
      with a yoga focused discussion session decreases stress in infertility patients compared to&#xD;
      controls. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further explore this relationship and&#xD;
      determine which aspect of the intervention had the most impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include women with a history of at least one IVF failure or women&#xD;
      undergoing fertility preservation for elective egg freezing. The participants who elect to&#xD;
      include yoga as part of their infertility treatments will self select one of three treatment&#xD;
      groups: 1) In person yoga + discussion; 2) online yoga + discussion; 3) In person discussion&#xD;
      only. The investigators will also recruit non-yoga participators as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The yoga participants and controls will be asked to fill out two questionnaires: The&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI). STAI is a&#xD;
      widely used measure of trait anxiety (a person's disposition towards being anxious over time)&#xD;
      and state anxiety (how anxious a person feels at the present time). It is a 40-question&#xD;
      survey that uses a 4-point Likert scale per question. A score of 20 corresponds to low&#xD;
      anxiety and a score of 80 corresponds to high anxiety. It has been shown that higher anxiety&#xD;
      scores exist in the infertility population. Mean STAI scores in the infertility population&#xD;
      range between 30-50. The FPI is used as another tool for assessing a person's state anxiety&#xD;
      and has been found to better discriminate between general stress and infertility-related&#xD;
      stress. Participants will complete these at the beginning of participation and then again six&#xD;
      weeks later. The design of the study will include a pre-test and post-test analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to determine whether stress reduction is greater in those women that&#xD;
      participate in the yoga postures and discussion group when compared to those in the&#xD;
      discussion only group or controls. The secondary hypothesis is that reduction in stress will&#xD;
      be equivalent between online and in-person participators. Additional outcomes include an&#xD;
      assessment of whether age or other demographic factors influence baseline stress levels or&#xD;
      reduction in stress. The investigators also plan to examine whether the yoga participation&#xD;
      has any influence on ovarian stimulation or pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, baseline patient&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes regarding ovarian stimulation as well as&#xD;
      future pregnancy outcomes will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit at least 150 participants who are currently undergoing&#xD;
      in-vitro fertilization (IVF) at Fertility Centers of Illinois (FCI) and 150 patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective egg freezing for fertility preservation at FCI. Those 150 patients will&#xD;
      then be further subdivided into one of the three treatment groups mentioned above or the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, the participants interested in a treatment group involving yoga&#xD;
      postures will be evaluated including a review of medical history and an assessment of ability&#xD;
      to perform basic, gentle yoga without injury. All interventions will occur once weekly for a&#xD;
      total of six weeks. The participant will be expected to participate in at least five of the&#xD;
      six sessions in order to complete the study. If the participant is in the in person yoga +&#xD;
      discussion group, she will complete a Yoga for Fertility class Pulling Down the Moon: An&#xD;
      Integrative Center for Fertility which consists of a 30 minute discussion session followed by&#xD;
      a 60 minute Vinyasa style yoga class. If the participant is in the online yoga + discussion&#xD;
      group, she will attend an online webinar of the Yoga for Fertility class and engage in a home&#xD;
      yoga practice with the Pulling Down the Moon Yoga DVD. If the participant is in the&#xD;
      discussion only group, she will attend an in-person 30 minute discussion session at Pulling&#xD;
      Down the Moon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be using paired t-tests to compare mean pre-test and post-test scores&#xD;
      between groups and logistic regressions to evaluate the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
