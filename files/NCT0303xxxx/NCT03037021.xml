  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed project is to 1) increase co-management between sickle cell&#xD;
      specialists and primary care providers (PCP's); 2) increase the use of hydroxyurea (HU) which&#xD;
      prevents Vaso-Occlusive Episode (VOE), EDs and subsequent hospitalizations, and death; 3)&#xD;
      identify and link patients not receiving primary or SCD specialty care to care, and 4) shift&#xD;
      healthcare use from EDs and hospitalizations to primary and specialty co-management. Many&#xD;
      persons with SCD experience a poor quality of life, serious medical complications and&#xD;
      frequent painful events that require treatment from SCD specialty care, primary care and&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) providers. There are two dominating models of care in the United&#xD;
      States; neither are ideal. Many people with SCD have all of their healthcare needs addressed&#xD;
      by sickle cell specialists who do not typically provide primary care and are often&#xD;
      geographically distant from the patients' home. Other sickle cell patients receive all of&#xD;
      their care in EDs. Both models are inadequate and result in an alarmingly high number of ED&#xD;
      visits for many patients. Current care models are neither cost efficient nor promoting&#xD;
      optimal patient outcomes. To improve outcomes, the investigators will implement a new model&#xD;
      of care for SCD using nurse care managers, web based-interactive algorithms, and test if&#xD;
      additional patient provided coaching can improve outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To inform the model, the investigators will conduct an initial in-depth multi-level&#xD;
      assessment of the barriers to care and implementation of the NHLBI &quot;Evidence-Based Management&#xD;
      of Sickle Cell Disease&quot;. With barriers and facilitators identified at the patient, provider,&#xD;
      healthcare organization and community levels, the investigators will develop another study&#xD;
      evaluation interventions that may improve the barriers.&#xD;
