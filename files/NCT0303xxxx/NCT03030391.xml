      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new drug 18F-PF-06445974 has a little radioactivity. This can be seen by a positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scan. The drug helps researchers see a protein, PDE4B, in the&#xD;
      brain. Looking at PDE4B in the living brain might show how it is involved in psychiatric and&#xD;
      neurological disorders. One part of the study will look at how the study drug is distributed&#xD;
      in the brain. Another part will study how brain measures vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the protein PDE4B in the brain. To test how a new radioactive chemical,&#xD;
      18F-PF-06445974, is distributed in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1-3 visits over a year. Each will be 2-5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will have a pregnancy test each time.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) terminates signal transduction of guanine nucleotidebinding&#xD;
      proteins (G-protein)-coupled receptors by metabolizing the second messenger 3 &lt;=,5 &lt;=- cyclic&#xD;
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 is selective to cAMP over cyclic guanosine&#xD;
      monophosphate. PDE4 has four isozymes A, B, C, and D and basic studies indicate that type B&#xD;
      (PDE4B) plays a key role in cognitive function and neuroinflammation. Thus, PDE4B inhibitors&#xD;
      would be expected to improve cognitive function and have anti-inflammatory effects. Pfizer&#xD;
      has developed a new PET ligand, 18F-PF-06445974, to selectively image PDE4B; the ligand has&#xD;
      shown promising results in non-human primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol covers four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1: whole body imaging of one subject with a low injection activity of 2 mCi to&#xD;
           confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of 18F-PF-06445974;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2: kinetic brain imaging with up to 5 mCi injection to quantify PDE4B in brain&#xD;
           relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3: if 18F-PF-06445974 is successful in Phase 2 in the first couple of subjects, we&#xD;
           will estimate the radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging with 5 mCi&#xD;
           injection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase 4: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of the&#xD;
           parent radioligand in arterial plasma (5 mCi per scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 or older) will undergo brain imaging.&#xD;
      An additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis, for a&#xD;
      total of 30 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantification of 18F-PF-06445974, 22 healthy controls will undergo brain PET imaging&#xD;
      using 18F-PF-06445974 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight&#xD;
      additional subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial&#xD;
      line will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess quantitation of PDE4B with 18F-PF-06445974, we will primarily use two outcome&#xD;
      measures, namely the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume (VT)&#xD;
      calculated with compartmental modeling. In the test-retest study, we will calculate the&#xD;
      retest&#xD;
&#xD;
      variability. We will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-PF-06445974 by&#xD;
      calculating doses to organs and effective dose to the body.&#xD;
