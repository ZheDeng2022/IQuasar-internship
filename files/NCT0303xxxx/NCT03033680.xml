      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To determine the presence and regional distribution of microglial activation, as&#xD;
      assessed by [F-18]PBR06 PET, in subjects with MSA as compared to healthy controls, at&#xD;
      baseline and at 9 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the relationship between microglial activation and clinical progression at baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The working hypothesis is that there is microglial activation in Multiple System&#xD;
      Atrophy and that the presence and regional distribution of microglial activation is different&#xD;
      in MSA versus healthy controls and correlates with disease severity and comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen subjects with a probable MSA diagnosis will be recruited for this study. A probable&#xD;
      MSA diagnosis will be based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic failure involving urinary incontinence (inability to control the release of&#xD;
           urine form the bladder, with erectile dysfunction in males) or an orthostatic decrease&#xD;
           of blood pressure within 3 min of standing by at least 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mm Hg&#xD;
           diastolic and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poorly levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism (bradykinesia with rigidity, tremor, or postural&#xD;
           instability) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cerebellar syndrome (gait ataxia with cerebellar dysarthria, limb ataxia, or&#xD;
           cerebellar oculomotor dysfunction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited during routine clinical appointments by their physician or one of&#xD;
      the other co-investigators listed on the protocol at the Movement Disorders Clinic, 60&#xD;
      Fenwood Road, Boston, MA. Once the subject gives the informed consent, investigators will be&#xD;
      administering standardized questionnaires for assessment of disease severity, comorbidities&#xD;
      and/or presence of symptoms, as applicable to a given cohort. In addition, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be drawn for genotype testing to identify high affinity, medium affinity, and low&#xD;
      affinity binders. Any subjects identified as low affinity binders will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo two PET scans with [F-18]PBR06 at BWH PET scanning facility at 75&#xD;
      Francis Street, Boston, MA. For PET scanning, an intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted&#xD;
      for injection of tracer. In addition, prior to the tracer injection, a second IV catheter may&#xD;
      be inserted into the other arm or hand vein on the contralateral side for blood sampling. To&#xD;
      increase the usefulness of blood sampling for radiotracer analysis, the hand or arm used for&#xD;
      blood sampling may be wrapped in an electrical warmer with the thermostat set at 44Â°C for&#xD;
      approximately 5-10 minutes.The whole PET session will last approximately 120 min. At the time&#xD;
      of imaging, the subjects will be positioned in the gantry of a PET camera. A head support&#xD;
      will be used to minimize head motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side Effects Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No side effects from the radiopharmaceutical are expected. The dose of radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      being administered in this study is below that at which investigators would expect any&#xD;
      effect, including physical dependence and addiction. There will be a follow up phone call&#xD;
      within 24-72 hours after the PET scans, and again 2 weeks after the PET scans to ensure the&#xD;
      subject has not suffered from any side effects. Subjects will be exposed to a small amount of&#xD;
      radiation. The radiotracer will be prepared in such a way as to ensure that it is sterile and&#xD;
      pyrogen free, and its radiochemical purity (RCP) will be determined using Silica Gel-Instant&#xD;
      Thin Layer Chromatography and/or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition,&#xD;
      because [F-18]PBR06 is a non-FDA approved radioligand, it's use for this study will be&#xD;
      reviewed by Radioactive Drugs Research Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject monitoring during PET scans will be performed using a 2-way intercom system between&#xD;
      the scanner operator and subject and by visual monitoring of the subject through the window&#xD;
      into the scan room (the subject is visible to the operator at all times).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will need to lie still in the PET camera for period of 120 min, and subjects may&#xD;
      find it uncomfortable to remain still over this time. Therefore, as mentioned above, subjects&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to take a break for up to 15 minutes after 45 minutes of PET&#xD;
      scanning, following which the last 60 minutes of scanning will be completed. A standard&#xD;
      head-support device will be used to make the subjects comfortable during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects find an intravenous catheter or duration of scanning too uncomfortable, they are&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians at Movement Disorders clinic may present the study to a subject during a regular&#xD;
      scheduled clinic visit. If the subject is interested in the study, a copy of the consent form&#xD;
      will be given. Established Movement Disorders clinic patients may be sent a recruitment&#xD;
      letter describing the study and a copy of the consent document. Interested subjects are&#xD;
      directed to contact research staff via a telephone number provided in the letter for&#xD;
      participation in the study. At the time of the subject's initial screening visit, a licensed&#xD;
      physician investigator will answer any questions the subject may have regarding the study and&#xD;
      subsequently obtain informed consent. In accordance with NIH guidelines, efforts will be made&#xD;
      to attain a mix of study participants, in terms of gender and racial/ethnic representation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the subjects by a licensed physician investigator on&#xD;
      the study protocol. Existing Movement Disorders clinic subjects may be sent a letter&#xD;
      describing the study and a copy of the consent document. Patients of the clinic may be&#xD;
      introduced to the study through fliers posted throughout the clinic. For the PI's own&#xD;
      patients, the recruitment letter will be sent several weeks before inquiring about their&#xD;
      interest in the study and/or a clinic nurse or a colleague listed on the IRB will introduce&#xD;
      the study using the IRB-approved flier in order to avoid the potential for coercion.&#xD;
      Interested subjects are directed to contact research staff via a telephone number provided in&#xD;
      the letter and on the fliers inviting participation in the study to set up a screening visit.&#xD;
      They will have the opportunity to discuss the study with research study staff prior to giving&#xD;
      consent as outlined above. Subjects approached for participation in the study during a&#xD;
      routine clinical visit will have the opportunity to participate in the study at that time or&#xD;
      they may choose to return for participation at another time in the future. All subjects will&#xD;
      be informed that they are free to withdraw consent from the study at any time without&#xD;
      affecting the quality or type of care that they receive at BWH. Subjects will be informed&#xD;
      that they may not qualify for the study if their genetic analysis reveals that they are low&#xD;
      affinity binders for TSPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, subjects will be followed by their clinical neurologists for adverse&#xD;
      events and disease progression. If problems are reported to their physicians, they will&#xD;
      receive care as is normally performed. In addition, the PI will review all laboratory results&#xD;
      of tests undergone by the subjects during the study period and help co-ordinate any necessary&#xD;
      care with patient's primary providers.&#xD;
