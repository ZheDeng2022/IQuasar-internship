  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a clinical trial to study the performance of a high strength&#xD;
      ceramic material for bridges to replace missing teeth. The ceramic material has been approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for patient treatment. A computer technique will be used to make the bridges. The&#xD;
      bridges will be cemented using an adhesive resin cement (MultiLink Automix/Ivoclar). The&#xD;
      bridges are planned be evaluated for clinical performance at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3&#xD;
      years, and if funding permits, 4 years, and 5 years. The purpose of the study is to measure&#xD;
      how well the high strength bridges function over an extended period of time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be composed of 30 bridges placed in adult patients that have been identified&#xD;
      as requiring replacement of a single tooth. All the bridges will be made from the same high&#xD;
      strength ceramic material (emaxCAD/Ivoclar) using a computer to make the entire bridge. All&#xD;
      the crowns will be cemented using the most current marketed version of the manufacturer's&#xD;
      adhesive resin cement (MultiLink Automix/Ivoclar). At each recall appointment an evaluation&#xD;
      of the bridge will be completed as well as clinical photographs, an intraoral digital scan,&#xD;
      and impression of the bridge. The purpose of the study is to measure how well the high&#xD;
      strength bridges function over an extended period of time.&#xD;

    <measure>Bridge loss of retention</measure>

    <measure>Tooth sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the bridge up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient described tooth sensitivity on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means absence of sensitivity (pain) and four means severe discomfort noted routinely with cold or pressure stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Margin staining</measure>
    <time_frame>from delivery of the bridge up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Margin staining is categorized based on modified US Public Health Service criteria using a four point scale where 1 is no staining and 4 is penetrating stain involving more than 50% of the margin of each of the abutment teeth.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  missing one anterior or premolar tooth that is appropriate for replacement with a&#xD;
             bridge. The second premolar tooth will be the most distal tooth acceptable as a pontic&#xD;
             for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy periodontal status for the adjacent abutment teeth with 1:1 crown:root ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  abutment teeth must be asymptomatic prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endodontically treated teeth will be acceptable for abutments as long as nonmetallic&#xD;
             cores can be placed to retain the FPD since the lithium disilicate will be bonded to&#xD;
             the abutments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no more than one bridge will be placed per patient. If a patient presents with more&#xD;
             than one missing teeth acceptable for the study, premolar teeth will be included prior&#xD;
             to anterior teeth. Each bridge will be three units and include only one missing tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  sensitive abutment teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  teeth with a history of direct or indirect pulp capping procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with significant untreated dental disease to include periodontitis and caries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with allergies to any material in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients unable to return for recall appointments&#xD;
