      Annually, the Department of Anesthesiology, Siriraj hospital has responsibilities to take&#xD;
      care of more than 50,000 patients peri-operatively. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs;&#xD;
      human's pleasure is classified as physiological, safety, belonging, esteem and&#xD;
      self-actualization. Since defining and measuring quality of healthcare service is an&#xD;
      inevitable challenge for all institutes in medical fields, a questionnaire is developed to&#xD;
      assess the quality of all services. The Siriraj Anesthesia Quality Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (Si-2-AQ), a simply 40-item tool in seven dimensions, comprises Accessibility and&#xD;
      convenience, Communication and Information, Process of care, Technical Quality, Psychological&#xD;

      Anesthesia service is the medical specialty that focuses on peri-operative medicine and the&#xD;
      administration of anesthetics. It expresses traditionally as the conditions of no pain&#xD;
      perception during surgical procedure. This includes three broad categories: 1) General&#xD;
      Anesthesia is a medically induced state of unconsciousness with loss of protective reflexes;&#xD;
      2) Sedation is a state of irritability or agitation reduction to facilitate a medical or&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure; and 3) Regional Anesthesia is a technique to abolish either or both&#xD;
      motor and sensory sensitivity in a specific part of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok is a tertiary, general hospital with more than&#xD;
      2,200 beds. Annually, the Department of Anesthesiology has responsibilities to take care of&#xD;
      more than 50,000 patients peri-operatively. Currently, it plays a part in many surgical&#xD;
      departments: Traumatic surgery (TRAU); Orthopedics surgery (ORT); Eye surgery (EYE); Ear,&#xD;
      Nose and Throat surgery (ENT); Plastics surgery (PLA); Cardio-thoracic surgery (CVT);&#xD;
      Neurosurgery (NEU); General surgery (GEN), Urological surgery (URO); Head and Neck surgery&#xD;
      (H&amp;N); Pediatric surgery (PED); Obstetrics surgery (OBG); Gynecological surgery (GYN);&#xD;
      Electro-convulsive therapy (PSY); Radiological services (RAD); Endoscopic center (SCOP);&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU); Acute Pain service (APS); Pain Clinic (PC); and Pre-Anesthesia&#xD;
      Assessment Center (SiPAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs; human's pleasure is classified as physiological,&#xD;
      safety, belonging, esteem and self-actualization. Likewise, patients' satisfaction seems to&#xD;
      cover all these aspects; since participants crave for an excellent healthcare services. As a&#xD;
      result, their contentment become a crucial factor to determine the quality of care&#xD;
      particularly in Anesthesia procedure. This includes many processes in peri-Anesthesia&#xD;
      management such as patient safety in operating theater, pain controlling and mutually&#xD;
      convenient inter-relationship, etc. To solve these procedural running by means of patients'&#xD;
      desires, a quality survey seems to be a promising tool that right on the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since defining and measuring quality of healthcare service is an inevitable challenge for all&#xD;
      institutes in medical fields, many organizations try to work out intensively. Currently,&#xD;
      there are many leading quality assessment tools in healthcare services, namely Hospital&#xD;
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System (HCAHPS), Patient Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PSQ), Service Quality Questionnaire (SERVQUAL), Quality of Recover after&#xD;
      anesthesia 40 (QoR-40), Post-operative Quality of Recovery Questionnaire and Developing and&#xD;
      Testing Questionnaire. These tests have been already verified for its validity and&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCAHPS a 33-item survey in three dimensions, comprises nurse and doctor communication,&#xD;
      medical communication, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, discharge&#xD;
      information, care transition 17 items; cleanliness and quietness of hospital environment 2&#xD;
      items; as well as overall rating of hospital and willingness to recommend hospital 2 items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSQ an 18-item questionnaire in seven dimensions, consists of general satisfaction, technical&#xD;
      quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor as&#xD;
      well as accessibility and convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SERVQUAL a questionnaire related to hospital services in five dimensions, is composed of&#xD;
      tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoR-40 a 40-item questionnaire concerning good quality recovery after anesthesia and surgery,&#xD;
      includes emotional states, physical and physiological support, physical independence and pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the previously mentioned; investigators, therefore, would like to develop a&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess the quality of our services. The Siriraj Anesthesia Quality&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (Si-2-AQ), a simply 40-item tool in seven dimensions, comprises&#xD;
      Accessibility and convenience (5 items), Communication and Information (10 items), Process of&#xD;
      care (8 items), Technical Quality (9 items) Psychological support (4 items) Physical support&#xD;
      (2 items) and Royalty (2 items).&#xD;

        A developed and validated questionnaire will be studied in 450 patients as target group (4&#xD;
        months). Post-operatively, a nurse anesthetist visits a patient to explain the details of&#xD;
        the study and ask for consent. Afterwards, a participant responses to a questionnaire&#xD;
        privately (10 minutes). Co-investigators collect data in a computer file. A statistician&#xD;
        who not involved in the study analyzes the data.&#xD;
