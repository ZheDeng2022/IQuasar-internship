      This study aims to assess the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on airway smooth muscle&#xD;
      (ASM) Na+, K+ pumps in patients with asthma.We wish to investigate differences in Na+, K+&#xD;
      pump content in healthy versus asthmatic patients, whether a reduction in airway&#xD;
      hyper-responsiveness observed in asthmatic patients treated with ICS is attributable to an&#xD;
      increase in Na+, K+ pump content in ASM cells and compare this in patients with&#xD;
      non-eosinophilic asthma versus eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;

      Purpose and background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids and asthma phenotypes Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is a cornerstone&#xD;
      in the treatment of asthma. ICS acts locally in the airways through several pathways to limit&#xD;
      inflammation, primarily through reduction of eosinophilic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice however a substantial part of adult patients with asthma have no&#xD;
      eosinophilic inflammation in the airways despite reduced lung function and increased&#xD;
      contractility of the smooth muscles in the airways i.e., airway hyperresponsiveness(AHR).&#xD;
      This group of patients with non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA) represents up to 50 % of adult&#xD;
      asthmatics with even higher occurrence among patients referred to a specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of ICS in NEA is debated but despite lack of eosinophilic inflammation, ICS has&#xD;
      been shown to significantly reduce AHR in patients with NEA, suggesting mechanistic pathways&#xD;
      different from reduction in eosinophilic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway smooth muscle and inhaled corticosteroids Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is the most&#xD;
      abundant tissue type in the airways. It plays a crucial part in the pathogenesis of asthma&#xD;
      and serves as an important target for therapy especially with β-adrenergic agents and to some&#xD;
      extent anti-muscarinic agents, counteracting bronchoconstriction. However also ICS has been&#xD;
      proposed to have direct action on ASM cells affecting contractility through reduction of&#xD;
      intracellular Ca2+ or down regulation of membrane bound receptors as well as through limiting&#xD;
      cellular proliferation and secretory function. The bronchodilating effect of β-adrenergic&#xD;
      agents has in animal models shown to be potentiated by administration of corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids and the Na+, K+ pump Both ICS and systemically administered&#xD;
      prednisone has been shown to increase Na+, K+ pump activity in leucocytes from patients with&#xD;
      asthma and in both rats and humans systemically administered corticosteroid increases the&#xD;
      amount of Na+, K+ pumps in striated muscle by 20-40 % and 30-60 % respectively. We have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated a similar effect with ICS where a therapeutically relevant daily dose&#xD;
      of 1600 μg budesonide, administered in the respiratory tract by inhalation, increased the&#xD;
      amount of Na+, K+ pumps in striated muscle by 17 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.4 The Na+, K+ pump and airway smooth muscle The Na+, K+ pump creates an inward Na+&#xD;
      current by removing Na+ from the intracellular lumen of cells. This may drive extrusion of&#xD;
      Ca2+ from the lumen of the ASM cells through the Na+, Ca2+ exchanger lowering intracellular&#xD;
      Ca2+ concentration. Since Ca2+ plays a central role in smooth muscle contraction, lower&#xD;
      intracellular concentrations may protect against bronchoconstriction as well as the contrary&#xD;
      might reinforce AHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies have demonstrated disturbances in leucocyte Na+, K+ pump activity and&#xD;
      increased intracellular Na+ in patients with hyperreactivity and asthma. Likewise in vitro&#xD;
      studies of human bronchial muscle have shown increased AHR and concentrations of&#xD;
      intracellular Ca2+ as well as decreased β-adrenergic induced relaxation of human bronchial&#xD;
      muscle when Na+, K+ pumps are blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoconstriction and airway remodeling are universal features of asthma and especially&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction can to some extent be related to proposed disturbances in Na+, K+ pump&#xD;
      activity and positive effects of ICS besides being anti-inflammatory is therefore suspected&#xD;
      to be beneficial independent of cellular patterns. However the non-inflammatory effect might&#xD;
      be more evident in patients with NEA since it is not blurred by the anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      seen in patients with EA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have assessed the effect of ICS on ASM Na+, K+ pumps in patients with asthma. In&#xD;
      the present study the investigators wish to study differences in Na+, K+ pump content in&#xD;
      healthy versus asthmatic patients, whether a reduction in AHR observed in asthmatic patients&#xD;
      treated with ICS is attributable to an increase in Na+, K+ pump content in ASM cells and&#xD;
      compare this in patients with NEA versus EA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This results in a study in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. A comparison of the level of Na+, K+ pumps in ASM in patients with asthma vs healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. A description of the association between changes in Na+, K+ pump content in ASM and&#xD;
      change in AHR after ICS in patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Study part I: The amount of ASM Na+, K+ pumps are lower in adult patients with&#xD;
      asthma compared to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part II: The reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness in adult patients with asthma&#xD;
      after treatment with ICS is related to an increase in the content of Na+, K+ pumps in ASM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We further hypothesize that the association between the increase in Na+, K+ pumps in ASM and&#xD;
      the change in AHR after ICS treatment is strongest in NEA versus EA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Study part I: To describe differences in ASM content of Na+, K+ pumps among healthy&#xD;
      subjects and patients with NEA or EA respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part II: To describe the correlation between increase in ASM content of Na+, K+ pumps&#xD;
      and reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol after six weeks of daily inhalation&#xD;
      of glucocorticoid, in patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Asthma is common and may be difficult to treat, especially the non-eosinophilic&#xD;
      phenotype. This study aims to increase our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in asthma,&#xD;
      unrelated to inflammatory pathways. This may lead towards a shift from the current paradigm&#xD;
      of asthma as a purely inflammatory condition, creating novel understanding of the role of ion&#xD;
      transport regulation in the pathogenesis and treatment of asthma, ultimately revealing&#xD;
      targets for novel treatments.&#xD;
