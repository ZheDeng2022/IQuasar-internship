      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of dendritic cell therapy,&#xD;
      cryosurgery and pembrolizumab in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Vaccines, such&#xD;
      as dendritic cell therapy made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may help the&#xD;
      body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Cryosurgery kills cancer cells&#xD;
      by freezing them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving dendritic cell therapy, cryosurgery and pembrolizumab may work&#xD;
      better at treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the optimal dose schedule, safety and tolerability as measured by the incidence&#xD;
      of significant toxicity of combination therapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      cryoablation, and intra-tumor injection of autologous dendritic cell into the cryoablated&#xD;
      tumor. (Phase I) II. Test the efficacy (overall response rate) of combination therapy with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, cryoablation, and intra-tumor injection of autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cell vaccine. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the feasibility of this combination immunotherapy. (Phase I) II. Evaluate patient&#xD;
      quality of life. (Phase I) III. Evaluate the partial response (PR) and complete response (CR)&#xD;
      rate of this combination immunotherapy. (Phase II) IV. Evaluate the progression free&#xD;
      survival, treatment free survival, duration of response, disease-free rate at 2 years, and&#xD;
      overall survival of this combination immunotherapy. (Phase II) V. Evaluate the safety of this&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the effect of combination immunotherapy on patients' immune status and anti-tumor&#xD;
      immune response. (Phase II) II. Assess the potential association between PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2&#xD;
      expression in tumor and blood with clinical efficacy. (Phase II) III. Assess the potential&#xD;
      association between tumor antigen mutations and antigen-specific immune response with&#xD;
      clinical efficacy. (Phase II) IV. Evaluate patient quality of life. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      also receive dendritic cell therapy intratumorally (IT) on days 2, 8, and 15 of cycles 2 and&#xD;
      3, and day 2 of cycles 4 and 5. Patients undergo cryosurgery on day 2 of cycle 2 and receive&#xD;
      pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine by injection on day 2 of cycles 2-5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) after completion of&#xD;
      therapy, may receive pembrolizumab for an additional 18 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months during the first&#xD;
      year post-treatment, every 4 months during the second year post-treatment, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

Each of the correlative endpoints will be summarized individually, but will also be evaluated in terms of their relationships to one another; i.e., will use Spearman rank correlation coefficient to assess the correlations between baseline levels as well as between changes before and after treatment in these immunologic markers. In addition, these immunologic markers will be correlated with cancer and treatment- related outcomes (e.g. response, toxicities). Relationships will also be explored graphically using scatter plots.</description>
