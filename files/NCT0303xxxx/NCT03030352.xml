    <textblock>
      The objectives of the How-to parenting program are 1) to improve optimal parenting style, and&#xD;
      2) to foster children mental health (i.e. decrease in internalized and externalized problems,&#xD;
      and well-being). The investigators expect that parents assigned to experimental groups will&#xD;
      show improvements in parenting over time (i.e improvements in parental affiliation, parental&#xD;
      structure and parental attitude toward autonomy), whereas parents in control groups will not&#xD;
      show such improvements (i.e., stable or declining parenting quality). The investigators also&#xD;
      expect children of parents in experimental groups to experience improvements in child mental&#xD;
      health (i.e., fewer internalized and externalized psychological problems and increased&#xD;
      well-being), whereas children whose parents are on the wait list will not show improvements&#xD;
      over time (i.e., stable or deteriorating mental health and well-being).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raising children is a fundamental yet challenging task. While parents are highly invested in&#xD;
      their children's development, they also have a vast influence on it. Indeed, among&#xD;
      environmental factors, the most widely accepted predictor of children mental health is&#xD;
      parenting quality. Research has shown that optimal parenting is composed of three key&#xD;
      dimensions: structure, autonomy support, and affiliation (vs. permissiveness, psychological&#xD;
      control, rejection). For parents, providing all three key &quot;nutriments&quot; is not necessarily&#xD;
      natural or easy. Indeed, it can be challenging to (1) require children to adopt socially&#xD;
      desirable behaviors (2) without thwarting their need for self-determination, (3) while&#xD;
      preserving a positive parent-child relationship. In addition, available parenting resources&#xD;
      (e.g., diverse parenting books) are sometimes contradictory, abstract, and rarely tap all&#xD;
      three important parenting dimensions. Providing the general population with concrete and&#xD;
      complete parenting education is essential in helping parents with their important yet&#xD;
      challenging role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate a parenting program (i.e., How-to program)&#xD;
      that addresses all three key dimensions of optimal parenting. This program is congruent with&#xD;
      basic developmental research and with knowledge from decades of motivation research devoted&#xD;
      to autonomy support and self-determination theory. The objectives of the How-to parenting&#xD;
      program are 1) to improve optimal parenting style, and 2) to foster children mental health&#xD;
      (i.e. decrease child' internal and external problems, and increase child' well-being). The&#xD;
      investigators expect that parents assigned to experimental groups will show improvements in&#xD;
      parenting over time, whereas parents in control groups will not show such improvements (i.e.,&#xD;
      stable or declining parenting quality). The investigators also expect children of parents in&#xD;
      experimental groups to experience improvements in mental health, whereas children whose&#xD;
      parents are on the wait list will not show improvements over time (i.e., stable or&#xD;
      deteriorating mental health and well-being).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will recruit participants and conduct the study in four schools per year,&#xD;
      during four years. The How-to parenting program will be offered to parents of grade school&#xD;
      children (5 to 12 years old). Grade schools will be recruited through Montreal school boards.&#xD;
      Only one parent per family may participate in the study. If parents have more than one child&#xD;
      in grade school, they will be asked to identify the one who is closest to 9 years of age and&#xD;
      then answer questionnaires about this &quot;targeted&quot; child. The seven-week parenting program will&#xD;
      be offered to the experimental groups (one per school) each spring (Years 1 to 4). Each of&#xD;
      these 4 experimental groups will be paired with a wait list control group from the same&#xD;
      school. Parents from these control groups will be offered the program the following year&#xD;
      (Years 2 to 5). In total, 256 parents from different families (mothers or fathers) will be&#xD;
      recruited in participating schools (16 parents [8 in experimental group + 8 in control group]&#xD;
      in each of 4 schools, for 4 years). This sample size was chosen to achieve adequate power,&#xD;
      while keeping the study feasible given participation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The How-to program highlights the importance of structure and teaches parents how to provide&#xD;
      it. Parents learn how to communicate expectations, give feedback, follow through with logical&#xD;
      consequences and use problem solving for recurrent problems. In addition, the program&#xD;
      perfectly captures what it means to be autonomy-supportive. Moreover, this style helps&#xD;
      children feel better about the rules and about themselves. These new skills empower parents&#xD;
      to exert their authority with confidence and, importantly, without guilt. Parents are then&#xD;
      more apt at providing structure effectively and consistently. With the How-to Parenting&#xD;
      program, parents learn how to listen and respond to their children in a way that helps&#xD;
      children feel loved and accepted for who they are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The How-to parenting program consists of seven 2 ½-hour weekly sessions. It is a manual-based&#xD;
      program in which participants have their own exercise booklet containing parenting skills and&#xD;
      exercises. Groups are led by 2 group leaders and formed of 6 to 10 parents. The format of&#xD;
      this program optimizes learning by (1) linking group content with parents' needs, (2)&#xD;
      facilitating awareness with perspective taking activities, (3) offering concrete parenting&#xD;
      skills, (4) modeling the skills and providing practice in a predictable and non-judgmental&#xD;
      environment, (5) emphasizing the importance of implementing these skills at home for long&#xD;
      term behavioral change, and (6) offering tools (i.e., exercise booklet, skill summary) that&#xD;
      facilitate information retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents and children will complete the same questionnaires before randomization&#xD;
      (baseline), after the seven-week program (post-test), and again at 6-month and 1-year follow&#xD;
      ups to assess change over time. Data will also be collected from targeted children's&#xD;
      teachers. These teacher reports will be collected at school, at each assessment point. At&#xD;
      follow ups, teacher reports will be provided by participating children's new teachers (i.e.,&#xD;
      in October and April of the 2nd school year). All measures (except for the control variables)&#xD;
      are included at all four assessment times to allow change measurement. The investigators will&#xD;
      adopt an intent-to-treat approach, as this approach increases external and internal validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting style measures were reviewed and selected to best reflect recent conceptualizations&#xD;
      of the three key parenting dimensions and to do so with the least overlap. Affiliation&#xD;
      (Parental Bonding Instrument), structure (Parenting Scale), and attitude toward autonomy&#xD;
      (How-to Parenting Skill Scale; Parental Autonomy Support Scale (P-PASS)) are assessed by&#xD;
      parents and children. Child mental health will be assessed using a multi-source approach&#xD;
      (parent, teacher and child reports). Parents will rate their child's internalized and&#xD;
      externalized psychological problems (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL). Teachers are asked to&#xD;
      evaluate children's classroom and social problems (Teacher-Child Rating Scale; TCRS). The&#xD;
      problem subscales of the TCRS assess internalized (I-) and externalized-(E-) problems.&#xD;
      Teachers will also complete the competencies subscales of the TCRS, which evaluate&#xD;
      socio-emotional competencies (i.e., frustration tolerance, task orientation and social&#xD;
      skills).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present data, baseline, post-test, and 6-month and 1-year follow up measures are&#xD;
      nested within a parent, who are nested within a parenting group. To evaluate change over&#xD;
      time, the four assessment points (baseline, post-test, 6-month follow up, and 12-month follow&#xD;
      up) will be treated as repeated measures using a piecewise growth hierarchical linear&#xD;
      modelling (HLM). These analyses are chosen because they model change between each subsequent&#xD;
      time points, which allows for rates of change to differ across time. HLM models are&#xD;
      recommended for intervention studies in order to capture rates of change both in the&#xD;
      intervention period and in the follow up periods. The effect of the parenting program will be&#xD;
      evidenced by significant interactions between rates of change and experimental conditions.&#xD;
      These interactions should reveal that optimal parenting components (H1) and child mental&#xD;
      health indicators (H2) increase over time for participants in the experimental condition, but&#xD;
      not for participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By including all three dimensions of optimal, authoritative parenting, the How-to program&#xD;
      stands in contrast to the majority of existing parenting training programs. In general, most&#xD;
      interventions target children already showing behavioral problems or considered at risk and&#xD;
      focus on behavior management strategies such as planned ignoring or reinforcement. Results&#xD;
      from a recent meta-analysis provide support for the adoption of a program that encompasses&#xD;
      all of the three essential dimensions of optimal parenting. Indeed, results showed that&#xD;
      programs' components that were predictive of larger effects pertained to autonomy support,&#xD;
      affiliation and structure. Though no formal evaluation of the How-to program has been made,&#xD;
      one early study suggested that it was associated with better familial climate and parenting&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is a first step toward implementing and evaluating a parenting program tailored&#xD;
      to the promotion of children's mental health. By improving parenting, it can ameliorate&#xD;
      children's life-course trajectories, thereby reducing mental health problems and their&#xD;
      associated costs. By offering parenting groups, this research project includes a significant&#xD;
      knowledge transfer component that will directly impact parents enrolled in the program.&#xD;
      Dissemination of findings will be made in schools, by giving school principals, teachers and&#xD;
      parents an easy-to-read summary of results. If the present randomized controlled trial and&#xD;
      following replication trials are successful, a wider dissemination/evaluation trial will be&#xD;
      implemented, making the program widely available to parents.&#xD;
