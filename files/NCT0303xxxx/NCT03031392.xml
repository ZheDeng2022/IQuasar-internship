    <textblock>
      Bleeding on probing demonstrated to have high specificity with certain level of sensitivity&#xD;
      to detect periodontal disease. Again, understanding the weak hemidesmosome attachment to the&#xD;
      implant surface is imperative to discern on the probe penetration extent and subsequent&#xD;
      bleeding. In the presence of inflammation, bleeding should be present indicating high&#xD;
      sensitivity when probing deeper sites; nevertheless the lack thereof in healthy condition&#xD;
      does not seem to translate high specificity. In this sense, it is noteworthy to mention that&#xD;
      the mucogingival shift after implant placement often decreases the presence of keratinized&#xD;
      mucosa, triggering a greater inflammatory condition on the peri-implant tissues. Thereupon,&#xD;
      bleeding on probing, although might reliably indicate presence of disease, it does not seem&#xD;
      to be a suitable diagnostic parameter. On the other side, suppuration characterizes the&#xD;
      necrosis of peri-implant tissues, being rich in polymorphonuclear cells and as such, a&#xD;
      sensitive indicator of bone turnover. In this sense, it must be noted that, if detected in&#xD;
      early stages where bone resorption has not occurred yet, it might be a consequence of a&#xD;
      foreign body reaction (i.e., residual cement or floss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the diagnosis of peri-implantitis, radiographic examination must be always&#xD;
      incorporated to the clinical assessment as the 'gold standard'. Hence, the aim of this&#xD;
      case-control study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of peri-implantitis-related clinical&#xD;
      parameters compared to otherwise healthy dental implants.&#xD;

      All subjects enrolled had to be consecutively evaluated in a routine peri-implant maintenance&#xD;
      t with dental implants for fixed prosthesis rehabilitation with a minimum period of 12 months&#xD;
      after final prosthesis delivery. Patients were contacted and informed to participate in a&#xD;
      cross-sectional assessment to identify the presence of peri-implant diseases. Eligible&#xD;
      implants had to be in an ideal prosthetically driven position, otherwise they were excluded&#xD;
      from the analysis. Moreover, implants that could not be accurately recorded the probing depth&#xD;
      due to inadequate prosthesis design were further excluded. Baseline periapical x-ray at time&#xD;
      of prosthesis delivery was retrospective assessed to exclude implants with early peri-implant&#xD;
      bone loss before function. A detailed description of risk factors and indicators of&#xD;
      peri-implant disease were explained at the same stage. Additionally, patients were thoroughly&#xD;
      instructed on plaque control home care strategies including but not limited to interdental&#xD;
      brushes with nylon-coated core wire, soft toothbrushes (manual and power) and floss with&#xD;
      stiffened end to clean under multiple units fixed-prosthesis. Moreover, treated patients were&#xD;
      encouraged to routinely enroll in a peri-implant maintenance therapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present case-control study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration&#xD;
      of human studies and received approval from the ethics committee from the University of&#xD;
      Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain). An informed written consent was signed from each subject&#xD;
      enrolled in the present study.&#xD;

        Patients will be either approached during their biannual peri-implant maintenance recall&#xD;
        appointment or contacted and asked to participate in a free clinical and radiographic&#xD;
        examination to identify the possible presence of peri-implant pathology.&#xD;
