    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) in non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) participants with underlying&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to&#xD;
      treat people who have non-end-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with underlying&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study will look at changes in fibrosis staging in&#xD;
      people who take vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 258 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups in ratio 1:1:1-which will&#xD;
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an&#xD;
      urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg once every 8 weeks (Q8W)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has&#xD;
           no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be administered vedolizumab or placebo via intravenous infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is up to 124 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with No Worsening in Ishak Fibrosis Staging Score from Baseline to Week 106 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments will be performed from liver biopsies with histology assessed by 2 independent blinded central readers for Ishak fibrosis staging score. Ishak fibrosis staging scoring is as follows: 0=No fibrosis, 1=Fibrous expansion of some portal areas with or without septa, 2=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with or without septa, 3=Fibrous expansion of most portal areas with occasional portal to portal bridging, 4=Fibrous expansion of portal areas with marked bridging (portal to portal and/or portal to central), 5=Marked bridging with occasional nodules (incomplete cirrhosis), 6=Cirrhosis, probable or definitive. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Ishak Necroinflammatory Grading Score from Baseline to the Week 106 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments will be performed from liver biopsies with histology assessed by 2 independent blinded central readers for Ishak fibrosis staging score. Ishak necroinflammatory grading score is based on assessments from 4 subscales: (A) Periportal or periseptal interface hepatitis (piecemeal necrosis) 5-point subscale (0=Absent to 4=Severe), (B) Confluent necrosis 7-point subscale (0=Absent to 6=Panacinar or multiacinar necrosis), (C) Focal (spotty) lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation 5-point subscale (0=Absent to 4=More than ten foci per times 10 objective), and (D) Portal inflammation (0=Absent to 4=Marked, all portal areas). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
