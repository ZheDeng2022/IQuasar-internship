  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether certain brain training activities can promote&#xD;
      cognitive, emotional, and physical health in caregivers of a loved one with dementia.&#xD;
      Numerous studies show that family dementia caregiving can be stressful, and can increase&#xD;
      mental and physical health risks. This study aims to understand how to reduce those risks.&#xD;

    <measure>Useful Field of View test performance at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Useful Field of View computerized test of speed of processing and attention; lower score (in milliseconds) reflects better performance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>HF-HRV is derived by spectral analysis of the electrocardiograph (ECG) waveform and is a measure of parasympathetic control of the heart; Higher resting HF-HRV (in Hz) reflects greater parasympathetic regulation of the heart</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion regulation at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as change in negative affect (from responses to the self-assessment manikin on a 9-point scale) from before to after a mental challenge; less increase in negative affect score suggests better emotion regulation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional well-being at 12 months after the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary index of emotional well-being will be depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale); a lower score on this measure indicates less depressive symptoms</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune aging</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Identified from blood samples; lower levels of inflammation (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay) and T-lymphocyte profiles that reflect larger ratios of naïve T-cells relative to mature T-cells (measured from flow cytometry) will index less aging of the immune system</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-speaking (consent process and assessments will be conducted in English only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently living with or in proximity to, and the primary caregiver for a loved one&#xD;
             with dementia who lives in the community-for the purposes of this study, &quot;loved one&quot;&#xD;
             refers to a family member such as a spouse, ex-spouse, significant other, sibling,&#xD;
             in-law, parent, or other type of close established relationship (e.g., close friend)&#xD;
             regarded as family; &quot;primary caregivers&quot; provide daily informal (non-paid) in-person&#xD;
             care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently experiencing moderate to high levels of perceived stress and caregiver&#xD;
             burden. Caregivers will be screened for stress levels and caregiving burden using the&#xD;
             10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 10) and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index&#xD;
             (MCSI), respectively. Caregivers scoring above the population mean (approx.) on the&#xD;
             PSS 10 (&gt; 11), reporting at least moderate caregiver strain (score ≥ 5) on the MCSI&#xD;
             will be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cognitive impairment or dementia (identified by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
             (MoCA)). Cutoff scores on the MoCA will be 23 or lower except for subjects who&#xD;
             identify as black or African American, in which case cutoffs will be based on scores&#xD;
             from the sample population reported in Rossetti et al (2017); subjects scoring greater&#xD;
             than one standard deviation below the published score, by respective age and&#xD;
             education, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current major depression (current Major Depression diagnosis and/or Geriatric&#xD;
             Depression Scale (GDS 15) score ≥ 10)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of events that cause neurological injury (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack, traumatic brain injury or head injury with loss of consciousness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious psychiatric or alcohol/substance use disorders, including current alcohol&#xD;
             dependence, current non-alcohol psychoactive substance use dependence, psychotic&#xD;
             disorders or features (current and lifetime), bipolar disorder (determined from Mini&#xD;
             International Neuropsychiatric Exam (MINI) modules)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disorder (e.g., Crohn's disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active neoplastic disease or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for cancer (or &lt; 6&#xD;
             months post-chemo or radiation) or other diseases (&lt; 3 months prior to enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant immunodeficiency disorder (e.g., alymphocytosis, hepatitis B or C, HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious cardiovascular disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, pacemaker) or&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical condition precluding required activities as part of the computerized&#xD;
             cognitive training (e.g., inability to use a computer mouse; inadequate visual acuity)&#xD;
