    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized into 2 separate arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm number one will receive Bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640 from&#xD;
           day 1 until day 28 of the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm number two will receive Bevacizumab alone every 2 weeks, from on days 1 and 15 of&#xD;
           the first until day 28 of the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MR-Spectroscopy will be obtained on all patients (both arms) at day 28 of first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting on cycle 2 day 1, all patients will converge to a single arm and will continue&#xD;
           to receive bevacizumab every 2 weeks in combination with TVB-2640. Every cycle will last&#xD;
           28 days.&#xD;
