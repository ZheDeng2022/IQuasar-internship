      The primary objective of this study is to better understand post-discharge utilization of&#xD;
      prescribed opioid analgesic medications following surgery. A secondary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to gain a better understanding of prevailing modes of storage for opioid&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription of medications for analgesia after surgery frequently occurs on an empiric&#xD;
      rather than individualized basis. The investigator will hypothesize that prescribed opioid&#xD;
      medications for analgesia after discharge from the hospital / surgery center are frequently&#xD;
      not taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The descriptive first aim of this study is to define self-reported usage patterns of&#xD;
      opioid analgesic medications at home following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The descriptive second aim of this study is to define prevailing modes of storage and/or&#xD;
      disposal for opioid medications prescribed to patients after hospital discharge following&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) The analytical second aim of this study is to characterize patients who do not take&#xD;
      significant amounts of their prescribed opioid medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Exploratory Objective (s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accidents (unintentional injuries) were the 5th leading cause of death among the general&#xD;
      population in the United States in 2010. Among persons 1-44 years of age accidents&#xD;
      represented the leading cause of death. And, within this group, pharmaceuticals were the #1&#xD;
      course of death. Of the 22,134 medication associated deaths in 2010, 75.2% included opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. The trajectory of this development is alarming: Deaths from prescription opioid&#xD;
      overdoses have more than tripled in recent years. Of special concern is that children are&#xD;
      especially vulnerable to unintentional medication overdosing, accounting for 71,224 annual&#xD;
      emergency room visits for this reason from 2004-2005 alone. In addition to the individual&#xD;
      burden from morbidity and mortality, the costs of prescription opioid abuse to society are&#xD;
      immense: The average health care costs for patients abusing opioids are 8 times higher than&#xD;
      for non-abusers. In the United States alone, $55.7 billion were spent on sequelae in the&#xD;
      workplace and in healthcare costs. Accordingly, prescription drug overdosing has been coined&#xD;
      &quot;An American Epidemic&quot; and increasing resources to tackle this rapidly growing public health&#xD;
      problem have been made available on a national (National Institutes of Health, U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration) and the state level as part of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription&#xD;
      Drug Abuse created through Governor Hickenlooper's efforts with the National Governors&#xD;
      Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the prescription of opioids following surgery usually occurs using a &quot;one size&#xD;
      fits all approach&quot;, leading potentially to many unused opioids that are then likely to be&#xD;
      utilized in a fashion unintended by prescribing clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to assess self-reported intake relative to prescribed&#xD;
      amounts of analgesic medications after surgery. Better knowledge of this relationship will&#xD;
      permit the design of tools to individualize analgesic pharmacotherapy after hospital&#xD;
      discharge. The goal is to reduce the amount of opioid prescriptions that are not needed and&#xD;
      to improve non-opioid analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will inform future studies to design more patient-centered opioid prescribing&#xD;
      tools, which are based on anticipated need. This will likely decrease the amounts of&#xD;
      prescribed opioids that are available for non-medical use. Future studies will be aimed to&#xD;
      standardize their use to provide improved analgesia upon discharge following surgery.&#xD;

        Study Design/Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Survey population: Patients ages 18-89 undergoing surgery at the University of Colorado&#xD;
        Hospital are eligible. We will focus on patients after Cesarean section surgery,&#xD;
        gastrointestinal, and thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Following exclusion of all patients under the age of 18 years, patients who do not&#xD;
        understand Spanish or English, and patients returning to institutional settings (e.g.&#xD;
        prison, jail, mental health facility), pregnant women, and decisionally challenged&#xD;
        patients, the investigators will include all remaining patients in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators will focus on adult patients after 1) Cesarean section, 2) thoracic&#xD;
        surgery procedures, and 3) gastrointestinal surgery procedures.&#xD;
