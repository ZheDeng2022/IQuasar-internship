  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to further explore characteristics of ablation&#xD;
      targets identified by CARTOFINDER 4D LAT Algorithm in subjects with persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and to assess the acute outcome of CARTOFINDER Guided Ablation in terms of the&#xD;
      termination of atrial fibrillation to either Normal Sinus Rhythm or Atrial Tachycardia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Scheduled to undergo a clinically-indicated catheter ablation procedure for treatment&#xD;
             of persistent atrial fibrillation (defined as continuous atrial fibrillation that is&#xD;
             sustained beyond seven consecutive days).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3.1. Drug-refractory atrial fibrillation. (failed 1 or more class I or III&#xD;
             antiarrhythmic drugs) and demonstrating Persistent AF (requiring drugs or electrical&#xD;
             shock to terminate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post-, and follow-up testing and&#xD;
             requirements (e.g. patients not confined by a court ruling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Continuous AF &gt; 12 months (1 Year) (Longstanding Persistent AF) 2.1. Subjects&#xD;
             previously diagnosed as Long Standing Persistent (LSP) but have demonstrated the&#xD;
             ability to maintain Normal Sinus Rhythm for &gt;30 days after cardioversion and have not&#xD;
             been in AF greater than 1 year at the time of the procedure remain eligible for&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous ablation procedure for AF (previous ablation for the treatment of Flutter is&#xD;
             acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;

             view).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to restore sinus rhythm for 30 seconds or longer in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the&#xD;

             inhibitor), significant pulmonary disease, unstable angina, uncontrolled heart&#xD;
             failure, acute illness or systemic infection, or any other disease or malfunction that&#xD;
             would preclude treatment in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Enrollment in a study evaluating another device or drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A complex arrhythmia secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or&#xD;
             reversible or non-cardiac cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a prosthetic mitral valve or any mechanical valve&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any cardiac surgery within the past 60 days (2 months) (includes PCI) (bypass within&#xD;
             the past year)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects that have ever undergone valvular cardiac surgical procedure (ie,&#xD;
             ventriculotomy, atriotomy, and valve repair or replacement and presence of a&#xD;
             prosthetic valve)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Prior ICD or pacemaker implanted&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Presence of intramural thrombus, tumor or other abnormality that precludes catheter&#xD;
             introduction or manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has a contra-indication to any of the devices used in the study per the IFU&#xD;
