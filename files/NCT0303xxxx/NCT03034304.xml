      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Safety and tolerability of MASCT-I in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors, either alone or in combination with chemical drugs or in combination&#xD;
      with PD1 antibody.&#xD;

      The multiple-antigen specific cell therapy which was developed by Hengrui Yuanzheng is&#xD;
      optimized continuously and has been upgraded from the first-generation MASCT technology to&#xD;
      MASCT-I. MASCT-I is a technology which add PD1 antibody in vitro cell culture process of&#xD;
      MASCT cell culture to block PD1 receptor on immunocytes, release the brake on immunocytes'&#xD;
      reinfusion and interaction with tumor cells for enhancing the efficacy of immunocytes'&#xD;
      killing tumor cells. At present, the development and validation of manufacturing process has&#xD;
      been completed, and it is urgently needed to conduct the validation of clinical effect. This&#xD;
      study is primarily to assess the safety and anti-tumor effect of MASCT-I technology to&#xD;
      provide data for II/III phase clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Multi-center, phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      multi-antigen autologous immune cell injection (MASCT-I) in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumor, and to preliminarily evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of MASCT-I alone, in combination&#xD;
      with chemical drugs, and in combination with PD1 antibody. About 133 cases of adult patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into four groups: Group 1: Bladder cancer and soft-tissue sarcoma with&#xD;
      advanced recurrence or metastasis that failed standard treatment: MASCT-I alone will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Advanced metastatic or recurrent urothelial carcinoma that achieved clinical benefit&#xD;
      after first-line chemotherapy: MASCT-I A; soft tissue sarcoma or osteosarcoma: MASCT-I&#xD;
      regimen 1 or MASCT-I regimen 2; advanced metastatic or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma that&#xD;
      achieved clinical benefit after first-line treatment: MASCT-I regimen 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Advanced metastatic or recurrent urothelial carcinoma, soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma/osteosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma that progressed after first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      were treated with MASCT-I combined with PD1 antibody until the disease progressed. If disease&#xD;
      progression occurs during MASCT-I + PD1 antibody combination therapy, treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued and then go to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Recurrent metastatic solid tumors that had failed previous treatment with PD1&#xD;
      antibody were treated with MASCT-I regimen 2 combined with PD1 antibody until the disease&#xD;
      progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 is a small sample size safety observation stage where the &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used.&#xD;
      It represents the group of MASCT-I alone where patients with advanced solid tumors that&#xD;
      various standard therapies failed in clinical practice are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 includes stage I ,stage II and stage III.Stage I is a small sample size safety&#xD;
      observation stage where the &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used .Stage I represents the combination&#xD;
      group of MASCT-I plus chemotherapy drug or group of MASCT-I alone where patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic advanced solid tumor who achieved the clinical benefit after&#xD;
      chemotherapy (CR, PR, SD) are included.Stage II is a dose expansion stage to observe the&#xD;
      safety and anti-tumor effectiveness.Advanced metastatic or recurrent urothelial carcinoma,&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma or osteosarcoma ,cholangiocarcinoma scheduled to be enrolled after&#xD;
      first-line treatment to achieve clinical benefit（CR,PR,SD）.If disease progression&#xD;
      occured,patients will go to stage III,where MASCT-I + PD1 antibody therapy will be used until&#xD;
      disease progressed again.&#xD;
