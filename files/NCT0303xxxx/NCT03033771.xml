      Dragon Study Europe is an international, multicenter, prospective, non-randomized study. It&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate safety and performance of the MFM for the treatment of chronic type B&#xD;
      aortic dissection. About 35 patients in up to 11 countries will be enrolled and screened per&#xD;
      the protocol-required inclusion, exclusion criteria, in order to obtain 30 completed&#xD;
      patients. For early demonstration of safety and performance, an interim analysis report will&#xD;
      be performed after all patients included will complete their 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study purpose is to determine the safety and performance of the MFM for the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of chronic type B aortic dissection. It should be noted that the MFM has CE mark&#xD;
      approval for aortic and peripheral artery aneurysms treatment.&#xD;

      Aortic dissection (AD) is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with&#xD;
      separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dissection may occur anywhere along the aorta and extend proximally or distally into&#xD;
      other arteries. It occurs most commonly at the proximal ascending aorta (within 5 cm of the&#xD;
      aortic valve) or the descending thoracic aorta (just beyond the origin of the left subclavian&#xD;
      artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The passage of blood through the false channel can lead to complications such as spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (paraplegia), lack of blood supply to the intestines (mesenteric ischemia) or lower&#xD;
      extremities. The flow of blood in the false channel can cause these complications by&#xD;
      pinching/narrowing off the flow of blood into the branches off the aorta. Aortic dissection&#xD;
      always occurs in the setting of pre-existing degeneration of the aortic media. Causes include&#xD;
      connective tissue disorders and injury. Atherosclerotic risk factors, notably hypertension,&#xD;
      contribute in more than two thirds of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of dissection is found in 1 to 3% of all autopsies. Population-based studies suggest&#xD;
      that the incidence of AD is approximately 5-30 cases per million people per year. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of AD is missed in 40% of cases on initial presentation, and 30% of AD are first&#xD;
      diagnosed on post mortem exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African-Americans, men, the elderly, and people with hypertension are especially at risk.&#xD;
      Peak incidence occurs at age 50 to 65 or, for patients with congenital connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), at age 20 to 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic dissections are classified anatomically, The DeBakey classification system is most&#xD;
      widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type I (50% of dissections): These dissections start in the ascending aorta and extend&#xD;
           at least to the aortic arch and sometimes beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type II (35%): These dissections start in and are confined to the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type III (15%): These dissections start in the descending thoracic aorta just beyond the&#xD;
           origin of the left subclavian artery and extend distally or, less commonly, proximally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stanford system is simpler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type A: These dissections involve the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type B: These dissections are confined to the descending thoracic aorta. Patients with&#xD;
           uncomplicated type B dissection have a 30-day mortality of 10%. Conversely, those who&#xD;
           develop an ischemic leg, renal failure, visceral ischemia, or contained rupture often&#xD;
           require urgent aortic repair; their mortality is 20% by day 2, and 25% by day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For uncomplicated acute and chronic type B dissection, several series have shown that drug&#xD;
      treatment alone can result in 78% three year survival after discharge from hospital. Current&#xD;
      guidelines deem that the medical management remains the gold standard for uncomplicated type&#xD;
      B aortic dissection and this benchmark is difficult to surpass. However, the medical&#xD;
      treatment alone may put some patients at risk of serious complications such as progressive&#xD;
      aortic enlargement, poor blood flow to some organs or the extremities, and aortic rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of complicated dissection-defined by the presence of visceral or limb&#xD;
      ischaemia, rupture, refractory pain, or uncontrollable hypertension-is the key factor that&#xD;
      determines both intervention and outcome for patients with type B dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is virtually always indicated if dissection involves the proximal aorta (type A&#xD;
      dissection) and for complicated aortic dissection. In addition surgery may also be best for&#xD;
      acute distal dissections in patients with Marfan syndrome. The goal of surgery is to&#xD;
      obliterate entry into the false channel and reconstitute the aorta with a synthetic graft.&#xD;
      Predictors of conventional surgery poor outcome include hypotension, renal failure, age &gt; 70,&#xD;
      abrupt onset of chest pain, pulse deficit, and ST-segment elevation on Electrocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEVAR (Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair) aims to cover the primary entry tear in the&#xD;
      descending aorta, resulting in a reduction of flow and pressure in the false lumen and&#xD;
      formation of false lumen thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covered stent or bare stent reconstruction of branch vessels and re-entry tears, with false&#xD;
      lumen thrombosis and remodelling. For acute (first 2 weeks) type B aortic dissection, the&#xD;
      pooled early mortality rate was 6.4% with medical treatment and increased to 10.2% with TEVAR&#xD;
      and 17.5% with open surgery, mostly for complicated cases. IRAD (International Registry of&#xD;
      Acute Aortic Dissection) reported an in-hospital mortality rate of 32% for surgically treated&#xD;
      individuals, 7% for those managed with endovascular techniques, and 10% for those managed&#xD;
      with medical therapy alone. The in-hospital mortality rate of patients with complicated type&#xD;
      B dissection was significantly higher after open surgery (33%) than after endovascular&#xD;
      treatment (11%). This demonstrated that with appropriate use of endovascular stent graft&#xD;
      placement, patients with complicated dissection enjoyed an improved prognosis, eventually&#xD;
      similar to patients with an uncomplicated stable course requiring only medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a rigid chronic dissection flap and multiple chronic re-entries often located&#xD;
      distal to the treated thoracic aorta could have a negative impact on outcome. For patients&#xD;
      with dissection extending into the abdominal aorta, TEVAR is seldom a definitive treatment,&#xD;
      and the continued perfusion of the distal lumen could create further problems. The&#xD;
      endovascular approach is associated with less morbidity and mortality. However, the longterm&#xD;
      efficacy of an endovascular approach to preventing long-term aortic related death is still&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraplegia and retrograde dissection are two of the most dreaded complications after TEVAR&#xD;
      for type B dissection. Retrograde dissection occurs in 1% to 4% of patients and is more&#xD;
      prevalent when the proximal landing zone is in the arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord ischemia rates are lower after TEVAR than after open repair, but this&#xD;
      complication remains a concern and has been reported in up to 4% of patients treated with&#xD;
      TEVAR for chronic dissection. This result compare favourably with open repair, which has a&#xD;
      reported 7% to 36% paraplegia risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a significant proportion (12%-60%) of patients experience disease progression&#xD;
      during follow-up after TEVAR, and thus requires further surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multilayer Flow ModulatorÂ® (MFM) (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium) has CE mark approval for&#xD;
      peripheral/visceral and aortic aneurysms involving at least one branch. The aortic MFM is&#xD;
      widely used for the thoracoabdominal aneurysm treatment. The clinical benefits of this&#xD;
      technology have been suggested in studies about treatments of thoracoabdominal aneurysm, type&#xD;
      B dissection, juxtarenal aortic aneurysm and peripheral artery aneurysm (celiac, hepatic,&#xD;
      renal, iliac, subclavian). Also the prospective multicenter registry of peripheral and&#xD;
      visceral aneurysms and the prospective multicenter STRATO Trial of TAAA, show good results at&#xD;
      12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This MFM is an uncovered, self-expanding wire mesh with high radial force and flexibility. It&#xD;
      is designed to modulate blood-flow dynamics by relieving local peak wall shear stress (PWSS),&#xD;
      achieving stabilization of aneurysm-sac pressure and preserving side-branch patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the MFMÂ® safety and performance will be evaluated in the use for the&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of the chronic type B aortic dissection. Of course all patients were&#xD;
      diagnosed according to standard of care and thoughtful decision before treatment/study&#xD;
      intervention has to be made. In all cases the treating physician(s) shall consider and&#xD;
      discuss alternative treatments with each individual patient before starting screening and&#xD;
      enrolling into this study. Hence, once MFMÂ® treatment within this study has been identified&#xD;
      as feasible and desired mode of treatment with a state-of-the-art device with a beneficial&#xD;
      risk benefit profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, treatment in this study will follow the routine course of an endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of aortic pathologies, i.e. classical stenting procedures. Surgery, or stent-grafts&#xD;
      are virtually always indicated if dissection involves the proximal aorta (type A dissection)&#xD;
      and for complicated aortic dissection. In addition, surgery/stent-grafts may also be best for&#xD;
      acute distal dissections in patients with congenital tissue disorders (non-exhaustively, such&#xD;
      as Marfan, Loeys-Dietz or Ehler Danlos syndromes).&#xD;
