      This project is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      that is designed to test whether treating patients who are at risk for development of lupus&#xD;
      with hydroxychloroquine can slow accumulation of disease features. Effects on clinical&#xD;
      progression of symptoms, patient-reported outcomes and changes in the immune markers of&#xD;
      response will be measured and toxicity of the treatment will be assessed. This trial is a&#xD;
      first step in testing a prevention strategy for lupus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes major organ damage and shortens lifespan in&#xD;
      relatively young persons. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improving outcomes&#xD;
      for SLE patients. However, evidenced-based approaches to early treatment interventions and&#xD;
      the appropriate target population for these interventions are not available. We propose that&#xD;
      individuals who have positivity for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and who also exhibit some&#xD;
      of the other features that are used to classify SLE, are at high risk of progressing to the&#xD;
      full systemic form of this disease. These individuals, who have significant levels of ANA&#xD;
      with 1 or 2 additional items from the lupus classification criteria, are considered to have&#xD;
      incomplete lupus erythematosus (ILE). We propose to treat ILE patients with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the &quot;Study of Anti-Malarials in Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus&quot;&#xD;
      or SMILE trial. The primary objective is to determine whether HCQ treatment can prevent&#xD;
      acquisition of additional clinical and immunologic features that define SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major secondary objectives are to determine whether HCQ treatment: (1) lessens lupus&#xD;
      disease activity as measured by standard scoring indices; (2) improves patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (3) prevents accumulation of immunologic abnormalities including autoantibodies and&#xD;
      cytokines and (4) has an acceptable toxicity profile. The specific aims of this proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of HCQ&#xD;
           vs. placebo in patients with ILE. The study tests the hypothesis that early use of HCQ&#xD;
           can modify disease features so that accumulation of abnormalities leading to a&#xD;
           classification of SLE can be significantly slowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine effects of HCQ on disease activity and patient-reported outcomes in&#xD;
           patients with ILE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the immunologic profile of HCQ in ILE-treated patients. Autoantibodies,&#xD;
           cytokines and chemokines will be measured on multiplex arrays for developing insights&#xD;
           into underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To quantitatively assess the incidence of ophthalmologic toxicity in HCQ-treated ILE&#xD;
           patients. All enrolled patients will have standardized ophthalmologic examinations&#xD;
           before and after study treatment. Recommendations for use and monitoring in this patient&#xD;
           population will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMILE trial will determine whether or not HCQ should be given to ILE patients, will&#xD;
      provide insights into the appropriate target population, and will propose candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. While not part of the Precision Medicine&#xD;
      InitiativeÂ®, SMILE is consistent with its goals. It will be the first step towards testing&#xD;
      the feasibility of disease prevention studies in SLE and will accumulate biological samples&#xD;
      in a repository that will be available to the lupus research community for further in-depth&#xD;
      mechanistic studies.&#xD;
