      This study will be conducted in Greek population. The patients who will be selected for study&#xD;
      enrollment will receive inhaled combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate&#xD;
      at doses 100 / 6mcg, 200 / 6mcg, 400/12 mcg through Elpenhlaler® device. The study end points&#xD;
      will be efficacy and safety in patients with asthma.Additional study objectives will be&#xD;
      quality of life, patient satisfaction, severe exacerbation and comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      airways. Characterized by a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, chest heaviness&#xD;
      and cough symptoms that fluctuate over time, as well as variable airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a common disease worldwide, the rates of which are increasing in children and&#xD;
      adults. It is estimated that asthma affects 1-18% of the population in different countries.&#xD;
      In Greece, which is a country with lower rates of asthma, it is estimated that 8.6% of the&#xD;
      population suffers from the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of asthma should be based on: Background with characteristic symptoms, signs&#xD;
      variable airway obstruction, with tests for reversal of bronchial obstruction or other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term treatment of asthma has the following objectives 1. symptom control: achieve&#xD;
      adequate control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels 2. Risk Reduction: minimize&#xD;
      risk of future exacerbations, permanent airflow obstruction and side effects from medication&#xD;
      Pulmoton® is an inhaled combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in&#xD;
      portions 100 / 6mcg, 200 / 6mcg, 400/12 mcg, administered through Elpenhlaler® device,&#xD;
      developed by ELPEN. It is approved as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma where&#xD;
      administration of the combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-beta2-agonist action) is&#xD;
      appropriate in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as&#xD;
      needed' inhaled beta2-agonists short-acting or patients already adequately controlled with&#xD;
      both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmoton® not recommended for the initial treatment of asthma. The dosage of the individual&#xD;
      components of Pulmoton® is separate and must be adjusted according to the severity of the&#xD;
      condition. This should be considered not only at the beginning of therapy with fixed&#xD;
      combination products, but also when adjusting the maintenance dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose should be adjusted to the lowest possible, to achieve and maintain effective control&#xD;
      of symptoms. Patients should be regularly reassessed by a doctor, so that the dose of&#xD;
      Pulmoton® receiving remains optimal. When you achieve long-term control of symptoms with the&#xD;
      lowest recommended dose, then the next step may be testing single administration of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two alternatives for the treatment of asthma with Pulmoton®:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pulmoton® maintenance therapy: Pulmoton® taken as regular maintenance treatment with a&#xD;
      separate rapid-acting bronchodilator for relief of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Pulmoton® maintenance and reliever therapy: Pulmoton® taken as regular maintenance and 'on&#xD;
      demand' therapy to treat the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pulmoton® maintenance therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be advised to always carry with them their fast-acting bronchodilator to use&#xD;
      when there is a need for relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More information on the effectiveness and safety of the study drug, reported in the Summary&#xD;
      of Product Characteristics (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study aims to collect data regarding Pulmoton® from everyday&#xD;
      clinical practice, improve the quality of life of patients and disease progression. The&#xD;
      centers where the study will be approximately 100, both hospital and private pulmonary&#xD;
      clinics will be held. Data will be collected for a period of 6 months from patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with asthma not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled&#xD;
      beta2-agonists short-acting or patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids and beta2-long-acting stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected during the period of three (3) and six (6) months (± 2 weeks) from the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment with inhaled combination include spirometry data, (FEV1, FVC, FEV /&#xD;
      FVC), checklist ACQ, AQLQ questionnaire and questionnaire FSI 10, and details of any existing&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;
