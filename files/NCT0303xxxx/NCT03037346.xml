      This trial evaluates the impact of a systemic social work driven approach on medical power of&#xD;
      attorney documentation, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in participants with stage I-IV&#xD;
      gynecological cancers. Social work counseling and education may help increase the number of&#xD;
      participants who complete medical power of attorney documents. Counseling and education may&#xD;
      also affect attitudes about decision-making and willingness to take part in these&#xD;
      conversations in participants with stage I-IV gynecological cancers and their family members&#xD;
      and/or caregivers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate medical power of attorney documents (MPOAD) completion rate after a systematic&#xD;
      social work counseling and education clinical process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine change in medical power of attorney (MPOA)/primary family caregivers'&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about conditions for quality surrogate medical&#xD;
      decision-making (MDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine change in MPOA/primary family caregivers' knowledge of patients' values and&#xD;
      goals for MDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate patients' and MPOA/primary family caregivers' willingness to participate in&#xD;
      future advance care planning discussions to discuss patients' values and goals important to&#xD;
      MDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate predictors of patient subgroups most likely to respond to the social work&#xD;
      counseling and education clinical process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Explore aspects of the Spanish language version of the advance care planning engagement&#xD;
      survey to inform future validation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (patients and family caregiver/MPOA) complete questionnaires about knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and beliefs of MPOAD. Participants without a MPOAD watch a 4-minute educational&#xD;
      video about the importance of the role of MPOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of intervention, participants are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;

Baseline and changes in MPOA/primary family caregivers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about conditions for quality surrogate medical decision-making (MDM), in patients/primary family caregivers' self-efficacy and readiness for MPOA, and in patients/Primary family caregivers' knowledge of patients' values and goals for MDM, will be summarized and compared among the four patient groups: 1) had MPOAD at the consult already, 2) complete MPOAD at the first visit, 3) complete MPOAD after initial social work counselor visit and by 3 months, 4) do not complete MPOAD by 3 months, using Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and either Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for discrete variables, whenever appropriate. Univariate/multi-covariate logistic regression will be employed to evaluate the effect of potential factors on completion of MPOAD.</description>
