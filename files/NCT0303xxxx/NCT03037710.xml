  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, non-interventional study to evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
      a remote monitoring and analytical platform for prediction of heart failure exacerbation. The&#xD;
      platform acquires continuous multivariate vital signs from HF patients using a new ambulatory&#xD;
      wearable (attached by an adhesive) multi-sensor device and analyzes the data using a novel&#xD;
      machine learning algorithm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The analytics being investigated includes a Similarity-Based Modeling technique, that&#xD;
      empirically estimates the expected physiological behavior of a subject based on prior learned&#xD;
      dynamic data, for comparison to actual measured behavior from the subject, to reveal&#xD;
      discrepancies hidden by normal variation. The measurements are typically an ensemble of vital&#xD;
      signs that effectively characterizes the physiological &quot;control system&quot; of the subject. This&#xD;
      technique is multivariate: multiple variables are leveraged, because single variables in&#xD;
      isolation have little context - a high heart rate by itself could mean a person is exerting&#xD;
      himself, or it could mean his physiology is in distress even though he is not exerting&#xD;
      himself. With reference to several other variables, however, such as respiration rate,&#xD;
      oximetry and motion/activity, a high heart rate might be recognized as a normal state when&#xD;
      accompanied by the corroborating data showing a high respiration rate, a normal oximetry and&#xD;
      a high level of motion - the person is exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wearable adhesive multi-sensor device will be used to collect continuous vital sign and&#xD;
      other data from study subjects, including heart rate, respiration rate, bodily&#xD;
      motion/activity, skin temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram and peripheral capillary oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. Subjects are provided with a smartphone or cellular tablet that will be paired&#xD;
      with the multi-sensor device to receive data and upload it to the analytics server via&#xD;
      cellular network or WiFi internet. Study staff will interact with the subject during visits&#xD;
      scheduled for routine heart failure follow-up to capture pre-specified heart failure medical&#xD;
      events. All standard of care clinic and hospitalization notes and procedure reports including&#xD;
      echocardiograms, right heart catheterizations, pulmonary function tests, six minute walk&#xD;
      tests and radiology reports will be collected as they occur.&#xD;
