      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic approach to uncomplicated ventral hernia repair as compared to open repair has&#xD;
      advantages of less post operative pain, less rates of wound infection , , early recovery,&#xD;
      shortened hospital stay and less overall cost of treatment , , . Patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedure is better as compared to open repair . Recurrence rate is also known&#xD;
      to be less in laparoscopic repair as compared to open repair. Despite all this, laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach is utilized in only about quarter of patients with ventral hernia in developed&#xD;
      countries , . Early post-operative pain and discomfort after laparoscopic repair remains a&#xD;
      concern for patients requiring hospital stay and parenteral narcotic analgesics . Intensity&#xD;
      of pain is similar regardless of method of fixation of mesh. This quite often proves to be a&#xD;
      hindrance in early ambulation, enhances patient discomfort and prevents early discharge from&#xD;
      hospital. Early post-operative pain is thought to be secondary to dissection in the area of&#xD;
      mesh application. Local application of anesthetic agent is this area can potentially overcome&#xD;
      this problem and make the procedure feasible as an ambulatory care operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics infiltration at wound site after various procedures is known to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing immediate post-operative pain , . In case of laparoscopic ventral&#xD;
      hernia repair, delivering local anesthetic at site of mesh application can be achieved by&#xD;
      soaking the mesh in local anesthetic solution before application. Bupivacaine is long acting&#xD;
      local anesthetic. Results of studies that have used this class of drugs intra-peritonealy in&#xD;
      other types of surgeries for analgesic purpose have shown it to be safe for intra-operative&#xD;
      use. To date there is no evidence regarding impact of soaking mesh in bupivacaine solution&#xD;
      before application in case of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. These patients require post&#xD;
      operative intravenous analgesic agents to deal with early post operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this turns out to be effective intervention, it will improve patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      early discharge from hospital. This can also potentially reduce cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate impact of impregnating mesh in .5% bupivacaine solution as compared to normal&#xD;
      saline solution on post-operative pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate impact of impregnating mesh in .5% bupivacaine solution as compared to saline&#xD;
      solution on length of hospital stay after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does impregnating mesh in solution of .5% bupivacaine before application in laparoscopic&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair result in significant reduction in post-operative pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain after Impregnating the mesh before application in laparoscopic ventral&#xD;
      hernia repair with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine solution is either the same or more as compared&#xD;
      to the post-operative pain after impregnating the mesh with 20ml of 0.9% saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain after Impregnating the mesh before application in laparoscopic ventral&#xD;
      hernia repair with 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine solution is less as compared to the&#xD;
      post-operative pain after impregnating the mesh with 20ml of 0.9% saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with un-complicated ventral abdominal wall hernia planned to undergo laparoscopic&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uncomplicated ventral abdominal wall hernia presenting at general surgery&#xD;
      clinics of Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi and planned to have laparoscopic&#xD;
      hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with uncomplicated ventral abdominal wall hernia presenting at general surgery&#xD;
      clinics of AKUH Karachi who are planned to undergo laparoscopic repair and meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria of inclusion into trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be done. Blocks sizes each of 10 participants will be made. In each&#xD;
      block randomization will be done using computer generated random numbers. Allocations in each&#xD;
      block will be written on cards and enclosed in envelops. For each block envelops will be&#xD;
      shuffled and then numbered in sequence. All envelops will be prepared and sealed before start&#xD;
      of trial by clinical trial unit. Trial monitoring will be done by clinical trial unit.&#xD;
      Emergency breaking of code will be done to the physician in cases of demanded for treatment&#xD;
      of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) software for sample size&#xD;
      calculation. Muyosoms F et al in 2013 reported pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair&#xD;
      after various mesh fixation techniques on visual analogue scale ranging from 0-10 . They&#xD;
      reported pain after fixation with tackers to be 4.4 +/- 2.3 at four hours. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that bupivacaine soakage of mesh will reduce this pain by at least on third as compared to&#xD;
      soakage with saline. A minimum of 44 patients are required in each group keeping level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% and power of study to be 90%. Anticipating 10% loss to follow up, it was&#xD;
      planned to include 50 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTINGS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted in General Surgery Section of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in clinic at the time of presentation regarding eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in study. Written informed consent will be taken in clinic. A copy of the consent&#xD;
      form will be handed over to the patient. Clinical Trial Unit will be informed of the&#xD;
      scheduled date and time of the operation. Allocation will be done by the staff at clinical&#xD;
      trial unit which will be kept undisclosed to the investigators, patients and outcome&#xD;
      assessors. Clinical Trial Unit will provide the solution for soaking mesh in coded form&#xD;
      according to treatment arm allocation. After the operation first assessment of pain will be&#xD;
      done six hours post-operatively using VAS. Second assessment will be done at twenty four&#xD;
      hours from end of operation. This assessment will be done directly if patient is admitted in&#xD;
      the hospital or will be done on telephone if patient is discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to complete recruitment of required sample size in one and a half year after&#xD;
      start of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is performed under general anesthesia. Laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach to repair ventral hernia at our institution involves trans-abdominal approach&#xD;
      through three laparoscopic ports inserted on one side of abdomen. Dual mesh is applied to&#xD;
      anterior abdominal wall after reducing hernia contents. Mesh is soaked in saline before&#xD;
      insertion into peritoneal cavity to ease handling. Mesh is applied using metallic tacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is long acting local anesthetic drug. Though minimum toxic dose of bupivacaine&#xD;
      for intra-peritoneal use is not defined, analgesic effect of its intra-peritoneal use&#xD;
      especially after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been assessed in several interventional&#xD;
      studies. Intra-peritoneal use of up to 50ml of .25% , , or up to 20ml of .5% solution has not&#xD;
      shown any drug related adverse reactions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known serious adverse reactions of bupivacaine after use as local anesthetic are due to its&#xD;
      high serum concentrations after use, commonly seen after accidental administration directly&#xD;
      into blood vessels. These are reported to be effects on central nervous system like seizures&#xD;
      and convulsion and cardiac effects like arrhythmias and heart block. These adverse reactions&#xD;
      are noted in 1:1000 cases . Time to onset of these adverse effects ranges from a few seconds&#xD;
      to up to one hour . These adverse effects will be monitored for up to one hour after surgery&#xD;
      in operating room and recovery room. In case some adverse effect is encountered, management&#xD;
      will be done according to standard resuscitation protocols at our institution. Any adverse&#xD;
      effect will be reported to Ethical Review Committee earliest after encountering and maximum&#xD;
      of seven days after the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment will be done using visual analogue scale (VAS). This is validated score to&#xD;
      measure level of pain. It ranges from zero to ten. Score of 0 means no pain and score of ten&#xD;
      means worst pain one can ever have. Score will be assessed at 6 and 24 hours from procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be done. Quantitative variable including VAS score will be&#xD;
      reported in mean +/- standard deviation or median +/- interquartile range. Qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be reported as percentages. Univariable linear regression will be done to&#xD;
      assess linear association of VAS score with predictor variables including use of bupivacaine.&#xD;
      Multiple variable linear regression analysis will be done to evaluate true effect of&#xD;
      intervention, adjusting for time of assessment and amount of analgesia used. P value of less&#xD;
      than 0.2 will be considered at Univariate level for the predictor variable to be included in&#xD;
      multiple variable linear regression analysis. Possible effect modifiers like pre-operative&#xD;
      pain and amount of dissection will be analyzed and reported if present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interim analysis will be conducted in mid of trial. At the time of interim analysis,&#xD;
      criteria to stop trial is defined as p value of less than 0.025 for the outcome of interest&#xD;
      or less than .05 for adverse events like side effect of bupivacaine with power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear Regression analysis will be done to adjust for confounders and effect modifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on preformed printed questionnaires. Each questionnaire will be having&#xD;
      information about data of operation and medical record number as identifier. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be anonymized and no identifiable information will be stored. Hard copies will be kept&#xD;
      under lock and key in research office of Department of Surgery. Data will be entered in&#xD;
      statistical software SPSS version 19. SPSS files will be password protected. Data will be&#xD;
      stored till 15 year after completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval has been taken from Ethical Review Committee. Informed consent will be taken from&#xD;
      participants. Cost of bupivacaine will be provided from study fund.&#xD;
