    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) is effective in remediating cognitive deficits while also improving&#xD;
      functionality in Veterans with schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the dysfunctional brain region most implicated in cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in schizophrenia, has recently been shown to improve cognition in non-Veteran&#xD;
      samples with schizophrenia. The investigators' goal is to confirm the efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment modality to remediate cognitive deficits and improve functionality in Veterans with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, as well as to gain a better understanding of the neural mechanisms responsible&#xD;
      for cognitive deficits and their remediation. The investigators propose conducting a&#xD;
      small-scale study to generate pilot data supporting the feasibility of conducting rTMS with&#xD;
      Veterans and the effectiveness of rTMS in this population. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct neurophysiologic experiments to test whether certain neural maker of abnormal&#xD;
      brain function improves with rTMS.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Working Memory Function</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in scores for working memory performance accuracy will serve as dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves working memory. Working memory performance was assessed using a non-standardized task developed in house, which is basically a Sterberg style delayed response task in which memoranda are displayed and are to be remembered across a short delay period. The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater working memory difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05. Scores will be reported as a change in percent accuracy during this working memory task, where higher percent accuracy is better and scores range from -100% to 100%.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neurophysiologic Function</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Gamma oscillation is viewed as a measure of neurophysiologic function. The investigators will be conducting task-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) to measure gamma oscillation before and after rTMS. It is predicted that the intervention will improve gamma oscillations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Level of Everyday Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Global Functioning Scale scores (GF) will serve as dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves functioning. The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater GF-difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
Scale's values range from a minimum score of 1 to a maximum score of 10, with a higher score means better functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Cognitive Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and after 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Brief Assessment of Cognition (BACS) score will serve as a dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves cognitive functioning. The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater GF-difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05. Data will be reported as change in Z-score on the scale, where a higher value means a better outcome, with scores ranging from -3 to 3.</description>

          <title>Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Composite T-score Score at Baseline</title>
          <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) represents cognitive ability of people with schizophrenia, where scores from six sub-scales of cognition were normalized to a composite T-score in which the normalized T-score has a mean of 50 and S.D. of 10 of the reference groups, where a higher score significantly above the mean indicates greater cognitive ability. Alternatively, scoring significantly below the mean would indicate lower cognitive ability as reflected in the data.</description>

        <title>Change in Working Memory Function</title>
        <description>Changes in scores for working memory performance accuracy will serve as dependent measure for testing the hypothesis that rTMS improves working memory. Working memory performance was assessed using a non-standardized task developed in house, which is basically a Sterberg style delayed response task in which memoranda are displayed and are to be remembered across a short delay period. The hypothesis will be supported if the investigators find greater working memory difference in the active compared to the sham-rTMS-treated groups as revealed by t-tests and two-sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05. Scores will be reported as a change in percent accuracy during this working memory task, where higher percent accuracy is better and scores range from -100% to 100%.</description>

          <description>Subjects will receive actual rTMS treatment.&#xD;
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: rTMS is a non-invasive procedure, in which the administration of a transient magnetic field induces electrical currents in specific, targeted brain regions. The intervention will be administered in 20 sessions lasting 50 minutes each over the course of 2-6 weeks. Up to two sessions may be scheduled per day with a one-hour interval in-between.</description>

          <description>Subjects will attend and sit through the session, but no rTMS treatment will be actually delivered to them.&#xD;
Sham: Subjects will still attend treatment sessions as outlined in the rTMS intervention. However, the device will not deliver any stimulation to the subject.</description>
