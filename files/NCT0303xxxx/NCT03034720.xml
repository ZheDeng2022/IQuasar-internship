      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      While post-concussive symptoms following sports-related concussion are typically transient&#xD;
      and resolve spontaneously within two weeks of concussive injury, 14% or more of youth who&#xD;
      sustain concussion experience significant morbidity that can persist well beyond the normal&#xD;
      disease course.Furthermore, post-concussive symptoms commonly co-occur with affective&#xD;
      symptoms including depression and anxiety which when present can prolong recovery from&#xD;
      primary post-concussive symptoms. Together, persistent physical and psychological symptoms&#xD;
      confer protracted functional impairment and create a significant burden for affected youth,&#xD;
      their family, and school. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines to inform&#xD;
      treatment of persistent post-concussive symptoms in youth and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the dearth of evidence-based treatment approaches for youth with persistent&#xD;
      post-concussive symptoms, the investigators developed a novel collaborative care treatment&#xD;
      model that simultaneously targets post-concussive symptoms and co-occurring depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. Athletes and their family members receive patient navigator care management services&#xD;
      that bridge post-injury care across acute care, specialist and primary care health service&#xD;
      delivery sectors, in addition to cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. Patients who remain&#xD;
      symptomatic after initial treatment efforts receive stepped-up care that may include&#xD;
      psychopharmacologic consultation. The Investigators have demonstrated feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention model through a pilot randomized-control trial of 49 adolescents with persistent&#xD;
      post-concussive symptoms recruited from a regional children's hospital. Participants assigned&#xD;
      to the intervention condition demonstrated significant and clinically-meaningful reductions&#xD;
      in post-concussive and depressive symptoms as well as health-related quality of life as&#xD;
      compared to adolescents in the usual care arm of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will expand upon the pilot trial in order to further develop, implement,&#xD;
      and test the impact of an innovative collaborative care approach tailored to the needs of a&#xD;
      patient population who currently have no evidence-based options. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      broad reach intervention strategy that is designed to be readily implemented in acute,&#xD;
      specialty and primary care medical settings, as well as over the telephone. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial with 200 youth, ages 11-18,&#xD;
      suffering from â‰¥ 3 post-concussive symptoms at least 1 month after their sports-related&#xD;
      injury. Athletes will be randomized to collaborative care (intervention) or post-sports&#xD;
      injury care as usual (control group) conditions. The study is designed with the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine the effectiveness of a stepped-collaborative care intervention model in&#xD;
      reducing post-concussive and co-occurring psychological symptoms in youth with persistent&#xD;
      post-concussive symptoms after sports-related concussion H1: Youth receiving a collaborative&#xD;
      care intervention will demonstrate clinically and statistically significant reductions in&#xD;
      post-concussive symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms over the course of the 12-month&#xD;
      study, compared to usual care control group athletes Aim 2. To examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention in improving function and health-related quality of life amongst youth with&#xD;
      persistent symptoms after sports-related concussion H2: Adolescents who receive a&#xD;
      collaborative care intervention will exhibit a clinically meaningful improvement in function&#xD;
      and health-related quality life Exploratory Aim 3. To explore differences in school&#xD;
      performance between groups H3: Adolescents who receive the collaborative care intervention&#xD;
      will receive individualized treatment and community resource linkages which will improve&#xD;
      their school performance as compared to adolescents receiving treatment as usual Aim 4. To&#xD;
      explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects in the primary and secondary outcomes by&#xD;
      examining the interaction of the treatment effect with group membership in distinct subgroups&#xD;
      of the population. H4: Three distinct subgroups are expected to emerge from the study&#xD;
      population: adolescents who recover from symptoms, adolescents with chronic psychosocial&#xD;
      problems, and adolescents whose symptoms wax and wane over time. A greater proportion of&#xD;
      adolescents who recover from symptoms will emerge in the treatment group, compared to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: By broadly targeting the constellation of post-concussive physical and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms and integrating care amongst primary care, pediatric sub-specialist, and behavioral&#xD;
      health providers, the collaborative care health services intervention could accelerate the&#xD;
      rate of recovery from persistent post-concussive symptoms and attenuate the degree and&#xD;
      duration of disability during adolescence, a critical period for healthy development.&#xD;
      Validation of this treatment through a scaled up clinical trial will serve as a foundation&#xD;
      for broader dissemination of this collaborative care treatment model. The multidisciplinary&#xD;
      sports concussion research team will simultaneously work nationally and internationally to&#xD;
      ensure study results are expediently translated into effective policy for youth athletes&#xD;
      suffering from enduring symptoms and functional impairments in the wake of sports-related&#xD;
      concussions.&#xD;
