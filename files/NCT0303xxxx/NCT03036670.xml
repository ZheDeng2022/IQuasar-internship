      EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, previously Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a&#xD;
      rare vasculitis, characterised by asthma, rhinosinusitis and eosinophilia. There has&#xD;
      previously been confusion around diagnostic criteria, with multiple sets of classification&#xD;
      criteria being used inappropriately for diagnosis. The ERS formed a taskforce to produce&#xD;
      specific diagnostic criteria, and these divided the Churg-Strauss Syndrome cohort into two&#xD;
      groups - vasculitic EGPA and tissular Hypereosinophilic Asthma with Systemic Manifestations&#xD;
      (HASM). It is not known if the groups separated by the diagnostic criteria are also separated&#xD;
      in clinical symptomatology, or if their disease course varies, and this could have&#xD;
      significant impact on management and further research.&#xD;

      Background Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA, previously Churg-Strauss&#xD;
      Syndrome) is a rare, idiopathic, ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV), alongside Granulomatosis&#xD;
      with Polyangiitis (GPA) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA). It is an eosinophilic&#xD;
      small/medium vessel vasculitis characterised by asthma, rhinosinusitis and eosinophilia.&#xD;
      Patients can also suffer renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal and neurological involvement. First&#xD;
      described by Churg and Strauss in 1951, exact epidemiology remains difficult because of a&#xD;
      lack of clear diagnostic criteria. It appears to have a prevalence of around 11-13 per&#xD;
      million population with a mean age of 50 years old and represents 10% of diagnosed&#xD;
      vasculitides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Churg and Strauss' original paper, the first attempt to provide diagnostic clarity&#xD;
      was provided by John Lanham in 1984. Lanham listed symptoms seen in a set of patients with&#xD;
      EGPA and suggested which symptoms were required for the disease and which symptoms were&#xD;
      &quot;additional&quot;. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990 published a list of 6&#xD;
      symptoms to assist with classification of vasculitides, created by comparing 20 patients with&#xD;
      EGPA with 787 patients with other forms of vasculitis. This was frequently used for diagnosis&#xD;
      despite being intended for classification. In 1994, and revised in 2012, the International&#xD;
      Chapel Hill Consensus Conference produced a nomenclature and definition for vasculitides,&#xD;
      again frequently incorrectly used as diagnostic criteria. Finally, in 2014, diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria were provided by the European Respiratory Society Churg Strauss Syndrome (ERS-CSS)&#xD;
      taskforce; however published literature still uses a variety of criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGPA is recognised as a Th2 predominant disease with elevated levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and&#xD;
      IgE according to a number of case control studies and case reports. Association between IL-10&#xD;
      levels and ANCA negative EGPA has been reported. Th17 responses also seem to be elevated with&#xD;
      raised serum IL-25 reported, potentiating Th2 cytokine release. Eosinophil products are&#xD;
      detectable in serum, BAL, urine and biopsies with varying time-courses. Roles of other cells&#xD;
      such as regulatory T cells, memory T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, ILCs and others are&#xD;
      being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work within the investigators' unit has demonstrated disturbances in the coagulation&#xD;
      system in patients with asthma. The investigators have demonstrated that, while moderate&#xD;
      asthma appears to favour fibrinolysis, severe asthma is a fibrinogenic condition. Deposition&#xD;
      of fibrin within the airways in fatal asthma has been previously recognised, but a case study&#xD;
      demonstrated strong activation of the coagulation system five days prior to an exacerbation.&#xD;
      Another case study has demonstrated increased activation of the coagulation system in a&#xD;
      patient with active EGPA which normalised on remission, but more in depth work has not been&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously recognised that ANCA positive patients often have a different disease&#xD;
      phenotype to those who are ANCA negative, suffering with more vasculitic symptoms and renal&#xD;
      disease but less cardiac involvement. In 2014 the ERS-CSS taskforce provided diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for these two main phenotypes - separating the vasculitic phenotype which remains&#xD;
      called Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), from the ANCA negative tissular&#xD;
      phenotype called Hypereosinophilic Asthma with Systemic Manifestations (HASM). It is&#xD;
      currently unclear if this distinction matches biological endotypes, or whether different&#xD;
      treatment strategies are advisable between the two groups. It is possible that HASM is a&#xD;
      precursor state to full vasculitic EGPA, however the increased incidence of cardiac&#xD;
      manifestations within this group would point away from this, as would the differing&#xD;
      prevalence of genetic markers such as IL-10 promoter activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the advent of corticosteroid use, prognosis of EGPA was poor with a mortality rate&#xD;
      of 50% at 3 months. Treatment primarily consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids,&#xD;
      with induction therapy using cyclophosphamide in severe cases. Rituximab is approved for use&#xD;
      in GPA and MPA, while case reports demonstrate a good effect in patients with severe,&#xD;
      refractory EGPA, uncontrolled on other therapy. Those who suffer from CSS can be exposed to&#xD;
      prolonged steroid therapy with the majority of patients experiencing side effects of their&#xD;
      medication such as weight gain, osteopaenia, impaired glucose tolerance, cataracts and skin&#xD;
      atrophy. Steroid sparing agents such as azathioprine and mycophenolate are used with variable&#xD;
      effect. Treatment is primarily guided by eosinophil count and symptom scores such as the&#xD;
      Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) as there are not currently any diagnostic tests&#xD;
      or EGPA-specific biomarkers. Presence of a specific biomarker would allow more accurate&#xD;
      alterations in patients' mediation, as non-specific symptoms can imitate EGPA and prompt&#xD;
      increases in steroid doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions Do the ERS-CSS diagnostic criteria divide the PHT cohort into groups with&#xD;
      distinct clinical characteristics? How do the EGPA and HASM groups differ in clinical and&#xD;
      physiological characteristics and how do these change over time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact If the investigators confirm that EGPA and HASM represent distinct clinical&#xD;
      entities within our cohort, further research into biological mechanisms and treatment options&#xD;
      is needed, and this work will help to guide further studies.&#xD;
