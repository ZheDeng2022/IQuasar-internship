      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, CBF acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      patients who have reached CR are randomised into two groups and receive high-dose cytarabine&#xD;
      (HDAC) or high-dose cytarabine plus chidamide.The safety and efficacy of chidamide is&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, CBF AML(including AML1-ETO or&#xD;
      CBF-MYH11 mutated patients) patients who have reached CR are randomised into two groups and&#xD;
      receive HDAC or high dose of cytarabine plus chidamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third&#xD;
      and fifth day and chidamide at a dose of 20mg/d twice a week for 3 months.Patients in control&#xD;
      group only receive cytarabine at the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of chidamide is evaluated. The primary outcome is relapse-free&#xD;
      survival rate after treatment.&#xD;
