  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For &gt;60 years, succinylcholine is still being administered as a selective relaxant for rapid&#xD;
      sequence intubation by anesthesiologists in many countries. It has been shown to possess&#xD;
      unique features such as low cost, fast-acting, short half-life, safe metabolites, and causing&#xD;
      excellent muscle relaxation for intubation. It has many side effects as well. Postoperative&#xD;
      myalgia (POM), with an incidence rate of ~41%-92%, is one of the most common side effects of&#xD;
      this drug and can take several days to cause significant discomfort in patients. However, its&#xD;
      effect is felt more in the throat, neck, shoulder, and abdominal muscles and is common among&#xD;
      patients with outpatient surgery. Due to its unknown real context of pathogenesis and in an&#xD;
      effort to reduce the incidence and severity of succinylcholine-induced myalgia, various&#xD;
      medications including nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, magnesium sulfate,&#xD;
      opioids, gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been tested, with varying&#xD;
      degrees of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duloxetine is an US Food and Drug Administration-approved analgesic used for various pain&#xD;
      syndromes, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. The underlying&#xD;
      mechanism for duloxetine against these pain syndromes remains unclear, but it may involve&#xD;
      three major central nervous system (CNS) targets: (1) serotonin transporter (Ki, 4.6 nM), (2)&#xD;
      norepinephrine transporter (Ki, 16 nM), and (3) dopamine transporter (Ki, 370 nM). In the&#xD;
      past, the antidepressant action was often thought to be the primary mechanism for its&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy. This theory was addressed later by &quot;Path Analysis,&quot; and the result showed&#xD;
      that duloxetine affects pain directly rather than indirectly through mood improvement. In&#xD;
      addition to these multiple CNS targets, duloxetine, like the antidepressant amitriptyline and&#xD;
      the local anesthetic bupivacaine, blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels. Because neuronal Na+&#xD;
      channels are present in both CNS and peripheral nervous systems, such a finding expands the&#xD;
      possible analgesic action and locus of duloxetine.&#xD;

      Eligibility and type of the study: This prospective randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double-blind study will be conducted after approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and obtaining written informed consent from patients undergoing elective direct&#xD;
      microlaryngoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Sample size calculation is based on the pilot study, where the incidence of POM&#xD;
      in outpatient cases is found to be more than 70% and intervention that can cause 25%&#xD;
      reduction in incidence of POM will be interesting. With a power of 90% and type I error of&#xD;
      5%, 32 patients will be required in each group (α=0.05 and β=90%), but to avoid possible loss&#xD;
      of samples (dropouts) during the study, the number of patients in each group will be&#xD;
      increased to 35 to be a total of 70 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Seventy patients will be enrolled in this study. They will be equally divided into&#xD;
      two groups. Group D (duloxetine group): 35 patients will receive duloxetine (Cymbalta; Eli&#xD;
      Lilly &amp; Company, Indiana, USA) 30 mg orally with sips of water, 2 h before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Group C (control group) 35 patients will receive similar-looking placebo capsules&#xD;
      (starch capsules) orally with sips of water, 2 h before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Technique and Data Collection: The patients will not be pre-medicated. The study&#xD;
      drugs will be given to patients by another anesthesiologist blinded to the envelops coding.&#xD;
      No IM injections will be administered during the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two days before surgery, patients will visit the outpatient clinic for assessment and&#xD;
      explanation about the study protocol. Laboratory investigations will be performed and&#xD;
      patients will be informed that they can stop participation in the study at any time without&#xD;
      any loss of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside the operating room, standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation) will be attached and the preliminary&#xD;
      values will be recorded. An intravenous cannula 18G will be inserted in the dorsum of the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand. Anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, propofol 1.5-2.0 mg/kg&#xD;
      and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of fasciculations will be assessed by an anesthesiologist blinded to the&#xD;
      patient's group allotment based on a four-point scale: (0) Absent, (1) Mild: fine&#xD;
      fasciculations at the eyes, neck, face or fingers without limb movement, (2) Moderate:&#xD;
      fasciculations occurring bilaterally or obvious limb movement and (3) Severe: widespread,&#xD;
      sustained fasciculations. After end of fasciculations, the values of heart rate, non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be intubated with an appropriate size cuffed endotracheal tube under direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy after complete muscular relaxation. The endotracheal tube then will be fixed at&#xD;
      the appropriate length, by adhesive tape at the angle of the mouth. After 5 minutes of&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, the previous values will be recorded again. Subsequent values will be&#xD;
      recorded every 5 minutes throughout the surgical procedure. Anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
      with oxygen 100% and sevoflurane (2-3 MAC). Atracurium bromide 0.5 mg/kg will be given after&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. The respiratory tidal volume will be adjusted to keep end-tidal CO2&#xD;
      at 35-40 mmHg. All surgical procedures will be completed by the same surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, sevoflurane will be discontinued; residual neuromuscular&#xD;
      blocking agents will be pharmacologically reversed with the standard reversal doses of&#xD;
      neostigmine bromide 0.05 mg/kg in atropine sulphate 0.02 mg/kg. The patients then will be&#xD;
      ventilated by 100% oxygen till full consciousness regains and the patients start following&#xD;
      verbal commands. At that point endotracheal tubes will be removed after gentle suction of&#xD;
      secretions through the tube and the oropharyngeal cavity. After the desired spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation, the patients will be shifted to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PACU, Postoperative care will be standardized for all patients. Pain related to surgical&#xD;
      intervention will be treated with paracetamol 1g intravenously (perfalgan; Bristol-Myers&#xD;
      Squibb, New York, USA) given every 8h in both group. The total dose of analgesic requirement&#xD;
      in the first 24 hours will be recorded. After meeting the discharge criteria, the patients&#xD;
      will be discharged to be taken home and cared for, by a responsible adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and severity of myalgia in all patients will be determined 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery by an anesthesiologist who is unaware of the grouping. Myalgia is defined as &quot;a pain&#xD;
      with no surgical interference&quot; and is graded based on a four-point scale as follows: (0) no&#xD;
      muscle pain, (1) muscle stiffness limited to one area of the body, (2) muscle pain or&#xD;
      stiffness noticed spontaneously by a patient who requires analgesics, and (3) incapacitating&#xD;
      generalized, severe muscle stiffness or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative sedation level will be assessed by the Ramsay sedation score which consists&#xD;
      of the following six grades: (1) anxious and agitated, (2) cooperative, oriented and&#xD;
      tranquil, (3) responding to commands only, (4) brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud&#xD;
      auditory stimulus, (5) sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus,&#xD;
      and (6) no response to light glabellar tap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any complications like postoperative nausea, vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, vertigo,&#xD;
      confusion will be recorded and managed accordingly. Nausea will be treated by 10 mg&#xD;
      metoclopramide intravenously, vomiting will be treated by 4 mg ondansetron intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' Satisfaction: assessment of patients' satisfaction with the overall preoperative&#xD;
      care will be recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be performed using a standard SPSS software package version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois, USA). Data will be expressed as mean ± SD, numbers (n), and median (range). The&#xD;
      demographic data will be analyzed by Student t-test. Male and female data will be analyzed&#xD;
      with the Chi square test. The consumption of analgesia and sedation in groups will be&#xD;
      analyzed by using Student t-test. The incidence and severity of fasciculation and POM will be&#xD;
      analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Pearson's r correlation will be used to test the&#xD;
      correlation between fasciculations and postoperative myalgia. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
