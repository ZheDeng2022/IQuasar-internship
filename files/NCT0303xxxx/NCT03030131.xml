  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer related-deaths worldwide, with an overall&#xD;
      all-stage 5-year survival of approximately 17%. The primary treatment of early stage (I-IIIA)&#xD;
      NSCLC is curative surgery. Although patients treated with curative surgery have a better&#xD;
      prognosis, the 5-year survival for patients treated with surgery alone remains low, ranging&#xD;
      from 67% (stage IA) to 23% (stage IIIA). Several randomized trials comparing postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy have shown a significant overall survival benefit from&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy in completely resected patients with NSCLC stage II and IIIA.&#xD;
      Likewise other randomized trials have demonstrated preoperative chemotherapy improves&#xD;
      survival and recently the analyses also based on individual patients data of 15 randomized&#xD;
      trials showed a significant benefit of preoperative chemotherapy on survival with the same&#xD;
      survival improvement of 5% at 5 years. Then, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also become&#xD;
      accepted in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting of PD-1 receptors and its ligand PD-L1, and inhibiting their engagement is an&#xD;
      attractive therapeutic option in the early stage NSCLC, which may reactivate host immune&#xD;
      responses and enable longterm tumor control.&#xD;
