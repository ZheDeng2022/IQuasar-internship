  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether tear secretion in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease will be altered to exhibit a characteristic or diagnostic biomarker profile, that&#xD;
      will be reflected in changes in the protein composition of tear fluid, which can be measured&#xD;
      relatively easily, cost-effectively, and non-invasively. Tear fluid samples will be collected&#xD;
      from Parkinson's patients, and through biochemical assays, the profile of proteins in tears&#xD;
      will be characterized and compared to that from control subjects. The profiles will be&#xD;
      analyzed with respect to any differences between Parkinson's patients and control subjects.&#xD;
      If differences appear, the levels of these potential biomarkers in Parkinson's patients will&#xD;
      be compared to the severity of their disease.&#xD;
