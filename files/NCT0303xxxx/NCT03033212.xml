    <textblock>
      This investigation will assess how the timing and type of rehabilitation after a&#xD;
      transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion will affect the efficacy of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      The efficacy of the procedure will be evaluated through patients' quality of life, measured&#xD;
      by health-related quality of life questionnaires up to 24 months following the procedure.&#xD;
      These measures will be compared to the patients' baseline value.&#xD;

      Patients will undergo transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative pathology at&#xD;
      the L4-5 vertebral level. They will be randomized to one of three postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation groups. Group 1 will receive &quot;structured early rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 7&#xD;
      weeks. Group 2 will receive &quot;Delayed rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 13 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
      Group 3 will undergo &quot;Self Rehabilitation&quot; beginning at 7 weeks postoperatively. Groups 1 and&#xD;
      2 will undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of a certified physical therapist for 10&#xD;
      total weeks. Group 3 will undergo non-supervised rehabilitation for 10 total weeks, and will&#xD;
      be given educational materials regarding which exercises to perform and at which intervals.&#xD;
