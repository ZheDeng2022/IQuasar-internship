  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer remains a worldwide big killer with a rate of deaths compared with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cases not lower than 20%. Mammography is the primary imaging modality for the early&#xD;
      detection of clinically occult breast cancer. Mammography is established as the primary&#xD;
      investigation for population-based breast cancer screening. Advances in mammographic&#xD;
      technique regarding both hardware and software applications are still not sufficient to&#xD;
      overcome mammography's limitation with regard to both sensitivity and specificity. Depending&#xD;
      on several factors, such as age and breast density, mammography screening is associated with&#xD;
      a false-negative rate of 10-20 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (TS) is a novel technique that is able to study the breast using&#xD;
      3D reconstructions of the tissue from multiple low-dose digital mammographic images acquired&#xD;
      in several planes in a 15 to 50 degree angle. This process aims at a increasing the number of&#xD;
      lesion visible due to the reduction of overlapping breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In TS, to overcome these limitations, a digital mammography (DM) unit is modified to allow&#xD;
      the X-ray tube to move through a proscribed arc of excursion acquiring a fixed number of&#xD;
      discrete projection images while the breast remains in compression. The individual projection&#xD;
      images are extremely low in dose, so the composite dose incurred during a TS acquisition may&#xD;
      be similar to that of a standard 2D mammography. The radiologically dense breasts are&#xD;
      associated with decreased sensitivity of mammography, both in the clinical and screening&#xD;
      setting as well as its established association with breast cancer risk. The systematic&#xD;
      application of ultrasound (US) in women with radiologically dense breasts and negative&#xD;
      mammogram has been shown to be associated with an additional cancer detection rate [7,8,9].&#xD;
      Incremental ultrasound detection of cancer may be considered in the range of 0.27% to 0.52%&#xD;
      of ultrasound-screened women in different density categories [10]. In addition, the main&#xD;
      limitation of US in breast screening is represented by false- positive findings. These&#xD;
      findings result in additional investigation or unnecessary surgical biopsy [10].&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study aims to demonstrate at least statistical equivalence, or non-significant difference&#xD;
      between TS and US in women with dense breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the equivalence between TS and US will be demonstrated, US may be substituted by TS with&#xD;
      great benefits for the patients and for the healthcare resources we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess if TS may detect additional cancers in dense breasts that approximate US&#xD;
           detection capability but with less false positive findings than US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If TS detects new cancers in dense breasts similarly to US (approximate rate or&#xD;
           marginally lower rate), evaluate the true positive/false positive ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost-analysis. In case of less false positives detected by TS, the TP/ FP trade-off&#xD;
           might be strongly in favour of TS with a great potential of costs reduction.&#xD;
