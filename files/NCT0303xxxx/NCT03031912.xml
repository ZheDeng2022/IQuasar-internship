  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-site, double-blind trial of V920&#xD;
      (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) Ebola Virus vaccine candidate in subjects with HIV infection to be&#xD;
      conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. The study will take place at 2&#xD;
      Canadian sites (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal and Ottawa General Hospital)&#xD;
      and 2 African sites (Centre MURAZ, Burkina Faso and Centre Hospitalier National Aristide Le&#xD;
      Dantec, Dakar, Senegal). The Duration of Study: 365 days for each participant not including&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 200 participants, ~100 at 2 sites in Canada and ~100 at 2&#xD;
      sites in Africa. Overall ~160 participants will receive the study vaccine and 40 will receive&#xD;
      a placebo . Sequential enrollment of four study cohorts will occur over time at each study&#xD;
      site according to CD4 T-cell counts: Group 1 will include adult subjects with CD4 ≥ 500&#xD;
      cells/mm3, Group 2 CD4 &gt; 350 and &lt; 500 cells/mm3, Group 3 CD4 ≥ 200 and ≤ 350 cells/mm3, and&#xD;
      Group 4 adolescents CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3. Enrolment and vaccine administration will begin with&#xD;
      the group with the highest CD4 count. When the D42 post-vaccination period is completed for&#xD;
      all subjects in Group 1, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has reviewed the safety&#xD;
      data and determined that there are no concerns, enrolment and vaccination of the next CD4&#xD;
      cohort may begin. Similarly, when the D42 safety data for Group 2 has been reviewed/approved&#xD;
      by the DSMB, enrolment and vaccination of participants in Group 3 may begin. Adolescents&#xD;
      13-17 years of age (inclusive) with CD4 ≥ 200 will be enrolled after D42 safety is reviewed&#xD;
      in adults with CD4 ≥ 200. Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive one dose of ≥2 x 107 pfu of the study vaccine or the placebo in a ratio of 4 to 1&#xD;
      (160:40). Participants will complete memory aids for 42 days following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific procedures to be performed during the trial, as well as their prescribed times and&#xD;
      associated visit windows, are outlined in the Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0. Details of each&#xD;
      procedure are provided in Section 7.0 - Trial Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will use an adaptive design based on pre-specified criteria, using an independent,&#xD;
      external DSMB to monitor safety and immunogenicity. There will be 3 formal safety analyses&#xD;
      performed by the DSMB. Data for at least 75% of participants must be available for each&#xD;
      analysis. The first safety analysis will be conducted when the first group (CD4 ≥ 500&#xD;
      cells/mm3) will have completed 42 days of follow-up post vaccination. The second safety&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted when the second group (CD4 &gt; 350 and &lt; 500 cells/mm3) will have&#xD;
      completed 42 days of follow-up post vaccination. The third safety analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      when the third group (Adults CD4 ≥ 200 and ≤ 350 cells/mm3) will have completed 42 days of&#xD;
      follow-up post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the safety analysis will be reviewed by the DSMB, which will make recommendations&#xD;
      to the Sponsor to continue, modify or end the trial according to the plan described briefly&#xD;
      in Section 2.2 - Trial Diagram and in detail in Section 8.0 - Statistical Analysis Plan. In&#xD;
      case of an outbreak of Ebola Zaire the DSMB may recommend to vaccinate subjects randomized to&#xD;
      receive placebo with V920 provided at least 84 days of SAE follow-up is conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Measure the immunogenicity of V920 via ZEBOV- specific antibody responses induced by V920 at D28 in HIV-infected adults and adolescents.&#xD;
The V920 vaccine candidate is a live recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV). Two independent assays are currently being utilized in the clinical development program to clinically evaluate the immunogenicity of V920:&#xD;
GP-ELISA measures the total IgG antibody response and can also be correlated to the plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) titer result.&#xD;
Plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) is a functional assay and a gold standard platform in the field for quantitating the neutralizing antibody response elicited by the vaccine.</description>

    <description>The rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is a live attenuated recombinant virus consisting of a single recombinant VSV isolate (11481 nt, strain Indiana) with the gene for the Zaire ebolavirus GP (ZEBOV GP), Kikwit strain replacing the gene for the VSV GP, which has been deleted. This results in a VSV backbone with the ZEBOV GP constituting the envelope of the virus.</description>
