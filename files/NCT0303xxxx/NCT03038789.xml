  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, prospective, non-interventional, regulatory postmarketing surveillance&#xD;
      study. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are initiating Xigduo XR as indicated&#xD;
      by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) will be included.&#xD;

      -  Primary objective: Descriptive analysis of the proportion (%) of adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
           serious adverse events (SAEs), unexpected adverse events∙adverse drug reactions and AEs&#xD;
           of special interest (AESI) in patients who are treated with Xigduo XR for type 2&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus by physicians in the normal clinical practice setting over a period of&#xD;
           12 or 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: To follow the changes of values of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting&#xD;
           plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hr post-prandial glucose (PPG-2hr), blood pressure, abdominal&#xD;
           circumference and body weight and self-reported data in this cohort of patients from&#xD;
           baseline to completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xigduo XR in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus based on conducted laboratory test (Laboratory tests are not mandatory because of&#xD;
      the non-interventional nature of this study)&#xD;

        Adult patients who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) eligible for the&#xD;
        treatment with Xigduo XR according to prescription information approved by MFDS and as&#xD;

             septicemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, lactic acidosis, or acute or chronic metabolic&#xD;

             and computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with severe infection or severe traumatism&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In terms of Surgical procedures (except minor procedures not associated with&#xD;

             capsular insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with impaired hepatic function (Since impaired hepatic function has been&#xD;
             associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, this drug should generally be avoided&#xD;
             in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.), respiratory&#xD;
             failure, acute myocardial infarction, acute or chronic disease causing histotoxic&#xD;
             hypoxia like shock, an alcoholic, gastroenteric trouble (anhydremia, diarrhea,&#xD;
             vomiting and etc.)&#xD;
