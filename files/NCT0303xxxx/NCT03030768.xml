  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greatest burden of the HIV-1 epidemic lies in sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of infections occur in long-term heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant partnerships.&#xD;
      Such couples face a difficult dilemma when considering their desire to have children: forego&#xD;
      condom use, attempt to conceive and risk HIV-1 transmission or continue condom use and&#xD;
      relinquish their childbearing desires. Based on evidence from rigorous clinical trials&#xD;
      demonstrating the strong efficacy of individual interventions for HIV-1 prevention and&#xD;
      formative work with HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and clinicians with expertise in HIV-1&#xD;
      prevention and reproductive health in the Kenyan context, this study pilots a safer&#xD;
      conception intervention that focuses on antiretrovirals (as antiretroviral therapy [ART]&#xD;
      taken by the HIV-1 infected partner and pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] taken by the HIV-1&#xD;
      uninfected partner) and timed condomless sex. Additional strategies for couples include&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of STIs and male circumcision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHealth tools, including SMS and mobile applications are novel and very popular among Kenyans&#xD;
      to ease the burden of addressing health problems. This safer conception intervention&#xD;
      incorporates mHealth tools to improve couples' experiences tracking fertility indicators and&#xD;
      communicating with providers about their readiness to practice safer conception. SMS surveys&#xD;
      to collect daily information from women about their fertility signs and SMS messages are used&#xD;
      to reinforce HIV-1 prevention, including condom use for couples during periods that do not&#xD;
      have a high likelihood of fertility. An in-clinic mobile application is used to improve&#xD;
      clinician-patient counseling and assessments of couple readiness to practice safer&#xD;
      conception. To inform future engagement of mHealth tools, the investigators will&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate clinician and patient experiences using SMS surveys and the tablet&#xD;
      application. Couples with immediate fertility intentions will be followed longitudinally,&#xD;
      allowing careful tracking of pregnancy and HIV-1 incidence. The study takes place in Thika,&#xD;
      Kenya.&#xD;

      Overall Design This is an open-label, prospective cohort pilot study of HIV-1 serodiscordant&#xD;
      couples with immediate fertility desires. The overall goal is to determine uptake and&#xD;
      sustained use of safer conception strategies, strategies for HIV-1 risk reduction during&#xD;
      periods when couples attempt to conceive a child. The study offers PrEP (daily oral TDF or&#xD;
      FTC/TDF) to the HIV-1 uninfected member of the couple, ART to the HIV-1 infected member of&#xD;
      the couple, teach women about tracking fertility indicators and predicting upcoming periods&#xD;
      of peak fertility, and work with couples to establish their readiness to practice timed&#xD;
      condomless sex. mHealth tools will be integrated to capture fertility indicators, sexual&#xD;
      behavior, improve patient-provider communication, and remind couples about their upcoming&#xD;
      periods with peak fertility. The investigators will conduct mixed-methods work to understand&#xD;
      couples experiences practicing safer conception and couples and providers experiences using&#xD;
      the mHealth tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine uptake (and adherence, when applicable) of each component of an integrated&#xD;
           safer conception intervention among HIV-1 serodiscordant couples, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Use of PrEP by the HIV-1 uninfected partner&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Use of ART by the HIV-1 infected partner&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Menstrual cycle monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patterns of condom use&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. STI treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Medical male circumcision, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Vaginal self-insemination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine rates of pregnancy and HIV-1 incidence among HIV-1 serodiscordant couples&#xD;
           participating in a safer conception intervention pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine which fertility indicators - including onset of menses, basal body&#xD;
           temperature, vaginal mucus characteristics, results from luteinizing hormone tests - are&#xD;
           most feasible for Kenyan women in HIV-1 serodiscordant partnerships to monitor via SMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To obtain user feedback about mHealth tools designed to improve patient experience with&#xD;
           safer conception including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Women's experiences tracking fertility signs through SMS and&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Couples' and provider's experiences using a clinic-based tablet application that&#xD;
                encompasses clinical, laboratory and fertility data to improve patient-provider&#xD;
                communication about safer conception readiness&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Women and men's experiences receiving SMS messages with personalized safer&#xD;
                conception reminders&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess participant experiences with an mHealth-enhanced safer conception intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits will take place at screening and enrollment, monthly prior to pregnancy and&#xD;
      quarterly during pregnancy, for up to 12 months or the end of pregnancy, whichever comes&#xD;
      later. Couples will move from a preparatory period into a peri-conception period once they&#xD;
      decide to practice timed condomless sex, based on discussions with study clinicians and&#xD;
      counselors. They will move from peri-conception to pregnancy once pregnancy occurs or from&#xD;
      peri-conception to study exit if pregnancy does not occur within 12 months of study&#xD;
      enrollment. During the preparatory and peri-conception periods, women will receive daily SMS&#xD;
      surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, both members of couples will undergo HIV-1 testing to verify HIV-1&#xD;
      serodiscordancy and women will have a pregnancy test. Demographic, behavioral and medical&#xD;
      information will be collected, along with additional laboratory results to establish&#xD;
      eligibility (for HIV-1 uninfected partners - serum creatinine, hepatitis B surface antigen).&#xD;
      Couples' fertility desires will be assessed and medical history will include information&#xD;
      about current use of contraceptives and menstrual cycle regularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, members of couples will separately complete interviewer-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess their pre-intervention knowledge, perceptions of, and barriers to&#xD;
      safer conception strategies and gather data on their demographic and medical characteristics,&#xD;
      sexual behavior and any current contraception and/or antiretroviral use. Both partners will&#xD;
      undergo diagnostic testing and treatment of genital infections, including gonorrhea,&#xD;
      chlamydia, trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis (BV, if there are symptoms). HIV-1 uninfected&#xD;
      partners will be re-tested to verify their HIV-1 status and assessed for acute HIV-1&#xD;
      infection. Women will be tested for pregnancy. HIV-1 infected partners will have specimen&#xD;
      collected for CD4 and plasma viral load quantification. Physical exams will be conducted for&#xD;
      both partners. Social harm will also be assessed in a culturally appropriate manner and&#xD;
      captured on validated case report forms. Safer conception behavioral counseling will be in&#xD;
      addition to couples counseling for HIV-1 prevention that fosters an understanding of HIV-1&#xD;
      serodiscordancy and negotiation of safer sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily SMS surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after enrollment, women will begin to receive daily SMS surveys to assess fertility&#xD;
      signs and sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete follow up visits to track their compliance with the intervention&#xD;
      strategies and study procedures. Participants will be scheduled for monthly study visits&#xD;
      during the preparatory and peri-conception periods and quarterly during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Participants can move from the preparatory period to peri-conception based on their own&#xD;
      desires and counseling from a clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the end of pregnancy or 12 months after study enrollment (whichever is later),&#xD;
      couples will be exited from the study. At study exit, couples will be counseled about their&#xD;
      current fertility goals (which may have changed throughout the course of follow up,&#xD;
      especially for couples who become pregnant and have a child during the study period) and&#xD;
      offered contraception and referrals for ongoing services, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain a deeper understanding of how participants perceive the integrated safer conception&#xD;
      intervention and the mHealth components that are part of the intervention, we will conduct&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with up to 40 couples. Interview topics will include: identification of&#xD;
      factors influencing individuals' preferences for safer conception strategies, their&#xD;
      experience with safer conception strategies, and their intentions for continued use of these&#xD;
      strategies should they desire pregnancy again and user satisfaction with the mHealth tools&#xD;
      and suggestions for improvement.&#xD;
