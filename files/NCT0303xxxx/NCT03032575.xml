      1. To determine the prevalence and incidence of anal HSIL and associated risk factors among&#xD;
      MSM who initiate ART during AHI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM).1-3 HIV-positive MSM have a higher prevalence of anal HPV infection than HIV-negative&#xD;
      MSM and are more likely to have infection with multiple HPV types.1,2 Spontaneous clearance&#xD;
      of anal HPV infection is less common among HIV- positive compared with HIV-negative MSM.2&#xD;
      Persistent anal HPV infection, particularly with high-risk HPV types, is an important risk&#xD;
      factor for the development of anal cancer.4-6 The incidence of anal cancer among HIV-positive&#xD;
      MSM is very high, ranging from 75 to 137 per 100,000 person-years, and is five times higher&#xD;
      than that in HIV-negative MSM.7-10 Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is&#xD;
      the putative precursor of anal cancer.11-13 Anal squamous intraepithelial lesion has a&#xD;
      dynamic picture of temporal progression and regression, but HSIL is much less likely to&#xD;
      regress than low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL).10,14 A recent systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis showed the pooled prevalence of anal HSIL to be 29.1% in&#xD;
      HIV-positive MSM and 21.5% in HIV-negative MSM.15 Anal HSIL incidence ranged from 8.5 to&#xD;
      15.4% per year in HIV-positive MSM and 3.3 to 6.0% per year in HIV-negative MSM. Although&#xD;
      data are limited, previous studies have shown a 9-15% progression rate from anal HSIL to anal&#xD;
      cancer during a median follow-up of 3 - 5 years. 11-13 Previous research at the Thai Red&#xD;
      Cross AIDS Research Centre has demonstrated high rates of HPV infection and anal HSIL among&#xD;
      Thai MSM, with HIV-positive MSM disproportionately affected. Prevalence of anal infection&#xD;
      with high-risk HPV types was 57.5% in HIV-positive and 36.6% in HIV-negative MSM (p =&#xD;
      0.008).16 Prevalence of anal HSIL was 18.9% in HIV-positive MSM and 11.4% in HIV-negative MSM&#xD;
      (p = 0.1), while incidence of anal HSIL over 12 months was 29% and 8%, respectively&#xD;
      (p=0.001).17 HIV-positive MSM in that study, however, were mainly na√Øve to antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) at enrollment (87% not on ART) and only 10% had undetectable HIV viral load at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not clear if the higher rates of HPV infection and persistence of infection are due to&#xD;
      HIV infection or to different risk behavior among HIV-positive MSM. Data are inconclusive on&#xD;
      whether the use of ART has an effect on anal HPV infection among HIV-positive MSM.18-19&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is no data on the effect that &quot;early diagnosis&quot; of HIV infection and&#xD;
      &quot;early treatment&quot; with ART might have on incidence and persistence of HPV infection or on the&#xD;
      development of anal HSIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a longitudinal, observational study of HPV infection and anal HSIL among&#xD;
      HIV-positive Thai MSM who initiate ART during acute HIV infection (AHI). The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that early HIV diagnosis and early ART within the first 4 weeks of infection will mitigate&#xD;
      immunological and virological factors that increase HPV persistence and anal HSIL incidence&#xD;
      in HIV-positive MSM such that these measure will be significantly lower when compared to&#xD;
      historical controls of chronically-infected HIV-positive Thai MSM.&#xD;

    <description>The prevalence of anal HSIL and the incidence of anal HSIL during the follow-up period. Anal HSIL is diagnosed based on histology specimen. A composite anal HSIL outcome (including both cytologic HSIL/ASC-H and histologic HSIL) will also be used.&#xD;
Incidence of HSIL during the follow-up period will be calculated as the number of new diagnoses per person time at risk. 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to identify factors associated with incident HSIL.</description>

    <description>Study Design: This is a prospective observational cohort of Thai MSM who initiated ART at the time of AHI, defined as the first 30 days after HIV acquisition (Fiebig stages 1 through 5). Volunteers will be examined at baseline to determine the prevalence of HPV infection and HSIL at HIV diagnosis. They will then be followed longitudinally for new incidence of HPV and HSIL, as well as progression or regression of existing lesions.</description>
