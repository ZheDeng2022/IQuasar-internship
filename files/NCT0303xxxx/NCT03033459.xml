      Breastfeeding is good for the health of both mother and baby, but many women do not&#xD;
      breastfeed, or do not breastfeed for as long as they would like. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to compare two types of interventions on how they impact breastfeeding. The interventions&#xD;
      will be given during the third trimester of pregnancy, and the intervention is individual&#xD;
      (i.e., one therapist and one participant). The first intervention is Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing, a type of counseling. The second intervention, or &quot;control group,&quot; is education&#xD;
      on how babies grow and develop. There general aims of this study are to compare women in the&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing group and control group on how they plan to feed their babies, how&#xD;
      much they learn about and their opinions about breastfeeding, and how much they learn about&#xD;
      how babies grow and develop. In addition, the groups will be compared as to whether they&#xD;
      start breastfeeding, and how they are feeding their baby when the baby is one month old.&#xD;

      1. Recruitment efforts will be made in the community via advertisements, online&#xD;
           advertisements (e.g., Craigslist, Facebook), and in-person at various clinics and health&#xD;
           fairs in the geographic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective participants will contact the investigators via email or by calling the&#xD;
           study phone number listed on the advertisements or verbally expressing interest&#xD;
           in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once a participant indicates interest by contacting study personnel, a 5-minute&#xD;
           screening interview will be conducted with the prospective participant using the&#xD;
           screening questionnaire to ensure eligibility criteria are met. For those who do not&#xD;
           qualify or agree to participate, the age and reason for non-qualification or declination&#xD;
           to participate will be recorded; any other data will be destroyed by shredding or&#xD;
           electronic shredding. For those who do qualify, name and contact information will be&#xD;
           kept confidential and maintained in a locked room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will be asked to rate on a scale of -10 to +10 about their certainty that&#xD;
           they will provide exclusive breastmilk to their babies for first six months. Responses&#xD;
           from this item will be used as the covariate in the covariate adaptive randomization&#xD;
           technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eligible subjects will be invited to participate in the study, either in an exam room at&#xD;
           West Virginia University's Family Medicine's clinic, participant's home, private room in&#xD;
           the Quin Curtis Center for Psychological Services, or in another agreed-upon community&#xD;
           location (e.g., church). The location of the study procedures is chosen by the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At the start of this session, participants will be given an overview of the study, and&#xD;
           the researcher will go over the consent form with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Following consent procedures, video-recording will begin, and all participants will&#xD;
           complete the prenatal interview. After this interview, participants will complete five&#xD;
           self-report measures, which include the Infant Feeding Knowledge Form, the Iowa Infant&#xD;
           Feeding Attitudes Scale, Brief Breastfeeding Attitudes Questions, Perinatal Anxiety&#xD;
           Screening Scale, and the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Participants assigned to the MI condition will receive an approximately 45 minute&#xD;
                intervention provided a masters-level supervised psychologist with training in&#xD;
                Motivational Interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participants who have been randomly assigned to participate in the&#xD;
                attention-control group session will receive approximately 45 minutes of&#xD;
                psychoeducation on typical developmental stages and infant feeding methods.&#xD;

    <description>Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a psychosocial intervention designed to help individuals increase readiness for behavior change by increasing intrinsic motivation and resolving ambivalence. MI founders MI conversations help clients change behavior through identifying and resolving discrepancies between goal behaviors and actual behaviors. Behavior change is promoted through the elicitation of &quot;change talk,&quot; or client-verbalized arguments for change. In MI, change talk is elicited through two major components: the therapeutic relationship, or the embodiment of the &quot;spirit&quot; of MI, and technical skill.</description>
