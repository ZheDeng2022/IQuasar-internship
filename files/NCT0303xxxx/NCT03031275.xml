      Follow-up after treatment with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) at the ECMO Center&#xD;
      Karolinska.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: adult survivors treated with ECMO for severe refractory respiratory failure at&#xD;
      least 5 years earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations: brain and pulmonary radiographic morphology, cognitive testing, pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing, exercise tolerance, quality of life and mood disorder screening.&#xD;

      All adult patients treated at the ECMO Center Karolinska between 1995 and July 2009 were&#xD;
      screened for eligibility in January 2014. Patients living abroad (including non-Swedish&#xD;
      citizens), patients treated for non-respiratory conditions, diseased patients and patients&#xD;
      with a known pre-ECMO mental handicap were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were contacted, and patients who agreed to participate gave their written&#xD;
      informed consent. All studied patients underwent the same study protocol during a day at the&#xD;
      hospital, including a clinical interview, MRI scan of the brain, HRCT scan of the thorax,&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing, neuropsychological examination, walking test, self assessment&#xD;
      questionnaires for quality of life, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts were reviewed for relevant clinical information, including age, gender, ECMO&#xD;
      mode (venovenous or venoarterial), time in hospital, on ECMO, non-ECMO ICU and on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation; preexisting diseases, blood gas values and ventilator settings before initiation&#xD;
      of ECMO treatment. Hand written clinical data from the patients´ charts from every hour with&#xD;
      ECMO treatment was reviewed for ventilator settings, lung volumes, mean arterial pressure,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, lactate and oxygenation parameters during an observation period, which was&#xD;
      defined as the first 10 days on ECMO (or the entire treatment period if shorter than 10&#xD;
      days). This information was added to a digital database for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of ECMO treatment, arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured by&#xD;
      peripheral pulse oximetry from the right ear, finger or nose. Venous preoxygenator lactate&#xD;
      and venous saturation values were used as indicators of sufficient (lactate &lt; 2 mmol l-1 ,&#xD;
      SvO2 ≥ 70%) or insufficient tissue perfusion.&#xD;
