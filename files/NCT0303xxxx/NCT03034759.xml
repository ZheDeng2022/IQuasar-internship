  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to test the efficacy of a new method for determining individual insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (IS) based on sensor-augmented-insulin pump (SAP) data in order to customize the insulin to&#xD;
      carbohydrate ratio (CR) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the individual insulin sensitivity (IS) could only be investigated by intensive and&#xD;
      invasive research techniques that are not feasible to perform in an outpatient setting for&#xD;
      pediatric patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an algorithm to calculate the&#xD;
      patient specific insulin sensitivity to customize the CR for adult patients with T1D. The&#xD;
      algorithm has been validated in adult patients, however not yet investigated in the pediatric&#xD;
      population with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to customize the CR of pediatric subjects with T1D using the individualized insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity index (ISind) to improve post-prandial blood glucose control after a&#xD;
           standard meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to test, under free living condition (at home), the efficacy of the customized CR in&#xD;
           improving post-prandial glycemic control for pediatric subjects with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach would have at least two potential benefits for pediatric patients with T1D:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide a non-invasive tool for individualizing their home insulin therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To offer a reliable instrument for adjusting the meal bolus of the current hybrid closed&#xD;
           loop (HCL) systems to account for the inter-subject variability in insulin action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new method to assess insulin sensitivity (IS) has been proposed and investigated by the PI&#xD;
      and his group at the University of Padova. The new insulin sensitivity index, named &quot;SISP&quot; is&#xD;
      calculated from data derived from insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      uploads. The efficiency of the SISP has been tested in-silico using the University of&#xD;
      Virginia/Padova T1D simulator by mimicking a single-meal scenario with patient-specific&#xD;
      optimized carbohydrate ratio (CR) (increased or decreased by 20%) and optimal CR. In all the&#xD;
      simulations the use of the optimal CR, calculated with the proposed method, has improved the&#xD;
      overall glycemic control. The simulator (S2013) used for this purpose has been valdated and&#xD;
      is approved by the FDA as a substitute for preclinical trials for insulin treatments,&#xD;
      including closed-loop algorithms. It is comprised of data from 100 in-silico patients that&#xD;
      represent the biological variability of a generic real diabetic population. Thus, an&#xD;
      algorithm that is tuned on the basis of in-silico analysis can be safely implemented in&#xD;
      real-life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method to estimate SISP and to optimize the CR from SAP data, could be easily applied to&#xD;
      the daily management of patients with T1D and in a closed-loop context since several&#xD;
      closed-loop algorithms, currently used in clinical trials, are based on the pre-programmed&#xD;
      open-loop insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the individualized SISP is calculated, it can be used to customize the CR using the&#xD;
      in-silico tested algorithm to determine an individualized CR (CRIND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the CRIND can be tested in outpatient setting safely, and adjusted in a&#xD;
      run-to-run framework, using a well described approach of self-learning, the latter allowing&#xD;
      titration of the insulin therapy based on CGM data using a self-learning algorithm as&#xD;
      previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: &quot;Control period&quot;. This phase represents the control frame-time, during which&#xD;
           patients, once enrolled, will use their SAP without any adjustment of the CR and&#xD;
           correction factors, according to the parameters recorded at the screening visit. This&#xD;
           phase is aimed to record the CGM data and will represent the control period of the&#xD;
           study. It lasts 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: &quot;Build-up period&quot; This phase is aimed to obtain an adequate amount of data for&#xD;
           customizing the insulin pump parameters to the specific features of each subject&#xD;
           according to the proposed algorithms. It consists of three standardized meals (Figure 2)&#xD;
           and a run-in phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to two different pre-meal insulin CR groups in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to determine parameters that will be used to adjust the IS algorithm for pediatric patients&#xD;
      with T1D. The post-prandial blood glucose pattern after a pre-meal bolus of CR, CR 20%&#xD;
      increased, CR 20% decreased are validated parameters necessary to customize the algorithm for&#xD;
      a specific patient population with T1D, therefore subjects will be challenged with two&#xD;
      different CRs, depending on the randomization, to collect sufficient data to fine tune the&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will go through three meal studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Meal 1: CR with 20% increase; Meal 2: CR home; Meal 3: CR individualized Group 2.&#xD;
      Meal 1: CR with 20% decrease; Meal 2: CR home; Meal 3:CR individualized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the 1st meal subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a modified premeal&#xD;
           bolus (increased or decreased of 20%, CR+/-20%) in a 1:1 ratio. This change of the home&#xD;
           CR (CRHOME) will allow us to estimate the accuracy and error of the CRHOME and to&#xD;
           calculate, according to the described algorithm ((21) and below), the optimized CR&#xD;
           (CRIND). This latter will be tested in both groups as third meal at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The three meals are followed by a 7 day- run-in period necessary to collect a minimum&#xD;
           amount of CGM data to run the algorithm calculations used in the intervention phase.&#xD;
           During this period subjects will adopt the CRIND obtained after the standard meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: &quot;Intervention period&quot;. This phase is aimed to test the efficacy of the CRIND on&#xD;
           mitigating post-prandial hyperglycemia by a home-based study, using periodical&#xD;
           adjustment of CR and basal rate according to the &quot;run-to-run&quot; approach. It consists of a&#xD;
           self-learning algorithm method to adjust insulin regimen (the basal rate and the CRIND)&#xD;
           based on CGM post-meal blood glucose patterns and pre-meal insulin bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will use the SAP tuned according to the individualized ISR2R and CRR2R obtained from&#xD;
      the run-in period, along with an individualized insulin basal rate (BasalR2R). During the&#xD;
      run-to-run period subjects will receive weekly revised parameters based on run-to-run&#xD;
      algorithm according to data analysis of the past seven days. It will last 3 weeks.&#xD;
