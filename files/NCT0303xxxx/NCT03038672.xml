  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without varlilumab works in treating&#xD;
      patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas that have come back (recurrent) or do not respond&#xD;
      to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as varlilumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the anti-tumor activity of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and&#xD;
      nivolumab as compared to nivolumab alone in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) based on the lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy&#xD;
      criteria or LYRIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability profile of treatment with a combination of CDX-1127&#xD;
      (varlilumab) and nivolumab in patients with advanced aggressive B-cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of combination therapy with CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab on&#xD;
      the immune system as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mass cytometry (CyTOF), changes&#xD;
      in serum cytokine profile and immunogenicity assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of CDX-1127 (varlilumab) and nivolumab when used&#xD;
      in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 4&#xD;
      months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may cross over to Group II at the time of disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive varlilumab IV over 90 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 months and every 4 weeks for a total of up to 2 years&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by computed tomography (CT)-based criteria or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT based criteria. A response will be defined as an objective status of partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) for patients evaluated by CT-based criteria and complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR) for patients evaluated by PET-CT based criteria. Exact binomial ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated in each arm. Comparison of overall response rates between the two treatment groups will be performed using a one-sided Fisher's exact test at significance level 0.15.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a PR or CR for patients evaluated by CT-based criteria or CMR or PMR for patients evaluated by PET-CT based criteria to the earliest date progression (documentation of disease progression [PMD] or progressive disease [PD]) is documented. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The comparison of duration of response between two treatment arms will be based on the log-rank test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival time</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to death due to any cause, assessed for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The comparison of overall survival between two treatment arms will be based on the log-rank test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression (PMD or PD) or death due to any cause, assessed for up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The comparison of progression-free survival between two treatment arms will be based on the log-rank test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The overall adverse event rates for grade 3 or higher hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events at least possibly related to treatment will be compared between the two treatment groups using the Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if the data in the contingency table is sparse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CD27 expression in tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by immunohistochemistry. Will be both graphically and quantitatively summarized and explored. Standard paired comparisons methodologies (Wilcoxon signed rank and McNemar's tests) will be used to assess changes in these variables before and after therapy. In addition, baseline values and changes over time in each measure will be explored in relation to clinical outcome. Differences between responders and non-responders will be assessed using Wilcoxon's rank sum (continuous data) or Fisher's exact (categorical data) test. The relationship between each measure and time to event measures (PFS, overall survival [OS]) will be evaluated using Cox's proportional hazards models and log-rank tests. Logistic regression will be used to model the response rate as a function of treatment and CD27 (as a continuous variable). The distribution of CD27 will be estimated empirically in the entire trial population and used to calculate CD27 values corresponding to each fixed percentile.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in peripheral blood immune cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). The relationship between presence/absence of a particular subtype of cell and association with outcomes will be evaluated. Evaluation of particular combinations of immune cells (immune signature) and whether they are predictive of outcome will also be evaluated. Will be both graphically and quantitatively summarized and explored. Standard paired comparisons methodologies (Wilcoxon signed rank and McNemar's tests) will be used to assess changes in these variables before and after therapy. In addition, baseline values and changes over time in each measure will be explored in relation to clinical outcome.

             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;

             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;

             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are&#xD;
