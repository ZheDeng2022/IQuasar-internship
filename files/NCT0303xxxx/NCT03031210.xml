      The aim of this study will be to evaluate whether a twice-daily antibiotic regimen is&#xD;
      non-inferior to a thrice-daily regimen for the treatment of non-severe community acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia in children presenting at a paediatric Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, non-blinded, pragmatic, randomized-controlled, non-inferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital&#xD;
      ED. All patients three months old to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of&#xD;
      non-severe community acquired pneumonia based on respiratory complaints and a pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrate identified by trained paediatricians or emergency physicians will be eligible to&#xD;
      the present study. Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive either&#xD;
      amoxicillin (90mg/kg per day) in twice or thrice daily regimen. Primary outcome will be&#xD;
      treatment failure within 10 days of enrolment as defined by hospitalisation, need for a&#xD;
      change in antibiotic (persistence of fever at 72 hours, clinical deterioration, comorbid&#xD;
      condition or development of serious adverse reactions) and death. ED revisits within 72&#xD;
      hours, second course of antibiotic and clinical recurrence rates will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      follow-up assessments as well as percent of adverse events encountered, number of days missed&#xD;
      (work, school or daycare), coverage vaccination rate, protocol adherence and patient and&#xD;
      parental satisfaction. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
      Per-protocol analysis will also be carried to compare the failure rate. Accounting to a&#xD;
      maximal 10% drop-off rate, a sample size of 685 participants per arm was calculated to have a&#xD;
      power of 90% to identify a difference of ≤ 5% with an alpha value of 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>As a primary outcome, clinical failure will be defined by any of the following occurring within 10 days of enrolment:&#xD;
Death or hospitalisation&#xD;
A need for a change in antibiotic according to the treating physician. In our settings, common reasons to change antibiotic are:&#xD;
Persistence of fever at 72h&#xD;
Clinical deterioration:&#xD;
• Clinical deterioration will include the development of lower chest-wall indrawing, central cyanosis, stridor while calm, or danger signs as defined by: inability to drink or breastfeed, convulsions, persistent vomiting, lethargy, or unconsciousness at any time during a child's treatment.&#xD;
Development of a comorbid condition such as a meningitis, bacteriemia, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis&#xD;
