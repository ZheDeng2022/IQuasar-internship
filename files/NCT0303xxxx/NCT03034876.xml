      Acute Kidney Injury is common in critically ill children and is associated with high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in pediatric intensive care unit. The serum creatinine is still a&#xD;
      gold standard test for diagnosis of AKI, but it rises after 1 to 3 days of injury . However,&#xD;
      Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) is an emerging biomarker in identifying&#xD;
      AKI at an early stages, which may in future help us in promptly instituting reno-protective&#xD;
      interventions like avoidance of nephrotoxic exposure and contrast agents, maintenance of&#xD;
      euvolemia and perfusion pressure which will not only preventing kidney from further failing,&#xD;
      decrease the use of very expensive and complicated renal supportive therapy like continuous&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as well as in decreasing morbidity and mortality related to&#xD;
      AKI.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is complex disorder affecting the millions of children around the&#xD;
      world where approximately 46% of critically ill individual developed acute kidney injury&#xD;
      every year (1, 2). An annual incidence of 3.3 cases/100,000 children along with hospital&#xD;
      mortality rate of up to 25-50% have reported from developed countries (3) This is even high&#xD;
      for developing countries, where annual incidence is 30-50% (4, 5). Furthermore, acute kidney&#xD;
      injury leads to significant healthcare use, with cost estimated between 8 billion dollars&#xD;
      (4). An early diagnosis is the key to prevent morbidity and mortality related to AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of AKI depends upon elevated serum creatinine level or decrease in urine output&#xD;
      . Early detection of AKI is essential. The currently use creatinine clearance (CrCl) is&#xD;
      calculated through Schwartz formula. The level of serum creatinine is poor marker for early&#xD;
      diagnosis. Because it varies with age, gender, hydration and muscle mass and metabolism.&#xD;
      Creatinine never rise until &gt;50% of renal function lost, amount of tubular secretion&#xD;
      overestimate at lower GFR, and in acute changes in GFR. During acute changes of GFR in AKI,&#xD;
      serum creatinine doesn't accurately depict kidney function until steady state equilibrium has&#xD;
      been achieved, which may require several days. There are some biomarker, with high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity, which can be used as a tool for early detection of AKI, and&#xD;
      prevent the burden of mortality and morbidity in intensive care unit (6, 7). Neutrophil&#xD;
      gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) recently identified as one of robust marker in AKI&#xD;
      (8). Several published reports that plasma NGA is raised in acute kidney injury before rise&#xD;
      in serum creatinine (9). A Study conducted by Mishra et al, in US showed that the 2 hours&#xD;
      sensitivity is 70% and specificity 94% for NGAL to predict AKI (10). A developed country data&#xD;
      showed 84% and 79% sensitivity , and 96% and 90% specificity of NGAL to predict the AKI (2,&#xD;
      11) , (see Annexure 1) . However, there is scarce of information available as plasma NGAL is&#xD;
      an early diagnostic marker from Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that serum creatinine is a gold standard for diagnosis of AKI it is cheaper test to&#xD;
      diagnose , but it rises after 1 to 3 days of injury . However, NGAL is a relatively costly&#xD;
      test but an emerging biomarker in identifying AKI at an early stages, which may in future&#xD;
      help us in promptly instituting reno-protective interventions like avoidance of nephrotoxic&#xD;
      exposure and contrast agents, maintenance of euvolemia and perfusion pressure which will not&#xD;
      only preventing kidney from further failing, decrease the use of very expensive and&#xD;
      complicated renal supportive therapy like continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as well&#xD;
      as in decreasing morbidity and mortality related to AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin&#xD;
      (NGAL) , in detection of acute kidney injury by comparing creatinine clearance which is gold&#xD;
      standard , in pediatric intensive care unit of Aga khan university hospital Karachi .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be conducting a prospective observational study in a closed&#xD;
      multidisciplinary-cardiothoracic Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Aga Khan University&#xD;
      Hospital after approval of Ethical Review Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): AKI is diagnosed according to pediatric RIFLE criteria. Pediatric&#xD;
      RIFLE criteria stratifies AKI when eCrCl decreased by 25 % in first 48hours of PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock: Shock is defined by use of vasoactive-inotropic support for at least more than 12&#xD;
      hours to maintain hemodynamics of acutely ill children in PICU for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalcin (NGAL): NGAL is biomarker is measured&#xD;
      quantitatively by a rapid , non - competitive Fluorescence Immunoassay (12) . Level of more&#xD;
      than 150 mg/dl will be considered as a positive for diagnosis of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If prevalence of AKI in children with shock is 46%, the sensitivity and specificity of plasma&#xD;
      NGAL is 0.9 and 0.79 respectively and margin of error is 0.1%, the sample size will be 140&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion Criteria: All children with either gender aged of 1 month - 16 years who&#xD;
           required vasoactive-inotropic drugs on admission and stayed for more than 48 hours in&#xD;
           PICU of tertiary care unit of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion Criteria: All those children who with chronic kidney disease or previous&#xD;
           history of renal injury will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who fulfill inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study will be enrolled&#xD;
      by daily surveillance of PICU. The informed consent will be obtained from parents or legal&#xD;
      guardian. The amount of blood about 1/3rd tea spoon ( 1.5ml ) will be collected from already&#xD;
      existing central line without any extra prick of participants at three different time&#xD;
      interval of 0 , 12 and 48 hours for plasma-NGAL and serum creatinine test in PICU. Then&#xD;
      samples will be sent to main laboratory of our hospital . Blood tests ( NGAL and Serum&#xD;
      Creatinine ) expenses will be paid from approved grant of University Research Council . Serum&#xD;
      NGAL is measured quantitatively by a rapid , non - competitive Fluorescence Immunoassay (12)&#xD;
      . The TriageÂ® NGAL test is a point - of - care , fluorescence - based immunoassay used in&#xD;
      conjunction with the Triage Meter (Biosite Inc . ) for the rapid quantitative measurement of&#xD;
      NGAL concentration. The serum creatinine will be measured by Jafe's method on ADVIA 1800&#xD;
      Chemistry System (Siemens Healthliners, Germany) , and then creatinine clearance will be&#xD;
      calculated by modified Schwartz formula . (19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data variables will be collected on a structured case report form which included demographic&#xD;
      variables (age, gender, weight, height), clinical and laboratory variables like admission&#xD;
      diagnosis, comorbidities, severity illness score (PRISM III score), use of vasoactive drugs,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, urine output, fluid balance, serum creatinine and plasma NGAL. The&#xD;
      discharge status as alive vs. expired, length of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization&#xD;
      and use of renal supportive therapy like peritoneal dialysis will also recorded on case&#xD;
      report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the level of plasma NGAL in children who is&#xD;
      in shock with and without AKI according to RIFLE criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered and analyzed into SPSS V20 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).Normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables will be reported as mean with standard deviation (SD) and will be&#xD;
      compared with student's test. Non-normally continuous distributed data will be reported as&#xD;
      medians with interquartile range (IQR) and will be compared with Man Whitney test and Kruskal&#xD;
      Wallis test. The categorical data will be reported as proportion and will be compared as&#xD;
      Fischer's exact test or Chi-square test. The association between variables will be assessed&#xD;
      by Spearman rank order correlation analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of plasma NGAL to&#xD;
      predict AKI in children with shock will be defined by calculation of Area Under Curve (AUC)&#xD;
      of Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves. An AUC of 0.5 is no better than by&#xD;
      chance, whereas a value of 1.0 indicates a perfect biomarker. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data variables will be stored in a password protected computer and strict confidentiality&#xD;
      will be maintained.&#xD;
