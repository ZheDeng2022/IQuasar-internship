      Rationale: Gout is a disease with growing incidence and complexity due to increased life&#xD;
      expectancy, co-morbidity and medication. The disease can be diagnosed by microscopy,&#xD;
      demonstrating monosodium uric acid (MSU) in synovial fluid of the affected joint or in tophi&#xD;
      (subcutaneous or peritendinous MSU depositions). In daily practice, however, the diagnosis is&#xD;
      difficult to ascertain due to sampling error (no synovial fluid acquired because the needle&#xD;
      was not exactly placed in the affected joint, or the location of the gout might have been&#xD;
      extra-articular e.g. around tendons) or to a different cause of acute arthritis (e.g.&#xD;
      infection, reactive arthritis). Recently, Dual Energy CT scan has become available. This&#xD;
      technique allows the visualization and quantification of MSU. Although imaging modalities&#xD;
      such as DECT show promise in the classification of gout, the studies to date have been small&#xD;
      and have primarily involved people with established disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study with cross-sectional design in which patients for whom the clinical questions &quot;does&#xD;
      this patient have gout?&quot; are referred for participation may contribute to assess the value of&#xD;
      DECT scan in diagnosing acute arthritis caused by gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Assessment of value of DECT scan in diagnosing acute arthritis, caused by gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective Study population: Patients with acute mono or oligo arthritis&#xD;
      without prior diagnosis, the rheumatologist has an indication for diagnostic needle&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: In current daily practice, patients with acute mono- or oligo-arthritis without&#xD;
      prior diagnosis undergo a diagnostic aspiration of the affected joint. This can be done by&#xD;
      blind aspiration or ultra sound guided aspiration depending on the judgement of the&#xD;
      rheumatologist. The aspirated synovial fluid is then assessed by polarized microscopy to&#xD;
      detect MSU crystals. The diagnostic value of DECT in acute gout attacks had not yet been&#xD;
      established and is therefore not used in daily practice. In this study all patients undergo&#xD;
      DECT scan to assess the value of DECT scan in diagnosing acute arthritis caused by gout. If&#xD;
      the DECT scan demonstrates MSU depositions and the diagnosis of gout was not ascertained&#xD;
      prior to DECT scanning by MSU crystals in the synovial fluid, then additional ultrasound&#xD;
      guided aspiration will take place, with knowledge of DECT results, followed by repeat&#xD;
      microscopy&#xD;
