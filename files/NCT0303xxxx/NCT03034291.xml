      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a clinical entity that includes several disorders that predispose&#xD;
      to imbalance in lipid metabolism: hypertension, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia,&#xD;
      obesity and low levels of high density lipoprotein. The SM itself has a great impact on&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and is also related to increased cerebrovascular risk and Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus 2 (DM2). In Colombia, DM2 is one of the 10 leading causes of illness and death in&#xD;
      people over 45 years. It is accepted that insulin resistance is a stage that precedes the&#xD;
      onset of DM2, but there are few alternatives to reverse it or prevent its progression to&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control of insulin resistance requires increased physical activity, reduced body weight&#xD;
      and changes in eating patterns, measures that are not easily adopted in modern Western&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence of the effect of chocolate consumption on increasing insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      both hypertensive diabetic patients as well as in normal individuals, apparently because of&#xD;
      the ability of cocoa polyphenols to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide, Formation&#xD;
      of reactive species of oxine, optimizing carbohydrate metabolism and modulating&#xD;
      insulin-related cellular signaling events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of 50 g of chocolate with 70% cocoa solids, which contributes at least 430 mg of&#xD;
      polyphenols, is conducted for 8 weeks in The reduction of insulin resistance defined by the&#xD;
      reduction of the HOMA-IR index. In addition, there was an increase in arterial reactivity in&#xD;
      non-diabetic individuals with central obesity and insulin resistance. Likewise, to infer the&#xD;
      effect of this food intervention in the modification of the total cardiometabolic risk of the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RATIONALE Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a clinical entity associated with obesity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance (IR), hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL. This syndrome promotes the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of oxidative stress damage, endothelial inflammation,&#xD;
      hypercoagulability, atheromatosis and metabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Colombia, morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases related to MS, such as arterial&#xD;
      hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus (DM2) represent high costs to the health system&#xD;
      due to the direct attention of these diseases as well as their more frequent complications:&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and&#xD;
      renal failure. In addition to social costs due to incapacity for work, loss of years of&#xD;
      useful life and reduction in the quality of life of patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR biologically precedes the development of DM2 and some authors propose that it is one of&#xD;
      the initial manifestations of MS. It is estimated that 25% of individuals with IR will&#xD;
      develop DM2 within 3 to 5 years and 50% will retain their IR status. In the global context,&#xD;
      it is estimated that in 2010 approximately 344 million people between the ages of 20 and 79,&#xD;
      or 7.9% of the population, are estimated to reach 472 million in 2030, that is, 8.4 million&#xD;
      of the adult population with the aggravation that the majority will be located in middle to&#xD;
      low income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the relevance of IR in the pathophysiology of DM2, since it is its previous stage,&#xD;
      there is no public health policies aimed at conducting an active search for the cases and in&#xD;
      the event that the diagnosis is made, there are few alternatives to reverse it or prevent its&#xD;
      progression to diabetes. Control of IR demands interventions in people's lifestyles such as&#xD;
      increased physical activity, reduced body weight and changes in eating patterns, however,&#xD;
      despite the effectiveness of these measures, its real impact is low since it involves drastic&#xD;
      modifications in the habits of consumer life that characterize modern Western society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grassi et al demonstrated in a short-term (15-day) clinical study that the consumption of&#xD;
      black chocolate, as opposed to white chocolate, reduces blood glucose and modulates the mean&#xD;
      arterial flow in hypertensive patients who have IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel, double-blind, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of consumption of 50 g of chocolate with 70% of cocoa solids and&#xD;
      providing at least 430 mg of Polyphenols for 8 weeks in the reduction of IR and in the&#xD;
      increase of arterial reactivity in non-diabetic individuals with central obesity and IR.&#xD;
      Likewise, it is expected to infer the effect of this food intervention in the modification of&#xD;
      the total cardiometabolic risk of the participants. This research seeks to corroborate the&#xD;
      studies of other groups, to visualize the effects of cocoa over a longer period of time, and&#xD;
      in a sample of Colombian population, characterized by a high degree of mestizaje, where the&#xD;
      effects may have some nuances different from those Reported with European populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MS is a clinical entity defined by the WHO in 1998, which includes several disorders that&#xD;
      predispose to imbalance in lipid metabolism. To establish the diagnosis, three of five&#xD;
      conditions must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elevated serum triglyceride levels (greater than 150mg / dL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low serum levels of high-density cholesterol (HDL less than 35 mg / dL in men, less than&#xD;
           39 mg / dL in women),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypertension (SBP greater than 140 mmHg and / or DBP greater than 90 mmHg) or being&#xD;
           treated with antihypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. High glycemia levels (greater than 100mg / dL) or being treated with hypoglycemic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obesity (abdominal circumference greater than 90 cm in men, greater than 80 cm in women&#xD;
           and / or body mass index greater than 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MS itself has a great impact on morbidity and mortality, and there is evidence of its&#xD;
      association with increased cerebrovascular and DM2 risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity Obesity is a risk factor for the development of IR, DM2 and MS, and its evaluation is&#xD;
      important not only total body fat but also the anatomical distribution of adipose tissue,&#xD;
      with particular relevance to visceral deposits for its contribution to resistance to insulin.&#xD;
      Epidemiological evidence shows an increase in cardiovascular risk and DM2 in individuals with&#xD;
      MS; in addition, mortality from non-cardiovascular causes increases by 2.26-fold in men and&#xD;
      2.78-fold in women not affected by the syndrome, regardless of age, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies related to obesity and chronic diseases recommend the use of abdominal circumference&#xD;
      as an indicator of central obesity even in people with normal body mass index. Appropriate&#xD;
      cutoffs are proposed based on studies on the variability in the risk of chronic diseases in&#xD;
      adults by ethnic group. For Colombia, the WHO recommendations were adopted, according to&#xD;
      which abdominal perimeters greater than 90 cm and 80 cm in women are compatible with central&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chocolate and IR Several studies indicate that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      as well as red wine, tea and chocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases due to&#xD;
      the flavonoids present in these foods. Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a food that originates in&#xD;
      the Americas, containing 6 to 8% of polyphenols, including flavonoids in their monomeric&#xD;
      forms: catechin and epicatechin, and their oligomeric forms: procyanidins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is epidemiological evidence of the protective factor conferring cocoa consumption on&#xD;
      the Kuna indigenous community, in the development of atherosclerotic disease, arterial&#xD;
      hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Grassi and colleagues have demonstrated the effect&#xD;
      of chocolate consumption on increasing sensitivity to insulin in both hypertensive diabetic&#xD;
      patients as well as in normal individuals. The mechanisms involved in this process seem to be&#xD;
      related to the ability of polyphenols to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide, reduce&#xD;
      the formation of reactive species of the oxide, and also have an effect on the metabolism of&#xD;
      carbohydrates and the modulation of the pathways of Signaling related to insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR is defined as decreased sensitivity or response to the metabolic action of insulin. The&#xD;
      concept of IR was first proposed in 1936 to describe diabetic patients who required high&#xD;
      doses of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR plays an important role in the pathophysiology of DM2 and a strong association with&#xD;
      obesity, hypertension, coronary disease, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome; therefore, it&#xD;
      is very important to have tools to quantify the sensitivity or resistance to insulin in&#xD;
      humans so that different aspects of this phenomenon can be studied, such as epidemiology,&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms, therapeutic outcomes, natural history, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different methods for measuring insulin sensitivity / resistance, one of them being&#xD;
      direct (hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamping) and the rest calculated from basal insulin and&#xD;
      glycaemia measurements. Up to now, the clamping continues as the reference diagnostic method,&#xD;
      but indirect methods such as QUICKI and the HOMA have a high correlation with the clamping,&#xD;
      but only recently validation was started in epidemiological and clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homeostasis Model Assesment (HOMA) Described since 1985, this model takes into account the&#xD;
      interaction between glucose and insulin and predicts the steady state of glucose and insulin&#xD;
      concentrations in a wide range of possible combinations of IR and beta cell function&#xD;
      pancreas. HOMA assumes a feedback loop between the liver and beta cells, meaning that insulin&#xD;
      levels depend on the pancreatic response of beta cells to glucose concentration. Therefore,&#xD;
      deficient beta cells reflect a decrease in insulin stimulated by glucose and IR is reflected&#xD;
      by a decrease in the suppressive effect of insulin on the hepatic production of glucose. HOMA&#xD;
      describes this model of insulin/glucose homeostasis through a series of linear equations. The&#xD;
      model predicts, in a fasting state, the constant levels of glucose and insulin for any given&#xD;
      combination of beta cell function and insulin sensitivity. In practical terms most studies&#xD;
      use HOMA as an index to measure IR and its mathematical formula is expressed as the product&#xD;
      of fasting glucose and fasting insulin divided by 22.5 which is a constant of normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chocolate and cardiometabolic risk The Kuna indigenous community living in the San Blas&#xD;
      archipelago in Panama has a low frequency of cerebrocardiovascular disease and DM2. This&#xD;
      epidemiological picture is attributed to the habitual consumption of large quantities of&#xD;
      cocoa-based beverages and not to protective genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocoa is a food with a high content of polyphenols and is the one with the highest&#xD;
      concentration of flavonoids, which are in monomeric form as catechin and epicatequin and as&#xD;
      oligomers are procyanidins. Flavonoids in general and cocoa in particular have the ability to&#xD;
      lower blood pressure, increase arterial blood flow, reduce oxidation of low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein, reduce platelet aggregability, and increase insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is postulated that the action of cacao involves several mechanisms, including: 1.&#xD;
      Reduction of the inflammatory endothelial response involved in the genesis of the&#xD;
      atheromatous plaque, which reduces the expression of adhesion molecules necessary for the&#xD;
      migration and activation of macrophages and others Phagocytic cells that are the source of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species as well as inflammatory cytokines necessary to perpetuate endothelial&#xD;
      injury. 2. Antioxidant capacity that protects from low density lipoprotein peroxidation. 3.&#xD;
      Increased activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase responsible for the production of&#xD;
      nitric oxide necessary to preserve the reactivity of arterial flow. 4. Decrease of platelet&#xD;
      agreeability at the expense of lower expression of adhesion molecules. And more recently has&#xD;
      been described, increased insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective To estimate the changes in IR index (HOMA-IR) and in the modification of&#xD;
      cardio metabolic risk in non-diabetic individuals with IR in a controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      after eight weeks of chocolate consumption with 70% of Cocoa solids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Buy the effect of chocolate consumption with or without cocoa solids for 8 weeks on&#xD;
           basal and post glucose load in non-diabetic individuals with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare baseline insulinemia in non-diabetic subjects with IR after eight weeks of&#xD;
           consumption of chocolate with or without cocoa solids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of the consumption of chocolate with or without cocoa solids in&#xD;
           the modulation of the arterial flow of non-diabetic people with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the effect of chocolate consumption with 70% cocoa solids for eight weeks on&#xD;
           the modification of the cardio metabolic risk of non-diabetic individuals with IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare the variation in health-related quality of life among people with IR who receive&#xD;
           chocolate with cocoa solids and those who receive chocolate free of cocoa solids at the&#xD;
           end of the intervention.&#xD;
