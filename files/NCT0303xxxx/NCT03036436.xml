  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will take part in a 12 week intervention, with at least one follow up at 24 +/-&#xD;
      2 weeks. Each participant will be provided with support, motivation and professional guidance&#xD;
      about improving physical activity (PA) levels and will be given a commercially available PA&#xD;
      tracker. The PA tracker will also include a smartphone or web-based application, where&#xD;
      participants can upload their exercise performed each day, and keep up to date with their&#xD;
      goals using their smartphone or by logging on to their computer. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      find out how useful and effective technology with support from a healthcare professional is&#xD;
      in helping cancer survivors to become more physically active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure objective PA levels of the participants at the start of the study and&#xD;
      at the end. The acceptability of using this intervention to promote PA in cancer survivors&#xD;
      will also be investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to determine the feasibility of a specific PA intervention, combining&#xD;
      technology and professional input, in the cancer survivor population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A single arm feasibility trial of a PA intervention using technology and&#xD;
      behavioural change theories as tools to achieve increased PA. Participants in the study will&#xD;
      receive 12 weeks of the intervention. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 weeks and 24&#xD;
      weeks (+/- 2 weeks) post baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment: Participants will be recruited from those attending the St. James'&#xD;
      Hospital oncology and haematology services. Study personnel will provide further information&#xD;
      to these patients and assess them for eligibility. Informed consent will be gained from each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Proposed sample size is 60 (based on Sim and Lewis, 2012 recommendations) and&#xD;
      allowing for 20% drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This study will use the commercially available 'Fitbit' wearable technology&#xD;
      with its paired smartphone application. PA goals will be prescribed by a qualified, chartered&#xD;
      physiotherapist using the American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines (Doyle et al 2006).&#xD;
      Participants will use the Fitbit and its paired application for 12 weeks. The Fitbit device&#xD;
      is a tool for motivation and monitoring of PA behaviours in this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also use evidence-based psychological behavioural change theory. Behavioural&#xD;
      change techniques include 'self-monitoring of behaviour', 'goal-setting', 'feedback on&#xD;
      behaviour' and 'information about health consequences'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: This study includes time-points at baseline, 12 weeks (Intervention end) and 24&#xD;
      weeks post baseline (+/- 2 weeks (Follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention:Consent and PA measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent: Study personnel meets potential participants at their outpatient appointment.&#xD;
           The agreement of the patient's consultant to exercise has been obtained before the&#xD;
           patient information leaflet (PIL) is provided. The researcher explains the study and&#xD;
           gives the potential participant a consent form and a patient information leaflet and a&#xD;
           verbal explanation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial PA measurement: Participants who consent are given an Actigraph PA monitor which&#xD;
           they will be instructed to wear for 7 days to measure their baseline physical activity&#xD;
           levels. Participants who wish to consider the study can take the PIL home, post it back,&#xD;
           and receive the Actigraph by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants attend&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) An educational session, delivered by the lead researcher, a chartered&#xD;
           physiotherapist. This is a group information session on PA following cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2) Educational session to introduce the technological component to the participants and&#xD;
           instruct them in use and upload of Fitbit data to allow monitoring by researcher(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3) Measurement of height, weight, BMI and body composition and 6 minute walk test During&#xD;
           intervention. (week 1-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants wear Fitbit and upload data for self-monitoring and monitoring by chartered&#xD;
           physiotherapist researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants receive scheduled structured telephone calls, giving them feedback on their&#xD;
           achievement of goals and reminders about uploading data as follows; 2 calls each week&#xD;
           till week 4, 1 call a week between week 4 and 8 and 2 calls, 2 weeks apart between week&#xD;
           8 and week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intervention ends (12 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of height, weight, BMI and body composition and 6 minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants wear Actigraph x 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           12 weeks after end of intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of height, weight, BMI and body composition and 6 minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants wear Actigraph x 7 days&#xD;
