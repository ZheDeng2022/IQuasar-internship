    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well anamorelin hydrochloride, physical activity, and&#xD;
      nutritional counseling work in decreasing cancer-related fatigue in patients with incurable&#xD;
      solid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body or have come back. Anamorelin&#xD;
      hydrochloride, physical activity, and nutritional counseling may help to decrease&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy-Fatigue&#xD;
      (FACIT-F) subscale score at day 43 +/- 3 days compared to baseline in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer receiving oral anamorelin hydrochloride (anamorelin) 100 mg daily and standardized&#xD;
      physical activity and nutritional counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effects of anamorelin and standardized physical activity and nutritional&#xD;
      counseling on health-related quality of life and patient reported outcomes as measured by the&#xD;
      Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Fatigue, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS),&#xD;
      Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G)&#xD;
      and its Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) subscale in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the side effects and tolerability of anamorelin in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effects of anamorelin and standardized physical activity and nutritional&#xD;
      counseling on muscle function (as measured by the 30 second chair stand test, 6 minute walk&#xD;
      test, day time activity [accelerometer], body composition [as measured by INBODY], and&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure [measured by indirect calorimetry]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the effects of anamorelin on potential inflammatory biomarkers of&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) (C-Reactive Protein [CRP], monocyte IL-6&amp;R, TNF-a&amp;R, IL-10,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-1&amp;RA; IGF-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the effects of anamorelin on sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the association between change in FACIT-F scores and changes in muscle&#xD;
      function, day time activity, and body composition, in patients with advanced cancer receiving&#xD;
      oral anamorelin 100 mg daily and standardized physical activity and nutritional counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anamorelin hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) and undergo physical&#xD;
      activity consisting of resistance exercises and a home walking program. Treatment continues&#xD;
      for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      also undergo nutritional counseling on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 71.&#xD;
