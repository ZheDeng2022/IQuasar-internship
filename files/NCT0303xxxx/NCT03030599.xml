  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study of the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of JZP-258.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be transitioned to JZP-258 based on their treatment status at study entry. All&#xD;
      subjects will begin JZP-258 treatment at the beginning of this period and continue through&#xD;
      Week 12. They will be treated with JZP-258 alone for the final two weeks of this 12-week&#xD;
      period. Once the JZP-258 dose has been optimized per the Investigator's judgment, these&#xD;
      subjects may enter the 2-week Stable-Dose Period with that dose. Subjects are eligible to&#xD;
      enter the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period if the dose of JZP-258 remains unchanged&#xD;
      during the Stable-Dose Period and, in the judgment of the Investigator, no clinically&#xD;
      significant worsening in narcolepsy symptoms or clinically significant adverse events due to&#xD;
      JZP-258 treatment have occurred. Subjects will return for a Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the Double-Blind Randomized-Withdrawal Period. Subjects who complete the double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period during the Main Study are eligible to enter a 24-week Open-Label Extension.&#xD;
      During this period subjects will receive open label JZP-258. Subjects will return for a&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up visit 2 weeks after the Open-Label Extension Period.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Weekly Number of Cataplexy Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (2 weeks of the Stable Dose Period) to the 2 weeks of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period (DB RWP)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a daily Cataplexy Frequency Diary each night prior to bedtime. Participants were to record the number of cataplexy attacks that they had each day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From the end of the Stable Dose Period to the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>This is the key secondary endpoint. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Participants were asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most participants engaged in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that participants average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Worsening Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) for Narcolepsy Overall</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period (DB RWP), participants rated the change in their condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot; since the last visit. This endpoint measures the percentage of participants with worsening PGIc scores for narcolepsy overall (defined as scores of Much Worse or Very Much Worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Worsening Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) for Narcolepsy Overall</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period, Investigators rated their impression of any change in the severity of the participant's narcolepsy overall condition since the start of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot;. This endpoint measures the percentage of participants with worsening CGIc scores for narcolepsy overall, defined as scores of Much Worse or Very Much Worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At the End of the Stable Dose Period to the End of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions/ items. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as a psychometrically-based physical and mental overall component summary measures. Two summary scores were derived using the SF-36v2. Physical Component Summary measures dimensions of functional health that are meaningful to respondents, including the impact of health and health-related changes on physical function, pain, and the ability to carry out daily roles. The Mental Component Summary component scale measures the impact of health and health-related changes on well-being, including vitality, social function, and emotional well-being. Participants self-report on items in a summary that have between 2-6 choices per item (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores were transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Crosswalk Index Score and Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the End of the Stable Dose Period to the End of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/ depression). The EQ-5D-5L includes 5 levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system (1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The 5 digit health states for each dimension are converted into a single value per country (0= equivalent to death, 1= equivalent to best imaginable health and values below 0= health states rated worse than death capped at -1), using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. A visual analogue scale (VAS) used within this scale recorded the participants self-rated health on a VAS and the endpoints resulted in a numeric value set ranging from 0 (= worst imaginable health state) up to 100 (= best imaginable health state).</description>

        <title>Change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</title>
        <description>This is the key secondary endpoint. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Participants were asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most participants engaged in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that participants average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

        <title>Change in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Scores</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions/ items. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as a psychometrically-based physical and mental overall component summary measures. Two summary scores were derived using the SF-36v2. Physical Component Summary measures dimensions of functional health that are meaningful to respondents, including the impact of health and health-related changes on physical function, pain, and the ability to carry out daily roles. The Mental Component Summary component scale measures the impact of health and health-related changes on well-being, including vitality, social function, and emotional well-being. Participants self-report on items in a summary that have between 2-6 choices per item (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores were transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

        <title>Change in 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Crosswalk Index Score and Visual Analog Scale</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/ depression). The EQ-5D-5L includes 5 levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system (1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The 5 digit health states for each dimension are converted into a single value per country (0= equivalent to death, 1= equivalent to best imaginable health and values below 0= health states rated worse than death capped at -1), using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. A visual analogue scale (VAS) used within this scale recorded the participants self-rated health on a VAS and the endpoints resulted in a numeric value set ranging from 0 (= worst imaginable health state) up to 100 (= best imaginable health state).</description>

        <population>There were 68 JZP-258 participants included in the Crosswalk Index, and 69 JZP-258 participants in the VAS Score. The efficacy population contains all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug and had at least one set of post-randomization efficacy data.</population>
