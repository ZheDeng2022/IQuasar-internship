  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which the myelin surrounding the nerve cells is&#xD;
      damaged which affects functioning. MS usually is treated with medications designed to reduce&#xD;
      the occurrence of future MS events. Evidence suggests that an important part of the disease&#xD;
      process is damage to the myelin and brain caused by too much oxygen (sometimes called&#xD;
      oxidative stress) or too much inflammation (or swelling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study will be to determine whether N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) will help&#xD;
      to support cerebral function in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This positron emission&#xD;
      tomography magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) study will utilize&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG PET to&#xD;
      measure cerebral metabolism, along with MRI analysis, to measure metabolism and structural&#xD;
      effects of NAC in patients with MS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original protocol consisted of two arms. The first arm of this study will receive&#xD;
      intravenous and oral NAC, a strong antioxidant that increases brain glutathione. NAC, is the&#xD;
      N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common&#xD;
      over-the-counter supplement that is also available as an injectable pharmaceutical that&#xD;
      protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed some&#xD;
      benefits to use of NAC. It has the potential to reduce markers of oxidative damage, protect&#xD;
      against cell death, and to increase glutathione in blood, which might be useful in preventing&#xD;
      oxidative damage in MS patients. The second arm will be a waitlist control receiving standard&#xD;
      MS care. It should be noted that both arms will receive standard of care treatment for MS&#xD;
      while enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We amended this protocol to increase the enrollment with an additional 30 participants: 15 in&#xD;
      a waitlist group and 15 will receive NAC. Subjects be randomized to either receive NAC or be&#xD;
      placed in a waitlist control group. Those patients receiving NAC would receive a combination&#xD;
      of IV and oral NAC for 4 months. We may obtain NAC serum measures that require a blood draw&#xD;
      at three time points, one at scanning before receiving any NAC, one after the first infusion&#xD;
      dose of NAC before the second dose, and another one at the last scan and the last dose of&#xD;
      NAC.&#xD;
