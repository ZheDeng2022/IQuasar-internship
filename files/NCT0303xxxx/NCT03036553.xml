  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is highly prevalent, disabling, and with high&#xD;
      socio-economic costs, with many negative effects on quality of life. CMP affects the ability&#xD;
      to perform work, social, recreational and domestic tasks, changing the mood and concentration&#xD;
      of this population. Despite the worldwide prevalence and socioeconomic burden of CMP, a clear&#xD;
      understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis remains elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) to analyze the possible level of association between pain-related fear, fear of movement,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and pain acceptance with pain intensity and disability at the start of the&#xD;
      study and prospectively evaluate its predictive function; (ii) to evaluate the possible&#xD;
      mediating role of fear of movement and self-efficacy in the relationship between&#xD;
      pain-disability in patients with CMP.&#xD;

      The present study will be a prospective multi-centric 12-month study that will be conducted&#xD;
      in four primary care centers and a hospital in the province of Malaga. Several questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing different psychological factors will be administered to these participants. The&#xD;
      results will be evaluated at baseline (t1) and at 3 follow-up (after 3 (t2), 6 (t3) and 12&#xD;
      months (t4)). Ethical approval will be obtained from the Costal del Sol Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Malaga, Spain. This study will follow the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
      study will be implemented and reported in line with the SPIRIT statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A consecutive sample of CMP participants will be recruited. The general&#xD;
      practitioners will carry out the recruitment. Next, the physiotherapists attending the&#xD;
      research project, which will be previously instructed by the research team, will evaluate the&#xD;
      participants for their eligibility. If participants meet the eligibility criteria, they will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in this study, and then evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months of follow-up. The inclusion criteria are: (i) men / women over the age of 18; (ii)&#xD;
      participants with musculoskeletal pain (pain intensity of 3 or more on a numerical scale of&#xD;
      pain 0-10) will be included in this study, among all of the following conditions: pain around&#xD;
      the axial skeleton (neck, lower back and / or pelvis) or peripheral joints (shoulder, elbow,&#xD;
      wrist, knee and / or ankle). We included people with clinical diagnoses of chronic pain&#xD;
      (shoulder pain, neck pain, whiplash disorder, temporomandibular joint disorders, pelvic pain&#xD;
      syndrome, ankle pain and epicondylalgia), non-specific low back pain, fibromyalgia, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome and those with a radiological diagnosis of osteoarthritis. (iii) duration of&#xD;
      symptoms: more than 3 months. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (i) musculoskeletal pain due&#xD;
      to traumatic or systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis, spondylolisthesis or other defined rheumatological conditions; (ii)&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain associated with neurological dysfunction (ie, multiple sclerosis or&#xD;
      stroke), osteoporosis, hemophilia and / or cancer; (iii) participants with post-fracture&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain; (iv) inability to provide informed consent and / or complete written&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The age and sex of those participants who refuse to participate in the project&#xD;
      will be noted anonymously, with the objective of evaluating the external validity of the&#xD;
      sample recruited from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants who are interested in the study will be asked to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent to participate. Participants will complete several questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant data files will be stored in numerical order and in a safe and accessible place.&#xD;
