  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to assess the effect of multiple applications of antimicrobial&#xD;
      Photodynamic Therapy (aPDT) as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment (nsPT) in&#xD;
      smokers without use of antibiotics. Twenty smokers with a clinical diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis will be treated in a split-mouth design study to either aPDT associated with&#xD;
      scaling and root planing (SRP) or SRP only. aPDT will be performed by using a laser light&#xD;
      source with 690 nm wavelength associated with a phenothiazine photosensitizer. The&#xD;
      applications will occur in four episodes (at days 0, 2, 7 and 14). All patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for 90 days. Plaque index, probing depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing will be performed at baseline (pre-intervention period) and 30 and 90 days after the&#xD;
      (nsPT). Subgingival plaque samples will be collected (at baseline and 30 and 90 days after&#xD;
      the nsPT) and the counts of 40 subgingival species will be determined using DNA-DNA&#xD;
      checkerboard hybridization. Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be collected (at Day 0,&#xD;
      14, 30 and 90 after the nsPT) and the levels of Interleukin 1 beta, Interleukin 10 and Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor alpha (Luminex) will be evaluated. Salivary cotinine levels will also be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline. Data obtained will be statistically analyzed.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to search - All patients will receive detailed information about experiment (goals,&#xD;
      benefits, risks and discomforts) in accordance with a consent form in this research. All&#xD;
      procedures will be subject to approval of the Ethics Committee (CEP) of Ribeirão Preto Dental&#xD;
      School (FORP), University of São Paulo (USP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation - The sample size was determined to provide 80% power to recognize a&#xD;
      significant difference of 1 mm (d) between groups with a 95% confidence interval (a = 0.05)&#xD;
      and standard deviation (s) of 1.0 mm. Considering the changes in mean clinical attachment&#xD;
      level (CAL) as the primary outcome variable and [Za (1.96) + Zb (0.84)]2 = 7.84. Size&#xD;
      calculation was based on the following formula: n = {2[(s)2/(d)2]} · (Za + Zb)2. Therefore, a&#xD;
      total of 16 patients were required. However, the number of patients enrolled in this study&#xD;
      was 20, considering that some patients could be lost during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design -The selected subjects will receive specific oral hygiene instruction and&#xD;
      supragingival scaling in all teeth, seven days before the start of interventions. The study&#xD;
      type will be split mouth with two pairs of contralateral uni-root teeth with proximal&#xD;
      periodontal sites presenting probing depth ≥ 5 mm for the clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      immunological assessment. A random number table will be generated by a computer program, each&#xD;
      of the selected pairs dental receive the following treatments: SRP or SRP + several aPDT&#xD;
      episodes. The clinical, immunological and microbiological parameters will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline (pre-intervention) and after the completion of non-surgical periodontal therapy. The&#xD;
      periodontal clinical examinations (pre and post-intervention) will be performed by a single&#xD;
      trained and calibrated examiner, who unknown the experimental groups of this study. Examiners&#xD;
      are also blind to study the immunological and microbiological analyzes. SRP procedures and&#xD;
      use of the aPDT protocol should be performed by other trained operator for these purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impression with alginate will be performed in each patient to obtain the models of the&#xD;
      dental arches and development of a guide plate on acetate with reference grooves to&#xD;
      standardize the insertion and inclination of computerized periodontal probe (Florida Probe&#xD;
      System, Florida Probe Corporation , Gainesville, FL, USA). The visible plaque index of each&#xD;
      patient, will be assessed dichotomously (O'Leary et al., 1972) and determined by the&#xD;
      percentage of tooth surfaces with plaque. In 6 sites of each tooth (mesio-buccal, buccal,&#xD;
      distobuccal, mesio- lingual, lingual and disto-lingual) will be assessed clinical periodontal&#xD;
      parameters: Probing Depth (mm) that will be measured from the gingival margin to the pocket&#xD;
      bottom; relative Clinical Attachment Level (mm) that will be measured from the occlusal plate&#xD;
      guide to the pocket bottom; Bleeding on probing, rated dichotomously (Ainamo, Bay, 1976), the&#xD;
      presence of bleeding is considered positive when presented within 20s after the probe&#xD;
      insertion for measuring probing depth. These clinical parameters and each patient's plaque&#xD;
      index will be recorded at baseline (pre-intervention period) as well as +30 and +90 days&#xD;
      after the non-surgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiner Calibration - The Kappa index will be used to evaluate the examiner calibration for&#xD;
      collection of clinical periodontal parameters in order to measure the intra-examiner&#xD;
      agreement. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) for diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      acceptable index Kappa agreement must be greater or equal to 0.85 (WHO, 1997). This agreement&#xD;
      level will be used for calibration of the examiner in this project. Ten patients will be&#xD;
      selected, at least two pairs of contralateral teeth uni-roots with probe depth ≥5 mm in the&#xD;
      proximal sites. Each patient is scanned twice using computerized periodontal probe (Probe&#xD;
      Corporation Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA) with a 48-hour interval between the first and&#xD;
      second examination in order to obtain the intra-examiner reliability, which will be measured&#xD;
      by determining the Kappa index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologic Analysis - At baseline and on days +14, +30 and +90, after non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy will be collected GCF samples from selected teeth. The supragingival&#xD;
      plaque these elements will be removed and the sites will be gently dried with air jets and&#xD;
      subsequently isolated using sterile cotton rolls. The GCF samples are obtained from the&#xD;
      mesial and distal sites to the use of Periopaper strips (Oralflow Inc., Amityville, NY, USA).&#xD;
      The strips will be carefully placed on the margin of the gingival sulcus for 30 seconds. The&#xD;
      amount of absorbed gingival fluid will be determined by an electronic meter of wet mass&#xD;
      Periotron (Oralflow Inc., Amityville, NY). The strips are placed in sterile eppendorf vials&#xD;
      of the type which will be stored at a temperature of 80C for later quantification of&#xD;
      cytokines (pg/ml) TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10. Cytokine levels are determined using a 3-plex kit&#xD;
      Millipore (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) 100TM and the Luminex system (Luminex,&#xD;
      MiraiBio, Alameda, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary Cotinine analysis - Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine which allows monitoring&#xD;
      patient exposure to nicotine (McGuire et al., 1989). Cotinine levels will be identified at&#xD;
      baseline by immunoenzymatic analysis (ELISA) (Salimetrics Inc., State College, PA, USA) using&#xD;
      a kit for the quantitative analysis of cotinine in saliva according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological Analysis - At baseline and on days +30 and +90, after performing non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy, subgingival plaque samples of the selected teeth will be collected at&#xD;
      the proximal periodontal pockets (mesial and distal). Counts of 40 subgingival species will&#xD;
      be determined in each sample using the method checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (Birth et&#xD;
      al., 2008). For the collection of subgingival plaque, the sites will be isolated with sterile&#xD;
      cotton rollers and dry with air jets. The supragingival plaque will be removed carefully&#xD;
      using a sterile curette. Subsequently, another sterile curette is used to collect subgingival&#xD;
      plaque, starting from the deepest portion of the pocket to the coronal region. The samples&#xD;
      will be transported in sterile Eppendorf vials and processing in Dental Molecular Diagnostics&#xD;
      Laboratory of the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto-USP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical Periodontal Therapy - At 7 day prior to the non-surgical periodontal therapy all&#xD;
      patients will pefrom a complete periapical radiographic examination of the entire mouth. They&#xD;
      will be grouped into an oral hygiene program (OHP) according to the specific needs. In this&#xD;
      program patients will receive instructions for effective self-plaque, including information&#xD;
      about Bass technique (Bass, 1954) and interproximal cleaning with dental floss and&#xD;
      interdental brushes. They will also be encouraged to brush the tongue once a day and receive&#xD;
      a single dentifrice to be used during the whole experimental period (Colgate Total, Anakol&#xD;
      Ind. Com. Ltda - Kolynos do Brasil - Colgate Palmolive Co., São Bernardo do Campo, SP,&#xD;
      Brasil). After the completion of this oral hygiene program, patients will be submitted to&#xD;
      evaluation of clinical periodontal parameters previously described, and also will be&#xD;
      collected subgingival plaque and GCF samples on selected sites (baseline - pre-intervention&#xD;
      period). Soon after, will receiving supragingival scaling and polishing with a coronary&#xD;
      rubber cups in all teeth in the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical periodontal therapy is initiated 7 days after the execution of the OHP and&#xD;
      initial supragingival scaling. The treatment will be made by one skilled in Periodontology,&#xD;
      at an interval of 24 hours by scaling (supragingival and subgingival) and root planing of all&#xD;
      teeth with periodontal disease, using hand (Curetas Gracey, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, EUA) and&#xD;
      ultrasonic tools. The instrumentation will be held quadrant by quadrant, until adequate&#xD;
      cleaning of the area and root planing, which will be checked with the help of an explorer.&#xD;
      Individuals will receive professional cleaning biweekly up to three months after the end of&#xD;
      nonsurgical periodontal therapy. In Fortnightly control and evaluation, patient cooperation&#xD;
      towards the study will be monitored, verifying the state of oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - Normality and homoscedasticity of the data will be checked. The inter-&#xD;
      and intra-group comparisons in different time intervals will be achieved through adequate&#xD;
      parametric or non-parametric tests. For all statistical analysis will use a 5% significance&#xD;
      level. All calculations are performed using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago IL, EUA).&#xD;

    <description>After Scaling and root planing, periodontal pockets will receive the antimicrobial (aPDT) photodynamic therapy. Shortly phenothiazine hydrochloride photosensitizing is applied at a concentration of 10mg/mL from the pocket bottom to the gingival margin. After 1 minute, irrigation is performed from periodontal pockets with distilled water to remove excess dye. The stained area is then irradiated with a diode laser with 660 nm of wavelength and maximum power of 60 mW/cm², through a fiber-optic probe of 0.6 mm diameter. Exposure to radiation will occur at six sites per tooth under treatment, making the total time of 1 minute per element, or the equivalent of 10 seconds per site. The aPDT applications will be repeated in the same way until the second week in the days 2, 7 and 14.</description>
