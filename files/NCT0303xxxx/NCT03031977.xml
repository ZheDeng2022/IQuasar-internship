      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of visceral mobilization on symptoms&#xD;
      of functional constipation and static balance in stroke survivors.&#xD;

      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers received clarifications with regard to the procedures and were informed that&#xD;
      the procedures would not affect their health. The volunteers were assured that all&#xD;
      information would be confidential and their privacy would remain protected. All volunteers&#xD;
      who agreed to participate in the study signed a statement of informed consent in compliance&#xD;
      with Resolution 196/96 of the Brazilian National Board of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham intervention procedures were always performed in combination with active conventional&#xD;
      therapy, which lessened the impact the sham procedure on the patient. Moreover, the patients&#xD;
      were informed of the use of this procedure prior to the onset of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, evaluation and intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty individuals met the eligibility criteria and were randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      study groups using a block randomization method. Fifteen patients were allocated to each&#xD;
      group: Experimental group - conventional physical therapy and visceral mobilization; control&#xD;
      group: conventional physical therapy and sham mobilization. Block randomization involved the&#xD;
      use of sealed opaque envelopes, each containing a card stipulating one of the two groups.&#xD;
      After the pre-intervention evaluation, the participant was allocated to a group by opening an&#xD;
      envelope. This process was performed by a member of the research team who was not involved in&#xD;
      the recruitment process or development of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations were performed on three occasions: 1) prior to the intervention; 2) immediately&#xD;
      after the first session; and 3) one week after the last session. All specific evaluation&#xD;
      procedures were performed during the pre-intervention and post-intervention (one week after&#xD;
      the sessions) evaluations, whereas only the computerized plantar pressure evaluation was&#xD;
      performed at the second evaluation (immediately after the first session). The researcher in&#xD;
      charge of the evaluations was blinded to the objectives of the study and did not take part in&#xD;
      the intervention protocols. Moreover, the order of the evaluations was randomized to avoid&#xD;
      the effect of standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an identification chart was filled out with information on age, sex, date of stroke&#xD;
      episode and onset of constipation. Anthropometric data (body mass and height) were also&#xD;
      measured and recorded. The specific evaluation procedures consisted of the use of an&#xD;
      intestinal symptoms rating scale(16) (primary outcome) and plantar pressure evaluation&#xD;
      (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ten-item intestinal symptoms rating scale was used to measure the intensity of intestinal&#xD;
      symptoms. On this scale, each item is scored from 0 to 4 points. Item 1 regards the frequency&#xD;
      of bowel movements and Items 2 to 10 address intestinal symptoms. The final scores is&#xD;
      calculated by the mean of the item scores; 0 corresponds to a absence of symptoms and 4&#xD;
      corresponds to the highest intensity of symptoms.(16) The plantar pressure evaluation was&#xD;
      performed using a force plate (Medicapteurs France S-Plate) with 1600 sensors and an&#xD;
      acquisition frequency of 100 images per second. This force plate measures the distribution of&#xD;
      plantar pressure during quiet standing, with quantitative data on anteroposterior and&#xD;
      mediolateral sway (cm) as well as the mean sway velocity (cm/s) in these directions. The&#xD;
      volunteer stood barefoot on the pressure plate in the standing position with arms alongside&#xD;
      the body, gaze fixed on the horizon, lips closed, with the mandible and rest of the body&#xD;
      relaxed. Readings were performed for 50 seconds, the 30 intermediate seconds of which were&#xD;
      used for analysis. The values were recorded using the program provided by the manufacturer&#xD;
      installed on a microcomputer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups were submitted to general kinesiotherapy with a focus on strengthening,&#xD;
      stretching and proprioception during conventional physical therapy. The experimental group&#xD;
      was also submitted to mobilization of the ascending colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon&#xD;
      and sphincters (cardiac, pyloric, Oddi, duodenojejunal and ileocecal) with the patient in the&#xD;
      supine position, knees flexed, feet supported and abdomen exposed. Contact was made with the&#xD;
      region to be treated, leading it in the direction of immobility, with pressure maintained for&#xD;
      one minute on each region with intensity based on the sensitivity to tension observed on the&#xD;
      feedback of the individual. In the control group, sham mobilization was performed, which&#xD;
      consisted of superficial contact with no pressure on the abdominal region corresponding to&#xD;
      the loops of the large intestine. Five intervention sessions were held over a two-week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were first submitted to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine adherence to the&#xD;
      Gaussian curve. The independent t-test was used for the inter-group analysis.&#xD;
      Repeated-measures ANOVA was used for the intra-group analysis under each condition. The&#xD;
      chi-square test was used to evaluate the dispersion of the qualitative variables in the&#xD;
      intra-group and inter-group analyses. A p-value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered indicative of&#xD;
      statistical significance. The data were organized and tabulated using the Statistical Package&#xD;
      for the Social Sciences (SPSS v.19.0).&#xD;
