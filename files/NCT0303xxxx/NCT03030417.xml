  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new drug LMP744 damages DNA. This causes cell death. Researchers want to see if it can&#xD;
      treat certain kinds of cancer. They want to understand how the drug works and how it affects&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of LMP744 and find out the dose of the drug that can be safely given to&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who have metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, which have&#xD;
      progressed after other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans or ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have a tumor sample taken 2 times. A small piece of tumor is removed&#xD;
      by a small needle. A scan or ultrasound will guide the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle, participants will get the study drug in a vein for 60 minutes once a day for 5&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For day 1 of cycle 1, participants will be admitted to the clinic and have blood and urine&#xD;
      taken several times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each cycle, participants will have a clinic visit and repeat some&#xD;
      screening tests. They will also do this twice in the middle of cycle 1 and once in the middle&#xD;
      of cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants stop taking the study drug, they will be followed for 30 days. They may&#xD;
      give blood samples. They will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with&#xD;
           improved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better&#xD;
           chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a&#xD;
           preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce&#xD;
           DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no&#xD;
           resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2,&#xD;
           and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC&#xD;
      706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in patients with&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage (yH2AX, pNbs1, pATR, ERCC1,&#xD;
           RAD51, Topo1cc, Top1, SLFN11) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in circulating&#xD;
           tumor cells (CTCs) and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the&#xD;
           expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adult patients must have histologically documented, relapsed solid tumors which have&#xD;
      progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after initial therapy&#xD;
      and without potentially curative options, or patient refuses potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP744 administered IV QD over 1&#xD;
           hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug (28-day cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK and PD samples will be collected. Tumor biopsies will be mandatory during the&#xD;
           expansion phase.&#xD;

    <description>Indenoisoquinolines, such as LMP744, are potent inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase I (Top1). Top1 is necessary for transcription, replication, recombination, and the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. It relaxes the supercoiled DNA by introducing a single-strand break, generating a free strand that rotates around the Top1-bound DNA complex. In the absence of external triggers, Top1-DNA cleavage complexes are generally short lived. Top1 inhibitors are potent anticancer agents because they stabilize the formation of the Top1-DNA cleavage complex in tumor cells, which induces DNA damage, delays DNA repair, and results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. LMP744 exhibited antitumor activity with lower toxicity than other agents in preclinical studies. Treatment of patients with LMP744 is expected to reduce tumor burden at doses that are well-tolerated.</description>

&#xD;
               9. Patients receiving denosumab or bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing&#xD;
                  androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. HIV-positive patients are eligible provided the following criteria are met: CD4&#xD;
                  count &gt;350/mm3, an undetectable viral load, and not receiving prophylaxis&#xD;
                  antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. The effects of LMP744 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
                  women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women and men treated or&#xD;
                  enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to&#xD;
                  the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion&#xD;
                  of LMP744 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
                  document.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Willingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes&#xD;
                  if on the expansion phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in&#xD;
             the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune&#xD;
             deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease&#xD;
             status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the&#xD;
             brain metastases. Patients on anti-seizure medications or steroid therapy may be&#xD;
             enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LMP744 is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with LMP744, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
