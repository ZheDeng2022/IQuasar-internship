  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive lung disease is a disabling disease that affects people usually after&#xD;
      several years of smoke tobacco exposure and affects millions of patients worldwide. The&#xD;
      disease is marked by multiples episode of worsening, termed exacerbations necessitating&#xD;
      frequent hospitalizations. During these exacerbations, patients present breathless, and in&#xD;
      the most severe cases, are admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory&#xD;
      assistance. Currently, respiratory assistance is provided by a ventilator via a oronasal mask&#xD;
      (referred to non-invasive ventilation, NIV), that helps patients to cope with their&#xD;
      breathless. The mask is not always well tolerated and the ventilator sessions are delivered&#xD;
      intermittently. In the past decade, a new technique that provides air-oxygen with high flow&#xD;
      has been developed. This technique, called High Flow via Nasal Cannula (HFNC) can deliver&#xD;
      from 21 to 100% heated and humidified air-oxygen at a high flow of gas via simple nasal&#xD;
      cannula. Recent studies have shown that the technique is very efficient to treat patients&#xD;
      presenting with acute respiratory failure who don't have any underlying chronic pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. Whether the technique would be also efficient in patients with COLD presenting with&#xD;
      severe exacerbations has not yet been demonstrated. Since HFNC does not require any mask, it&#xD;
      is thought that the comfort of the patient would be much better in comparison to NIV and&#xD;
      could potentially help to treat many patients with the disease. The objective of the present&#xD;
      study is to study the physiological effect of HFNC as compared to NIV in patients with severe&#xD;
      exacerbations of COPD and to show that it is non-inferior to NIV.&#xD;

      Design: Prospective, observational, cross-over, clinical physiologic study of HFNC and NIV in&#xD;
      patients with COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure Intervention: Participants will be&#xD;
      consecutively ventilated with the two devices, i.e., HFNC and NIV. HFNC 30 and 50 L/min will&#xD;
      be applied in a random order (sealed, opaque envelope). HFNC will be set with a temperature&#xD;
      at 37°C or 34°C if perceived as too warm. NIV settings will be adjusted based on the clinical&#xD;
      assessment of the Respiratory Therapist as per standard practice and will not be modified&#xD;
      during the test. In both groups, FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of at least 92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The intervention will be applied in the Medical-Surgical ICU of St. Michael's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Each device will be studied for 30 minutes. The entire study will take place over&#xD;
      approximately 3 hours. There is no additional follow-up thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The study will start first by recording patients under spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      considered as a baseline (sequence #1). Under spontaneous breathing, patients will be&#xD;
      receiving oxygen therapy as it is usually done between 2 NIV sessions. Then, the patient will&#xD;
      have 20 -30 minutes to acclimatize to HFNC and select his/her preferred flow rate (sequence&#xD;
      #2). NIV will be applied (sequence #3). The NIV settings will be adjusted based on the&#xD;
      clinical assessment of the Respiratory Therapist and will not be modified throughout the&#xD;
      study. Then, according to randomization order (sealed envelopes), patients will receive a&#xD;
      flow corresponding to the preferred flow selected by the patient and a second flow, either&#xD;
      HFNC 30 L/min or HFNC 50 L/min depending on the initial choice (sequences #4 and #5) (see&#xD;
      flow diagram). FiO2 will be adjusted to achieve a SpO2 of 90 to 94%. Each condition will be&#xD;
      studied for 30 minutes and will be separated by a 5-minute washout period during which&#xD;
      patients will be receiving oxygen therapy. The measurements will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (under spontaneous breathing) and during the last five minutes of each condition. In case of&#xD;
      clinical intolerance as considered by the attending physician, the study will stop. In case&#xD;
      the patient is considered dependent of NIV by clinicians, we will still enroll the patient&#xD;
      without doing baseline period after discussion with clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse oximeter (SpO2) and transcutaneous CO2 monitor (SenTec Digital Monitoring System&#xD;
      (SDMS)) will be continuously monitored throughout the study period. Exspiron device will be&#xD;
      calibrated to measure minute ventilation. Four surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally&#xD;
      to record each hemidiaphragm activity using a specific recording system (Acqknowledge&#xD;
      software, Biopac Systems) A bedside ultrasound examination will be performed, using a&#xD;
      SonoSite system (Fujifilm) equipped with a 10-15 MHz ultrasound linear probe. Diaphragm&#xD;
      thickness will be measured both at end-inspiration and end-expiration. This technique will be&#xD;
      applied at the end of each sequence (before ventilatory assist under conventional O2&#xD;
      therapy). In patients becoming rapidly intolerant to NIV disconnection, we will limit this&#xD;
      &quot;baseline&quot; period under O2 to a minimum (5 minutes). The thickness and contraction of the&#xD;
      intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation of the ultrasound results to determine diaphragm and other muscle thickness&#xD;
      will be read at a later time by an individual blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
