    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and recombinant&#xD;
      interleukin-12 in treating patients with solid tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Recombinant interleukin-12&#xD;
      may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating white blood cells&#xD;
      to kill tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12 may work better than&#xD;
      giving pembrolizumab alone in treating patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      edodekin alfa (recombinant human interleukin [rhIL]-12) in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by continuously monitoring adverse events that will be&#xD;
      documented utilizing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
      v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained&#xD;
      pre-treatment, after one week of rhIL-12 and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in&#xD;
      combination with rhIL-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked&#xD;
      biospecimens (tumor, blood, and stool) obtained pre-treatment and during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Treatment continues for 28 days for cycle 1 and repeats every 21 days for subsequent&#xD;
      cycles for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patient then receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 8 additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 year and&#xD;
      then every 24 weeks for up to 5 years.&#xD;

             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on any systemic corticosteroid therapy within one week before the planned&#xD;
             date for first dose on study would not be eligible; exception: patients on physiologic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment; pregnant women are excluded&#xD;
             from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an agent with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             pembrolizumab (MK-3475), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with pembrolizumab (MK-3475); these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study; pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may have adverse effects on a fetus in&#xD;
             utero; furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has transient adverse&#xD;
             effects on the composition of sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to&#xD;
             use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive; highly&#xD;
             unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a&#xD;
             woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will&#xD;
             be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the&#xD;
             study; the two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a&#xD;
             hormonal method to prevent pregnancy; patients should start using birth control from&#xD;
             study visit 1 throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception:&#xD;
             diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide;&#xD;
             appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed&#xD;
             contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including&#xD;
             oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown&#xD;
                  risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in&#xD;
                  order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception&#xD;
                  requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the&#xD;
                  follow-up period of pregnancy and lactation; if there is any question that a&#xD;
                  patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that&#xD;
                  patient should not be entered into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy: If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab (MK-3475), the patient will immediately be removed from the study;&#xD;
                  the site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient's&#xD;
                  status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the&#xD;
                  pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a&#xD;
                  serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other&#xD;
                  disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study&#xD;
                  investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of&#xD;
                  the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient&#xD;
                  impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed&#xD;
                  immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is unknown whether pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is excreted in human milk; since&#xD;
                  many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious&#xD;
                  adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast-feeding are not&#xD;
                  eligible for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or&#xD;
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment&#xD;
