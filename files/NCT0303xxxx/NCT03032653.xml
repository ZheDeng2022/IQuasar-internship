    <textblock>
      This single-centre historical control group comparative study will compare outcomes of&#xD;
      surgically-treated rotational ankle fractures and the current routine practice of early&#xD;
      protected weightbearing and range of motion with immediate unprotected weightbearing as&#xD;
      tolerated and range of motion after ankle open reduction and internal fixation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fractures are among the most common injuries, making up 9% of all fractures. Rotational&#xD;
      ankle fractures are among the most common of all fractures, with an incidence averaging 4.2&#xD;
      per 1,000 individuals annually. These fractures range from minimal injuries amenable to&#xD;
      non-surgical management to complex injuries with potential of long-term sequelae. Known risk&#xD;
      factors for ankle fractures are age, body mass index and previous ankle fracture, with the&#xD;
      highest incidence in elderly women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ankle fractures are low-energy injuries which occur when the body rotates about a&#xD;
      planted foot, whether it be during sports, normal gait, or otherwise. Stable ankle fractures&#xD;
      are generally treated non-surgically, while unstable fractures are usually treated with&#xD;
      surgical reduction and fixation, with indications previously well-described and published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the post-operative management of such injuries is still controversial, with large&#xD;
      variability between care providers. Protocols range from complete immobilization of the&#xD;
      affected ankle and non-weightbearing to early range-of-motion (ROM) and weightbearing (WB).&#xD;
      Studies have compared immobilization and non-WB to early ROM and WB but results have been&#xD;
      mixed, with the most recent study demonstrating safety and advantages to protected WB and ROM&#xD;
      at two weeks post-operatively versus non-WB and immobilization for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators intend to expand on the studies above and propose a single-centre&#xD;
      historical control group comparative study to compare outcomes of surgically-treated&#xD;
      rotational ankle fractures and the current routine practice of early protected weightbearing&#xD;
      and range of motion with immediate unprotected weightbearing as tolerated and range of motion&#xD;
      after ankle open reduction and internal fixation.&#xD;

At the first follow-up appointment (two weeks post-op), the splint is removed and a removable pre-fabricated walking boot applied. At this stage the patient is permitted to WB as tolerated while wearing the boot, and to perform ROM exercises with the boot removed.
