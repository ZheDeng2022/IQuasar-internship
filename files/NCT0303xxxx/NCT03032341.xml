  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if mobility (the ability to move around)&#xD;
      can be reliably assessed by having the family or care giver caregiver take a video based test&#xD;
      for the patient. If this study shows that mobility can be assessed by family or caregiver,&#xD;
      this information can be used in situations where mobility cannot be measured directly in&#xD;
      patients. A total of 60 patients and 60 family/caregivers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical&#xD;
      Center will take part in this study. Patients physical function will be assessed using a test&#xD;
      that uses short movie clips to assess mobility. Patients will be asked to watch ten short&#xD;
      (~10 seconds each) movie clips that describe various tasks such as climbing up hills or&#xD;
      walking and estimate if they can perform the tasks. The familymember/caregiver will be also&#xD;
      asked to answer the questions on behalf of the patient. The family member/caregiver will be&#xD;
      asked to return to take the same test in the next 1-14 days. The patient will be in the study&#xD;
      for one day. There is no intervention, this is observational.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the U.S. Census Bureau projections, the number of persons 65 years of age or&#xD;
      older will increase from roughly 40 million in the year 2010, to 88.5 million in 2050, a net&#xD;
      increase of 121%. During this same time period, the number of persons 85 years of age or&#xD;
      older will increase by 227%; accounting for nearly 5% of the U.S. population. Mobility and&#xD;
      functional status are important predictors of outcomes in this rapidly growing elderly&#xD;
      population. It has shown that walking speed and physical function, measured by Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance Battery (SPPB) are predictors of mortality in community-dwelling older men and&#xD;
      women. It was also reported that gait speed predicts incident disability in community&#xD;
      dwelling elderly subjects. In our prior study, we have demonstrated that, mobility, assessed&#xD;
      using an animated video clip based assessment tool, Mobility Assessment Tool-short form&#xD;
      (MAT-sf) predicts postoperative complications, length of stay and nursing home placement in&#xD;
      elderly patients (&gt;69) who were undergoing elective surgery that requires overnight&#xD;
      hospitalization and more clinical practices use physical function and mobility as a tool to&#xD;
      predict outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these assessments are not always readily available, especially in clinical&#xD;
      situations when acute illnesses or injuries occurred without any chance to assess the&#xD;
      baseline status, such as acute myocardial infract, rapidly progressing sepsis or catastrophic&#xD;
      trauma. In these cases, patients are often sedated, intubated, have altered mental status, or&#xD;
      too unstable to perform even non-invasive testing. Although some clinicians or researchers&#xD;
      feel that surrogate can accurately assess the patients' baseline physical function and&#xD;
      mobility status, it was never been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that mobility assessment done on surrogates, using MAT-sf will&#xD;
      have high compatibility with the assessment done on elderly patients. Surrogates are defined&#xD;
      as a person who spends &gt;2 hours a day or 8 hours a week with the patient and accompany the&#xD;
      patient to most of their medical appointments. The investigators will test the hypothesis at&#xD;
      the Preoperative Assessment Clinic since this clinic sees high volume of elderly patients and&#xD;
      patients at this clinic tend to have their caregiver with them during the appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll 20 patients in poor mobility group (MAT-sf &lt; 51.38 in men and&#xD;
      &lt;45.61 in women), 20 patients into the mid-mobility group (51.38&lt; MAT-sf≤65.5 in men and&#xD;
      45.61≤MAT-sf&lt;54.02) and 20 patients into the high mobility group (MAT-sf&gt;65.5 in men and&#xD;
      MAT-sf&gt;54.02 in women) for a total of 60 patients and one surrogate per patient for a total&#xD;
      of 120 unique participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess mobility, participants will be instructed on the use of the Mobility Assessment&#xD;
      Tool-short form (MAT-sf). The MAT-sf is a 10-item computer based assessment of mobility using&#xD;
      animated video clips. The 10 items in the MAT-sf cover a broad range of functioning. The&#xD;
      items include walking on level ground, a slow jog, walking outdoors on uneven terrain,&#xD;
      walking up a ramp with and without using a handrail, stepping over hurdles, ascending and&#xD;
      descending stairs with and without the use of a handrail, and climbing stairs while carrying&#xD;
      bags. The items were previously selected based on individual response and information curves&#xD;
      derived from Item Response Theory. Each item is accompanied by an animated video clip&#xD;
      together with the responses for that question (number of minutes, number of times, yes/no).&#xD;
      The test will be performed on an I-PAD and scores will be saved to an exportable file. The&#xD;
      time required to do the test with instructions from the examiner is expected to be no longer&#xD;
      than 5 minutes. While the patient is completing the MAT-sf assessment, the surrogate will be&#xD;
      directed to a separate room to complete MAT-sf for the patient (&quot;Do you think Mr ** can climb&#xD;
      up this hill?) , so there is no interaction between the patient and the surrogate during the&#xD;
      assessment. Investigators will measure the compatibility between patients-surrogates mobility&#xD;
      using MAT-sf and will also assess the stability of surrogate MAT-sf.&#xD;
