  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Spikes and Waves during Sleep (CSWS) is a rare paediatric epileptic&#xD;
      encephalopathy. Even if the correlation between the severity of the epilepsy and the&#xD;
      cognitive consequences is well established, the mechanisms involved in epileptic cognitive&#xD;
      degradation are complex and poorly understood. In CSWS, there are many arguments for the&#xD;
      implication of cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Among them the thalamus seems to&#xD;
      play a crucial role. In fact it is strongly implicated in the sleep and this function is&#xD;
      determining for learning. Moreover, it is part of the propagation pathway of generalized&#xD;
      forms of epilepsy like absences in animal studies. Unfortunately there is no animal model for&#xD;
      CSWS to confirm this theory. In human studies, few cases are caused by thalamic injuries but&#xD;
      most of the time conventional MRI is normal. Despite few literature on CSWS, some studies&#xD;
      reported abnormal functional connectivity especially in the thalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the first utilisation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)&#xD;
      and tractography will be useful in CSWS to confirm the implication of a&#xD;
      cortico-thalamo-cortical network showing an abnormal structural connectivity. The&#xD;
      investigators will try to determinate if a particular thalamic nucleus is concerned and&#xD;
      demonstrate a link between the disease severity (duration and cognitive consequences) and the&#xD;
      importance of structural abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using resting state functional MRI (fMRI), the investigators will also try to investigate the&#xD;
      default mode network. Its implication was also suggested in the literature.&#xD;
