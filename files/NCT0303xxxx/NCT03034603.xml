  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This triple-blinded randomized placebo control trial aims to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Nutri-PEITC jelly, a functional food, in head and neck cancer patients. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure includes adverse events and health-related quality of life. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome includes tumor response and functional status.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, Nutri-jelly, a novel edible nutritious gel for patients with chewing and&#xD;
      swallowing difficulties, was shown to be effective in improving the quality of life of head&#xD;
      and neck cancer patients. Recently, Nutri-PEITC jelly is recently developed by addition of&#xD;
      Phenethyl Isothiocyanate (PEITC), a phytochemical compound with chemopreventive action in&#xD;
      animal bearing oral cancer. It intends to be a functional food for cancer survivor. The dose&#xD;
      of PEITC in Nutri-jelly was based on safe and effective dose determined in animal studies.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Nutri-PEITC jelly was proven safe in healthy volunteers who daily consumes for a&#xD;
      consecutive month with no serious adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Nutri-jelly with PEITC in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      independent variable: continuous Nutri -jelly with PEITC intake dependent variable (outcome):&#xD;
      adverse effects, health-related quality of life score, tumor response and functional status&#xD;
