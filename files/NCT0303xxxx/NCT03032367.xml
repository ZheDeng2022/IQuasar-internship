      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study comparing the bioequivalence of&#xD;
      bedaquiline administered in whole tablet form versus bedaquiline administered in crushed&#xD;
      (experimental) form in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over, bioequivalence study with two single treatment&#xD;
      periods, separated by a 14-day wash-out period, conducted among 24 healthy adult males and&#xD;
      females, who receive 400mg (4 x 100mg) bedaquiline orally in one of two sequences: either&#xD;
      first in whole tablet form and second in crushed (experimental) form, or vice versa under fed&#xD;
      conditions. The bioequivalence evaluation will be based on primary pharmacokinetic (pk)&#xD;
      parameters affecting the extent of absorption, i.e., the bioavailability. If bioequivalence&#xD;
      is not shown, the knowledge about the differences in bioavailability between whole and&#xD;
      crushed tablets will be used for assessing the need of dose adjustment in children receiving&#xD;
      the crushed form.&#xD;
