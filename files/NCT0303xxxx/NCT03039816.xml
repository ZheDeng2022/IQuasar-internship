    <textblock>
      Background: A nasally applied cellulose powder is increasingly used in many countries as a&#xD;
      remedy for allergic rhinitis. In 2009, a 4-week study in birch pollen-allergic children&#xD;
      showed a reduction in nasal symptoms. The best effect occurred on days with lower pollen&#xD;
      counts. The present study in grass pollen-allergic adults used the same basic design.&#xD;
      Methods: In May 2013, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 108 patients&#xD;
      with allergic rhinitis due to grass pollen (18-40 years of age). SMS on mobile phones were&#xD;
      used as reminders of treatment and reporting of symptom scores.&#xD;

      The study was performed at university clinics in Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine in May&#xD;
      2013. 108 subjects 18-40 years of age were recruited locally to 2 centres. They all had a&#xD;
      history of typical symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) during late spring - early&#xD;
      summer. At first appointment the history was scrutinized and an assessment of the severity&#xD;
      excluded previous use of nasal steroids or a current need for nasal steroids. They should not&#xD;
      have perennial symptoms or a history of asthma. They were tested with a blood sample for&#xD;
      ImmunoCAP Specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) for timothy grass pollen and birch pollen, with&#xD;
      &gt;0.35 Kilounits (kU)/ml counted as positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned to active or placebo in groups using an identical device&#xD;
      to be puffed in each nostril 3 times daily. The nasal powders were supplied in plastic&#xD;
      containers, which deliver the powder from a nozzle when squeezed. The exact amount delivered&#xD;
      is not standardized and the variations of patterns of deposition in the nose are not known.&#xD;
      The placebo was a lactose powder with the same particle size, appearance and the same tinge&#xD;
      of mint taste as the cellulose powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue medication could be obtained by the investigators after emergency contacts. Oral&#xD;
      antihistamine was loratadine 10 mg tablets and sodium chromoglycate eye drops. Each subject&#xD;
      obtained oral and written instructions about the SMS. The SMS-reporting of symptoms started&#xD;
      with a run in period for 3 days before the treatment and lasted for the 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      during the grass pollen season&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times a day the patients were reminded by SMS to take their nasal puffs and were asked&#xD;
      to confirm the intake by a response SMS. In the evening, they were asked about the severity&#xD;
      of symptoms during the preceding day from the nose, eyes and lower airways and to answer with&#xD;
      a figure 1-6, corresponding to 1 &quot;no trouble at all&quot;, 2&quot;little trouble&quot;, 3&quot;moderate trouble&quot;,&#xD;
      4&quot;rather much trouble&quot;, 5&quot;much trouble&quot;, and 6 &quot;very much trouble&quot; respectively. From the&#xD;
      nose, scoring of sneezing, running nose and blocked nose were reported. For the eyes and&#xD;
      lower airways, respectively, only a concluding figure was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the registration a question was added daily on the use of rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a concluding appointment after the treatment period, the subjects were asked about their&#xD;
      global opinion of the efficacy: No effect, good effect, very good effect. They also were&#xD;
      asked whether they believed they had obtained the active substance or placebo.&#xD;

      asked whether they believed they had obtained the active substance or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods For each question the mean score was calculated for the whole 28 days&#xD;
      period for every subject. Mean values for the sum of all scores as well as the sum of the&#xD;
      nasal scores were also calculated. The scores from the two treatment groups were then&#xD;
      compared using t-tests. The group comparison of reflective opinions and the guess on obtained&#xD;
      medication at the follow up visit were assessed using the Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concluding opinion at the follow up visit were analysed using the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the local ethics committees at the respective hospitals.&#xD;
