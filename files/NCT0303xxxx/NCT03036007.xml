      Background: Patients suffering residual disability after anterior decompression and fusion&#xD;
      (ACDF) surgery for cervical disc disease may be prescribed physical activity (PPA) or&#xD;
      neck-specific exercises (NSE). Currently, we lack data for the success of either approach.&#xD;
      There is also a knowledge-gap concerning the use of internet-based care for chronic neck&#xD;
      pain, inclusive of cervical disc disease. The scarcity of these data, and the high proportion&#xD;
      of patients with various degrees of incapacity following ACDF, warrants increased efforts to&#xD;
      investigate and improve cost-effective rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a structured, internet-based NSE program,&#xD;
      versus PPA following ACDF surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective, randomised, experimental, longitudinal multicentre study,&#xD;
      that includes 140 patients with residual disability (≥30% on the Neck Disability Index; NDI)&#xD;
      following ACDF for radiculopathy due to cervical disc disease. Patient recruitment occurs&#xD;
      following attendance at routine clinical appointments, scheduled for 3-months post-surgery.&#xD;
      Patients are then randomised to one of two groups (70 patients/group), scheduled for a&#xD;
      3-month treatment of either internet-based NSE or PPA. Questionnaires on background data,&#xD;
      pain and discomfort, physical and mental capacity, satisfaction with care, and health and&#xD;
      workplace factors are completed, with physical measurements of neck-related function&#xD;
      performed by independent test leaders blinded to randomisation. Measurements are performed at&#xD;
      inclusion, after the 3-month treatments (end of treatment), and at a 2-year follow-up.&#xD;
      Radiography will be completed at the 2-year follow-up. Preoperative data will be collected&#xD;
      from the Swedish Spine Registry (Swespine). Data on healthcare consumption, drug use, and&#xD;
      sick leave will be requested from the relevant national registers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether internet-based, structured NSE, differs&#xD;
      from PPA after surgery for cervical disc disease, in relation to function, pain, work&#xD;
      capacity, health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that internet-based NSE will be superior in terms of outcome measures to&#xD;
      PPA. This assumption, based on an earlier study of patients with chronic WAD, remains&#xD;
      untested for individuals with residual disability following ACDF. The project is expected to&#xD;
      lead to improved care, well-being, and patient satisfaction, and, as a result, a reduced&#xD;
      societal burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a prospective, randomised, experimental longitudinal multicentre study, with a&#xD;
      two-year follow-up. Questionnaires are distributed and physical measurements taken at&#xD;
      baseline, at the end of treatment (3 months after enrolment), and after 2 years. Preoperative&#xD;
      data is collected from Swespine. Patients are recruited from the surgical unit following&#xD;
      regular follow-up visits to the physiotherapist/surgeon at approximately 3 months&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the study criteria be met, and after the receipt of written and oral informed consent,&#xD;
      the patient completes a questionnaire and undergoes physical measurements of neck-related&#xD;
      function. The patient is then randomised (computerised block randomisation list compiled by&#xD;
      statisticians) to one of two groups for 3 months of treatment with a) internet-based NSE with&#xD;
      3 visits to the physiotherapist or b) PPA with 3 visits to the physiotherapist. In addition,&#xD;
      and prior to treatment, patients in both groups are examined by a physiotherapist, in&#xD;
      accordance with Swedish law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test leader is a physiotherapist at the surgical unit who is not involved in study&#xD;
      treatment and is blinded to the randomisation groups. Qualified clinicians will perform&#xD;
      X-rays and (potentially) ultrasound registration. Following randomization the results will be&#xD;
      put into an opaque envelope that contains the name of the patient and their randomisation&#xD;
      group, which is sent to the physiotherapy outpatient care clinic. Questionnaires and tests of&#xD;
      physical neck-related function are conducted at baseline (before randomisation), after 3&#xD;
      months (when the treatment ends), and after 2 years. Participant physiotherapists will be&#xD;
      provided oral, written, and practical training, and are able to consult project managers at&#xD;
      any time. Exercise diaries and the number of care contacts will be recorded for both groups.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Intervention Internet-based neck-specific exercise (NSE) Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      an explanation and justification for their exercise. Training includes exercises to activate&#xD;
      the deep neck muscles (initially daily), continuing with endurance training of the neck and&#xD;
      shoulder muscles (3 times/week). Exercise will be tailored to the individual's physical&#xD;
      condition, and then scaled up progressively in terms of severity and dose. Participants will&#xD;
      undertake three visits to the physiotherapist, where the exercises will be introduced and&#xD;
      repeated, in order to establish and control patient comprehension. The exercise is completed&#xD;
      with the help of internet support outside of the healthcare system, which can be accessed&#xD;
      anywhere, but most probably at home. Photos and videos of the exercises, information, and&#xD;
      answers to frequently asked questions are available on the internet-support platform.&#xD;
      Patients can contact a physiotherapist by e-mail if necessary. Three visits to the&#xD;
      physiotherapist are provided in addition to a mandatory first visit (for new clinical&#xD;
      investigations as required by Swedish law). At the end of the treatment period, the patients&#xD;
      are encouraged to continue practicing the exercises on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribed physical activity (PPA) The training consists of general, physical, land-based&#xD;
      activity (3 times/week). The aim is to find a physical activity outside of the care unit that&#xD;
      suits the individual, based on their specific needs and problems. The goal is that the&#xD;
      individual should increase their overall level of physical activity, and that that activity&#xD;
      is performed as part of a self-care/wellness routine. This may involve activities that can be&#xD;
      performed at home, such as walking according to a set schedule, home exercises given by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist (not neck-specific training), and aerobic classes etc. To increase&#xD;
      compliance, a simple motivational interview is performed before the PPA schedule is provided,&#xD;
      which can occur during the same session or at a separate visit, should the physiotherapist&#xD;
      and patient prefer. Patients are advised to contact the physiotherapist should their&#xD;
      prescribed activity fail to work so that another activity can be identified. Three visits to&#xD;
      the physiotherapist are provided in addition to a mandatory first visit (for new clinical&#xD;
      investigations as required by Swedish law), with the patient encouraged to continue&#xD;
      practicing on their own at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistics Seventy participants per group (i.e. a total of 140&#xD;
      patients) are required. Sample size calculations (conducted by statisticians) are based on&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure of Neck Disability Index (NDI). In order to detect a clinically&#xD;
      relevant improvement of 10 NDI points, 70 participants per group are needed (assuming 80%&#xD;
      power, and a level of significance of 5%). This calculation is based on group differences&#xD;
      recorded in previous studies. These include a study in which individuals with chronic&#xD;
      whiplash-associated injuries were offered training, as well as a study investigating the&#xD;
      benefits of surgery over and above physical therapy for cervical disc disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we lack any studies on rehabilitation for patients with disability after ACDF, this&#xD;
      calculation remains hypothetical and our sample size may need to be adjusted after the first&#xD;
      30 people (15/group) have completed the 3-month follow-up. This number can also be adjusted&#xD;
      in the event of participants dropping-out, such that at least 70 individuals per group&#xD;
      complete the intervention. Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
      Alternative analyses (sub-group analyses) will be carried out where the degree of&#xD;
      implementation of treatment (compliance) is taken into account, as well as sex, dizziness,&#xD;
      headaches, neurological findings, and the number of segmental levels operated on. Analyses&#xD;
      will be performed using parametric or non-parametric statistics, depending on the type of&#xD;
      data, in consultation with statisticians as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound registrations, electromyography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and kinesthesia may be&#xD;
      done on a sub-group of participants to investigate neck muscle structure and function.&#xD;
      Interviews may be done on a sub-group of individuals regarding their function, experiences&#xD;
      and opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in&#xD;
      Linköping Ref: 2016 / 283-31. The scientists are independent with no commercial ties.&#xD;
      Patients are recruited after providing informed consent. Patient data are presented at the&#xD;
      group level such that no connection to any individual can be made. All data are anonymised&#xD;
      when reported, and subject to the Official Secrets Health Acts. The test leaders are&#xD;
      independent and blinded for randomisation. Exercises, both general and neck-specific, have&#xD;
      been used extensively in clinical practice and we anticipate no harm from their&#xD;
      implementation other than a risk of muscle soreness. Any important harms or unintended&#xD;
      effects in each group will be collected by the test leaders. All questionnaires and test&#xD;
      materials are encoded by the research group, with code lists stored in locked, fireproof file&#xD;
      cabinets, housed at the university in a room with controlled (card-based) access. Only&#xD;
      individuals in receipt of a unique website address posted by the researchers can access the&#xD;
      program; patients can neither communicate with each other nor with caregivers via the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
