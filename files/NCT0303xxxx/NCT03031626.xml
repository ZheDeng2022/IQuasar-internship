  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if treatment with Medical Air (21% oxygen in room air)&#xD;
      compared to supplemental oxygen (100% oxygen) will lead to similar improvements in the&#xD;
      central apnea-hypopnea index (CAHI) for infants with Prader-Willi Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the vast amount of research investigating the cause of central sleep apnea, there&#xD;
      remain gaps in knowledge, lending to further research efforts. The decision to compare oxygen&#xD;
      to medical air is based on several theorized mechanisms. The first of which is the&#xD;
      supposition that provision of medical air may act as an arousal stimulus for the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, thereby preventing sleep disordered breathing. Secondly, the hypercapnic&#xD;
      challenge performed by Livingston et al demonstrated a delayed hypercapneic arousal response&#xD;
      in PWS subjects despite simultaneous hyperoxia, leading us to question if therapeutic oxygen&#xD;
      really plays a significant role in treating CSA. Lastly, the delivery of medical air via&#xD;
      nasal prongs may provide sufficient arousal to terminate the cycle of events leading to&#xD;
      central apnea, as described by Urquhart et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deeper understanding of central sleep apnea is essential to ameliorating its adverse&#xD;
      sequelae, which include symptoms of ADHD, impaired attention, behavioral problems, and&#xD;
      academic difficulties.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The screening visit will occur during a regularly scheduled clinic visit. The patients that have consented for the study will all undergo the baseline PSG. Only patients with clinically significant CSA after Visit 1 will undergo randomization and complete Visit 2.&#xD;
Those who have a CAHI greater or equal to 5 will be randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Randomization will be performed using a computer with random numbers drawn. Arm A will receive Medical Air followed by Oxygen and Arm B will receive Oxygen followed by Medical Air.</intervention_model_description>
