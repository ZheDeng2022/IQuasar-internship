    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with a history of treatment, within the past year, of both asthma and either&#xD;
      depression or an anxiety disorder will be recruited for this study. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from their doctors and from advertisements. The investigators will randomly assign&#xD;
      patients to two groups, using a crossover design. One group will first receive three months&#xD;
      with four biweekly sessions of heart rate variability biofeedback treatment, and then will be&#xD;
      followed for three months with a daily symptom diary. The other group will first be followed&#xD;
      for three months, and then given the three months of treatment. In both treatment and&#xD;
      following procedures, patients will receive psychophysiological testing sessions at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the three month period. The investigators will assess symptoms of&#xD;
      asthma, anxiety, and depression as well as pulmonary function and will measure heart rate&#xD;
      (from electrodes on the wrists), respiration (through a belt around the waist), end tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (through a cannula in the nose).&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous published research from our laboratory has demonstrated a clinically significant&#xD;
      effect for heart rate variability biofeedback on asthma clinical condition. In an&#xD;
      NIH-supported trial just completed, however, the investigators found that, among unmedicated&#xD;
      patients with mild or moderate asthma, the effects were no greater than for most placebos&#xD;
      found in the literature. Significant effects were found in reducing anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      even among a population that was selected neither for clinical anxiety or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence from the literature that negative affect is common in asthma,&#xD;
      and that it may interact with asthma. Anxiety is often accompanied by hyperventilation, as is&#xD;
      asthma, and hyperventilation can exacerbate asthma, by increasing exposure to in air that is&#xD;
      colder drier than the lung (body temperature at 100% humidity). Indeed some of the asthma&#xD;
      symptoms affecting quality of life are associated with hyperventilation, which may partially&#xD;
      be stimulated by anxiety, and partially by increased airway resistance, which increases&#xD;
      respiratory drive. Thus asthma processes can increase anxiety (through symptoms associated&#xD;
      with hyperventilation), just as anxiety can exacerbate asthma (through hyperventilation).&#xD;
      Additionally, autonomic hyperreactivity, which is common in anxiety, may produce&#xD;
      parasympathetic hyperreactivity that may cause bronchoconstriction. There is considerable&#xD;
      evidence that heart rate variability (HRVB) biofeedback ameliorates anxiety, just as it does&#xD;
      asthma, so the combined effect may prove particularly beneficial to people with the comorbid&#xD;
      condition. The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to test the effect of HRVB on an&#xD;
      asthma population that is clinically anxious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another consistent effect of HRVB is on ameliorating depression. There is a good&#xD;
      physiological rationale for using HRVB to treat negative affect and depression, stemming from&#xD;
      anatomical evidence for connections between the site of HRVB effects on the baroreflex&#xD;
      (mediated through nucleus tractus solitarius) and brain centers involved in negative emotion,&#xD;
      particularly the insula and amygdala. Depression also is highly prevalent among asthma&#xD;
      patients, and depressed patients often have poor health care behavior, and this may worsen&#xD;
      asthma condition. Depressive symptoms also are associated with bronchoconstriction in asthma.&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression are frequently comorbid, with some overlapping symptoms, so many&#xD;
      anxiety patients will be expected to also show signs of clinical depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it is possible that HRVB may improve by making asthma medication more available to the&#xD;
      lungs, through deep breathing. Therefore asthma medication will not be restricted in this&#xD;
      study, but medication intake will be monitored as one outcome measure. Similarly medication&#xD;
      for anxiety or depression also will not be controlled, but daily intake and changes in&#xD;
      medications will be monitored. Additionally patients with all levels of asthma severity will&#xD;
      be studied, as long as they continue to be symptomatic. It is possible that, in a previous&#xD;
      study, restricting inclusion to patients only with very mild asthma may have contributed to a&#xD;
      floor effect that obscured biofeedback effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will use the same HRVB protocol as used in previous studies.&#xD;
      The control group will be a waiting list control, who will be given a post-assessment at&#xD;
      three months, and then given the treatment protocol, in a crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment and Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients will be recruited for this study, 10 for the treatment group and 10 for the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from media advertisements, physician referrals, and from letters&#xD;
      (approved by the Institutional Review Board) sent by physicians to their asthma patients&#xD;
      inviting them to participate in the study. At the physicians' request, study personnel may&#xD;
      assist the office in preparing mailings. The investigators also will work with a large&#xD;
      behavioral healthcare organization, University Behavioral Healthcare (UBHC), which also&#xD;
      provides primary care to patients treated there. UBHC will provide a list of patients with&#xD;
      diagnoses including asthma and one of the anxiety disorders. The investigators will contact&#xD;
      the patient's physician or therapist, and ask the provider to give a recruitment brochure to&#xD;
      the patient, inviting the patient to call the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over a course of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and run-in. At the first session, patients will first be consented. Then they will&#xD;
      be given an interview to determine medical and psychiatric history, and will be given the&#xD;
      Asthma Control Test and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. They also will be given a peak flow&#xD;
      meter, trained to take a reliable measure with it, and instructed in completing the daily&#xD;
      diary. Patients who are unable to follow these procedures by the following session (about 1-2&#xD;
      weeks later, the first psychophysiological test session, as described below) will be screened&#xD;
      out. Patients will be administered the Asthma Quality of Life questionnaire for standardized&#xD;
      situations, Asthma Control Test, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory. The Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale also will be administered in the&#xD;
      pretest session, as this test is known to predict the correlation between symptoms self&#xD;
      report and psychophysiological indicators, as well as stress-related asthma symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First three month treatment phase: Treatment and control procedures will take place in the&#xD;
      first three months, The three months of treatment will consist of 5 biweekly treatment&#xD;
      sessions, and 2 measurement sessions (with a third session for patients in the control group&#xD;
      after they receive treatment). In the control condition, patients will be asked to send daily&#xD;
      questionnaires (and be given reminder calls) every two weeks). They will be provided with&#xD;
      stamped addressed envelopes. The treatment sessions will be an hour long each and the&#xD;
      measurement sessions will be 2 hours long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second three-month treatment phase: Following the post-test psychophysiological test session,&#xD;
      subjects in the control condition will be given three months of treatment, as above, and&#xD;
      patients initially assigned to the Treatment group will receive the same procedure as control&#xD;
      group subjects in the initial phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home practice: Subjects will be asked to do paced breathing at their resonance frequency&#xD;
      (approximately 6 breaths/min) for 20 min twice daily after the first session of treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects who find this procedure difficult will be lent a biofeedback machine for home&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysiological testing sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysiological testing sessions will take place before the first treatment session (or&#xD;
      waiting list period), and after the last treatment session (or waiting list period) in both&#xD;
      phases of the study. Thus three testing sessions will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: In the second and third testing sessions, the same questionnaires given at&#xD;
      the screening session will be readministered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pulmonary function test will be performed using standard spirometry (Three forced&#xD;
      expiratory maneuvers from maximal vital capacity). Sensors will then be affixed to measure&#xD;
      heart rate (from the wrists), respiration (a strain gauge around the waist), finger pulse&#xD;
      volume (from a plethysmograph attached to the middle finger of the nondominant hand), and&#xD;
      palmar skin conductance (from electrodes pasted to the forefinger and thenar eminence of the&#xD;
      nondominant hand). Exhaled carbon dioxide will be collected from a nasal cannula to measure&#xD;
      hyperventilation symptoms, which are targeted by HRVB, and which are common in asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sensors are attached, 5-min baseline period will take place in which patients will do a&#xD;
      'plain vanilla task' (looking at a series of colored rectangles, counting the number of a&#xD;
      particular color), followed by 5 minutes of HRV biofeedback or uninstructed relaxation (for&#xD;
      the control group), followed by another baseline. After each 5-min period, three minutes of&#xD;
      testing will be done using a forced oscillation pneumograph, followed by spirometry (the&#xD;
      standard 3-puff procedure). This instrument involves playing sound waves into the mouth, and&#xD;
      measuring sounds bounced back from the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the canulas are sometimes mildly uncomfortable, the 5-min baseline and biofeedback&#xD;
      (or relaxation) periods will be given twice, once with the measure of end tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) and once without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing sessions will be performed after a 6-hour albuterol withhold. If a patient&#xD;
      experiences an exacerbation of asthma symptoms, the patient will be instructed to take&#xD;
      medication as usual, and the session will be rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function measures (impulse oscillometry and spirometry) will be taken using a&#xD;
      Jaeger 'IOS (Impulse Oscillometry System) Masterscreen' unit after each 5-min assessment&#xD;
      period. Other psychophysiological measures will be taken using a J&amp;J Engineering C2+, which&#xD;
      will output electrocardiogram (EKG) data at 1000 samples/sec for later analysis using a&#xD;
      program called 'WinCPRS'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to provide a daily symptom diary and twice daily peak flow readings&#xD;
      (morning upon arising and evening prior to retiring)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified randomization protocol will be used, with three criteria: gender, age (older or&#xD;
      younger than 40, the age where HRV tends to abruptly decrease), and asthma control (percent&#xD;
      expected on the basis of normative data of the amount of air exhaled in the first second of a&#xD;
      forced expiratory maneuver from maximal vital capacity (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed models repeated measures analysis will be done on all measures with Treatment as a&#xD;
      between-groups measure and Session (and Task for physiological measures after the three tasks&#xD;
      in the physiological testing sessions).&#xD;
