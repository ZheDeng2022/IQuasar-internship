  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if oral administration of 240mg PAC of cranberries can reduce the number of&#xD;
      episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and improve general QoL in women with recurrent&#xD;
      bacterial cystitis. In addition, the effect on vagina and rectal flora will studied and the&#xD;
      adverse effect profile of the drug will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with â‰¥3 symptomatic episodes of lower UTIs at the previous year will be recruited from&#xD;
      the outpatient population who present to their family physician or specialist with&#xD;
      symptomatic recurrent UTI. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients and they will&#xD;
      be divided in groups according to their age. Urinary culture, vaginal and rectal swab will be&#xD;
      taken from all the patients. Antibiotic treatment will be prescribed (using the drug of&#xD;
      choice according to the urine culture and the treating physician choice). Subsequently, they&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive combined antibiotic treatment with one capsule of Cysticlean&#xD;
      240mg PAC two times per day or antibiotic treatment with placebo. At 14th day post treatment&#xD;
      and after a negative urinary culture patients will continue to receive per os, daily, one&#xD;
      capsule of Cysticlean 240mg at bed time for 12 months or placebo respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at 3rd, 6th , 9th and 12th month treatment phase. A urine collection,&#xD;
      vaginal swabs and rectal swab will be taken at study entry and at the month 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about medication usage, any side effects they may be experiencing&#xD;
      at each study visit. If participants develop a UTI at any time during the study, they will be&#xD;
      asked to visit the study site within 24 hours.&#xD;
