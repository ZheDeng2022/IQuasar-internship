    <textblock>
      As individuals grow older, a number of factors can reduce our cognitive (or thinking)&#xD;
      abilities such as &quot;normal&quot; aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether cognitive rehabilitation and transcranial electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (TES) can improve cognitive abilities. Cognitive rehabilitation refers to methods&#xD;
      that are used to improve tasks people have trouble doing in everyday life. Transcranial&#xD;
      electrical stimulation uses small amounts of electricity to try to alter brain functioning.&#xD;
      These approaches may help improve cognitive abilities like attention, learning, memory,&#xD;
      finding words, and problem solving as well as everyday functioning. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to identify how to best use these methods, either alone or in combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a neurorehabilitation&#xD;
      treatment tailored to individual patient needs, with the ultimate goal of maximizing&#xD;
      cognitive and real-world functioning for older adults with cognitive aging, mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI), neurodegenerative, or other neurological diseases/conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) is a non-invasive, neurorehabilitation procedure in&#xD;
      which a weak electric current is passed between electrodes that are placed on the scalp with&#xD;
      the intention of modulating excitability of the underlying brain regions. Because the field&#xD;
      of TES is relatively young, rapidly evolving, and primarily focused on cognitive neuroscience&#xD;
      with &quot;healthy&quot; individuals, there is a clear need for well-conceptualized and conducted&#xD;
      clinical research. The current protocol is intentionally broad with respect to both&#xD;
      methodology and patient characteristics in order to tailor potential TES interventions to&#xD;
      individual patients or small samples. The current protocol utilizes various forms of TES&#xD;
      including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), alternating current stimulation&#xD;
      (tACS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS) and sham stimulation in older adults. As this is&#xD;
      a cross-over design, some participants may receive active (or &quot;real&quot;) TES and/or sham TES&#xD;
      conditions.This includes head to head comparisons of the different forms of TES.&#xD;
      Additionally, TES could be performed in conjunction with cognitively-based intervention since&#xD;
      this may enhance the neuroplastic response of the targeted brain region(s) while at the same&#xD;
      time shaping/optimizing the pathways that are engaged by cognitively-based interventions.&#xD;
      This broad approach is important since etiological differences in cognitive impairment may&#xD;
      necessitate distinct interventions.&#xD;
