      After Institutional Review Board approval, adult patients scheduled for total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) will be enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent over a 24&#xD;
      month period. Interim analyses of cases who have completed the 6 month follow up as on 31st&#xD;
      October, 2017 will be analyzed as part of the co- principle investigator's thesis. All&#xD;
      consenting patients will be assessed for pain preoperatively, the first 3 post-operative&#xD;
      days, at 1, 4 and 6 months from the date of surgery. Pain scores will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale during the 3 postoperative days. Pain will be managed by the Acute&#xD;
      Pain Service team as per standard protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brief pain inventory (BPI) (short form with translations, obtained with permission from&#xD;
      MD Anderson), which assesses pain severity and its impact on daily functions will be&#xD;
      administered to the patient in a language familiar to them, preoperatively, at 1, 4 and 6&#xD;
      months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) which evaluates the functional condition&#xD;
      (impairment) after completed tumour treatment will be estimated at the end of 6 months from&#xD;
      the date of surgery The painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) a quick, simple and reliable&#xD;
      screening tool to identify the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in patients and&#xD;
      validated in various languages including Hindi and Marathi will be administered&#xD;
      preoperatively and at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation will also be obtained from patient's&#xD;
      notes and the electronic medical record. If the patient cannot follow up at the said&#xD;
      intervals, the pain scores would be obtained telephonically and the BPI and PD-Q forms in&#xD;
      prepaid envelopes would be given to them at discharge which they would have to duly fill in&#xD;
      and post them to the given address at the appropriate intervals if they cannot visit the pain&#xD;
      clinic. At the 6th month of follow up, they would be requested to visit the pain clinic for&#xD;
      an assessment of MSTS score and completing the BPI and PD-Q.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:- A Total Knee Replacement (TKR) or arthroplasty (TKA) is a complex procedure&#xD;
      that requires an Orthopedic Surgeon to make precise measurements and skillfully remove the&#xD;
      diseased portions of the bone, in order to shape the remaining bone to accommodate the knee&#xD;
      implant. Knee Replacement Surgery is most commonly performed in people with advanced&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and should be considered when conservative treatments have been exhausted.&#xD;
      Oncologic TKRs are different from the routine TKRs in a way that the former involves a wide&#xD;
      local resection of the bone and soft tissues, ranging from 10 to 20 cm, resection of muscles&#xD;
      like the head(s) of biceps femoris, the gastrocnemius muscle, the intermuscular septa, the&#xD;
      joint capsule, etc. to ensure negative margins along with the complete resection of the&#xD;
      tumour, followed by a reconstruction of almost the same length as that resected, to restore&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common indication for doing oncologic TKR is Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) of and around&#xD;
      the knee joint. The distal femur and proximal tibia are among the most common sites for&#xD;
      primary bone tumor. OGS is the most common bone cancer in the world in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, and the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for 4% of all&#xD;
      childhood cancers worldwide. In India, the incidence varies from 4.7% to 11.6%, where this&#xD;
      malignancy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additional treatment&#xD;
      involves chemotherapy which further delays the healing and recovery of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is a known risk factor for development of Chronic Post Surgical Pain(CPSP) which as&#xD;
      per the definition given by Macrae and Davies, is defined by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain developing after a surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain of at least 2 months' duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other causes of pain excluded (e.g.- malignancy, infection, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain continuing from a pre-existing pain problem excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPSP is a well known risk factor in many surgeries like (but not exclusive of)-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mastectomy (Incidence of chronic pain = 11-57%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amputation (30-85%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inguinal hernia(5-63%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholecystectomy (3-50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPSP develops after a surgical procedure or increases in intensity after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Literature on TKR surgeries indicated for osteoarthritis, report that although&#xD;
      many patients report a good outcome after their total knee replacement, at a time when&#xD;
      recovery should have been achieved, about 10-34% of patients undergoing TKR for&#xD;
      osteoarthritis report moderate to severe CPSP. In around 30% of patients with CPSP, the&#xD;
      origin of CPSP might be neuropathic. Neuropathic pain is more severe and adversely affects&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients. TKR on its own may cause neuropathic pain postoperatively&#xD;
      due to local nerve damage, often to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve or due to&#xD;
      local inflammation. Risk factors associated with the operation include increased duration of&#xD;
      surgery and tourniquet time, revision surgery, TKA versus unicompartmental arthroplasty and&#xD;
      intraoperative nerve damage. Oncologic TKRs are more extensive and include much morbid&#xD;
      excisions, and consequently may be presumed to have a similar if not a greater incidence of&#xD;
      CPSP. Some of the risk factors for CPSP include the following (but not exclusive of)-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain, moderate to severe, lasting more than 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Younger age (adults)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical approach with risk of nerve damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative pain is consistently found to be a predictor for persistent postsurgical pain,&#xD;
      which might reflect an independent risk factor but could well be a manifestation of&#xD;
      predisposing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tata Memorial Hospital, a tertiary cancer institute is a 629 bedded hospital and conducts&#xD;
      approximately 6000 surgeries per year out of which approximately 100 TKRs are performed per&#xD;
      year. Analgesia peri-operatively is provided by an epidural infusion of a combination of&#xD;
      local anaesthetic and an opioid or intravenous opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      analgesics and paracetamol as appropriate. Postoperatively, if inserted, epidural analgesia&#xD;
      is continued for up to 3-4 days to help mobilization &amp; physiotherapy. In the absence of an&#xD;
      epidural, around the clock analgesics with or without an opioid administered by means of an&#xD;
      Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IVPCA) device is instituted. These patients are&#xD;
      visited by the acute pain service team to address pain issues for the first 3 postoperative&#xD;
      days or sometimes longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:- Prospective and Observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS and MATERIALS:- After Institutional Review Board approval, adult patients scheduled&#xD;
      for TKR surgeries will be enrolled into the study after obtaining their informed consent over&#xD;
      a 24 month period. However, interim analyses of all cases who have completed the 6 month&#xD;
      follow up as on 31st October, 2017 would be analyzed as part of the co- principle&#xD;
      investigator's thesis. All consenting patients will be assessed for their pain preoperatively&#xD;
      and for the first 3 post-operative days, and at 1, 4 and 6 months from the date of surgery.&#xD;
      Pain scores will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale during the 3 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Pain will be managed by the Acute Pain Service team as per the standard management&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brief pain inventory (BPI), (short form with translations, obtained with permission from&#xD;
      MD Anderson), which assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions&#xD;
      will be administered to the patient in the language familiar to them, preoperatively, at 1, 4&#xD;
      and 6 months postoperatively. The BPI is a useful instrument to assess the severity of pain&#xD;
      and impact of pain on daily functions in patients with pain from chronic diseases, conditions&#xD;
      such as cancer, osteoarthritis and low back pain, or with pain from acute conditions such as&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The short form comprises of nine questions related to the severity of&#xD;
      pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain&#xD;
      relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. It has been widely used and validated in&#xD;
      several languages the world over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score (MSTS) evaluates the functional condition&#xD;
      (impairment) after completed tumour treatment will be estimated at the end of 6 months from&#xD;
      the date of surgery. It is calculated on the basis of a standardized physical examination by&#xD;
      the physician. This clinical examination assesses six criteria and differs slightly between&#xD;
      the upper and lower limb. For the lower limb, the components are pain, function, emotional&#xD;
      acceptance of the treatment outcome, need for walking aids, walking and gait. For all&#xD;
      criteria, the estimate is made from bad to very good with parallel awarding of points (0 to&#xD;
      5). There is thus a numerical value for each of the six criteria. These six values are added&#xD;
      and divided by the maximum possible number of points (30). The percentage value is obtained&#xD;
      by multiplying the calculated point value by 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a quick, simple and reliable screening tool to&#xD;
      identify the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component in patients with neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      This questionnaire had been prepared by professionals and validated in various languages&#xD;
      including Hindi and Marathi. Its sensitivity and specificity is higher than other screening&#xD;
      questionnaires for neuropathic pain, including the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), Leeds&#xD;
      Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS), and the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire&#xD;
      (NPQ) (Freynhagen et al 2006). The PD-Q has been used to identify neuropathic pain in&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis (Ohtori et al 2012) and to identify sensory proﬁles in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia (Baron et al 2009).This&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered tot he patients preoperatively , at 1, 4 and 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation will also be obtained from patient's&#xD;
      notes and the electronic medical record. If the patient cannot follow up at the said&#xD;
      intervals, the pain scores would be obtained telephonically and the BPI and PD-Q forms in&#xD;
      prepaid envelopes would be given to them at discharge which they would have to duly fill in&#xD;
      and post them to the given address at the appropriate intervals if they cannot visit the pain&#xD;
      clinic. At the 6th month of follow up, they would be requested to visit the pain clinic for&#xD;
      an assessment of MSTS score and completing the BPI and PD-Q.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All demographic, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data would be collected&#xD;
           by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data includes case no, age, sex, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists)&#xD;
           grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative variables include pain score, preoperative analgesics, duration of use, and&#xD;
           the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative variables include duration of surgery, tourniquet time, any nerve or&#xD;
           muscle resection and length of bone resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative variables include median average and worst pain score for the first 3&#xD;
           postoperative days , 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesics administered postoperatively, dose &amp; dosing intervals, impact on daily&#xD;
           functions as obtained from the BPI pre-operatively, 1, 4 and 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The painDETECT score to identify the neuropathic component of pain if any,&#xD;
           preoperatively and at 1, 4 and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MSTS score calculated by the physician and obtained from the patient's record at the&#xD;
           6th month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:- The above mentioned data will be presented as mean (sd), median&#xD;
      (range), and frequency (percentage). Categorical data will be analyzed using the Chi-square&#xD;
      test or Fisher Exact test (for binary data). Continuous variables will be analyzed using&#xD;
      paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as per distribution of data. Repeated measure&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used for pain score analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients will be used for&#xD;
      association. p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistical significant.&#xD;
