  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by propensity for spontaneous&#xD;
      epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell&#xD;
      activity in the brain. About 0.7-1% of the world population suffers from seizures. The most&#xD;
      common treatment is based on seizure medications that enables about 2/3 of the patients to&#xD;
      control their seizures. However, about 20 million patients worldwide, suffer from&#xD;
      unpredictable seizures without remedy, and are resistant to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study EEG and other physiologic signals are collected using wearable sensors, from&#xD;
      Epilepsy patients who are at risk of experiencing seizures. The collected signals will be&#xD;
      used for developing algorithms that may identify pre-seizure and seizure related periods.&#xD;
