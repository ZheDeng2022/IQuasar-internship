  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the accuracy of glenoid&#xD;
      implant placement comparing four groups of patients. Group 1 consists of 3D imaging and&#xD;
      computer-generated surgical planning using standard DePuy instrumentation for placement of&#xD;
      the glenoid implant. This group is considered the standard of care. Group 2 consists of 3D&#xD;
      imaging and computer-generated surgical planning, with use of a SmartBone to trial the&#xD;
      standard DePuy instrumentation. (Group 2 is Group 1 with addition of the use of a SmartBone.)&#xD;
      Group 3 consists of 3D imaging and computer-generated surgical planning, with use of the IRI&#xD;
      technology including a SmartBone, but with metal legs instead of plastic legs in the&#xD;
      IRB#13-652 study. Group 4 consists of 3D imaging and computer-generated surgical planning,&#xD;
      with use of the RTI technology including a SmartBone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure implant placement based on 3D CT imaging. We will measure pre-operative bone&#xD;
      quality using quantitative CT scan to measure trabecular bone volume and correlate these&#xD;
      findings with bone samples removed from the humeral head and measured by microCT and&#xD;
      mechanical testing of the bone samples. These bone samples will be obtained as part of the&#xD;
      routine preparation of the humeral head for implant placement. This bone tissue is normally&#xD;
      removed and discarded as part of the standard of care for preparation of the bone for&#xD;
      placement of the humeral stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing a computer generated pre-operative plan to the post-operative glenoid component&#xD;
      placement, we will be looking at three outcomes. First, we will determine the overall&#xD;
      difference in glenoid component placement between the four treatment groups. Second, we will&#xD;
      compare the placement between the technologies within and among surgeons. Third, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the difference in implant position between technologies based on severity of&#xD;
      pathology. The quality of the humeral head sample will be correlated to the possible&#xD;
      loosening of the implants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical study will enroll patients indicated for standard of care anatomic&#xD;
      total shoulder arthroplasty. Participants will receive all pre-operative testing,&#xD;
      intra-operative care including all implants and post-operative care that is standard of care&#xD;
      and specific to the surgeon's and patient's decisions for care. The only change for Groups 2,&#xD;
      3 and 4 will be the type of surgical instruments used to place the glenoid guide pin,&#xD;
      retention of the humeral head to obtain bone tissue, placement of the beads and&#xD;
      post-operative CT scanning. In all cases the surgeon is able and allowed to use their own&#xD;
      surgical judgment to place the guide pin, prepare the bone and place the desired implant. In&#xD;
      all cases, the surgeon can use any and all of the standard instruments or guides provided by&#xD;
      the implant manufacturer as the surgeon would use if the patient was not enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. If the surgeon chooses not to use the IRI or RTI technology, then this would be noted&#xD;
      as a deviation in plan, the reasons recorded and the patient would be excluded from the study&#xD;
      without post-operative imaging and their pre-operative and intra-operative data would be&#xD;
      analyzed for the purpose of understanding the reasons for failure of the IRI or RTI&#xD;
      technology to provide assistance for refinement of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating surgeons will be Dr. Joseph Iannotti, Dr. Eric Ricchetti and Dr. Peter&#xD;
      Evans. Patients may have surgery at either Cleveland Clinic main campus or at Euclid&#xD;
      Hospital. If the procedure is performed at Euclid Hospital, post-operative CT scan and RSA&#xD;
      (if chosen), will be performed at main campus within 3 weeks after surgery. The patient will&#xD;
      be made aware of this at the time of enrollment and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using manufacturer (RSA biomedical, Umsa Sweden) provided beads and injector gun, four to&#xD;
      five 1 mm tantalum beads will be placed in the coracoid, acromion and glenoid. Exact&#xD;
      placement of these beads is at the discretion of the surgeon. Patient anatomy and operative&#xD;
      exposure will guide the surgeon to the best places to inject the beads; however the surgeon&#xD;
      will not be confined to a specific amount of beads in a specific location. The beads just&#xD;
      need to be spread out amongst the coracoid, acromion, and glenoid to establish reference&#xD;
      points for the RSA imaging. Prior studies looking at shoulder joint kinematics and implant&#xD;
      position have used this methodology of bead placement with successful study related outcomes.&#xD;
      Investigators have successfully placed bone beads in 22 patients currently treated in the&#xD;
      ongoing IRI clinical study without any difficulty or adverse events during or after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients will receive a CT with Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR)and RSA&#xD;
      (if chosen) within 3 weeks of surgery. This will be a CT Scan performed with the patient's&#xD;
      arm by the side in a supine position using metal artifact reduction techniques. In addition&#xD;
      patients will receive a second CT scan and RSA imaging, provided they originally got RSA,&#xD;
      performed 1 year (± 1 month) from surgery. The second CT scan will be performed with MAR&#xD;
      techniques and with the patient in the lateral decubitus position with their arm in the&#xD;
      overhead position, again using metal artifact reduction techniques. The second set of images,&#xD;
      produced with a different body and arm position, also decreases metal artifact than those&#xD;
      obtained with the arm placed by the side. This position cannot be comfortably obtained until&#xD;
      3- 6 months after surgery and require healing of the tissues and rehabilitation of the&#xD;
      shoulder. Investigators have shown that in a small number of patients the glenoid component&#xD;
      can shift in position within the first 3-6 months after surgery making the first CT Scan more&#xD;
      accurate for implant position. The images obtained from the postoperative CT scans are placed&#xD;
      back into the surgical software and the 3D reconstruction of the postoperative scapula with&#xD;
      the implants is compared to the preoperative plan. Using measurement tools within the&#xD;
      software, developed at the Cleveland Clinic, investigators will compare the position of the&#xD;
      actual glenoid component placed in the patient with the desired position specified by the&#xD;
      plan. The use and validation of these imaging methods to precisely measure implant position&#xD;
      has been performed at the Cleveland Clinic in a prior IRB approved clinical trial (IRB&#xD;
      10-582).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, the high resolution quantitative CT will measure volumetric bone mineral&#xD;
      density and the trabecular network of the glenoid. When available, this will be applied to&#xD;
      the preoperative CT for those patients at Cleveland Clinic, Main Campus. Patients who have&#xD;
      their preoperative CT completed at non Main Campus facilities will have the standard of care&#xD;
      preoperative CT. This will be done at the same visit for the standard of care preoperative&#xD;
      CT. Micro CT imaging, which creates a 3D reconstruction of the fine bone structure, in&#xD;
      addition to microarchitecture analysis and mechanical testing, will allow assessment of the&#xD;
      bone tissue taken from the bone core sample. Between the preoperative imaging and the bone&#xD;
      tissue analysis, investigators will have data to properly determine the quality of the bone&#xD;
      stock surrounding the implant. Further correlating these data with RSA and 3D CT imaging of&#xD;
      implant movement, investigators can fully develop cause and effect of bone quality on glenoid&#xD;
      component loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Statistics and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to have 20 subjects in each of the 4 treatment groups for a total of 80 subjects.&#xD;
      To control for subject withdrawal for various reasons after enrollment, we will enroll up to&#xD;
      120 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average deviations from plan for the 4 treatment groups will be compared using mixed-effects&#xD;
      ANOVA methods. Random effects will be included to account for correlation between&#xD;
      observations introduced as a consequence of multiple observations of deviation being taken on&#xD;
      a particular surgeon. If significant differences are found, multiple comparisons based on the&#xD;
      ANOVA model will be made to compare each pair of groups, and will use Holm's step-down&#xD;
      procedure to control the family-wise error rate of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be done by Colin O'Rourke of Quantitative Health Sciences at Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic using R software (version 3.0.0, Vienna, Austria). A significance level of 5% will be&#xD;
      used for all testing.&#xD;

    <description>Accuracy of glenoid component placement based on severity of glenoid morphology. Each shoulder was classified according to a modified Walch classification. The Walch classification of glenoid morphology is the most commonly used system describing glenohumeral pathology in primary osteoarthritis. Glenoids were classified as asymmetric moderate-to severe posterior glenoid bone loss (Walch type-C or moderate to-severe type-B2 and B3 glenoids), without bone loss (Walch type-A1 glenoid), posterior bone loss requiring &lt;10 degrees of correction (Walch type-B1 or mild type-B2 and B3 glenoids), or symmetric glenoid bone loss (Walch type-A2 glenoid).</description>

        <description>Accuracy of glenoid component placement based on severity of glenoid morphology. Each shoulder was classified according to a modified Walch classification. The Walch classification of glenoid morphology is the most commonly used system describing glenohumeral pathology in primary osteoarthritis. Glenoids were classified as asymmetric moderate-to severe posterior glenoid bone loss (Walch type-C or moderate to-severe type-B2 and B3 glenoids), without bone loss (Walch type-A1 glenoid), posterior bone loss requiring &lt;10 degrees of correction (Walch type-B1 or mild type-B2 and B3 glenoids), or symmetric glenoid bone loss (Walch type-A2 glenoid).</description>
