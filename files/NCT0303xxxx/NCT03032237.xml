  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Undernutrition risk among community-dwelling older adults in developed countries&#xD;
      is shown to be around 24%. Increasing protein intake is a strategy that is feasible as well&#xD;
      as efficacious to reduce undernutrition in community-dwelling older adults. A promising&#xD;
      strategy to increase protein intake among older adults, is to offer dietary solutions with&#xD;
      normal foods that fit their current daily eating patterns. For this reason, home-delivered&#xD;
      protein-rich readymade meals and protein-rich dairy products will be studied in this&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to study the effectiveness of commercially available&#xD;
      protein-rich readymade meals and protein-rich dairy products in increasing protein intake of&#xD;
      older adults who use a meal-delivery service to a level of 1.2 g/kg bodyweight/d. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include: studying effects of these meals and dairy products on total daily energy&#xD;
      intake. Further, studying the acceptance of and compliance to the meals and dairy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be performed as a single-blind randomized, controlled, four-week&#xD;
      trial in a real-life setting: in community-dwelling older adults' own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The target group of this study are community-dwelling older adults who use&#xD;
      a meal-delivery service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Both groups will receive readymade meals for each day during 4 weeks. They will&#xD;
      also receive dairy products to freely consume during the intervention period. The&#xD;
      intervention groups receives protein-rich meals and protein-rich dairy products, the control&#xD;
      receives standard meals and food products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Difference in daily protein intake between intervention and&#xD;
      control group. Secondary parameters: energy intake and acceptance (liking).&#xD;
