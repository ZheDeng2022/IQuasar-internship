  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of liver-localised radioembolization and&#xD;
      nivolumab on liver cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that liver-localized radioembolization will stimulate tumour and/or HBV&#xD;
      specific T cell responses that are associated with favourable patient outcomes and that can&#xD;
      be boosted using nivolumab anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the response rates of Y90 radioembolization in combination with nivolumab in HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate time to response, response duration, time to treatment progression and sites&#xD;
           of progression when RE is combined with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess progression free survival and overall survival when RE is combined with&#xD;
           nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the quality of life using the FACT-HEP score and EORTC QLQ-C30&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of RE and nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the relationship between tumor biopsy PD-L1 expression and response to&#xD;
           treatment with Y90 radioembolization in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess relationship between blood lymphocyte (e.g., T cell) activation and phenotypic&#xD;
           profiles with response to treatment with Y90 radioembolization in combination with&#xD;
           nivolumab, using mass cytometry and fluorescence flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess relationship between HCC tumour mutational burden and response to treatment&#xD;
           with Y90 radioembolization in combination with nivolumab using whole-exome sequencing of&#xD;
           tumour biopsy samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Where possible, to evaluate antigen-specific T cell responses to known HBV, HCC tumour&#xD;
           (including candidate mutation-derived tumour neo-antigens) and other unrelated antigens&#xD;
           (e.g. CMV, EBV, Influenza) in the blood and to assess kinetic changes in these responses&#xD;
           associated with response to treatment with Y90 radioembolization in combination with&#xD;
           nivolumab using mass cytometry and fluorescence flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of study drug The first dose of nivolumab will be administered 21 days (+/- 3&#xD;
      days) after completion of RE. [The dose of Yttrium-90 will be determined as per institution&#xD;
      norm by the Nuclear Medicine physician, based on factors such as the subject's Body Surface&#xD;
      Area (BSA), the size of the tumour within the liver, and any dose modifications required for&#xD;
      percent lung shunting between 10 - 20% on the Tc-99MMA scan].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose given will be intravenous 240mg absolute over 30 minutes. Subsequent doses of&#xD;
      nivolumab will be administered in the outpatient setting at NCCS. After the first dose,&#xD;
      intravenous nivolumab 240mg will be given every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A US or CT guided liver biopsy will be conducted by an interventional radiologist on C1D8&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for the following at EVERY visit: physical examination, ECOG&#xD;
      status, vital signs, Child-Pugh score and ALBI score CT or MRI scans to assess response to&#xD;
      treatment will be done before cycle 4, 8, 12 and then after every 12 weeks thereafter (±7&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACT-HEP and EORTC QLQ C30 version 3.0 questionnaire at cycle 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit will be done 2-3 months after last dose. Survival updates will be obtained by&#xD;
      phone every 3-4 months after the follow-up visit and any new anti-cancer treatment given to&#xD;
      the subject will be recorded.&#xD;

             pregnancy test within 3 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication,&#xD;
             and must agree to adequate contraception use from time of signing the informed consent&#xD;

             after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients are excluded if they are receiving any other investigational agents or using&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with any active autoimmune disease or history of known or suspected&#xD;
             autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy within the past 2 years, except for&#xD;
             subjects with vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy or euthyroid patients with a&#xD;
             history of Grave's disease (subjects with suspected autoimmune thyroid disorders must&#xD;
             be negative for thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid&#xD;
             stimulating immunoglobulin prior to randomization). Replacement therapy (e.g. with&#xD;
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or&#xD;
             pituitary insufficiency etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers are excluded from this study because of the&#xD;
             potential risks to the foetus or baby. Women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency, including HIV/AIDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation&#xD;

             non-melanomatous skin cancers, in situ cervical cancers, localized prostate cancer or&#xD;
             in situ breast cancer) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least&#xD;
             3 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to&#xD;
             be required&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Prior radiation therapy to the liver or upper abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Inability to undergo Y-90 radioembolisation due to inability to cathterise the hepatic&#xD;
             artery, portal vein thrombosis/occlusion limiting the ability to perform selective&#xD;
             infusion, Tc-99M MAA scan showing unfavourable shunt fraction between the liver and&#xD;
             pulmonary parenchyma, any other contraindications to RE as determined by the&#xD;
             interventional radiologist (e.g. other anatomic variants precluding safe&#xD;
             administration of Y90, severe peripheral vascular disease, uncorrectable coagulopathy&#xD;
             etc)&#xD;
