  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about biomarker changes in patients who&#xD;
      have primary prostate cancer after receiving Darzalex (daratumumab) and then have a&#xD;
      prostatectomy (the surgical removal of the prostate) as part of their standard care.&#xD;
      Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by&#xD;
      vein over about 1 hour 1 time a week during Weeks 1- 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 4 doses of daratumumab. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the Week 18 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab treatment will interfere with blood type testing which is needed before blood&#xD;
      transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your blood type will be&#xD;
      performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood type card with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 1 and 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 2 and 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for blood type testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 6 (the week of your surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including measurements of&#xD;
           your PSA and testosterone levels. Part of this sample will also be used for blood type&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have surgery to remove your prostate. You will sign a separate consent form&#xD;
           explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 12, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including&#xD;
      measurements of your PSA and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 18, you will come to the clinic and asked about any side effects and how you are&#xD;
      doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat multiple myeloma (MM). It is considered investigational to use daratumumab in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             Cancer Center. Patients with small cell, neuroendocrine, or transitional cell&#xD;
             carcinomas are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the purpose of and procedures required for the study and is willing to participate in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
