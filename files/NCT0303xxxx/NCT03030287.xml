  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug,&#xD;
      OMP-305B83, when given in combination with paclitaxel. OMP-305B83 is a humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody and was developed to target cancer stem cells. Based on preclinical studies, it is&#xD;
      believed that OMP-305B83 may block the growth of cancer stem cells and may also impair the&#xD;
      productive growth of new blood vessels, which tumors need to grow and spread.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study of OMP-305B83 plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OMP-305B83 in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal&#xD;
      or fallopian tube cancer. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a&#xD;
      post-treatment follow up period in which patients will be followed for survival for&#xD;
      approximately 12 months. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and&#xD;
      an expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 5 study centers in&#xD;
      the United States (U.S)..&#xD;
