    <description>Neurologic examination evaluated all cranial nerves except I (smell), IX (taste) and XI (shoulder shrug). Motor examination included evaluation of muscle tone, bulk and movement. Sensory examination included test of temperature and superficial pain (homologous dermatomes using cold tuning fork, neurological examination pin) and deep pain by pressure on achilles tendon. Reflex evaluation included biceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and achilles tendons. Evaluation for persistence of developmental reflexes including Moro reflex, palmar and planter grasp, and tonic neck response was evaluated. Autonomic nervous system evaluation included examination of pupillary reaction, heart rate changes in response to activity, and inquiring about abnormal sweating. Abnormality was determined by the assessor.</description>

    <time_frame>Follow-up Visit 2 (At the age of 26 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic examination evaluated all cranial nerves except I (smell), IX (taste) and XI (shoulder shrug). Motor examination included evaluation of muscle tone, bulk and movement. Sensory examination included test of temperature and superficial pain (homologous dermatomes using cold tuning fork, neurological examination pin) and deep pain by pressure on achilles tendon. Reflex evaluation included biceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and achilles tendons. Evaluation for persistence of developmental reflexes including Moro reflex, palmar and planter grasp, and tonic neck response was evaluated. Autonomic nervous system evaluation included examination of pupillary reaction, heart rate changes in response to activity, and inquiring about abnormal sweating. Abnormality was determined by the assessor.</description>

    <measure>Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS) Total Score at Month 8 of Participant's Age</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8 Months of participants' age</time_frame>
    <description>BINS: a validated instrument designed specifically for a high-risk infant population. It consisted of 11-13 items for different age levels (11 items for participants aged from 3-4 months, 11-15 months, 16-20 months; 13 items for participants aged from 5-6 months, 7-10 months, 21-24 months) to assess cognitive, social, language, gross, and fine motor skills. Each item was scored on a range 0 = non-optimal performance to 1 = optimal performance; BINS total score was sum of scores of each item and it ranged for 11 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 11 (optimum performance) and for 13 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 13 (optimum performance), higher score indicated better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>At 8 Months of participants' age</time_frame>
    <description>REEL-3, was designed to identify infants and toddlers who had language impairments or who had other disabilities that affect language development. Caregiver answered interview questionnaire by pediatrician, pediatric neurologist or clinical psychologist for receptive language and expressive language subtests. Each of these 2 sub tests had 66 questions with answer of 'yes = 1' or 'no = 0'. Sum of receptive and expressive language subtests answers was used to calculate REEL-3 language ability total score, with following ranges: &lt;70 (very poor), 70-79 (poor), 80-89 (below average), 90-110 (average), 111-120 (above average), 121-130 (superior), and &gt;130 (very superior).

      <recruitment_details>Infants to be enrolled were exposed potentially to tanezumab, placebo or comparator via maternal exposure at conception or in-utero during tanezumab clinical program, in any of the following studies: A4091056 (NCT02697773), A4091057 (NCT02709486), A4091058 (NCT02528188), A4091059 (NCT02528253), A4091061 (NCT02609828) or A4091063 (NCT02725411). Total 4 eligible infants were enrolled. Out of 4, 2 had tanezumab exposure, 2 had comparator (tramadol) exposure and none had placebo exposure.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Protocol defined visits for vital signs were at age of 0-2, 8 and 15 months. Additional visits to collect vital signs, were defined in 3 month intervals for the first 2 years and then 6 month intervals up till as needed. Neurological examination was planned at age of 0-2, 8 and 15 months. Developmental assessments (BINS, REEL-3) were planned at age of 8 and 15 months. As judged by the investigator neurological examination and developmental assessments could be conducted up to an age 36 months.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Neurologic examination evaluated all cranial nerves except I (smell), IX (taste) and XI (shoulder shrug). Motor examination included evaluation of muscle tone, bulk and movement. Sensory examination included test of temperature and superficial pain (homologous dermatomes using cold tuning fork, neurological examination pin) and deep pain by pressure on achilles tendon. Reflex evaluation included biceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and achilles tendons. Evaluation for persistence of developmental reflexes including Moro reflex, palmar and planter grasp, and tonic neck response was evaluated. Autonomic nervous system evaluation included examination of pupillary reaction, heart rate changes in response to activity, and inquiring about abnormal sweating. Abnormality was determined by the assessor.</description>

Each item was scored on a range 0 = non-optimal performance to 1 = optimal performance; BINS total score was sum of scores of each item and it ranged for 11 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 11 (optimum performance) and for 13 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 13 (optimum performance), higher score indicated better performance.</description>

        <title>Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS) Total Score at Month 15 of Participant's Age</title>
        <description>BINS: a validated instrument designed specifically for a high-risk infant population. It consisted of 11-13 items for different age levels (11 items for participants aged from 3-4 months, 11-15 months, 16-20 months; 13 items for participants aged from 5-6 months, 7-10 months, 21-24 months) to assess cognitive, social, language, gross, and fine motor skills. Each item was scored on a range 0 = non-optimal performance to 1 = optimal performance; BINS total score was sum of scores of each item and it ranged for 11 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 11 (optimum performance) and for 13 items from 0 (non-optimal performance) to 13 (optimum performance), higher score indicated better performance.</description>

        <description>REEL-3, was designed to identify infants and toddlers who had language impairments or who had other disabilities that affect language development. Caregiver answered interview questionnaire by pediatrician, pediatric neurologist or clinical psychologist for receptive language and expressive language subtests. Each of these 2 sub tests had 66 questions with answer of 'yes = 1' or 'no = 0'. Sum of receptive and expressive language subtests answers was used to calculate REEL-3 language ability total score, with following ranges: &lt;70 (very poor), 70-79 (poor), 80-89 (below average), 90-110 (average), 111-120 (above average), 121-130 (superior), and &gt;130 (very superior).

          <description>REEL-3, was designed to identify infants and toddlers who had language impairments or who had other disabilities that affect language development. Caregiver answered interview questionnaire by pediatrician, pediatric neurologist or clinical psychologist for receptive language and expressive language subtests. Each of these 2 sub tests had 66 questions with answer of 'yes = 1' or 'no = 0'. Sum of receptive and expressive language subtests answers was used to calculate REEL-3 language ability total score, with following ranges: &lt;70 (very poor), 70-79 (poor), 80-89 (below average), 90-110 (average), 111-120 (above average), 121-130 (superior), and &gt;130 (very superior).
