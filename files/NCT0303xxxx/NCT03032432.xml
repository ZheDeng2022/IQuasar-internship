      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with shoulder pain and MRI-confirmed&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendinosis, will have their pain and function improved when treated with daily&#xD;
      use of a dynamic elastic garment along with a corticosteroid injection, when compared to&#xD;
      those patients who receive a corticosteroid injection alone. To our knowledge this is the&#xD;
      first study to evaluate the use of a dynamic elastic garment on shoulders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Control group, will receive and ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Intervention, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection and scheduled use of a&#xD;
           dynamic elastic garment, by IntelliSkin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: Intervention corticosteroid injection and scheduled use of a Dynamic elastic&#xD;
           garment, by AlignMed Posture Shirt 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 patients will participate and be randomized in this study, both male and female&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 to 89 years of age. Subjects will complete a few forms; SF-36, ASES,&#xD;
      Simple Shoulder test, these will take place at the initial visit and Then again at your 4&#xD;
      week and 6 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center study, investigator initiated. 60 subjects will participate in the&#xD;
      study at Loma Linda University.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common complaint with a reported prevalence of 7-26% in the general&#xD;
      population(1). The most common etiology of shoulder pain in the primary care setting is&#xD;
      rotator cuff disease (2-4), a term which encompasses several separate diagnoses. In an&#xD;
      orthopaedic practice, rotator cuff disease includes tendinosis or tendinitis of the&#xD;
      supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, or teres minor tendons, subacromial impingement&#xD;
      with or without bursitis, bicipital tendinitis, or a partial or complete rotator cuff tear.&#xD;
      This study will specifically include patients with tendinosis or tendinitis of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff, for which we will use the term rotator cuff tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are myriad treatment options for rotator cuff tendinopathy; from conservative measures&#xD;
      such as NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, and physiotherapy to more invasive measures&#xD;
      including arthroscopic decompression for subacromial impingement syndrome. While most&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons will employ some combination of physiotherapy, NSAIDs, and&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections for pain relief, the evidence supporting their efficacy in&#xD;
      providing long-term pain relief and functional improvement is limited. Thus, there is&#xD;
      clinical equipoise that exists when treating rotator cuff tendinopathy has led physicians to&#xD;
      pursue other less traditional modalities. Some of these that have gained notoriety are&#xD;
      hyperthermia, extracorporeal shock-wave treatment, electrotherapy modalities and more&#xD;
      recently, non-elastic taping and elastic kinesiology taping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic elastic garments are relatively new products which are being used to improve posture&#xD;
      and provide shoulder and lumbar support. Abnormal scapular motion, particularly scapular&#xD;
      protraction, has been shown to reduce the subacromial width and place undue strain on the&#xD;
      rotator cuff. These garments utilize elastic bands placed in specific locations to provide&#xD;
      postural support and proprioceptive feedback to the patient. This may help to restore normal&#xD;
      shoulder kinematics and subsequently provide relief of shoulder symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MRI-confirmed tendinosis or tendinopathy of the rotator cuff will have improved&#xD;
      shoulder pain relief and outcome scores when treated with scheduled use of a dynamic- elastic&#xD;
      garment and a corticosteroid injection compared to those patients who receive a&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection alone.&#xD;
