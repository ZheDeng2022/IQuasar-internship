    <textblock>
      Specific and objective guidelines for choosing endobronchial tube size for main-stem&#xD;
      intubation in pediatric patients are lacking. The objective criteria for choosing an ETT size&#xD;
      for OLV are likely to increase the safety and success. The primary aims of this study were to&#xD;
      define the relationship between cricoid and mainstem bronchi (right and left) in children of&#xD;
      various ages and to determine the effects of age, height and weight.&#xD;

      Understanding the relationship between cricoid and mainstem bronchi can provide to be a&#xD;
      useful adjunct for lung isolation in children. The relationship between cricoid dimensions&#xD;
      and the dimensions of main-stem bronchi (right and left) have been studied using 2&#xD;
      dimensional CT images and video-bronchoscopic images. The present study defines the&#xD;
      volume-based relationship between the right main-stem bronchus (RMSB), left main-stem&#xD;
      bronchus (LMSB) and the cricoid ring based on 3 dimensional CT derived images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The three dimensional CT images of 35 children, younger than 8 years, undergoing&#xD;
      radiological evaluation unrelated to airway symptomatology were examined. The children were&#xD;
      evaluated during spontaneous ventilation without airway devices either during natural sleep&#xD;
      or with sedation. The 3-dimensional images of the airway column were evaluated at the level&#xD;
      of cricoid, right mainstem bronchus and left main-stem bronchus, volumes were calculated and&#xD;
      comparisons made between these levels. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was&#xD;
      used to determine whether one or more of the variables (age, gender, height, weight and&#xD;
      cricoid) had a predictable relationship to the RMSB and the LMSB diameter.&#xD;
