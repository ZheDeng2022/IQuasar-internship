  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the need to improve outcomes post second autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM) and the benefits seen of maintenance treatment following initial ASCT,&#xD;
      the natural next step is to evaluate maintenance/continuation therapy following second ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is active against MM cells refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide,&#xD;
      making it an ideal choice for continuation therapy following second ASCT. Adding elotuzumab&#xD;
      may increase efficacy and also the durability of responses which is essential to improving&#xD;
      outcomes following second ASCT.&#xD;

    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>-Event-free survival (EFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to disease progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who are removed from study therapy prior to any of these events occurring will be censored at the time of initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 102 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>-Overall response rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of evaluable patients meeting the criteria for partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent complete response (sCR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete response rate (CRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 102 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response rate (CRR) will be defined as the proportion of evaluable patients meeting the criteria complete (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR)&#xD;
Stringent complete response (sCR) requires all of the following:&#xD;
CR as defined below&#xD;
Normal free light chain ratio (0.26-1.65)&#xD;
Absence of clonal cells in the bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence&#xD;
Complete response (CR) requires all of the following:&#xD;
Disappearance of monoclonal protein by both protein electrophoresis and immunofixation studies from the blood and urine&#xD;
If serum and urine monoclonal protein are unmeasurable, Normal free light chain ratio (0.26-1.65)&#xD;
&lt;5% plasma cells in the bone marrow&#xD;
Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytoma&#xD;
Patients who do not meet the definition of CR based solely on residual monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis and/or immunofixation, but are MRD-negative as described above, will also be considered CR.</description>

    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>-Event-free survival (EFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to disease progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who are removed from study therapy prior to any of these events occurring will be censored at the time of initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>-Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from ASCT to disease progression or relapse. Any patient who expires or withdraws prior to disease progression or relapse will be censored at last follow-up. Patients who are removed from study therapy prior to progression or relapse will be censored at the time of initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>-Overall survival (OS) will be defined as time from ASCT to death due to any causes. Patients who are alive at the time of data analyses will be censored on the last known alive date. Patients who are removed from study therapy prior death will be censored at the time of initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment.</description>
