      1. Summary of Clinical Investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of the clinical investigation is provided below and includes the primary objective&#xD;
      of the study, the safety and feasibility endpoints, the number of subjects to be enrolled,&#xD;
      the study duration, the subject follow-up and the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the&#xD;
           alfapump® System indication for use in the management of fluid in NYHA Class III and&#xD;
           ambulatory NYHA Class IV heart failure patients who have an eGFR of &gt; 15 to &lt; 60&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary Safety Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
                The primary safety endpoint will be an assessment of the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
                events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Surgical implant of the alfapump®&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Device malfunctions&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Dialysate infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary Safety Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
                The secondary endpoint will be an assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Time to first hospitalization related to fluid management after the activation&#xD;
                     of the alfapump® System and initiation of dialysate infusion has occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Rate of occurrence of re-hospitalizations related to fluid management&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessment of Feasibility for Fluid Management in Heart Failure Indication The&#xD;
                feasibility of the alfapump® System for management of fluid in NYHA Class III and&#xD;
                ambulatory NYHA Class IV heart failure patients with renal dysfunction will be&#xD;
                assessed by the net fluid balance as measured by the ability of the alfapump®&#xD;
                System to move more fluid to the bladder than dialysate instilled.&#xD;
