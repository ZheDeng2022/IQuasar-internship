  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is one of the most commonly performed outpatient procedure for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of lower gastrointestinal tract disorders. It has been largely accepted as an&#xD;
      effective tool for colorectal cancer(CRC) screening, given its ability to detect and remove&#xD;
      identified polyps. Increased colonoscopy utilization is associated with the observed decline&#xD;
      in the incidence of CRC and its diagnosis at earlier stages. Diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      colonoscopy can successfully be performed using moderate sedation in the ambulatory setting.&#xD;
      Techniques of sedation must guarantee the comfort and safety of patients, and at the same&#xD;
      time allow a rapid turnover of patients.. An anaesthetic agent with rapid onset and offset of&#xD;
      action, and convenient titration of anaesthetic/analgesic depth as well as rapid recovery to&#xD;
      enable discharge from the endoscopy unit as soon as possible would be ideal as most such&#xD;
      procedures are performed in the Non-Operating Room Anaesthesia(NORA) settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is recent interest in the use of Remifentanil, in endoscopic units as it might have&#xD;
      advantages over other drugs because of its profound analgesic effects, rapid onset and offset&#xD;
      time and rapid titration to the individual patient's requirements and intermittent pain&#xD;
      during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized study is to test the hypothesis that a colonoscopy of good quality&#xD;
      in terms of pain relief, patient comfort and discharge times with less cardiorespiratory side&#xD;
      effects can be performed using Remifentanil as a sole agent as compared with the standard&#xD;
      midazolam/fentanyl protocol. The second group combining Remifentanil with Midazolam is taken&#xD;
      to evaluate if there is any advantage of adding an anxiolytic amnesic drug as used in the&#xD;
      standard Midazolam/Fentanyl Protocol.&#xD;

      A Prospective Randomized Comparative Study to Evaluate the Use of Remifentanil as a Sole&#xD;
      Agent or in Combination with Midazolam Versus Fentanyl/Midazolam during Sedation for&#xD;
      Colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audits of patient experiences and studies on quality improvement for colonoscopy have shown&#xD;
      that increased sedation administration results in long-lasting improvement of colonoscopy&#xD;
      quality indicators. However deep sedation in NORA ambulatory settings has been associated&#xD;
      with increased sedation associated risks and raises costs for healthcare providers. Sedation&#xD;
      may delay discharge of patients or cause discharge of patients with early cognitive&#xD;
      impairment that contraindicate complex activities of daily living, The search is still on for&#xD;
      an ideal drug that produces optimal operating conditions with minimum postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is an ultrashort, very potent narcotic, which is eliminated by plasma and tissue&#xD;
      esterases. There is recent interest in the use of Remifentanil in endoscopic units as it&#xD;
      might have advantages over other drugs because of its profound analgesic effects, rapid onset&#xD;
      and offset time and rapid titration to the individual patient's requirements and intermittent&#xD;
      pain during colonoscopy. There are a few studies which suggest that the&#xD;
      analgosedation(intense pain relief without loss of consciousness) achievable with&#xD;
      remifentanil is a valid alternative to the present sedo-analgesia techniques used for&#xD;
      colonoscopic sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ackcaboy ZN conducted a prospective randomized trial to test the hypothesis that continuous&#xD;
      infusion of low dose remifentanil (0.05mcg/kg/min) continuous and bolus injection - in&#xD;
      combination with 2 mg of midazolam, can provide effective analgesia, sedation, amnesia,&#xD;
      patient comfort and stable recovery profile without respiratory depression when compared with&#xD;
      Propofol infusion during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Moerman's hypothesis: &quot;If pain is the crucial point, why do we need sedation?&quot;, the&#xD;
      use of remifentanil as a sole agent for colonoscopy, has been investigated and compared with&#xD;
      the sedative scheme of midazolam plus pethidine. Remifentanil was found to provide sufficient&#xD;
      pain relief with better hemodynamic stability, less respiratory depression, and significantly&#xD;
      faster recovery and hospital discharge than moderate sedation with midazolam and pethidine.&#xD;
      Midazolam-Fentanyl and Midazolam-Remifentanyl techniques has been compared for Endoscopic&#xD;
      Retrograde Cholangio- Pancreatography another painful endoscopic procedure and there were&#xD;
      definite advantages seen in the midazolam-remifentanil group in level of sedation and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. However, remifentanil use is not widespread and is being used only by&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is scope to conduct further studies to ascertain if there is an actual real benefit of&#xD;
      using remifentanil as a sole agent or in combination with midazolam, over the standard&#xD;
      technique of midazolam/fentanyl used in endoscopy units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Controlled Randomized Clinical Study is planned to evaluate whether Remifentanil by&#xD;
      itself as a sole agent or in combination with Midazolam provides a safe and effective&#xD;
      sedation for colonoscopy as compared to the present technique of midazolam and fentanyl being&#xD;
      used by most endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Statement of the problem Colonoscopy is a proven method for bowel cancer screening and is&#xD;
      often experienced as a painful procedure. They are the most frequently performed endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures. However motivating patients to participate in colonoscopy screening continues to&#xD;
      be a challenge as it is associated with considerable anxiety and pain. Additionally patients&#xD;
      complain of disruption of normal activities by bowel preparations and hangover effects from&#xD;
      sedation and need for an escort after procedure. The sedation protocol are followed by the&#xD;
      endoscopists' themselves with a nurse who is monitoring the case. Rescue from extreme&#xD;
      sedation or agitation is not uncommon. Ideal sedation should be potent and easily titrated ,&#xD;
      be adequate and safe for the painful procedure yet have a quick recovery for an early&#xD;
      discharge as these procedures are usually done in an ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanyl is a relatively new drug which has been used in endoscopic suites with some&#xD;
      advantage. There is scope to conduct further studies to ascertain if there is an actual real&#xD;
      benefit of using remifentanil as a sole agent or in combination with midazolam, over the&#xD;
      standard technique of midazolam/fentanyl..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is one of the most commonly performed outpatient procedure for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of lower gastrointestinal tract disorders, usually performed under moderate&#xD;
      sedation in the ambulatory setting. As pain and vasovagal reactions are common during the&#xD;
      procedure, administration of sedation and analgesia is imperative. Techniques of sedation&#xD;
      must guarantee the comfort and safety of patients, and at the same time allow a rapid&#xD;
      turnover of patients. An anaesthetic agent with rapid onset and offset of action, and&#xD;
      convenient titration of anaesthetic/analgesic depth as well as rapid recovery to enable&#xD;
      discharge from the endoscopy unit as soon as possible would be ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is recent interest in the use of Remifentanil in endoscopic units as it might have&#xD;
      advantages over other drugs because of its profound analgesic effects, rapid onset and offset&#xD;
      time and rapid titration to the individual patient's requirements and intermittent pain&#xD;
      during colonoscopy. Remifentanil was found to provide sufficient pain relief with better&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability, less respiratory depression, and significantly faster recovery and&#xD;
      hospital discharge than moderate sedation in a few preliminary studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to study whether Remifentanil by itself as a sole agent or in combination&#xD;
      with Midazolam provides a safe and effective sedation for colonoscopy as compared to the&#xD;
      present technique of midazolam and fentanyl being used by the endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether remifentanyl as a sole agent was effective and safe for Colonoscopies, or if&#xD;
           combined with midazolam offered any advantages over the only remifentanyl or standard&#xD;
           midazolam fentanyl technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness will be judged by the number of patients who complained of pain during&#xD;
           procedure, number of patients who became uncooperative during the technique and had to&#xD;
           be given Propofol to convert it into a general anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety will be judged by any significant haemodynamic or respiratory changes and changes&#xD;
           in sedation level in the various study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advantages in reduced recovery time will be noted from the time to full recovery after&#xD;
           sedation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and Endoscopist's satisfaction score will be recorded to see any differences in&#xD;
           the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an Ethics Committee approval, 90 patients who are undergoing colonoscopy under&#xD;
      moderate sedation in an ambulatory setting at Awali Hospital will be included in the study&#xD;
      who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Informed Consent will be taken preoperatively&#xD;
      and they will be randomly allocated in to three groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - Patients will receive Midazolam and Fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Patients will receive Midazolam and Remifentanil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - Patients will receive Remifentanil as a sole agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 90 patients will be selected for the study randomly dividing them into the three&#xD;
      groups of 30 each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique: All patients due for colonoscopy under moderate sedation who satisfy the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agree to be part of the study group by an informed&#xD;
      consent will be randomly divided into the three groups of 30 each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by making identical folded slips of the three groups and by&#xD;
      randomly picking up a slip preoperatively on the morning of procedure for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe of the study. The study will be done prospectively once approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and registered as a Prospective Clinical Trial in the Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection methods, instruments used and measurements: Describe the instruments to be&#xD;
      used for data collection (questionnaire, observation recording form, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing elective colonoscopy who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the 3 groups after taking an informed consent. All colonoscopies will be&#xD;
      performed by two Endoscopists of Awali Hospital who seem to work in a very similar manner for&#xD;
      colonic endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the endoscopy room an IV access will be established. Supplemental oxygen 3&#xD;
      L/min will be given through both the nostrils and mouth by a specially designed mask which&#xD;
      can monitor the end tidal CO2 level. The basal values of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP),&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and end-tidal CO2&#xD;
      level (ETCO2) will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two minutes before the colonoscopy procedure, a bolus of midazolam 0.03mg/Kg and&#xD;
      1.5microgram/Kg fentanyl will be given intravenously over 60 sec in group 1. 0.5 mg of&#xD;
      midazolam intravenously can be given every two minutes till the patient is sufficiently&#xD;
      sedated (sleeping but arousable on calling). The colonoscopy can start at this end point.&#xD;
      Increments of 0.5mcg/Kg of fentanyl will be given if patient complains of pain, which can be&#xD;
      repeated every 5 minutes if there is persistent pain. The patient in group 2 Target&#xD;
      controlled infusion of Remifentanil to 3.0 ng/ml will be started 2 minutes before procedure.&#xD;
      The patient will then be given same doses of midazolam in 0.5 mg increments till sedated&#xD;
      sufficiently (sleeping but arousable on verbal command). During Colonoscopy the dose of&#xD;
      Remifentanil could be increased by 0.5ng/ml if patient complained of pain upto 4.0ng/ml. The&#xD;
      group 3 patient will receive only Remifentanil in the same doses as given in group 2. During&#xD;
      the procedure if the pain is excessive and persistent in spite of increasing the respective&#xD;
      doses as prescribed in each group, or causing loss of cooperation of patient and interfering&#xD;
      in the performance of procedure, the patients will be given sleep dose of Inj Propofol and&#xD;
      further anaesthesia care as required will be provided for same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haemodynamic Parameters(NIBP,HR), RR, SPO2, Sedation Scare (Ramsay) and ETCO2 will be&#xD;
      measured 1 and 3 min after the drug dose then every 5 min till end of procedure. After&#xD;
      procedure the patients will be shifted to recovery and the same parameters will continue to&#xD;
      be measured every 5 min until discharge from the 30 min stay in the recovery room. Pain&#xD;
      Scoring will be done by a Visual Analog Pain Score (VAS) (0- minimum to 100mm- Maximum pain)&#xD;
      just after passing the scope, during the scope, just after the completion of colonoscopy and&#xD;
      at the discharge from the recovery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total amount of drug consumed, duration of colonoscopy, incidence of adverse effects&#xD;
      (desaturation &lt;94% on Pulseoximetry, Hypoventilation (RR&lt;8/min or apneic episode, hypotension&#xD;
      (SBP&lt;90mm Hg), nausea vomiting or pruritis will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be noted at the time of discharge from ward&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The Recovery Time The patient will be considered recovered if and when they achieve an&#xD;
      Aldrete score of 10. Aldrete scoring will be done every 5 minutes after completing&#xD;
      colonoscopy up to 30 min or till achievement of a 10/10 Aldrete Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldrete score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiration: Able to take deep breath and cough = 2, Dyspnea/shallow breathing = 1,&#xD;
           Apnea = 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O2 saturation: Maintains &gt; 92% on room air =2, Needs O2 inhalation to maintain O2&#xD;
           saturation &gt; 90% =1 , O2 saturation &lt; 90% even with supplemental oxygen =0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consciousness: Fully awake= 2, Arousable on calling = 1, Not responding = 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulation: BP +/- 20 mm Hg preop =2, BP +/- 20-50 mm Hg preop =1, BP +/- 50 mm Hg&#xD;
           preop =0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity: Able to move 4 extremities = 2, Able to move 2 extremities = 1, Able to move 0&#xD;
           extremities 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants Assumed to Feel Frequent Pain, during and after colonoscopy. • Patients&#xD;
           sound &quot;Ah&quot; at feeling pain during colonoscopy would be taken as a measure: if a patients&#xD;
           sounds &quot;Ah&quot; &gt; 6 times, the patient was assumed to feel frequent pain. Will be scored as&#xD;
           0 no pain ,1if he complains of pain or 2 if he says Ah or complains of pain frequently,&#xD;
           that is, more than 6 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's Distress Score every 5 min till the end of colonoscopy. Patients' distress as&#xD;
           minimal, mild moderate or severe distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients in each group who had to receive propofol due to loss of cooperation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopist Satisfaction. Time Frame: 5 min after the colonoscopy. Endoscopist's&#xD;
           satisfaction after colonoscopy in visual analogue scale 100 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of Patient's Recall. Tested after colonoscopy before discharge from the&#xD;
           hospital. The numbers of patients who recalled instructions and explanations given&#xD;
           during colonoscopy will be noted and if there was any unpleasantness related to the&#xD;
           recall or awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction. Will be tested on a numerical scale from 0 (not satisfied at all)&#xD;
           to 10 (fully satisfied) at the time of discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side Effects noted in each group for example excessive sedation, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
           pruritis, respiratory depression or apnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be statistically analyzed, to arrive at a conclusion on whether remifentanyl as&#xD;
      a sole agent was effective for Colonoscopies, or if combined with midazolam offered any&#xD;
      advantages over the only remifentanyl or standard midazolam fentanyl technique.&#xD;
