      The purpose of this study is to adopt an operational research approach that seeks to design,&#xD;
      develop and pilot-test the health-promotion lifestyle model that will enhance&#xD;
      health-promoting behaviour and lifestyle modification of university staff in Nigeria. The&#xD;
      following are the hypotheses of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be a significant difference in the pre and post intervention practices of&#xD;
           health promoting lifestyle behaviours (behaviour specific cognition and affect) of NOUN&#xD;
           staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be significant association between the health promoting lifestyle behaviours&#xD;
           (behavioural outcome) and health status of NOUN staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be a significant difference in the pre-and post-intervention health promoting&#xD;
           lifestyle behaviours (behavioural outcome) of staff of NOUN&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be a significant difference in the pre-and post-intervention health status&#xD;
           measure (specific health measurement indicators) of staff of NOUN&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Health promotion is advocated worldwide as being an efficient strategy to enhance quality of&#xD;
      life and control the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases. health promoting&#xD;
      lifestyle has been linked to high prevalence of most non-communicable diseases. Efficient and&#xD;
      effective health promoting lifestyle practices is beneficial in prevention and control of&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases, as well as improving the quality of life. World Health&#xD;
      Organization has established workplace and schools as priority settings for health promotion&#xD;
      in the 21st century as locus of reaching large number of audience. Workplace and schools also&#xD;
      offer an ideal settings and infrastructure to support the health promoting activities that&#xD;
      will improve the quality of life of workers and students. Information and communication&#xD;
      technologies (ICTs) has made the world a global village, both young and old engages in one&#xD;
      form of ICTs or the other. This study aims to adopt operational research approach to design,&#xD;
      develop and pilot-test Integrated Technology-Moderated Institutional Health Promotion Model&#xD;
      (ITIHPM) that will enhance health promoting behaviour and lifestyle modification of staff in&#xD;
      Nigeria universities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the health-promoting behaviour of NOUN staff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the health status of NOUN staff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine factors that influence the health promoting lifestyle behaviour of NOUN&#xD;
           staff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess institutional policies available to encourage NOUN staff to practise health&#xD;
           -promoting lifestyles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess resources available in the institution that encourage health-promoting&#xD;
           behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine protocols in place to ensure adoption of health-promoting behaviour and&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle of NOUN staff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine technology-moderated applications/platforms that would be useful in&#xD;
           promoting knowledge and skills acquisition for health-promoting behaviour and lifestyle&#xD;
           modifications among NOUN staff; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To determine the impact of a technologically-based institutional health promotion model&#xD;
           among NOUN staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can participate? All staff that are on the university pay roll in the selected study&#xD;
      centres, irrespective of their age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does the study involve? Two study centres will be randomly selected from the six study&#xD;
      centers selected during the first phase of the study. The two centres are randomly allocated&#xD;
      into two groups two (experimental group and control group). The control group will receive&#xD;
      tips on health promoting lifestyle practices, answer health promoting lifestyle profile&#xD;
      questionnaire before giving the tips, have their weight, height, blood pressure, fasting&#xD;
      blood sugar, abdominal circumference and hip circumference checked. The group will further&#xD;
      answer the questionnaire and have their weight, height, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar,&#xD;
      abdominal circumference and hip circumference checked at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. While the&#xD;
      experimental group will have four weeks training (educational package) on nutrition,&#xD;
      exercise/physical activity, stress management, health responsibility, self-actualization and&#xD;
      interpersonal relationship through seminar and symposium for 45-60 minutes 4 times in a week&#xD;
      for the 4 weeks. At the beginning of the training database of all the participants will be&#xD;
      created. This will include socio-demographic data and baseline health assessment that is&#xD;
      related to the study (weight, height, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, abdominal&#xD;
      circumference and hip circumference). Participants will also answer questionnaire on health&#xD;
      promoting lifestyle practice at the beginning of the training. The same procedure will be&#xD;
      taken at week zero (immediately after the training), at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. In the last&#xD;
      two sections of the meeting, participants will be informed and intimate on the use of the&#xD;
      software package and encourage them to ask questions. The participants will receive audio and&#xD;
      video messages on health promoting lifestyle practices once in a week. The software&#xD;
      application will be designed in a way that both the principal investigator and participants&#xD;
      can interact at any time. The Technology-Moderated Institutional Health Promotion Model will&#xD;
      also give opportunity to university staff to have assessed to a Community Health Nurse&#xD;
      Specialist (health promotion expert) at every needed time. Four sessions of Focus Group&#xD;
      Discussions among cohorts of staff will be conducted to identify barriers to healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle practices using the developed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Health promoting lifestyle practices of staff will be measured using health promoting&#xD;
           lifestyle profile II at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effective and efficient Health promoting lifestyle practices of staff will be measured&#xD;
           using health promoting lifestyle profile II and mobile software application at zero&#xD;
           week, 6 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health status of staff will be measured using the following indicators: weight, height,&#xD;
           blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, abdominal circumference and hip circumference at&#xD;
           the beginning of the study, at zero week, 6 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Resources available in the university that will enhance health promoting lifestyle&#xD;
           practices will be measured using interview guide and checklists at the beginning of the&#xD;
           study Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Participants compliance to the intervention will be measured at 6 weeks and 12 weeks 2.&#xD;
      Participants satisfaction with the intervention will be measured at 6 weeks and 12 weeks 3.&#xD;
      Retention rate will be measured at 6 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target number of participants in the pilot-testing phase is 185 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? We hope that the study will afford&#xD;
      the participants the benefits of practicing health promoting lifestyle effectively and&#xD;
      thereby help him/her to prevent non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In case the participant has&#xD;
      been diagnosed with any NCDs, participating in this study will provide the individual with&#xD;
      relevant information that will make him/her live a quality life. During the study if the&#xD;
      health assessment reveals any deviation from normal, the individual will be referred to the&#xD;
      school sickbay for appropriate treatment and the principal researcher will still follow the&#xD;
      him/her up. The only risk anticipated in this study is that its demands the participants to&#xD;
      be meticulous in adhering to all the health promotion activities, which are beneficial on the&#xD;
      long to the participants.&#xD;
