      The primary objective of this multicenter observational study is to determine the effect size&#xD;
      of the relationship between DCI and neuropsychological impairment 14-28 days and 3 months&#xD;
      after aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the feasibility to administer and the validity of the MoCA in an&#xD;
      intensive care unit setting, as well as the test/retest reliability of the MoCA in patients&#xD;
      with acute brain damage in absence of aSAH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the independent most important predictor of neurological&#xD;
      disability in survivors following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). DCI could also&#xD;
      be identified as the most important predictor of moderate to severe neuropsychological&#xD;
      impairment following aSAH. Only few prospective studies so far specifically analyzed the&#xD;
      effect size of the relationship between DCI and neuropsychological impairment, and all&#xD;
      studies had a methodological weakness: lack of a baseline neuropsychological assessment&#xD;
      before the onset of DCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies analyzing the neuropsychological outcome after aSAH, the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA) is the most comprehensive, sensitive and specific instrument among the&#xD;
      short tests. The MoCA is increasingly used in the aSAH population, while its validity and&#xD;
      reliability has only been demonstrated in the normal population or patients suffering from&#xD;
      diseases different from aSAH, such as e.g. Parkinson's disease or dementia. Today,&#xD;
      neuropsychological examinations find entry into clinical routine for aSAH patients to&#xD;
      estimate the need for inpatient rehabilitation. However, the MoCA is often applied to aSAH&#xD;
      patients in a busy intensive or intermediate care unit, while it remains largely unknown&#xD;
      whether the distraction in such an environment represents a bias to the obtained results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore evaluates aSAH patients before and after the phase of DCI, as well as&#xD;
      three months after aSAH, in order to estimate the impact of DCI on neuropsychological&#xD;
      impairment. In addition, the extent and location of cerebral ischemia, as measured with the&#xD;
      Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is correlated with the neuropsychological&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study measures the test/retest reliability of the MoCA, as well as the&#xD;
      influence of the intensive care environment on the MoCA results in a randomized fashion in&#xD;
      subjects with acute brain damage (and no aSAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this multicenter observational study is to determine the effect size&#xD;
      of the relationship between DCI and neuropsychological impairment 14-28 days and 3 months&#xD;
      after aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the feasibility to administer and the validity of the MoCA in an&#xD;
      intensive care unit setting, as well as the test/retest reliability of the MoCA in patients&#xD;
      with acute brain damage in absence of aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with or without DCI that show worsening on&#xD;
      the MoCA 3 months after the ictus as compared to before the DCI phase by at least two points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoints for part 1 of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients with or without DCI that show worsening on the MoCA 14-28&#xD;
           days after the ictus as compared to before the DCI phase by at least two points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absolute difference of the MoCA before and after the active phase of DCI in patients&#xD;
           with versus without DCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absolute difference of the MoCA before the active phase of DCI and 3 months after&#xD;
           aSAH in patients with versus without DCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of patients with versus without DCI that show cognitive impairment at 14-28&#xD;
           days and 3 months (defined as MoCA &lt; 26 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The correlation of neuropsychological outcome with the extent and location of ischemic&#xD;
           lesions on brain CT-scan 12-21 days post-SAH, graded by the semi-quantitative&#xD;
           ASPECT-grading&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life at 3 months in patients with versus without DCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home-time at 3 months in patients with versus without DCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death and dependency at 3 months in patients with versus without DCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absolute MoCA result, health-related quality of life and home-time at 3 months in&#xD;
           patients with versus without hydrocephalus requiring shunting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absolute MoCA result, health-related quality of life and home-time at 3 months in&#xD;
           patients with surgical versus endovascular aneurysm occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoints for part 2 of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test/retest reliability of the MoCA in patients with acute brain damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The influence of the intensive care environment on the MoCA in patients with acute brain&#xD;
           damage&#xD;
