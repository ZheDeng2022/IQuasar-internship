      This is a two-arm, open-label, phase II study of in adult patients who have successfully&#xD;
      undergone R0/R1 resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and completion of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Within 1-3 months of treatment completion, patients will be enrolled&#xD;

      Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) patients who have successfully underwent R0/R1&#xD;
      resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 1-3 months after the completion&#xD;
      of planned adjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two arms&#xD;
      (56 per arm). Patients in Arm A will be given anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for a maximum of 26 doses if there is no radiographic evidence of disease recurrence.&#xD;
      Patients in Arm B will be observed. Blood draws for immune monitoring and serum banking will&#xD;
      be collected at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A - before Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7 and End of Treatment (EOT) visit; Arm B - before Cycles 1,&#xD;
      4, 7, and End of Treatment (EOT) visit&#xD;
