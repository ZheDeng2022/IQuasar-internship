  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility trial studies how well the Optune device works in treating younger patients&#xD;
      with recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma. The&#xD;
      TTFields generated by Optune device may inhibit the growth of tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I To establish the feasibility of treatment with the Optune device in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II To describe the Optune device treatment-related toxicities in children with&#xD;
      recurrent/refractory/progressive supratentorial malignant glioma and ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I To estimate the response rate and Event-Free Survival (EFS) as markers of anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of the Optune device within the context of a feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II To assess the association of anti-tumor activity with compliance in Optune device use&#xD;
      within the context of a small feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III To explore the impact of the Optune device on the children and families undergoing this&#xD;
      therapy, and to explore the association between demographic (e.g., SES, gender), disease&#xD;
      (e.g., risk status), treatment, and behavioral variables with health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV To explore the association of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values within the tumor&#xD;
      and correlate with response to Optune treatment and EFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optune will be worn for a minimum of 18 hours a day, with a recommendation of 22&#xD;
      hours/day for at least 23 days in a 28-day cycle. Cycle 1 includes 7 days training period,&#xD;
      followed by 28 days treatment (total 35 days). The patients will receive multiple 28-day&#xD;
      cycles of continuous Optune treatment. In the absence of treatment related serious adverse&#xD;
      events or disease progression, Optune will continue up to 26 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up for 30 days after the last application of the Optune device.&#xD;
