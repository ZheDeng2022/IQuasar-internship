    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to investigate whether a gluten free diet after the onset&#xD;
      of type 1 diabetes (T1D) can better preserve the remaining beta cell mass and at the same&#xD;
      time prevent the development of Celiac Disease (CD) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To study whether gluten free diet during one year after the onset of diabetes influence the&#xD;
      appearance and duration of clinical remission in children with Type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New data show that a gluten free diet is beneficial concerning the insulin production after&#xD;
      the onset of diabetes. The investigators want to investigate if gluten is a triggering&#xD;
      protein for the destruction of the beta cell function after the onset of diabetes by&#xD;
      comparing children who have a normal diet compared to children with a gluten free diet during&#xD;
      one year after the onset of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study whether a gluten free diet during one year after the onset of diabetes prevent&#xD;
           the development of Celiac Disease in these children and the impact of having two&#xD;
           diseases It is known that it is almost 10 times more common that children with Type 1&#xD;
           Diabetes (IDDM) develop Celiac Disease (CD) than the general population and that most of&#xD;
           these children (6-7 %) develop CD after the onset of Diabetes and within 5 years. Based&#xD;
           on our new data that CD is preventable to some extent the investigators plan to perform&#xD;
           randomized controlled studies if it is possible to prevent or postpone CD by means after&#xD;
           the onset of IDDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the impact of gluten free diet on the regulation of autoimmune responses&#xD;
           The investigators will test the hypothesis that gluten free diet in children with recent&#xD;
           onset T1D will implement immune regulation and inhibit the activation of potentially&#xD;
           autoreactive T cells.&#xD;

      General project outline Our aim is to perform a intervention study whether one year gluten&#xD;
      free diet in children with newly diagnosed TID would make it possible to influence the speed&#xD;
      of the beta-cells destruction and if this diet decrease the risk to develop CD after the&#xD;
      disease A power calculation shows that we would need 600 participants to detect clinically&#xD;
      relevant effects (see power calculation). As the power calculation is based on estimated&#xD;
      effects we plan to first perform a pilot study including 100 patients. Based on the results&#xD;
      of the pilot study we then plan to continue to design a larger study to get more robust&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will also at the start study and, after 1 and 2 years receive a KID-screen form&#xD;
      to study the quality of life of time in children with diabetes and to compare children with&#xD;
      diabetes without CD and to them who will develop or have undiagnosed CD. Furthermore all&#xD;
      children will also be monitored by a dietician during the study period, at onset, after 1 and&#xD;
      2 years according to the content (protein, fat, carbohydrate, gluten and vitamins) during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Consecutive patients with recent onset of diabetes at Swedish paediatric clinics&#xD;
      are given information about the study and they and their parents are asked to participate in&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent given by patients and guardians/parents and inclusion criteria are; 1. Type&#xD;
      1 diabetes according to the ADA classification with &lt; 1 months diabetes duration at time of&#xD;
      screening 2. Age 3.00 -17.99 years at time of screening 3. Fasting C-peptide at time of&#xD;
      screening ≥ 0.12 nmol/L Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the provisions of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deemed by the investigator not being able to follow instructions and/or follow the study&#xD;
           protocol Recruitment and Screening Eligible subjects and their parent(s) / guardian(s)&#xD;
           will have the study explained to them, and will receive a written patient information.&#xD;
           If, after this, the subjects agree to participate, they will personally sign and date&#xD;
           the written informed consent form. In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the&#xD;
           investigator must explain to the patient that they have the right to withdraw from the&#xD;
           study at any time, and that this will in no way prejudice their future treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size, power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning the study as a continuous response from independent control and experimental&#xD;
      subjects with 1 control per experimental subject. In a similar study the response within each&#xD;
      subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 0,19. If the true difference&#xD;
      in the experimental and control means is 0,05 we will need to study 250 subjects and 250&#xD;
      controls to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the&#xD;
      experimental and control group are equal with a probability (power) 0,8. The Type 1 error&#xD;
      probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0,05. Recalculation of&#xD;
      sample size is needed on a pilot study, which we have chosen to 100 subjects, 50 in each&#xD;
      group. This field also benefit from that smaller and shorter trials are conducted to obtain&#xD;
      initial sense of efficacy prior to undertake a fully powered study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk to develop CD in the children with gluten free diet will be compared to the 8000&#xD;
      children in the BDD who had been followed yearly with transglutaminse autoantibodies for CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The trial is designed as a 2-arm not randomized, open, multicentre study&#xD;
      comparing 1 year of gluten free diet with normal diet. In the pilot study 100 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited at 7 sites in Sweden (and if the pilot study shows expected results we will&#xD;
      include all 43 Swedish pediatric clinics and altogether an estimated 600 patients). The&#xD;
      patients will not be randomized into two parallel groups as it could influence the compliance&#xD;
      to a normal diet. Instead we will recruit group A (50 patients) during the first year and&#xD;
      group B with 50 age and sex-matched patients during the second year. Group A will eat gluten&#xD;
      free diet for a year after the onset of diabetes and B normal diet. Both groups will follow&#xD;
      the same procedures according to the study visits and clinical routines in our diabetes care&#xD;
      and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Patients who qualify for the study have to have a C-peptide over above 0.12&#xD;
      nmol/L and will be assigned with a number and this screening number together with the&#xD;
      clinics, site number, will be used as patient identification. The patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility at the screening visit (Visit 1) prior to the start of treatment with&#xD;
      glutenfree diet and screened with a MMTT (mixed meal tolerance test) and fasting C-peptide&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for a total study period of 60 months which includes not more&#xD;
      than 6 extra visits for the study (however these visits may be combined with regular diabetes&#xD;
      care visits though all children with diabetes use to attend outpatient clinic at least every&#xD;
      3 month and more often at the onset of the disease) Visit 1; 2 month within the onset, MMT&#xD;
      and fasting C-peptide Visit 2; If eligible, randomized to group A (the first 50), contact&#xD;
      with a dietitian, information of GFD, within 3 month from onset Visit 3; at 6 months; fasting&#xD;
      C-peptide, immunological analyses and contact with a dietician; questionnaire and a registry&#xD;
      (before the visit one week registry of the diet intake) Visit 4; at 12 months; MMTT fasting&#xD;
      C-peptide, HbA1c, immunological analyses. HbA1c, immunological analyses for research, contact&#xD;
      with a dietician; questionnaire and a registry (before the visit one week registry of the&#xD;
      diet intake) Visit 5; at 18 months, MMTT fasting C-peptide, HbA1c, immunological analyses.&#xD;
      HbA1c, immunological analyses, including Ttg (transglutaminse) Visit 6; at 24 months, MMTT&#xD;
      fasting C-peptide, HbA1c, immunological analyses. HbA1c, immunological analyses, including&#xD;
      Ttg (transglutaminse) yearly until 60 months. Questionnaire about quality of life and gluten&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both group A and B will have same information and visits according to the diabetes care where&#xD;
      contacts with a dietician is mandatory, but arm A will need special information about a&#xD;
      gluten free diet and will also have x-support according to gluten free products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both group A and B will be followed according to CD risk during 5 years with Ttg annually as&#xD;
      a clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate changes in beta-cell function the patients will undergo an MMTT&#xD;
           (measuring C-peptide, 90 minute value and AUCmean 0-120 min) at basile baseline (Visit&#xD;
           1) to 12 and 18 months). Our research nurse will perform this test on all patients&#xD;
           included at the different sites and the samples are analyzed at the Clinical Chemistry&#xD;
           at SUS, Malmö.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also investigate and compare the proportion of patients with a stimulated&#xD;
           maximum C-peptide level above 0.2 nmol/L after 12 and 18 months respectively as well as&#xD;
           fasting C-peptide, change between baseline and month 6, 12 and 18 months between the&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences between metabolic control, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), change between baseline&#xD;
           and subsequent visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, marker of metabolic control)) as marker for long term&#xD;
           hyperglycemia will be analyzed at baseline and subsequent visits in both groups. We will&#xD;
           also study if there are differences in exogenous insulin dose per kg body weight and 24&#xD;
           hours, change between baseline and subsequent visits as indirect marker of beta cell&#xD;
           insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2 To follow the development of gluten-induced humoral autoimmunity, IgA&#xD;
      anti-tissue-transglutaminase autoantibodies (Ttg) will be determined in blood samples&#xD;
      collected at the onset, before insulin therapy,, and yearly up to five year after the onset&#xD;
      of TID. Ttg autoantibodies will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Aim 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To investigate the immunoregulatory effect of gluten-free diet we will perform a detailed&#xD;
      analysis of the magnitude and the phenotype of both gliadin- and tTG-specific T cells.&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis of antigen-specific T cells will be performed using multicolor flow&#xD;
      cytometry and cytokine secretion Gender and ethnicity All our data will respect to gender and&#xD;
      ethnicity is evaluated if there are any predictive factors associated: Diabetes is the&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, which is more common in boys than girl, and the reason for this is&#xD;
      unknown and Celiac Disease is more common in girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations In spite of a very heavy, intensive, expensive treatment many patients&#xD;
      with TID get life-threatening serious both acute and late complications. At diagnosis many&#xD;
      patients have some slight residual insulin secretion. As long as this is the case it is much&#xD;
      easier to keep blood glucose stable, the incidence of hypoglycaemia decreases as well as the&#xD;
      risk of keto-acidosis. A trial with a gluten free diet is not very complicated and it is safe&#xD;
      but may be a burden for the children and families involved. Gluten free special products are&#xD;
      often more expensive, few products and are often considered not so tasty but when summarizing&#xD;
      the pros and cons, there is a clear possibility of therapeutic benefit of great importance&#xD;
      with no risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical implications Toward an individualized treatment: To find predictive a factors&#xD;
      determining the remission period is important for people who develop diabetes. Every month in&#xD;
      remission increase the quality of life, increase metabol control and thereby postpone late&#xD;
      complications. To find triggering factors for to rate of beta-cells destruction unable us to&#xD;
      design a more individualized treatment in respective individual. Increased remission period&#xD;
      and decreased risk of developing Celiac Disease. Gluten free diet is a safe administer, well&#xD;
      tolerable for the patients and the main long-term goal is to find a treatment at onset of&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes in young patients which is easy and safe and preserve residual insulin&#xD;
      secretion and give the patients a better quality of life, with less acute complications and&#xD;
      in the long run less risk of late complications. The identification of exogenous factors&#xD;
      triggering and driving beta-cell destruction offers a potential means for intervention aimed&#xD;
      at the prevention of T1D. Environmental modification is likely to offer the most powerful&#xD;
      strategy for effective prevention of T1D, because such an approach can target the whole&#xD;
      population or at least that proportion of the population carrying increased genetic disease&#xD;
      susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet is a cornerstone in the diabetes treatment and individuals with diabetes must always be&#xD;
      much aware of the carbohydrate content in the food which limits the arena of different&#xD;
      beverages and make life more complicated and if the individual has both IDDM and CD this is&#xD;
      even more complicated and limit the social and quality of life. If this study could prevent&#xD;
      some individuals to develop CD it would increase their life quality extensively.&#xD;
