      The purpose of this study is to investigate opportunities for prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (OA) by evaluating potentially modifiable risk factors for disease and&#xD;
      poor pain and physical function outcomes especially among those with early or mild knee&#xD;
      symptoms. The goal of the study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early&#xD;
      stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.&#xD;

      MOST study participants in the &quot;Existing Cohort&quot; (3,026 subjects) were enrolled in the&#xD;
      original study in 2003-2005. Surviving Existing Cohort participants without end-stage knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis will be asked to participate in the 144-, 152-, 160- and 168-month follow-up&#xD;
      contacts. In addition, in 2016-2018 the cohort will be enriched by the recruitment of an&#xD;
      additional 1,500 &quot;New Cohort&quot; participants with early or mild knee symptoms. The goal of the&#xD;
      study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early stage.&#xD;
