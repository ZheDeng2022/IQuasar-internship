  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a common disease, which involves significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The clinical presentation of APE has many faces but it is acceptable to suspect&#xD;
      this disease when the patient presenting with at least one of the following: shortness of&#xD;
      breath, pleuritic chest pain, cough, sub-febrile fever or hemoptysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between syncope and APE is not entirely clear. Prandoni et al conducted a&#xD;
      systematic process for the exclusion / confirmation of APE all patients hospitalized for a&#xD;
      first investigation of syncope. In this study APE was diagnosed in about 17% of the patients.&#xD;
      In 12.7% of patients with an alternative explanation for syncope APE was diagnosed.&#xD;
      Interestingly, 25% of the patients had no other manifestation of pulmonary embolism apart&#xD;
      from the syncope itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the updated clinical guidelines, APE should not be routinely tested as an&#xD;
      etiology for syncope and not systematically excluded. According to the new data presented by&#xD;
      Prandoni et al, this means that a significant percentage of patients hospitalized for an&#xD;
      investigation of syncope are discharged when they are suffering from APE (in most cases&#xD;
      probably an event of unprovoked pulmonary embolism) without treatment with anticoagulants,&#xD;
      making them particularly prone to PE recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To examine the incidence of pulmonary embolism (Pulmonary Embolism, PE), and VTE (venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism, VTE) in patients hospitalized for a first investigation of syncope.&#xD;

      Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, conducted at Rambam Health Care&#xD;
      Campus and Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv and includes all Clalit HMO insured patients who&#xD;
      were admitted for investigation of first event of syncope from 2006 to 2013 (diagnosis on&#xD;
      admission- syncope and collapse (ICD9 code 427.31)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients over 18 years old during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On admission diagnosis of syncope and collapse (ICD9 code 427.31).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are insured by Clalit Health Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization during the study period for additional event of syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving anticoagulation on recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients investigated for APE during hospitalization (by testing for D-dimer,&#xD;
           computerized tomography angiography or perfusion-ventilation lung scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who began treatment anticoagulation, not because of VTE, during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The research is divided into two main stages. At the first phase data of the&#xD;
      relevant study population will be collected from the computerized medical record of the two&#xD;
      medical centers mentioned above and according to the inclusion and exclusions criteria listed&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase we will examine in the study population the occurrence of PE or DVT&#xD;
      within 36 months from hospitalization.&#xD;
