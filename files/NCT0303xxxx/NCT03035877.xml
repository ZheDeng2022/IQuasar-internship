    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to examine the effectiveness of a promising intervention for emerging&#xD;
      adults (EAs) with alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and justice involvement in achieving the&#xD;
      ultimate outcome of reduced criminal activity. The study will also examine that effect on&#xD;
      intermediate outcomes as follows: 1) reduced AOD use; 2) greater gainful activity (increased&#xD;
      educational success, employment and housing stability; decreased antisocial peer involvement&#xD;
      and relationship conflict); 3) and greater improvement in self-regulation (self-efficacy,&#xD;
      goal directedness and responsibility taking). The intervention to be tested is Multisystemic&#xD;
      Therapy-Emerging Adults (MST-EA). MST-EA is an adaptation of MST, a well-established,&#xD;
      effective intervention for antisocial behavior in adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and criminal activity is highest during&#xD;
      emerging adulthood compared to any other developmental period, and causes extraordinary costs&#xD;
      to society. Emerging Adults (EAs; ages 17-26) with AOD abuse have greater incarceration rates&#xD;
      than EAs without AOD abuse, and AOD-abusing offenders have significantly more recidivism,&#xD;
      severe offending, and incarceration than other offenders. Such serious behavior interferes&#xD;
      with successful transition into adulthood in areas such as school completion, employment and&#xD;
      housing. Thus, there is a strong public health need for effective treatment to reduce AOD&#xD;
      abuse and justice involvement in EAs. Surprisingly, there are no interventions with&#xD;
      established efficacy to reduce criminal activity among EAs, with or without AOD abuse. Among&#xD;
      younger adolescents, the comprehensive causes of antisocial behavior are addressed by&#xD;
      effective interventions (e.g., Multisystemic Therapy [MST]; Treatment Foster Care Oregon&#xD;
      [TFCO]), and the present investigative team has developed and evaluated a well-defined&#xD;
      age-tailored intervention for EAs with criminal behavior. The developed intervention is an&#xD;
      adaptation of MST and integrates a skills coaching component from TFCO, both well-established&#xD;
      effective juvenile justice interventions. Initial MST-EA research focused on justice-involved&#xD;
      young adults who had mental health problems, a high-risk subpopulation of offenders, but AOD&#xD;
      abuse quickly became a primary problem the MST-EA team treated. As a single-source&#xD;
      intervention, MST-EA targets the EA correlates of criminal activity and AOD abuse, including&#xD;
      gainful EA activities (positive relationships, school, work, and housing) and reduced AOD&#xD;
      abuse-in part by targeting the proximal mechanism of poor self-regulation. In a successfully&#xD;
      completed community-based open trial, the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      the intervention were established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of MST-EA for reducing justice involvement&#xD;
      and AOD abuse. EAs (n = 240) with AOD abuse and justice involvement (recent arrests or&#xD;
      release from justice facilities) will be randomized to receive MST-EA or Enhanced Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual (E-TAU). Assessments will be completed at months 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16, with&#xD;
      confirmation of outcome data using official records. Aims will be to evaluate the effect over&#xD;
      time of MST-EA for reducing AOD abuse and criminal activity, as well as to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of MST-EA on the key proximal target of treatment (self-regulation) and intermediate&#xD;
      outcomes of treatment (gainful activities). A final aim of the study will be to investigate&#xD;
      if the direct effect of treatment on criminal activity is mediated by its effect on&#xD;
      self-regulation, AOD abuse, and gainful activities. In this specific age group, there is a&#xD;
      complete absence of AOD abuse and recidivism reduction treatments with demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness. The ultimate effect of the proposed research would be decreased AOD abuse and&#xD;
      justice involvement in a high-risk population, as well as improved outcomes that have&#xD;
      significant societal impact (e.g., reduced homelessness and unemployment).&#xD;

    <description>MST-EA is a home- and community-based treatment for emerging adults (ages 17-21) that aims to address antisocial behavior and problems caused by substance use disorders. The model also addresses co-occurring mental health problems when present. Therapists work directly with the young adult and his/her social network. This treatment also involves the use of coaches who help young people develop skills for young adulthood.</description>

    <description>With Enhanced Treatment as Usual (E-TAU), emerging adults will get the treatments that they usually receive when they have a substance use disorder and have been in trouble with the law. In addition, they will receive travel vouchers for attending services, a card with an individualized list of contacts when in crisis, and facilitation with identifying need of services and accessing those services.</description>
