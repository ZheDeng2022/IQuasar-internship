      This is a phase I, open label, single-arm, multi-center, dose-finding study of venetoclax in&#xD;
      combination with DA-EPOCH-R in patients with aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women with aggressive B-Cell Lymphomas which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with intermediate features between DLBCL and Burkitt&#xD;
           Lymphoma (BL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transformed indolent NHL (TiNHL). The aggressive B-cell lymphomas enrolling on this&#xD;
           study have been recognized to have a poor prognosis with the use of conventional&#xD;
           chemoimmunotherapy. DA-EPOCH-R is an alternative highly effective chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
           platform for these lymphomas and may serve as an optimal chemotherapy backbone for the&#xD;
           incorporation of novel agents such as venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bcl-2 protein plays a significant role in the regulation of cell death in malignant&#xD;
      cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins is associated with chemo-resistance of a broad&#xD;
      variety of cancers, and BCL2 abnormalities are common in aggressive B-cell Lymphomas.&#xD;
      Venetoclax is a highly selective Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds to Bcl-2 family&#xD;
      proteins to potentially overcome resistance and enhance responses to therapy. This study has&#xD;
      been designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax in combination&#xD;
      with DA-EPOCH-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive venetoclax in conjunction with six 21-day cycles of DA-EPOCH-R. Dosing&#xD;
      for DA-EPOCH-R will follow established protocols. Venetoclax will be administered on days 3&#xD;
      through 12 during cycle 1 and days 1 through 10 of each subsequent cycle. Following&#xD;
      completion of therapy, subjects will be followed every three months for up to two years.&#xD;
      Subjects removed from study due to toxicity will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of the toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Venetoclax will be given in conjunction with 6 cycles of DA-EPOCH-R (doxorubicin hydrochloride, etoposide, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, prednisone, rituximab). The dosing schedule and regimen for DA-EPOCH-R will follow established protocols. Venetoclax will be administered days 1-10 of each 21-day cycle, with the exception of cycle 1, during which venetoclax dose will commence on day 3 and continue through day 12, so as to clarify attribution of any observed TLS and/or infusion reactions, and minimize tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) risk.</description>

    <description>Rituximab will be administered as an IV infusion at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle of DA-EPOCH-R, immediately prior to the start of chemotherapy. Oral pre-medication 650 mg of acetaminophen and 50-100 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride will be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to starting each infusion of rituximab. The first rituximab infusion should be started at 50 mg/hr, and increased in 50-mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr. If this rate of escalation is well tolerated the second and subsequent infusions can begin at a rate of 100 mg/hr and increase in 100 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.
