  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma rates are high and asthma control is greatly reduced in Black, Medicaid-insured&#xD;
      adults, due in part to their poor adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which in turn&#xD;
      may be due to erroneous health beliefs about asthma and negative beliefs regarding ICS. A&#xD;
      brief shared decision-making intervention for use by primary care providers in Federally&#xD;
      Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) has the potential to be a novel avenue to greatly improve&#xD;
      asthma control in this high-risk patient group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled asthma disproportionally impacts Black and poor adults. Adherence to inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICS), which plays a significant role in asthma control, is relatively low in&#xD;
      poor and minority populations. Non-adherence to ICS is associated with erroneous personal&#xD;
      health beliefs regarding asthma care and with negative beliefs regarding ICS. Despite this,&#xD;
      no intervention concurrently addresses beliefs regarding asthma self-care and ICS. Shared&#xD;
      decision-making interventions have not been tested in underserved Black adults, despite this&#xD;
      model's success in pediatric populations and in White, privately insured patients with&#xD;
      asthma. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) have unique challenges to helping patients&#xD;
      achieve asthma control but are overlooked in asthma intervention research. Process&#xD;
      evaluations are often lacking during intervention development. We will address these&#xD;
      treatment and methodological gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This pilot study will (1) develop a brief shared decision-making intervention&#xD;
      delivered by primary care providers (PCPs) to improve asthma control in Black adults&#xD;
      receiving care in FQHCs; (2) evaluate the intervention's feasibility and acceptability; and&#xD;
      (3) assess preliminary evidence of intervention effects on asthma control, ICS adherence,&#xD;
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) - an objective lung function measure - and&#xD;
      asthma quality of life (QOL) over a 3-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) The intervention will be feasible and acceptable, and (2) over 3 months,&#xD;
      relative to controls, patients whose PCPs are trained in the intervention will have&#xD;
      significant improvement on asthma control (primary outcome), ICS adherence, FEV1 and asthma&#xD;
      QOL (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Using community-based participatory research and including a Patient Advocate, we&#xD;
      will develop the intervention, Brief Evaluation of Asthma Therapy (BREATHE). Intervention&#xD;
      development is guided by patient and family/support persons of asthma patients input, as well&#xD;
      as PCP feedback. We will then conduct a randomized trial of the intervention with 8 PCPs from&#xD;
      2 FQHCs in Philadelphia, PA; for each PCP we will enroll 10 Black adults (N=80) with&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma, and with erroneous asthma care beliefs and negative ICS beliefs. PCPs&#xD;
      will be randomized within FQHC to intervention and control; patients will be followed for 3&#xD;
      months. Process evaluation interviews with patients and PCPs will obtain feedback regarding&#xD;
      intervention procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study has high public health significance because it (1) targets a highly&#xD;
      vulnerable population for poor asthma control - Black poor adults with erroneous asthma care&#xD;
      beliefs and with negative ICS beliefs; (2) adapts a model-based intervention to develop a&#xD;
      novel intervention delivered by PCPs that simultaneously targets erroneous asthma beliefs and&#xD;
      negative ICS beliefs, and which has the potential to amplify intervention effects and&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of sustainability; and (3) includes a process evaluation, bridging&#xD;
      the gap between science and practice, and aiding in the design of a full-scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
