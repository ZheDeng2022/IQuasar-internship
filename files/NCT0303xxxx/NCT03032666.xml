      Thalassemia is characterized by a defect in red blood cell production. The anemia is caused&#xD;
      by destruction of the erythroblasts in the bone marrow, erythrocytes' hemolysis and disrupted&#xD;
      erythropoiesis. The life-long need for transfusions makes patients vulnerable to transfusion&#xD;
      transmitted viral infections especially hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection is a&#xD;
      widespread disease. It affects a large number of thalassemia patients and it is considered a&#xD;
      major public health problem. Infection with HCV results in chronic infection in a huge&#xD;
      proportion of infected individuals. Therefore, it has been suggested that early treatment of&#xD;
      acute HCV may prevent the development of chronic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have dwelled on the efficacy of interferon therapy for acute HCV infection in&#xD;
      adults. Newer pegylated interferons (PEG-IFN) were used in the treatment of adults with acute&#xD;
      HCV which showed equally excellent results. However, in thalassemia patients, iron overload&#xD;
      in the liver negatively affects the outcome of liver disease leading to more severe hepatic&#xD;
      inflammation and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C which decreases response to IFN therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavarin has also been added as a treatment option with IFN, but ribavirin in thalassemia&#xD;
      patients increases transfusion need by a median of 30-40 %, but does not increase major&#xD;
      adverse events or treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new direct-acting&#xD;
      antiviral agent for the treatment of HCV infection: Sofosbuvir (Gilead Sciences). Ledipasvir&#xD;
      (Gilead Sciences) is a new drug with potent activity against HCV genotypes 1a and 1b. The&#xD;
      combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir resulted in high rates of response among patients&#xD;
      with HCV genotype 1 infection who had received prior treatment with interferon-based&#xD;
      regimens. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir have been combined in a single fixed-dose tablet for use&#xD;
      once daily (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using this drug for HCV therapy alone or in combination with IFN for 12 or 24 weeks, resulted&#xD;
      in more than 90% response rates in patients from the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia major are at increased risk of adverse events&#xD;
      with pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for HCV due to a notable 30% increase in&#xD;
      transfusion requirements during the 48-week therapy. Some patients are not eligible for other&#xD;
      treatments as they relapsed or did not respond to previous Ribavarin and IFN regimens.&#xD;
      Treatment naïve thalassemia patients with HCV will be exposed to anemia and&#xD;
      transfusion-induced iron overload among other adverse events associated with Ribavarin and&#xD;
      IFN. These patients in particular, in addition to treatment-naïve thalassemia patients, have&#xD;
      limited alternative treatment options available and constitute an area of significant unmet&#xD;
      clinical needs. There is currently no literature available showing the efficacy of&#xD;
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in the treatment of thalassemia patients with hepatitis C. Therefore,&#xD;
      this trial will study the efficacy of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for hepatitis C genotype 1-6 in&#xD;
      patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients from the Lebanese Chronic Care Center will be enrolled in this open label trial.&#xD;
      Patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia with hepatitis C will be enrolled. Study&#xD;
      patients will receive the treatment following informed consent and will be followed up&#xD;
      regularly by the study coordinator for side effects, compliance and adherence. A blood test&#xD;
      for hemoglobin and hematocrit and liver enzyme, will be done on all patients at baseline and&#xD;
      then after 4 weeks, 8 weeks , and 12 weeks of therapy. At week 12, levels of the virus in the&#xD;
      patient's blood will also be evaluated. Liver imaging will be done throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of this study outweigh potential risks. Side effects of medications used are minor&#xD;
      however potential benefits for the patients are possibly treating their hepatitis C with an&#xD;
      approved drug (in the general population) at no cost, and for the society, the possibility of&#xD;
      finding an oral treatment more efficient and tolerable in this special population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for privacy and confidentiality issues, all data will be under lock. The PI and the Co-&#xD;
      Investigators will be the only ones with access to that data.&#xD;
