    <textblock>
      Prospective, open, single-arm trial of dolutegravir-tenofovir and emtricitabine or lamivudine&#xD;
      (DTG-TDF-FTC or 3TC) in antiretroviral (ART) naïve HIV transgender women (TGW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the retention in care of TGW&#xD;
      treated with DTG-TDF-FTC or 3TC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the antiretroviral regimen at week 48 ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of this regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adherence across 48 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the patient satisfaction with this regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify individual, social and contextual factors associated with adherence and&#xD;
           retention.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the retention in care of TGW&#xD;
      treated with DTG-TDF-FTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be assessed by the proportion of individuals that provide&#xD;
      information on ART use and virological outcomes at the end of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retention under care: Proportion of enrolled and dosed individuals that provide clinical&#xD;
           information up to 48 weeks of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retention on treatment: Proportion of enrolled and dosed individuals that receive study&#xD;
           drugs up to 48 weeks of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the antiretroviral regimen at week 48 ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of this regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adherence across 48 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the patient satisfaction with this regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify individual, social and contextual factors associated with adherence and&#xD;
           retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be evaluated using the following endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment by the IIT-exposed snapshot FDA algorithm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequency, type and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pill count, analogue visual scale for adherence in each visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in the scores of stigma and discrimination scales , quality of life, social&#xD;
           support and anxiety and depression (BERGER, WBI,DUKE,CES-D,STAI) at bsl, 4,24, and 48&#xD;
           weeks e;.Changes in the score scales of sexual behaviors, use of drug /alcohol at bsl&#xD;
           and at each visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Through association of baseline individual, social and contextual characteristics with&#xD;
      percentage of adherence and retention at 48 weeks.&#xD;
