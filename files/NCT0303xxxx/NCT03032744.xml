  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project ASTHMA is a school-based health center intervention program that institutes&#xD;
      guideline-based chronic asthma care and provides supervised administration with daily&#xD;
      preventive asthma medications to improve asthma symptoms and lung function, reduce emergency&#xD;
      visits, and decrease missed days of school among children from communities with health&#xD;
      disparities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project ASTHMA in schools is a 7 month randomized control intervention pilot trial. Forty&#xD;
      students, ages 4 to 14 years, with persistent asthma, or who utilize acute care facilities&#xD;
      frequently for their asthma, will be recruited from 3 urban SBHCs in the fall of 2018. All&#xD;
      students will receive NHLBI guideline-based asthma assessments to determine eligibility and&#xD;
      proper dosing of preventive medication. The asthma assessment will include spirometry&#xD;
      testing. All enrolled students and parents will receive asthma education at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. Eligible students will be randomized to an intervention or usual care group using&#xD;
      permuted block randomization stratified by SBHCs. In collaboration with the student's PCP,&#xD;
      the SBHCs' mid-level providers will prescribe the preventive medication to the students in&#xD;
      the intervention group. These students will receive the morning dose of their preventive&#xD;
      medication from the school nurse each school day for the remainder of the school year.&#xD;
      Students and their parents will be responsible to administer the evening and non-school day&#xD;
      doses. Students randomized to the usual care group will be referred back to their PCP for&#xD;
      further asthma management. All participants will be re-evaluated at 1, 3 and 7 months after&#xD;
      enrollment, and medication dose adjustments will be made in the intervention group as needed.&#xD;
