      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify an SCP process that is patient-centered,&#xD;
      effective in promoting appropriate survivorship care and can be successfully implemented for&#xD;
      patients with different types of cancer who are being treated in a broad range of clinical&#xD;
      settings. There is a need for research related to SCP that prioritizes outcomes that are most&#xD;
      highly valued by patients, caregivers and clinical stakeholders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Each year, approximately 1.6 million people are diagnosed with cancer and the&#xD;
      relative 5-year survival rate across all cancer types approaches 70%. As of 2014, there were&#xD;
      almost 15 million Americans living with a history of cancer. Cancer survivors face a variety&#xD;
      of health care needs, including surveillance for recurrence, treatment for long-term and late&#xD;
      effects of cancer and its treatment, general primary and preventive care, management of any&#xD;
      comorbidities, encouragement of healthy lifestyle behaviors, and attention to psychosocial&#xD;
      issues. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report 'From Cancer Patient to Cancer&#xD;
      Survivor: Lost in Transition' highlighted the challenges that cancer survivors face as they&#xD;
      transition from acute treatment. The completion of acute cancer treatment is a critical&#xD;
      juncture at which patients are in need of better support and communication to ensure optimal&#xD;
      health and quality of life outcomes as they transition to long-term survivorship. Cancer&#xD;
      survivors face substantial deficiencies in the quality of care that they receive, including&#xD;
      both underuse of recommended care and overuse of services that are not recommended for&#xD;
      routine follow-up. The 2005 IOM report called for all patients completing acute treatment to&#xD;
      be provided with a survivorship care plan (SCP) that summarizes treatments received and&#xD;
      outlines future healthcare priorities in order to facilitate effective management of health&#xD;
      care between survivors and their oncology and primary care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES: The primary aim of this trial is to assess whether there is a difference&#xD;
      among three SCP models of varying levels of resource intensity and patients' receipt of&#xD;
      recommended health services in the months following completion of acute treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure whether the&#xD;
      provision of the SCP to the survivor and primary care provider (PCP) is associated with&#xD;
      survivors' receipt of cancer follow-up care as outlined on their SCP (primary outcome).&#xD;
      Avoidance of non-recommended care, receipt of recommended primary and preventive care, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures will serve as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the RCT will have been treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      This RCT will be conducted in four oncology clinics in two medical systems. The investigators&#xD;
      will enroll survivors of Stage I-III breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer who are&#xD;
      completing treatment and transitioning to long-term survivorship, and use a stratified&#xD;
      randomization to assign participants to one of three study conditions (Arms A, B or C). This&#xD;
      study will focus specifically on the period following completion of acute treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
      surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy); patients receiving long-term adjuvant&#xD;
      endocrine/antibody therapies will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial will be conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution (JHMI) and&#xD;
      Peninsula Regional Medical Center (PRMC). JHMI is a large, academic medical center in an&#xD;
      urban setting with distinct treatment programs based on disease site. At JHMI, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit from the Breast Cancer Program, the Genitourinary Cancer Program&#xD;
      (prostate cancer), and Gastrointestinal Cancer Program (colorectal cancer). These programs&#xD;
      operate across disciplines (e.g., medical, radiation, and surgical oncology) but separately&#xD;
      from each other, enabling evaluation of 3 separate clinical settings within JHMI. In&#xD;
      addition, the trial will include the PRMC Richard A. Henson Cancer Institute, a community&#xD;
      cancer program located in the rural area of Maryland's eastern shore. At PRMC there is a&#xD;
      single general oncology practice. The four programs differ in the extent to which&#xD;
      survivorship care planning is already a part of routine care. As yet, none of the clinics in&#xD;
      this study has a consistent format for the delivery of SCP universally at the completion of&#xD;
      acute treatment. The study design (cancer types, clinical systems and SCP models) is intended&#xD;
      to enable the development of real-world best practices for the implementation of SCPs and&#xD;
      assess whether these are consistent or vary across a wide range of clinical contexts and&#xD;
      survivor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be followed for 18 months, with the number of visits dependent on the&#xD;
      randomization arm (described below). The investigators will abstract 18 months of follow-up&#xD;
      data for enrolled patients from medical records, as well as from patient reports of health&#xD;
      service use; data will be collected at months 6, 12, and 18. The investigators will obtain&#xD;
      and abstract medical records guided by the information in the summary document (see Health&#xD;
      Services Use Summary included as a supplemental study document) and from the patient using&#xD;
      provided tracking tools of providers they have seen, tests they have undergone, etc. (see Tip&#xD;
      Sheet in supplemental study documents). Patient-reported outcomes will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months primarily via a REDCap form, with telephone or in-person data&#xD;
      collection as a back-up when needed.&#xD;
