    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 when&#xD;
      given together with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating patient with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). KRT-232 (AMG 232) may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a protein&#xD;
      called MDM2 that is needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide help shrink or slow the growth of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carfilzomib and dexamethasone, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone together may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by NCI CTCAE version 5.0. TEAE is defined as an adverse event that emerges during the treatment period (from first dose date till 30 [+/- 5] days after the last dosing date), having been absent at pre-treatment; or reemerges during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in severity after starting treatment relative to the pre-treatment state, when the adverse event is continuous. The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated by the worst NCI-CTCAE grade, system organ class, and preferred term. Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent severe adverse event (SAE)s will be tabulated, as well as TEAEs/SAEs considered related to treatment.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must show evidence of wild-type (WT) p53 status on somatic tissue specimens&#xD;
             as assessed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing; note that since patients with&#xD;
             relapsed myeloma have a rapidly proliferating disease, patient can be enrolled and&#xD;
             begin treatment prior to obtaining the results of this test; patients who are&#xD;
             discovered to have a TP53 mutation will be removed from study after cycle one and can&#xD;
             continue on carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd); all enrolled patients&#xD;
             will be followed for toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities from prior anti-tumor therapy, defined&#xD;
             as not having resolved to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known central nervous system involvement of myeloma should be excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often&#xD;
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;

             at each clinic visit; any potential drug interactions will be brought and discussed&#xD;
             with the principal investigator; use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic window (such as alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine,&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III and higher),&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral&#xD;
             medication, malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior&#xD;

             positive hepatitis total core antibody with negative HBsAG (suggestive of occult&#xD;
             hepatitis B), or detectable hepatitis C virus RNA by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
             assay (indicative of active hepatitis C - screening is generally done by hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR if HepCAb is positive);&#xD;
             subjects with hepatitis B virus suppressed on therapy, and previously&#xD;
             treated/eradicated hepatitis C virus are eligible for study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT excluded from this study, but HIV-positive&#xD;
             subjects must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;

                  PCR-based test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KRT-232 (AMG 232) is an agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with KRT-232 (AMG 232), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with KRT-232 (AMG 232); these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are lactating/breast feeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study&#xD;
