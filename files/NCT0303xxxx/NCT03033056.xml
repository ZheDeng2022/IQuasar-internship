  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent, costly, and disabling mental illnesses. One&#xD;
      central, yet largely understudied, abnormality in anxiety disorders is the heightened&#xD;
      tendency to display fear and avoidance in reaction to benign or safe events that resemble&#xD;
      feared situations. The current project maps brain circuits associated with this abnormality&#xD;
      in order to contribute to future brain-based diagnosis and treatments for clinical anxiety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to neurally, behaviorally, psychologically, and clinically&#xD;
      characterize fundamental Pavlovian and instrumental dimensions of potential threat through&#xD;
      which emotional and behavioral responses to threat cues generalize to resembling, safe&#xD;
      stimuli. Such generalization is aligned with the potential threat construct due to the threat&#xD;
      ambiguity, or uncertain threat value, inherent in these safe 'generalization' stimuli. The&#xD;
      Pavlovian dimension of interest is generalization of conditioned fear: a fundamental&#xD;
      Pavlovian process through which fear transfers, or generalizes, to safe stimuli resembling a&#xD;
      conditioned threat-cue (CS+). The targeted instrumental dimension is generalized avoidance:&#xD;
      active decisions to withdraw from safe stimuli resembling the CS+ that are motivationally&#xD;
      prompted by Pavlovian generalization. Given lab-based findings have linked heightened&#xD;
      Pavlovian generalization to a variety of traditional anxiety disorders, overgeneralization&#xD;
      represents a promising dimension of potential threat with relevance across traditional&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. One central aspect of this project is testing personality and psychiatric&#xD;
      factors (e.g., trait fear, internalizing, externalizing) that may account for the relevance&#xD;
      of generalization and its neurobiology across traditional anxiety disorders. A second key&#xD;
      aspect, is studying neural processes by which Pavlovian generalization evokes instrumental&#xD;
      generalized avoidance of benign stimuli (resembling danger cues), which, when excessive, is&#xD;
      likely to impair day-to-day functioning in anxiety patients. Unfortunately, human&#xD;
      fear-conditioning experiments in clinical samples, have focused almost exclusively on&#xD;
      passive-emotional, Pavlovian conditioning, to the virtual exclusion of studying&#xD;
      active-behavioral, instrumental avoidance. The current neuroimaging project fills this gap by&#xD;
      applying a novel Pavlovian-instrumental generalization paradigm to neurally and behaviorally&#xD;
      elucidate Pavlovian processes leading to generalized instrumental avoidance. Personality&#xD;
      moderators (e.g., dispositional resilience) of relations between Pavlovian and instrumental&#xD;
      generalization will also be examined. The studied adult samples will display a wide range of&#xD;
      symptom severity across traditional anxiety disorders and will include anxiety-clinic&#xD;
      patients and healthy comparisons (N=159). Central goals of this proposal include: 1)&#xD;
      elucidating the neurobiology of Pavlovian and instrumental generalization and their&#xD;
      interaction, 2) testing relations between neural substrates of Pavlovian and instrumental&#xD;
      generalization and broad psychiatric dysfunction (Aims2-3); and 3) assessing the degree to&#xD;
      which relations between these dimensions of generalization and broad dysfunction are driven&#xD;
      by psychometrically validated personality traits relevant across traditional anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. This third and final goal is critical to the project, because individual&#xD;
      difference measures capturing empirically-validated psychological constructs will likely&#xD;
      track relations between fundamental conditioning processes (e.g., generalization) and general&#xD;
      dysfunction, better than traditional, polythetic, diagnostic entities, that, by and large, do&#xD;
      not reflect any single coherent psychological process.&#xD;
