  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve the chance of cure for people with higher risk Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma. The purpose of the Phase I study is to test any good and bad effects of the study&#xD;
      drug called Nivolumab when combined with ABVD for the front-line treatment of HL.The purpose&#xD;
      of this Phase II study is to test whether including nivolumab in treatment for untreated&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma can improve the chance of cure for patients with abnormal PET scans after 2&#xD;
      cycles of ABVD.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase II portion of cohort A will enroll patients with untreated stage III or IV Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma. All patients will begin with 2 cycles of ABVD as standard of care treatment. A PET&#xD;
      scan will be performed after 2 cycles of ABVD. Enrollment at MSK may occur at any point&#xD;
      during the first two cycles of ABVD treatment. Enrollment at non-MSK locations will occur&#xD;
      after the PET scan is performed. MSK patients with a PET-negative response (defined by&#xD;
      Deauville 1, 2 or 3) will proceed with 4 additional cycles of ABVD or AVD (per treating&#xD;
      physician preference) on-study. Non-MSK patients with a PET-negative response are not&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients with a PET-positive response (Deauville 4 or 5) will&#xD;
      proceed with 4 cycles of AVD plus nivolumab on-study. Non-MSK patients must have a&#xD;
      PET-positive response to enroll on this study&#xD;

    <description>For this objective, the standard 3+3 scheme will be used. Initially, 3 patients will enroll onto dose level 1. If no patients experience DLT, enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. If 1 DLT is observed, 3 additional patients will enroll onto dose level 1. If 1 or fewer patients out of 6 experience DLT, enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed at a given dose level, the previous dose will be declared the MTD. Adverse events will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening, corresponding to Grades 1 - 4, will be used.</description>

    <description>The study will employ a 3+3 design and include 3 treatment cohorts. In each cohort, patients will receive 6 cycles of A(B)VD and 8 doses of nivolumab. In dose level 1, patients will receive nivolumab in combination with AVD during cycle 6 only followed by 6 additional doses of nivolumab. In subsequent dose levels, nivolumab will be combined with increasing numbers of cycles of AVD. Based upon safety data from another study with Nivolumab, we will no longer need to evaluate dose level 2. If we determine that dose level 1 is safe, the next group of patients will enroll onto dose level 3. A PET scan will be performed after 2 cycles of ABVD and those with a PET-negative response (defined by Deauville 1, 2 or 3) will proceed with 4 additional cycles of ABVD or AVD (per treating physician preference).</description>

    <description>The study will employ a 3+3 design and include 3 treatment cohorts. In each cohort, patients will receive 6 cycles of AVD and 12 doses of nivolumab. In this cohort, patients will receive nivolumab in combination with AVD during cycles 5 and 6 only, followed by 8 additional doses of nivolumab. In subsequent cohorts, nivolumab will be combined with increasing numbers of cycles of AVD. Based upon safety data from another study with Nivolumab, we will no longer need to evaluate dose level 2. If we determine that dose level 1 is safe, the next group of patients will enroll onto dose level 3. Prophylactic growth factor support is mandatory for all patients on Cohort B and should be used per the treating physician's discretion for all other patients.</description>
