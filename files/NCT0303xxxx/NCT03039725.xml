      Retrospective study to assess a single Clinic on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&#xD;

      and pneumococcal disease&#xD;

      Vaccines are known as one of the greatest public health achievements of the twentieth&#xD;
      century. Due to the successful implementation of childhood immunization programs in the&#xD;
      United States (US), once common disease states such as polio, smallpox, and measles are no&#xD;
      longer a natural part of childhood. Unfortunately, these successes have not been replicated&#xD;
      in the adult population despite the availability of vaccines and published recommendations&#xD;
      guiding appropriate screening for and administration of vaccines. On average, 42,000 adults&#xD;
      compared to 300 children die in the US of vaccine-preventable infections every year. In fact,&#xD;
      results of the National Health Interview Survey from 2012 demonstrated low immunization rates&#xD;
      for adults 19 years of age and older leaving a significant portion of eligible patients&#xD;
      susceptible to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine administration rates are often lower in the obstetric population likely due to fear&#xD;
      of administration during pregnancy and lack of recommendations and education to patients&#xD;
      about vaccines. The influenza and Tdap vaccines are recommended for every pregnant patient.&#xD;
      However, in 2015-16 influenza season only 49.9% of pregnant patients received the influenza&#xD;
      vaccine. Additionally, only 30-53.% have receive the Tdap vaccine. Besides these needed&#xD;
      vaccines, patients are often indicated for additional vaccines including hepatitis A,&#xD;
      hepatitis B, pneumococcal-23, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, patients who have&#xD;
      unequivocal or negative rubella titers during pregnancy should receive the measles, mumps,&#xD;
      and rubella vaccine when post-partum. Because of the lack of vaccination, the American&#xD;
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended that vaccines become part&#xD;
      of the routine obstetric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to American Society of Healthcare Pharmacists (ASHP) Guidelines on the pharmacist's&#xD;
      role in immunizations, all pharmacists can contribute to the effort by promoting proper&#xD;
      immunizations in various ways. One way is by helping to identify patients in need of&#xD;
      immunizations by gathering immunization histories, identifying patient specific indication,&#xD;
      issuing immunization records to patients, and educating patients on their specific&#xD;
      indications, and the risk of the immunizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's team includes a maternal fetal medicine specialist, nurse practitioners,&#xD;
      clinical pharmacist, social workers, and registered nurses. The pharmacist meets with all&#xD;
      patients to perform medication reconciliation, vaccine history, social history, allergy&#xD;
      history, disease specific review of systems, pregnancy related review of systems, and&#xD;
      preventative health review; assess medical and preventative health problems; recommend&#xD;
      appropriate management of medical problems and preventative health; and provide extensive&#xD;
      education including information on all indicated vaccines. The indicated vaccines are&#xD;
      recommended to either the physician or nurse practitioner provider for that visit as well as&#xD;
      documented in the medical record. Additionally, prior to each office visit, the pharmacist&#xD;
      reviews each patient's chart to determine what vaccines are indicated for this visit. This&#xD;
      list of indicated vaccines is provided to the nurse who asks the patients about receiving the&#xD;
      vaccine at that day's visit. If the patient is willing to receive the vaccine, the nurse has&#xD;
      the provider order the indicated vaccines. All the vaccines are kept as floor stock in the&#xD;
      clinic to minimize wait time for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been recent efforts to increase immunization rates throughout the health&#xD;
      care system, there is little evidence about the impact of pharmacists' involvement on&#xD;
      immunization rates in outpatient obstetric clinic setting. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate immunization administration compliance with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&#xD;
      2016 immunization recommendations for influenza, pneumococcal 23 polyvalent, hepatitis A,&#xD;
      hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV),&#xD;
      and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR).&#xD;
