  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to better understand the mechanisms underlying alcohol use and dependence in&#xD;
      order to advance the clinical treatment of alcohol dependence. Here, the investigators will&#xD;
      use Positron Emission Tomography to determine if there is an up-regulation of D3 receptors in&#xD;
      the brains of subjects with alcohol use disorders. The investigators will also investigate&#xD;
      the relationship between D3 binding and major phenotypes associated with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders, namely: alcohol cue induced craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in&#xD;
      the laboratory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence is a devastating illness with social and medical costs estimated to be 180&#xD;
      billion dollars annually in the US. In the clinical treatment of alcoholism, reducing alcohol&#xD;
      consumption in heavy drinkers is a major clinical challenge. As such, there has been much&#xD;
      emphasis in both clinical and preclinical research to identify the substrates that mediate&#xD;
      craving, excessive drinking and addiction. Identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence may lead to the development of new and better treatment strategies.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies indicate that the D3 receptor is involved in alcohol-cue response and in&#xD;
      the motivation to drink alcohol. However, there is currently no data available in human&#xD;
      subjects exploring the relationship between D3 and those behavioral responses in subjects&#xD;
      with alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: To measure the [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET binding levels in the brains of subjects with&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To determine the relationship between D3 receptor binding and alcohol cue induced&#xD;
      craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve designated goals, the investigators will recruit 25 male and female subjects who&#xD;
      are non-treatment seekers. After a period of abstinence from alcohol, participants will come&#xD;
      to the Centre for Addiction of Mental Health for a [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET scan. Participants will&#xD;
      also have additional sessions during which other alcohol-related measures will be assessed&#xD;
      (i.e. alcohol cue induced craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the&#xD;
      laboratory).&#xD;

    <measure>Dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy</measure>
    <time_frame>One PET scan after 2-7 days of abstinence from alcohol; ~2 hours in duration.</time_frame>
    <description>Dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the brains of individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders will be quantified using [11C]-(+)-PHNO Positron Emission Tomography (PET). [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels will be used to infer receptor occupancy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol craving ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Cue paradigm session is expected to take ~1 hour and will occur on the PET day.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' ratings for alcohol craving acquired during the validated Cue-Induced Craving Paradigm (using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire: 8 items on a 11-point Likert scale) will be correlated to dopamine receptor occupancy (outcome 1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effort to obtain alcohol</measure>
    <time_frame>Single self-administration session will occur on its own day with a time commitment of ~6 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory alcohol self-administration paradigm in which participants press a button to intravenously self-administer small doses of alcohol will be used to assess amount of effort expended to obtain alcohol (&quot;break point&quot;). The # of button presses required to obtain the alcohol will increase as per the Progressive Ratio schedule. Regression analysis between effort and [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding (outcome 1) will be applied.</description>
