  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if a new drug, ONC201 can make tumors become smaller or&#xD;
      go away completely. Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of&#xD;
      cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201&#xD;
      in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine&#xD;
      whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in&#xD;
      unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers&#xD;
      including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any&#xD;
      other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or&#xD;
      paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase&#xD;
      1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to&#xD;
      see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and&#xD;
      significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.&#xD;

      Primary Objective To demonstrate objective responses using MRI or CT, and/or PET-CT imaging.&#xD;
      The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6&#xD;
      and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have&#xD;
      imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be&#xD;
      compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including&#xD;
      PC-PG are rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will&#xD;
      be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI&#xD;
      for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the&#xD;
      quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some&#xD;
      information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans&#xD;
      sent to Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
