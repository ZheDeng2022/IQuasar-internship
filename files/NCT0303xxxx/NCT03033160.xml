  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this protocol is to determine whether vaginal estrogen is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in postmenopausal women. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that women who use vaginal estrogen for three months will be more likely to have&#xD;
      resolution of their asymptomatic microscopic hematuria compared with women who do not use&#xD;
      vaginal estrogen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether vaginal estrogen is&#xD;
      an effective treatment for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      asymptomatic microscopic hematuria will be recruited from the two urogynecology clinics that&#xD;
      serve as the clinic sites for the Mount Auburn Hospital/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center&#xD;
      Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery fellowship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are eligible if they are postmenopausal, defined by amenorrhea for at least one&#xD;
      year or a bilateral oophorectomy at least one year prior, and have three or more red blood&#xD;
      cells per high powered field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence&#xD;
      of infection. In addition, participants must have a negative cystoscopy and computed&#xD;
      tomography urogram (or magnetic resonance urography if history of renal insufficiency or&#xD;
      contrast allergy) within the past three years. Exclusion criteria include any of the&#xD;
      following: current or past thromboembolic disorder or cerebrovascular accident, intolerance&#xD;
      to previous estrogen replacement therapy or hormone replacement therapy, estrogen dependent&#xD;
      neoplasm within the past five years (unless supporting documentation from patient's&#xD;
      oncologist is obtained), estrogen replacement therapy or hormone replacement therapy within&#xD;
      the past three months or selective estrogen receptor modulators within eight weeks of&#xD;
      enrollment, urinary tract infection, urinary calculi, urinary tract malignancy, vaginal&#xD;
      bleeding of unknown origin, urethral caruncle, history of recurrent urinary tract infections&#xD;
      in the last one year, and stage two or greater pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring (Estring;&#xD;
      Pfizer, New York, NY) or expectant management in a ratio of 1:1 using computer-generated&#xD;
      block randomization stratified by enrollment site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estring is a silicone vaginal ring, 5.5 cm in diameter, containing 2 mg of 17-estradiol,&#xD;
      which is released at a rate of 7.5 g daily. The Estring was chosen as the vehicle for vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen secondary to its ease of administration, higher patient preference, acceptability,&#xD;
      and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility is confirmed and written, informed consent is obtained, participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the two study arms. Participants randomized to the use of vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen will have the vaginal ring placed by one of the investigators. Participants in both&#xD;
      study arms will complete the short form of the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the&#xD;
      Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the vaginal estrogen arm will be called at two, four and eight weeks to&#xD;
      ensure that the Estring is still in place and follow-up appointments will be scheduled as&#xD;
      needed if there is any question as to whether the ring is still in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12-week visit all participants will provide a urine sample for urinalysis to assess&#xD;
      whether the microscopic hematuria is present. All participants also will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the UDI-6 and IIQ-7 and vaginal mucosal atrophy will be assessed as described above. Women in&#xD;
      the vaginal estrogen arm will have the Estring removed and a new Estring will be placed by&#xD;
      one of the investigators; participants also will be asked if the ring was removed or fell out&#xD;
      during the past 12 weeks. All participants will be asked whether any of the following, (which&#xD;
      could be a side effect from vaginal estrogen use) occurred in the previous 12 weeks:&#xD;
      dyspareunia for subject or partner, vaginal bleeding, non-physiologic discharge, vaginal&#xD;
      ulceration and vaginal irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants will be followed for 24 weeks to determine if more than 12 weeks are needed for&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 24-week visit, all participants will provide a urine sample for urinalysis to assess&#xD;
      whether the microscopic hematuria is present. All participants also will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the UDI-6 and IIQ-7 and vaginal mucosal atrophy will be assessed as described above. We will&#xD;
      ask all participants whether any of the following, which could be a side effect from vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen use, occurred in the previous 12 weeks: dyspareunia for subject or their partner,&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding, non-physiologic discharge, vaginal ulceration and vaginal irritation. One&#xD;
      of the investigators will remove the Estring from all women in the vaginal estrogen arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 24 week visit investigators will offer women in the expectant management arm with&#xD;
      persistent microscopic hematuria the opportunity to try the Estring.&#xD;
