      The proposed study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily dosing of&#xD;
      Liposomal-Amikacin for Inhalation (LAI) 590 mg for 12 months plus standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      mycobacterial multi-drug regimen in accordance with the 2007 ATS/ IDSA guidelines, for&#xD;
      treatment of mycobacterium abscessus lung disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily dosing of&#xD;
      Liposomal-Amikacin for Inhalation (LAI), in addition to a standard multi-drug antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy in accordance with the 2007 ATS/ IDSA guidelines, in patients with Mycobacterium&#xD;
      abscessus lung disease. The multi-drug therapy is determined at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator. After screening, all eligible patients will enter the trial and will receive&#xD;
      LAI 590 mg once daily for 12 months. If deemed necessary by the investigator, dose may be&#xD;
      adjusted from a minimum of three times per week up to daily, in cases of adverse events&#xD;
      relating to tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who enter the study will have subsequent study visits at Months 1,2,4,6,9, at&#xD;
      End-of-Study or Month 12, and at 1 and 3 months post study drug discontinuation. At each&#xD;
      visit (including screening), review of concomitant medications, review of adverse events, and&#xD;
      physical exam, will be performed. Chest CT scan will be performed at baseline, 6 months, and&#xD;
      12 months, unless a chest CT scan has already been performed within 6 months on this time&#xD;
      point. The 6 minute walk test and QOL-B-NTM will be performed at baseline, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months, and 3 months post study drug discontinuation. All patients will have inducted sputum&#xD;
      collected at each study visit, and patients will self-collect expectorated sputum during&#xD;
      intervening monthly time-points until study completion to determine changes in mycobacterial&#xD;
      smear and culture status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits will occur as needed should subjects' symptoms worsen between visits.&#xD;
