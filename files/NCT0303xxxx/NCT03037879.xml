  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population have documented deficits in&#xD;
      learning and memory (LM) and processing speed (PS) that adversely impact daily life and the&#xD;
      ability to benefit from rehabilitation. The investigators have previously attributed the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits demonstrated in the SCI population to low blood pressure (BP) and cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (CBF) and are currently conducting a study to determine the effect of a 30-day&#xD;
      elevation in BP (using midodrine hydrochloride - an alpha agonist) on CBF and cognitive&#xD;
      performance compared to placebo in hypotensive individuals with SCI. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) may improve cognition independent&#xD;
      of changes in BP and CBF in individuals with SCI. The current randomized clinical trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will examine the efficacy of 2 treatment protocols shown to be effective in improving&#xD;
      cognitive performance in other neurologically impaired populations for use in persons with&#xD;
      SCI demonstrating (1) LM impairment and/or (2) PS impairment on objective measures of&#xD;
      cognitive functioning during a complete Neuropsychological assessment. Two methods of outcome&#xD;
      assessment will be used to examine treatment impact: (1) a traditional Neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment (NP) and (2) an assessment of global functioning (AGF) composed of broader outcome&#xD;
      measures that examine the impact of the treatment on everyday life activities. In this way,&#xD;
      the investigators will be able to objectively evaluate the presence or absence of changes in&#xD;
      memory performance through a NP assessment, while also evaluating the impact of this&#xD;
      treatment protocol on everyday life through the AGF. While most studies evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of cognitive retraining usually employ a pre- and post-training evaluation, such&#xD;
      evaluations have been criticized for their lack of ecological validity (i.e., real world&#xD;
      generalizability). The present design allows the assessment of the efficacy of these&#xD;
      treatment techniques within an SCI population using traditional measures, as well as the&#xD;
      assessment of the impact that treatment has on everyday life. The investigators will&#xD;
      additionally evaluate the long-term efficacy by including a 6-month post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
      Few studies examine long-term effects, but given the time, labor and expense involved, it is&#xD;
      critical to demonstrate long-term efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      104 individuals with SCI will be recruited for eligibility to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=26 per group) story memory technique&#xD;
      (mSMT), mSMT control, speed of processing training (SPT) and SPT control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 14 visits spread over 8 months. A screening visit, lasting approximately 1&#xD;
      hour. 3 testing sessions lasting 3-4 hours each (Baseline, Immediate and Long-term&#xD;
      follow-ups), and 10 intervention sessions that will last approximately 45 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Prior to enrollment in the study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo&#xD;
      cognitive screening to determine eligibility for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline: After passing screening, subjects will be scheduled for the baseline evaluation&#xD;
      comprised of a cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment and cognitive evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Subjects will undergo 10 sessions of training in one of the 4 randomized&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Follow-up Assessment: Subjects will undergo a repeat of the baseline assessments&#xD;
      upon completion of the intervention protocol to document changes in PS, LM, BP and CBF&#xD;
      following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up: Subjects will be asked to return to the laboratory 6 months following&#xD;
      the intervention for evaluation of the maintenance of the treatment effect over time.&#xD;
      Baseline and Immediate follow-up measures of PS, LM, BP and CBF will be documented.&#xD;
