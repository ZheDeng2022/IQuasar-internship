    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel adjuvanted hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus (HBV) vaccine formulated as a potential therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV&#xD;
      infection. An ongoing human clinical trial of this HBV vaccine in a prophylactic setting has&#xD;
      confirmed this vaccine to be more effective at inducing seroconversion as measured by&#xD;
      development of Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) in poor responder subjects than the&#xD;
      standard alum-adjuvanted HBV vaccine, providing promise that this new vaccine may also be&#xD;
      able to induce HBV viral control and/or seroconversion in chronically infected subjects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic immunisation with HBsAg-based vaccines leads to development of HBsAg antibodies&#xD;
      that provide protection against HBV infection. Modern HBV vaccines are based on recombinant&#xD;
      HBsAg produced by expression in yeast expression systems. For infants whose mothers are HBsAg&#xD;
      positive, the first HBV vaccine dose is given at birth and three further doses are&#xD;
      administrated during the following 12 months at 2, 4 and 6 or 12 months. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that these HBV vaccines are 90 to 95% effective in preventing children from developing&#xD;
      chronic infection if they have not yet been infected. Since 1982 over one billion doses of&#xD;
      HBV vaccine have been used worldwide. However a number of groups have poor responses to the&#xD;
      existing HBV vaccines and these include older adults (age &gt; 40) and patients with&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, diabetes or renal impairment. A pilot clinical study demonstrated that&#xD;
      standard anti-HBV vaccination could reduce HBV replication in 50% of chronic carriers. A&#xD;
      multicentre trial, showed both the efficacy and the limitations of this approach. This study&#xD;
      included 118 treatment-naive patients, with detectable serum HBV DNA using a standard liquid&#xD;
      hybridization study and biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis pre-vaccination. Over a 12-month&#xD;
      period, they were given either five intradermal injections of 20 Âµg of a pre S2:S HBV vaccine&#xD;
      (GenHevac B.Pasteur-Merieux) or a standard HBV vaccine (Recombivax, MSD) or no treatment.&#xD;
      Three months after the first three vaccine injections, the percentage of serum HBV DNA&#xD;
      negativity was higher in the vaccine groups (15.5%) than in the control group (2.7%). After 1&#xD;
      year follow-up and five vaccine injections, there was no difference in the rate of serum HBV&#xD;
      DNA negativity, but those receiving HBV vaccines had significantly decreased HBV viral load&#xD;
      between 6 and 12 months when compared to the control group. The rate of HBe:anti-HBe&#xD;
      seroconversion did not differ between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, but early HBeAg&#xD;
      negativity and anti-HBe detection after 6 months of follow-up was seen only in vaccinated&#xD;
      patients (8 and 15% in groups B (Recombivax.) and C (GenHevac B.), respectively, compared&#xD;
      with 0% in the controls). Analysis of the vaccine-induced immune responses in 40 patients&#xD;
      with HBV chronic hepatitis during this vaccine trial showed that vaccination elicited T cell&#xD;
      proliferative responses in 7 of 27 patients who received the vaccine versus none of the&#xD;
      unvaccinated control group. These specific responses for envelope antigen were mediated by&#xD;
      CD4 T cells that produced high levels of gamma interferon. The reduction of serum HBV-DNA in&#xD;
      some of these patients suggests that induction of CD4 T cell responses could be important in&#xD;
      controlling viremia after vaccine therapy of HBV chronic carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments in transgenic mice that constitutively express HBV in the liver as a model of&#xD;
      asymptomatic chronic HBV carriers have shown that immunization can overcome functional&#xD;
      tolerance to HBV by inducing a specific antiviral immune response. The study vaccine was&#xD;
      tested for its ability to induce seroconversion in a HBV transgenic mouse model. The results&#xD;
      confirmed that the vaccine induced a high titre of anti-HBsAg antibodies and suppressed HBV&#xD;
      virus load in the liver. Importantly from a safety perspective no evidence of a flare in&#xD;
      liver disease as reflected by elevation of liver functions tests, was seen despite evidence&#xD;
      the vaccine suppressed liver virus. The vaccinated mice had the lowest levels of liver&#xD;
      transaminases, consistent with the vaccine reducing virus-mediated damage to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that the investigational vaccine will boost HBV antibody&#xD;
      and T cell responses in chronically infected patients and thereby improve HBV viral control&#xD;
      and opportunity for seroconversion. As this is an exploratory study, subjects with chronic&#xD;
      HBV infection will be enrolled whether or not they are on current antiviral treatment. This&#xD;
      will then allow comparison of vaccine effects in subjects on and off concomitant antiviral&#xD;
      treatment, with this data used to assist the design of future studies. The study will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that a potent preS HBV vaccine including Advax adjuvant will enhance both&#xD;
      humoral and cellular immunity thereby helping to control chronic hepatitis B infection. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to induce HBsAg seroconversion and effect permanent clearance of HBV or at a&#xD;
      minimum to enable better immune control of viral replication. This pilot study will collect&#xD;
      preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine approach in chronically HBV&#xD;
      infected individuals, as a precursor to larger efficacy studies in the future.&#xD;
