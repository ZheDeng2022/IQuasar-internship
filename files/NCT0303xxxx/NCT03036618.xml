  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quinoa is possible alternative to wheat, corn and rice due to its high nutritional value and&#xD;
      possible properties against cardiovascular diseases and for improving gut health. There are&#xD;
      some animal studies to suggest that some important class of compounds like fibre,&#xD;
      antioxidants and protein, found naturally in quinoa, have beneficial effects against markers&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of quinoa on humans has rarely been&#xD;
      investigated. This study will investigate the effects of daily consumption of quinoa for four&#xD;
      weeks on markers of cardiovascular risk, including blood cholesterol and resting blood&#xD;
      pressure, and on gut health in a randomised cross-over study design.&#xD;

      Quinoa is a possible alternative to wheat, corn and rice due to its high nutritional value&#xD;
      and possible properties against cardiovascular diseases. There are some animal studies which&#xD;
      suggest that quinoa has beneficial effects against markers of cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      particularly blood lipid profile. The grain has a unique nutritional profile, with high fibre&#xD;
      levels and a wide range of phytochemicals which may influence gut bacteria and improve&#xD;
      gastrointestinal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effects of quinoa on humans has rarely been investigated with just two small&#xD;
      interventions published. These studies also showed an improvement in blood lipid profile&#xD;
      after consuming quinoa daily. There have been no studies which have investigated the effects&#xD;
      of quinoa on gut bacteria and gastrointestinal health. Therefore, this human dietary&#xD;
      intervention study aims to determine the effects of quinoa consumption on markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized cross-over designed dietary intervention study with 4-week study&#xD;
      periods separated by a 4-week wash-out period. The treatment will be the daily consumption of&#xD;
      a test bread roll containing quinoa to deliver 20g quinoa per day (one roll per day). The&#xD;
      control will be the same amount of a refined wheat roll. Markers of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk, including fasting blood lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin concentration,&#xD;
      resting blood pressure will be compared at the beginning and end of each treatment period.&#xD;
      Changes in the numbers and species of gut bacteria, and products of bacterial fermentation&#xD;
      will be made in stool samples collected at the beginning and end of each intervention period&#xD;
      as indicators of gastrointestinal health.&#xD;
