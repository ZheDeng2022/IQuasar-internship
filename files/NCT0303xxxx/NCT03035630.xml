      This is an open label, randomized phase II trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio and stratified for known prognostics variables to one of two first-line medication&#xD;
      treatment arms. Once disease progression has been documented, and following a required&#xD;
      inter-line washout period, subjects will receive either second-line medication treatment or&#xD;
      discontinue treatment, per discretion of treating investigator.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized and stratified to&#xD;
      one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avelumab 10mg/kg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 (D1) and Day 15 (D15) of every 28 day cycle&#xD;
           until documented disease progression per Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In&#xD;
           Solid Tumors (irRECIST) 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following completion of an inter-line washout period of a minimum of 2 weeks up to a&#xD;
           maximum of 60 days (or at the discretion of treating investigator) subjects will&#xD;
           receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sunitinib 50 mg by mouth (po) once daily from D1 to D14 of every 21 day cycle until&#xD;
                documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors&#xD;
                (RECIST) 1.1 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinue treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIRST-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sunitinib 50 mg po once daily from D1 to D14 of every 21 day cycle until documented&#xD;
           disease progression per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECOND-LINE INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT ARM B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following completion of an inter-line washout period of a minimum of 2 weeks up to a&#xD;
           maximum of 60 days (or at the discretion of treating investigator) subjects will&#xD;
           receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Avelumab 10mg/kg IV on D1 and D15 every 28 day cycle until documented disease&#xD;
                progression per irRECIST 1.1 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinue treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not experience disease progression at end of first-line treatment and are&#xD;
      removed from first-line treatment due to toxicities or personal decision, may also either&#xD;
      receive second-line therapy or be monitored during the inter-line period until progression&#xD;
      (which may be longer than 60 days) per discretion of treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological disease evaluation assessments will be completed every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs must be obtained within 14 days&#xD;
      prior to registration:&#xD;

             prednisone equivalent dose of another corticosteroid for ≥2 weeks) is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
