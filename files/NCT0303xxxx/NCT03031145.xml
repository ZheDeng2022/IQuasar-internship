    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate allergen-induced nasal airway inflammation&#xD;
      following nasal application of felis domesticus, or cat, extract in e-cigarette users,&#xD;
      cigarette smokers, and non-smokers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent increase in popularity of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation or in combination&#xD;
      with conventional cigarettes has let to safety concerns regarding their potential role in&#xD;
      respiratory disease. These tobacco alternatives devices were initially perceived as a &quot;safer&quot;&#xD;
      alternative to cigarettes and were marketed without much known about their health effects.&#xD;
      Increasing evidence that while they contain fewer toxins and carcinogens than conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes, they do involve delivery of ultrafine particles to the lower airways and can&#xD;
      contain heavy metals and other chemicals. Tobacco Smoke may augment allergic inflammation&#xD;
      resulting from allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Animal models of allergic asthma demonstrate&#xD;
      aggravation of allergen -induced airway inflammation following inhalation of e-cig cartridge&#xD;
      solution, with increased airway eosinophil infiltration, production of Th2 cytokines, and&#xD;
      airway hyperresponsivness. In vitro studies in human tissues have demonstrated&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory responses in a similar way as tobacco smoke, yet a head-to-head comparison&#xD;
      of the effects of these two exposures has not been performed in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of tobacco products remains a pervasive problem in our society and around the world, with&#xD;
      significant impact on respiratory health and quality of life. With the emergence of new&#xD;
      non-tobacco based nicotine products like e-cigarettes, it is important to understand the&#xD;
      impact these substances have on respiratory health and disease. The aim o f this study is to&#xD;
      study the impact of these products on allergic inflammation in cat allergic subjects who&#xD;
      already routinely use e-cigarettes and to compare their response to those of cigarette&#xD;
      smokers and non-smokers. A thorough understanding of the potential health impacts of tobacco&#xD;
      alternative substances in seeded, especially given the rising popularity of such products&#xD;
      with adolescents and young adults to whom these substances have particular appeals given the&#xD;
      purported safety: and variety of flavors to chose from.&#xD;
