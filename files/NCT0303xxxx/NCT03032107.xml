  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not&#xD;
      approved the combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 for use in patients, including people&#xD;
      with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine what amount (or dose) of Pembrolizumab and of T-DM1 is safe for&#xD;
      people to take and what effects, good or bad, this combination may have on participants and&#xD;
      their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved in&#xD;
      the United Sates for the treatment of other types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) as a treatment option for this type of&#xD;
      breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Pembrolizumab and T-DM1 is investigational. It is thought that together&#xD;
      these drugs to help get the immune system to attack tumor cells and kill cancer cells that&#xD;
      have the HER2 protein. However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same&#xD;
      time will have a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because tratuzumab, a component of T-DM1, is known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy, for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and for an additional 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, the treating physician and principal&#xD;
                  investigator should be informed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  While on the study, women should not breast-feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been&#xD;
                  surgically sterilized and/or have had a menstrual period in the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If a&#xD;
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control&#xD;
             symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they&#xD;
             have completed treatment at least one month prior to trial therapy initiation, are&#xD;
             neurologically stable with an absence of new neurological symptoms for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry, and have recovered from effects of radiotherapy or&#xD;
             surgery. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued&#xD;
             without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; see Appendix B),&#xD;
             active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed&#xD;
             within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed&#xD;
             with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or&#xD;
             any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifiying agents, or&#xD;
             has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,&#xD;
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis C RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             pembrolizumab. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections with bone marrow suppressive therapy, i.e. nab-paclitaxel. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study&#xD;
             therapy. Note: seasonal influenza vaccines for infection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
             vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (i.e. Flu-Mist ®) are&#xD;
             live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
