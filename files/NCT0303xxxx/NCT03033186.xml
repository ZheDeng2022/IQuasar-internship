  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic (HR-positive, HER2-negative) breast cancer (BC), advanced or unresectable&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic (pNET), gastrointestinal or lung origin and metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are diseases with poor outcome. Everolimus increases patients'&#xD;
      median progression-free survival (PFS) with 4.6 months in metastatic BC (mBC), 7 months in&#xD;
      (p)NET and 3 months in mRCC. However, serious adverse events (AEs) occur frequently. This&#xD;
      reduces effectiveness of everolimus, because AEs are managed with dose reductions, treatment&#xD;
      interruptions or even complete discontinuation of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic-drug-monitoring (TDM) is used to adjust the prescribed daily dose, to maintain&#xD;
      effective everolimus whole blood concentrations, with the lowest possible risk of AEs. While&#xD;
      everolimus TDM has been common in transplantation medicine, it has not been implemented in&#xD;
      oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of TDM in oncology is supported by previous research which showed that a&#xD;
      2-fold increased everolimus whole blood trough concentration was associated with a short-term&#xD;
      risk of grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis, stomatitis and metabolic events. Moreover, an&#xD;
      exposure-toxicity relationship of everolimus in patients with thyroid cancer was observed,&#xD;
      since initial everolimus concentrations could be associated with early toxicity (&lt; 12 weeks,&#xD;
      e.g. stomatitis). However, the association between initial everolimus measurements and&#xD;
      long-term AEs (≥12 weeks, e.g. pneumonitis, anorexia and anemia) of any grade and the need&#xD;
      for everolimus dose reductions could not be made. Since levels ±&gt;18 µg/L were associated with&#xD;
      toxicity, the investigators assume that the upper therapeutic window of everolimus in the&#xD;
      oncologic setting will be ±18 µg/L. Similarly, a tendency to improved PFS and overall&#xD;
      survival was observed when Cmin in steady state was above 14.1 μg/L. This seems to be the&#xD;
      lower limit of the therapeutic window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before consensus about the feasibility of everolimus TDM in the oncologic setting can be&#xD;
      achieved, a number of questions (the knowledge gaps) need to be answered: 1. It is unknown&#xD;
      whether everolimus whole blood trough levels (over time) predict long-term AEs. 2. The&#xD;
      optimal concentration range for everolimus, with the treatment of mBC, mRCC, or (p)NET is&#xD;
      unknown, especially the upper limit associated with toxicity. 3. It is unknown what&#xD;
      everolimus concentration level is associated with the need for everolimus dose reductions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus is an oral inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key signal&#xD;
      transduction molecule of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. This pathway, which&#xD;
      regulates cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival and angiogenesis, is&#xD;
      frequently dysregulated in human cancers and thus is a rational target for anticancer&#xD;
      therapy. Everolimus is currently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the treatment of different solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic (Hormone-Receptor [HR]-positive, HER2-negative) breast cancer (BC), advanced or&#xD;
      unresectable neuroendocrine tumours of pancreatic (pNET), gastrointestinal or lung origin and&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are diseases with poor outcome. Everolimus is part of&#xD;
      palliative treatment and increases patients' median progression-free survival (PFS) with 4.6&#xD;
      months in metastatic BC (mBC), 7 months in pNET and 3 months in mRCC. However, serious&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) occur frequently; stomatitis up to 67%, non-infectious pneumonitis (NIP)&#xD;
      up to 15%. This reduces effectiveness of everolimus, because AEs are managed with dose&#xD;
      reductions, treatment interruptions or even complete discontinuation of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus shows a large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variation in whole blood&#xD;
      concentrations, due to variability in oral drug availability, patient non-compliance (e.g.&#xD;
      due to drug-related toxicity, forgetting and/or overuse), drug-drug interactions with&#xD;
      co-medication and many other factors. Furthermore, variation in the population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of everolimus is caused by everolimus' hematocrit effect. This effect is&#xD;
      present at high everolimus concentrations in combination with low hematocrit values, which is&#xD;
      likely to be the case in the oncologic population. High incidences of anemia in oncologic&#xD;
      patients treated with everolimus have been described, respectively being 32.1%&#xD;
      (CI=17.5-51.3%) for all-grade (grades 1-4) toxicities and 6.9% (95% CI=4.1-11.3%) for&#xD;
      high-grade (grades 3-4) toxicities. Therefore, studies have recommended to correct the&#xD;
      everolimus whole blood concentrations for hematocrit determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very different whole blood concentrations between individuals can result in&#xD;
      supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic exposure levels and consequently in over- or&#xD;
      undertreatment, respectively. Despite the inter-patient variability in systemic exposure,&#xD;
      everolimus is currently prescribed at a fixed dose. Given the narrow therapeutic index and a&#xD;
      positive exposure-efficacy relationship, there is a rationale for pharmacokinetically guided&#xD;
      dosing also known as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of everolimus. Such an approach could&#xD;
      theoretically contribute to a tailor-made everolimus treatment with improved therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy and decreased risk for toxicity. Since daily everolimus dosing demonstrates dose&#xD;
      proportionality and linear pharmacokinetics, this seems to be easily applicable. Furthermore,&#xD;
      requirements for dose reduction at physicians discretion can be supported when it is known at&#xD;
      what everolimus trough level a dose reduction is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic-drug-monitoring (TDM) (i.e. measurement of everolimus whole blood levels after&#xD;
      venipuncture) is used to adjust the prescribed daily dose, to maintain effective everolimus&#xD;
      whole blood concentrations, with the lowest possible risk of AEs. In addition, TDM is a&#xD;
      useful tool for early detection of non-adherence, and might also be used to monitor the&#xD;
      effects of drug-drug interactions and food effects. While TDM, according to international&#xD;
      consensus, has been common in transplantation medicine for 10 years, it has not been&#xD;
      implemented in oncology. The importance of TDM in oncology is, however, supported by previous&#xD;
      research that showed a 2-fold increased trough concentration (Cmin) of everolimus whole blood&#xD;
      with a short-term risk of grade ≥ 3 pulmonary events (relative risk [RR] 1.9; 95% CI&#xD;
      1.1-3.3], stomatitis events (RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and metabolic events (RR 1.3 95%&#xD;
      1.0-1.7). Moreover, an exposure-toxicity relationship of everolimus in patients with thyroid&#xD;
      cancer was observed, since initial everolimus concentrations could be associated with early&#xD;
      toxicity (&lt; 12 weeks), i.e. stomatitis. However, the association between initial everolimus&#xD;
      measurements and long-term AEs (≥ 12 weeks, e.g. pneumonitis, anorexia and anemia) of any&#xD;
      grade and the need for everolimus dose reductions could not be made. Since a trough&#xD;
      concentration of approximately 18 µg/L was associated with toxicity, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that the upper therapeutic window of everolimus in the oncologic setting will be ±18 µg/L.&#xD;
      Therefore, an upper threshold of &gt;18 µg/L was considered for this study.Similarly, a tendency&#xD;
      to improved PFS and overall survival (OS) was noted when CminSS was above 14.1 μg/L. This&#xD;
      might be the lower limit of the therapeutic window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the following knowledge gaps exist: 1. It is unknown whether everolimus trough whole&#xD;
      blood levels (over time) predict for long-term AEs (≥12 weeks, e.g. pneumonitis, anorexia and&#xD;
      anemia). 2. The optimal concentration range for everolimus, for the treatment of mBC, mRCC,&#xD;
      or (p)NET is unknown, especially the upper limit associated with toxicity. 3. It is unknown&#xD;
      what everolimus concentration level is associated with the need for everolimus dose&#xD;
      reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to quantitate the outcome toxicity, the number of dose reductions can be&#xD;
      investigated as this is the sum of all different toxicities experienced by patients and these&#xD;
      are also the toxicities that lead to clinical action by the treating physician. Furthermore,&#xD;
      especially all NCI-CTCAE v4.0 grade ≥2 are important, and special attention should be focused&#xD;
      on AEs that are highly prevalent, objectively measurable, clinically relevant and/or&#xD;
      untreatable. These AEs will be leading to dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose individualization based on the measured drug concentration could theoretically result in&#xD;
      less toxicity and more efficacy. Further studies are required to determine the clinical&#xD;
      utility of TDM for everolimus in oncology settings. Determination of everolimus&#xD;
      concentrations at the onset of severe AEs (dose interruptions or reductions) and disease&#xD;
      progression may enable better understanding of pathophysiology, permitting dose reduction at&#xD;
      the right moment rather than drug withdrawal in patients with high everolimus concentrations.&#xD;
      The clinical impact of this approach can be large, since everolimus treatment optimization is&#xD;
      better than unnecessary switching to the next line of palliative treatment in these oncologic&#xD;
      patients. This is supported by the study by Generali et al., finding the combination of&#xD;
      everolimus plus exemestaan as first- or second-line therapy for mBC patients more efficacious&#xD;
      than several chemotherapy regimens that were reported in the literature. Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      important to realise that the initial concentration (&lt; 12 weeks) does not reflect a change in&#xD;
      steady-state trough concentration over time (≥12 weeks) due to various reasons. Some of them&#xD;
      being drug-drug interactions, high-fat food effects, a change in haematocrit, non-adherence,&#xD;
      dose-reductions and interruptions of the everolimus treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of the everolimus concentration over time implies frequent pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
      (blood draws). Nowadays everolimus exposure is determined by everolimus concentration&#xD;
      measurement in whole blood. Therefore, a venipuncture is always necessary. This is invasive&#xD;
      and requires patients to come to the hospital. It would be convenient for patients to have&#xD;
      their everolimus concentration determined by dried blood spot (DBS) analysis. With DBS only a&#xD;
      single drop of blood from the finger is necessary, which can be done at home and send by&#xD;
      regular mail for analysis. Previous studies have showed the feasibility of the DBS approach&#xD;
      in the oncologic setting. The physician may benefit from the ease of the DBS sampling method&#xD;
      providing results timely before the patient visits the clinic for their (routine) check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous methods for the measurement of everolimus by means of DBS have been developed. In&#xD;
      the past, emphasis has been put on the development and analytical validation of the assay&#xD;
      while the clinical validation was of minor importance. Some information has been gathered in&#xD;
      transplantation medicine. However, in patients with cancer, the correlation between&#xD;
      everolimus DBS concentrations and whole blood concentration is unknown. Furthermore,&#xD;
      information regarding the important everolimus hematocrit effect in DBS at high concentration&#xD;
      levels common in the oncology population is lacking. Therefore, the secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine the everolimus concentration collected with DBS from a finger prick and DBS paper&#xD;
      spiked with a drop of venipunctured whole blood containing everolimus.&#xD;
