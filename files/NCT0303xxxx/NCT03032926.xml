  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to identify a potential biobehavioral marker of CBT&#xD;
      outcome in the most common child and adolescent anxiety disorders, including separation&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (SAD), social phobia (SoP), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and to&#xD;
      replicate in a clinical sample the previous finding from animal and non-clinical human&#xD;
      samples that a difference exists in extinction learning across development.&#xD;

      Study Sample and Design: The study will utilize an open treatment pilot trial design.&#xD;
      Participants will include 10 individuals, ages 11-18, with a primary anxiety disorder&#xD;
      diagnosis. Participants must not have failed prior trials of CBT. Participants on psychiatric&#xD;
      medication must be on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to study participation and&#xD;
      remain symptomatic to the level identified for study inclusion (ADIS CSR â‰¥ 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Independent evaluators will administer a comprehensive assessment at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment. The Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for Children for DSM-5 (ADIS-C-5)19&#xD;
      will measure the primary outcome of change in clinical severity of anxiety disorder symptoms&#xD;
      across age groups. The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) will assess overall symptom&#xD;
      severity. The PARS and the MASC will provide secondary, dimensional measures of anxiety. In&#xD;
      addition, we will measure treatment adherence and parent engagement as important secondary&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear Conditioning &amp; Extinction Paradigm: Subjects will participate in a laboratory test of&#xD;
      extinction training prior to CBT in order to establish extinction learning as a potential&#xD;
      predictive marker of treatment outcome. Subjects will be exposed to two shapes on a computer&#xD;
      screen, one shape (conditioned stimulus (CS+) will be paired with an aversive sound&#xD;
      (unconditioned stimulus) on 38% of the trials, whereas the other shape will never be paired&#xD;
      with aversive sound (CS-)20. A day later, individuals will undergo extinction training in&#xD;
      which the two conditioned stimuli will be repeatedly presented without the unconditioned&#xD;
      stimulus. Extinction will be measured as the difference score of skin conductance response to&#xD;
      the CS+ and CS-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Therapy Intervention: investigators will offer participants an 8 session exposure&#xD;
      therapy intervention. Session one will consist of psychoeducation and completion of an&#xD;
      exposure hierarchy. Sessions 2-7 will consist of weekly gradual exposure sessions. Session 8&#xD;
      will include review, relapse prevention and referral to additional treatment if needed.&#xD;
      Assessment measures will be given at the completion of each exposure session to assess&#xD;
      individual differences in symptom change related to exposure therapy. All treatment sessions&#xD;
      will be videotaped to ensure fidelity to treatment manual and modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Investigators will track the monthly number of participants screened and&#xD;
      enrolled to determine feasibility of a larger trial, as well as session attendance, study&#xD;
      attrition, treatment adherence and patient safety to assess acceptability of the selected&#xD;
      measures and interventions. Though this pilot will not be adequately powered to detect&#xD;
      statistical significance, the investigators will execute a preliminary test of the&#xD;
      association between performance on the extinction learning task and treatment outcome, and&#xD;
      the investigators will assess age group differences in extinction learning and treatment&#xD;
      outcome to determine early proof of concept.&#xD;
