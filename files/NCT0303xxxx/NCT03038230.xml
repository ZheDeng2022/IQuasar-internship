      Study Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label, single arm, multinational, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1&#xD;
      consists of dose escalation cohorts and Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include adult AML patients (and all subtypes of AML, except for&#xD;
      APL) with relapse or refractory disease and newly diagnosed elderly untreated AML patients&#xD;
      with high risk cytogenetics. In addition, very high-risk MDS patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory disease are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, dose escalations cohorts are followed until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or RecommendedPart2Dose (RP2D) is defined. Dose escalation&#xD;
      decisions will be made by the Data Review Committee and will be primarily guided by safety&#xD;
      data observed through the end of Cycle 1, as well as on-going assessment of safety beyond&#xD;
      Cycle 1 in later cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will begin once the MTD or RP2D is determined in Part 1. Part 2 will further&#xD;
      characterize the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), Pharmacodynamic (PD),&#xD;
      immunogenicity and to assess preliminary efficacy of MCLA-117. This part will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 30 evaluable patients (defined as evaluable for first efficacy assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both parts, the study consists of 3 periods: a Screening period (up to 28 days prior to&#xD;
      the first dose of study drug); a Treatment period (first dose of study drug until the last&#xD;
      dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and a Follow Up period (through 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose and quarterly checks for survival data for up to 1 year). Participants'&#xD;
      safety will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be permitted to receive MCLA-117&#xD;
      beyond Cycle 1 if conditions allow this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 centers in five countries are estimated to be involved during Parts 1 and 2&#xD;
      of the study. Additional sites may be added to ensure there is an acceptable enrollment rate&#xD;
      or to replace non-enrolling/withdrawn sites.&#xD;
