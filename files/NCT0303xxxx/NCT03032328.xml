  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous work the investigator identified a group of children between the ages of 10-18&#xD;
      years whose diagnostic workup for chronic nausea unexplained by conventional diagnostic tests&#xD;
      has unexpectedly revealed underlying cardiovascular instability manifesting as orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance, primary defined as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (88%). While&#xD;
      this is an atypical initial presentation for orthostatic intolerance in general, the&#xD;
      investigator believes that the cardiovascular problem is serious and represents a cause of&#xD;
      the nausea in a majority of these individuals, as treatment of the POTS with fludrocortisone&#xD;
      reduced the symptoms of nausea. While fludrocortisone treatment abrogates the fall in&#xD;
      baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) during tilt in part, it did not completely correct the&#xD;
      tachycardia symptoms or the BRS suppression during HUT. Furthermore it caused an elevation in&#xD;
      MAP in supine position, which may lead to future cardiovascular problems such as early onset&#xD;
      hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. This argues for a different treatment approach. The&#xD;
      investigator presents preliminary data in this application revealing that OI subjects tend to&#xD;
      have lower 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) compared to non OI subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators approach will combine HUT testing coupled with autonomic testing that&#xD;
      includes continuous blood pressure and HR measurements, Baroreflex Sensitivity and Hear Rate&#xD;
      Variability, to establish objective autonomic profiles, along with vascular testing including&#xD;
      Pulse Wave Velocity, Ankle Brachial Index at rest and measures of blood volume of different&#xD;
      compartments, Systemic Vascular Resistance and cardiac output at rest and in response to&#xD;
      hand-grip stress. This will allow the treating physician to provide patients with a specific&#xD;
      diagnosis, and ultimately develop data for more focused, rational treatments than currently&#xD;
      achieved. The full vascular profile is also novel and has the potential to improve&#xD;
      therapeutic management of the participants independent of the outcomes with the vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation. This study is designed to recruit 80 participants into 4 groups of 20 each.&#xD;
      The 4 groups represent non OI (those recruited from the clinics for nausea but without a&#xD;
      positive tilt test) or those showing orthostatic intolerance (POTS alone, OH, and syncope).&#xD;
      The general objective of this proposal is to address this gap in knowledge by determining&#xD;
      vascular function, the neurohumoral profile and autonomic status supine and in response to&#xD;
      HUT in OI subjects with low vitamin D levels in comparison with subjects who test negative&#xD;
      for OI on the HUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to examine the effect of vitamin D replacement on these measures,&#xD;
      providing the possibility of therapeutic use of vitamin D to treat or ameliorate the symptoms&#xD;
      associated with OI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The age range of 10-18 years was chosen as we anticipate these patients will be&#xD;
             capable of adequately answering nausea symptom questionnaires and cooperating during&#xD;
             autonomic and tilt table testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be recruited from the pediatric GI clinic if they meet Rome III criteria&#xD;
             for childhood functional dyspepsia with nausea as the predominant symptom which&#xD;
             includes: persistent or recurrent pain or discomfort (including nausea) in the upper&#xD;
             abdomen not relieved with defecation and not associated an inflammatory, anatomic,&#xD;
             metabolic, or neoplastic process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be recruited from the pediatric cardiology clinic for presenting&#xD;
             symptoms of unexplained syncope not associated with cardiac anatomic anomalies or&#xD;
             other identified cardiac pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if a metabolic, mechanical, or mucosal inflammatory cause&#xD;
             has been defined to explain their gastrointestinal symptoms. This would include, for&#xD;
             example, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, liver or&#xD;
             pancreatic disease, hiatal hernia, or bowel obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant cardiac or cardiovascular disease, malignancy, or other&#xD;
             comorbid conditions precluding successful completion of a 45 minute tilt test will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are incapable or unwilling to discontinue medications affecting autonomic&#xD;
             function will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes will be excluded due to the possibility that the autonomic&#xD;
             dysfunction results from a peripheral neuropathy. (We have successfully recruited&#xD;
             these numbers of subjects in less than 2 years in a previous study of similar design&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant&#xD;
