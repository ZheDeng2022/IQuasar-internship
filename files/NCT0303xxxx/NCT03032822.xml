  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Ohio State University, and across the country, surgical patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital are over-prescribed a significant amount of opioid medications upon discharge to&#xD;
      home. Recent studies reveal that a large percentage of patients prescribed opioid medications&#xD;
      after surgery have approximately half of the prescribed medication left over. This study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate reported opioid use after surgery in patients undergoing cystectomy in order to&#xD;
      better approach the issue with current opioid use and abuse trends while still providing&#xD;
      adequate medical care and pain management to patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies show that 67% of patients prescribed opioid medications in urologic&#xD;
      procedures and surgeries had leftover opioid medications with a mean use of about half the&#xD;
      medications prescribed. A similar study in thoracic surgery patients reported similar results&#xD;
      with 71% of patients admitting to taking half or less of their prescribed opioid medications.&#xD;
      Recent advancements in cystectomy protocol have already shown promise with reducing hospital&#xD;
      length of stay from eight to four days, including the simultaneous reduction of opioid&#xD;
      analgesics for pain management, with 4.9 mg morphine equivalents per day when using enhanced&#xD;
      recovery techniques compared to 20.67 mg in traditional care. Results of the current&#xD;
      prospective study could further support these results and include low to no risk assessments&#xD;
      and follow-up phone calls. This study is observational and involves consenting adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing cystectomy to pre-operative assessments including the Self Administered&#xD;
      Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) questionnaire, a cognitive test to identify mild-moderate cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, and collection of demographic data and medical history. Phone call follow-ups&#xD;
      include assessments of post-discharge pain and opioid consumption, and completing verbally an&#xD;
      adapted Activities of Daily Living questionnaire. No additional risks have been identified by&#xD;
      participating in this study. Participants may not directly benefit from participating in this&#xD;
      trial, but the data collected could provide valuable insight into the discrepancy between&#xD;
      required opioid pain medications and opioid pain medication prescription for adequate pain&#xD;
      management. This insight could then be applied to reevaluate post-discharge pain management&#xD;
      procedures and standards of care, therefore curbing opioid use and abuse trends&#xD;
