  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, are common after traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      and affect recovery and negatively influence participation in rehabilitation. Sleep apnea is&#xD;
      a breathing problem while persons sleep and causes further brain damage and problems with&#xD;
      thinking, daily functioning, and overall health. Earlier diagnosis and treatment is important&#xD;
      for TBI survivors to maximize the recovery process. There is little information that guides&#xD;
      TBI doctors on how to identify sleep apnea during inpatient TBI rehabilitation, a phase in&#xD;
      which people experience the potential for a rapid pace of improvement. The Agency for&#xD;
      Healthcare Research has highlighted gaps in best methods for identifying sleep apnea and&#xD;
      separately in helping consumers with TBI rehabilitation choices. Partnering with survivors,&#xD;
      caregivers, and administrators, investigators developed this study to compare sleep apnea&#xD;
      screening and diagnostic tools in TBI rehabilitation settings. This information will provide&#xD;
      clinicians, providers, and patients with the best information for early identification of&#xD;
      sleep apnea to remove negative influence on the pace of recovery in early phases after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Goal: Investigators will compare existing screening (Aim 1) and diagnostic tools (Aim 2)&#xD;
      in TBI patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. For the second aim, investigators will&#xD;
      determine if a more accessible diagnostic test is sufficient to diagnose sleep apnea compared&#xD;
      to the traditional method used which is less accessible to consumers. If the more accessible&#xD;
      test is good enough, this will increase recognition of this problem and increase patient&#xD;
      access to earlier sleep apnea treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stakeholders and Products. TBI survivors, caregivers, researchers, and policymakers working&#xD;
      together on this study helped develop the study questions. Idea exchanges included ways to&#xD;
      reach clinicians and TBI survivors/caregivers via existing educational programming and online&#xD;
      tools for consumers such as fact sheets and patient/caregiver-focused videos. Other&#xD;
      traditional methods will include targeting professional magazines, conferences, and research&#xD;
      journals that reach professionals working with TBI survivors and their families at the time&#xD;
      of admission to rehabilitation and during the recovery process. This study will occur at&#xD;
      rehabilitation hospitals around the country who enroll TBI survivors into a lifetime study&#xD;
      called the TBI Model System funded by the Dept. of Health and Human Services and VA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses of TBI studies found prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was 12 times&#xD;
      higher than community-based studies. Yet, sleep apnea in those with TBI is largely&#xD;
      undiagnosed. Given that sleep is critical for neural repair and disordered sleep may play a&#xD;
      role in slowing functional recovery and prolonging rehabilitation, early detection of sleep&#xD;
      apnea is critical (Stakeholder Input). Minimal guidance exists informing TBI and sleep&#xD;
      medicine physicians regarding assessment of sleep disorders in the acute rehabilitation&#xD;
      setting. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness&#xD;
      Review highlighted insufficient comparative effectiveness evidence for diagnostic and&#xD;
      screening tools. This study proposes to leverage the existing TBI Model System research&#xD;
      consortium (TBIMS), funded by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs, to improve early detection of sleep apnea in patients with TBI undergoing inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation at six study sites. Study aims are focused around components of phased testing&#xD;
      for sleep apnea. Findings will inform clinician's decisions for screening and diagnostic&#xD;
      tests to facilitate earlier recognition of sleep apnea (outcome) and subsequently prescribe&#xD;
      appropriate treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: (Screening) For individuals with TBI, determine comparative effectiveness of 2&#xD;
      American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) endorsed screening tools (STOPBang vs. Actigraphy)&#xD;
      to identify those at high risk of sleep apnea as diagnosed through Level 1 PSG. Long-term&#xD;
      Objectives: To inform clinician's choices for screening measures to determine presence of&#xD;
      sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate alternative screening tools (Berlin, MAPI) to Level 1 PSG in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II: (Diagnosis) This study will determine the diagnostic accuracy (non-inferiority) of&#xD;
      Level 3 PSG in determining presence of sleep apnea in patients with acute TBI patients in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation setting. Level 1 PSG will be used as the criterion standard. Long-term&#xD;
      Objectives: To inform clinician's choices of diagnostic tests to determine presence of sleep&#xD;
      apnea and prescribe appropriate treatments. If Level 3 portable PSG is equivalent to the less&#xD;
      accessible Level 1 PSG, this will increase consumer accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-year, multi-center prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim I, the screening tools STOPBang and ACG will be compared against one another to&#xD;
      determine their sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with TBI at risk for&#xD;
      sleep apnea. In Aim II, the non-inferiority of Level 3 PSG in determining presence and&#xD;
      severity of sleep apnea in patients with moderate to severe TBI will be compared to Level 1&#xD;
      PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive participants to neurorehabilitation at an existing National Institute on&#xD;
      Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) or VA funded TBIMS&#xD;
      Center will make up the study population. Patients will be age 16 and older (18 or older at&#xD;
      VA sites), with moderate to severe TBI, admitted for rehabilitation in a U.S. TBIMS inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation facility, and sleeping &gt; 2 hours/night suggesting habitual sleep duration.&#xD;
      Based on historical data from the six study sites participating in this study, investigators&#xD;
      in this study conservatively estimated that 70% of patients admitted for inpatient TBI&#xD;
      rehabilitation would consent into this study (N=20/month), resulting in a 13-month enrollment&#xD;
      estimate of 259 patients. Power analyses of each study aim suggest that a sample size of 237&#xD;
      is the largest sample size needed for sufficient power. The sites participating in this study&#xD;
      aim to collectively enroll 259 patients to account for possible further attrition. Based on&#xD;
      TBIMS data acquired over the past 25-years, 44% of the sample is female, 64% are categorized&#xD;
      as Non-White, median age is 38 years, with predominantly moderate to severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Positive predictive power of screening tools: STOPBang and ACG, 2) Equivalency in&#xD;
      detection of sleep apnea via Level 1 and Level 3 PSG, with diagnosis of sleep apnea based on&#xD;
      overall apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt; 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Investigators expect that STOPBang values &gt; 5 and abnormal ACG total sleep time (&lt; 5&#xD;
      hours with desaturation) will produce sufficiently high SEs with reasonable tradeoff in SP&#xD;
      (noting that SE and SP are inversely related). Similarly, for Level 1 PSG, a diagnosis of&#xD;
      sleep apnea will be made if AHI ≥ 5. Cross-tabulations of STOPBang and ACG screening for high&#xD;
      risk of sleep apnea (positive/negative) versus Level 1 PSG diagnosis (positive/negative) will&#xD;
      be constructed and estimates of diagnostic accuracy (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy) will be estimated along with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. To address hypothesis 1.1, two-sided McNemar's tests will be used to&#xD;
      compare the paired SEs and paired SPs between STOPBang and ACG assuming a significance level&#xD;
      of α = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) of Level 3 PSG (compared to Level 1 PSG, the&#xD;
      reference gold standard) will each be estimated and compared to fixed hypothesized rates of&#xD;
      SE and SP of 90% and 60%, respectively, considered sufficiently large enough. Level 1 PSG&#xD;
      (reference) diagnosis of sleep apnea will be made based on AHI ≥ 5. Level 3 PSG (test)&#xD;
      diagnosis will be made based AHI ≥ 5. A cross-tabulation of Level 3 PSG (positive/negative)&#xD;
      versus Level 1 PSG (positive/negative) will be constructed and standard measures of&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy will be estimated along with 95% confidence intervals (i.e., sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy).To test for&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the SE to 90% and the SP to 60%, a non-inferiority threshold of 0.1 is&#xD;
      assumed. If the lower bound on the 95% confidence interval for SE is strictly above 80% and&#xD;
      the lower bound on the confidence interval for SP is strictly above 50% then non-inferiority&#xD;
      of Level 3 PSG (compared to Level 3 PSG) can be established.&#xD;
