  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injuries have become increasingly frequent due mainly to the increase in urban&#xD;
      violence. The growing number of automobile collisions and violence-related events merits&#xD;
      particular attention, as such occurrences can lead to death or disability stemming from a&#xD;
      spinal injury. The severity of the consequences depends on the location affected and degree&#xD;
      of destruction of afferent and efferent spinal cord pathways, with higher, more extensive&#xD;
      injuries leading to less physical fitness and functional independence. Unfortunately, injured&#xD;
      neurons of the central nervous system are unable to regenerate following a spinal injury and&#xD;
      spinal cord regeneration is therefore a major challenge to researchers in the fields of&#xD;
      neuroscience and neurologia. Upon receiving an external stimulus, the central nervous system&#xD;
      is believed to adapt and reorganize itself using mechanisms to compensate for neuronal loss&#xD;
      and promote, even if partially, the remodeling of remaining synaptic connections, leading to&#xD;
      new neuronal sprouting. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has proven to be a possible option for&#xD;
      the stimulation of the repair process in the central nervous system. It is plausible that&#xD;
      this type of therapy can offer the same benefits previously established in other types of&#xD;
      tissues, the stimulation of bone formation, neovascularization and the regeneration of&#xD;
      peripheral nerves. Research groups have investigated the efficacy of LLLT for the treatment&#xD;
      of spinal cord injuries and have demonstrated that laser therapy administered simultaneously&#xD;
      to an injured sciatic nerve and corresponding segment of the spinal cord accelerates the&#xD;
      regeneration process of the injured peripheral nerve.&#xD;

      General objective - Evaluate the effect of LLLT on the sensory-motor response in individuals&#xD;
      having suffered a spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives - Investigate the maintenance of the possible sensory-motor response&#xD;
      through electromyographic analyses conducted before LLLT and as well as one, 15, 30, 45 and&#xD;
      60 days after the intervention; evaluate functional independence and quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals having suffered a spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design - A randomized, controlled, clinical trial is proposed. displays the flowchart&#xD;
      of the development of the study. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the norms&#xD;
      governing research involving human subjects and will be submitted for the approval of the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of University Nove de Julho, São Paulo, Brazil. All participants&#xD;
      or their legal guardians will receive clarifications regarding the objectives and procedures&#xD;
      of the study and those agreeing to participate will sign a statement of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants, interventions and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting - Physical Therapy Clinics of University Nove de Julho, São Paulo, Brazil&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: complete spinal cord injury, cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - The volunteers will be randomly allocated to a control group or treatment&#xD;
      group. Evaluations will be conducted before and after the intervention using electromyography&#xD;
      of the myotome corresponding to the injured spinal nerve root. The treatment group will&#xD;
      receive LLLT following the protocol outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LLLT protocol - Based on Byrnes et al. and Holanda et al., radiance will be administered to&#xD;
      the injury site transcutaneously at a wavelength of 808 nm using a Twin Flex Evolution diode&#xD;
      laser (MMO Equipamento Opto-Eletronicos, Brazil). Twelve sessions will be held (three per&#xD;
      week over four weeks). The dose administered to the surface of the skin will be 983 J/cm2 per&#xD;
      session, with a treatment area of 4.72 W/cm² and total radiant energy of 25 J.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the literature, this dose is capable of enhancing functional recovery following&#xD;
      an injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Individuals will be recruited from the physical therapy clinics of University&#xD;
      Nove de Julho (São Paulo, Brazil) as well as spinal injury associations, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Assignment of interventions (for controlled trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence generation The individuals will be allocated to the different groups based on&#xD;
      numbers randomly generated by a computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment mechanism Allocation will be concealed with the use of sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes. Each envelope will be numbered on the outside and will contain the name of a&#xD;
      participant on the inside. The envelopes will be randomly selected using a computer program,&#xD;
      with the formation of the control group first, followed by the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation The volunteers will be enrolled in the research project of MSc. Fernanda&#xD;
      Cordeiro da Silva and the envelopes will be prepared by researcher Paulo Roberto da Costa&#xD;
      Palácio. Dr. Sandra Kalil Bussadori will head the project and will run the computer program&#xD;
      for the random allocation of the volunteers to the different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding - There will be no blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collection, management and analysis The data will be tabulated and treated&#xD;
      using the SPSS 20.0 program for WindowsTM. The data will be submitted to descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be used to establish&#xD;
      the associations of the categorical variables. The Student's t-test will be used for the&#xD;
      comparison of mean electromyographic signals. Pearson's correlation coefficients will be&#xD;
      calculated for the analysis of the correlation of the continuous variables. The level of&#xD;
      significance will be 95% (p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval - The trial will be conducted in compliance with the norms governing&#xD;
      research involving human subjects and will be submitted for the approval of the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board of University Nove de Julho, São Paulo, Brazil. All participants or their legal&#xD;
      guardians will receive clarifications regarding the objectives and procedures of the study&#xD;
      and those agreeing to participate will sign a statement of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent or assent - Researchers MSc. Fernanda Cordeiro da Silva and Paulo Roberto da Costa&#xD;
      Palácio will present and explain the statement of informed consent to each volunteer. All&#xD;
      participants will be informed with regard to the voluntary nature of participation and the&#xD;
      possibility of withdrawing from the study at any time with no negative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality - All data collected from the volunteers during the evaluations and&#xD;
      treatments will be stored a hard drive to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declaration of interests - The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Access to data -&#xD;
      Only the researchers directly involved in the study will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary and post-trial care - At the end of the study, all volunteers allocated to the&#xD;
      control group will receive LLLT with the same protocol administered to the treatment group to&#xD;
      avoid any inequality regarding treatment among the individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination policy - The findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at&#xD;
      conferences on the application of laser therapy and treatment for individuals with spinal&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
