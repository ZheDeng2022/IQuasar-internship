  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of vented base bottles on respiration-swallow&#xD;
      patterns and on gastroesophageal refluxes in preterm infants with clinical suspect of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this crossover-randomized study, we compared the effects of standard feeding bottles (A)&#xD;
      versus vented base feeding bottles (B) on a group of patients with at least 2 clinical GERD&#xD;
      symptoms. 24 hours of synchronized cardiorespiratory (CR) and Esophageal Multichannel&#xD;
      intraluminal impedance (MII/pH) monitoring were evaluated for each patient. During this&#xD;
      period, patients were fed alternatively with feeding bottle A and B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants a deficit of both coordination and gastro-intestinal motility is often the&#xD;
      underpinning cause of oxygen desaturations and gastro-esophageal reflux. Breastfeeding&#xD;
      enhances the maturation of the respiration-swallow mechanism. For this reason, a feeding&#xD;
      bottle that best recreates the physiological sucking from the maternal breast is highly&#xD;
      desirable in non-breastfed newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: newborns referred to esophageal Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance and pH-metry&#xD;
      (MII/pH) combined with cardiorespiratory (CR) monitoring for GERD or cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: we compare the effects of traditional feeding bottles (A) versus&#xD;
      vented base feeding bottles (B) on cardiorespiratory and reflux events in newborns undergoing&#xD;
      24 hours synchronized CR and MII/pH monitoring. During the exam, newborns are fed,&#xD;
      alternatively, by feeding bottle A and B with human milk or formula. Some training meals are&#xD;
      offered the day before monitoring to get newborns enrolled into the study used to vented base&#xD;
      feeding bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory monitoring is performed through VitaGuard VG3100® (Getemed Medizin- und&#xD;
      Informationstechnik AG, Teltow, Germany) based on Masimo Signal Extraction Technology (SET)®&#xD;
      (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA). It operates with a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) detector,&#xD;
      placed on the right wrist, and 3 thoracic electrodes. This instrument is able to record ECG,&#xD;
      heart rate, SpO2 and thoracic plethysmographic curve. The signals are analyzed with VitaWin&#xD;
      3® software (Getemed Medizin - und Informationstechnik AG, Teltow, Germany), by filtering&#xD;
      artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MII/pH monitoring is performed through a neonatal catheter (Infant Comfort TEC®) with 7&#xD;
      impedence electrodes (creating 6 impedance channels) and one pH detector able to cover the&#xD;
      whole distance from the pharynx to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) (channel 1). The pH&#xD;
      detector is placed within channel 1, 1.5 cm above the LES. The correct positioning of the&#xD;
      catheter is measured through fluoroscopy and eventually corrected. Data obtained from&#xD;
      impedance channels that result proximal to the superior esophageal sphincter are excluded&#xD;
      from the analysis. The acquisition and recording of MII/pH data are performed through Sleuth&#xD;
      System, Sandhill Scientific Inc., Highlands Ranch, Colorado, USA. The analysis of MII/pH&#xD;
      tracings is made visually by a single operator using BioView 5.3.4 software (Sleuth System,&#xD;
      Sandhill Scientific Inc., Highlands Ranch, Colorado, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables analyzed are listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  feeding time (min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  feeding total volume (mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  n. GER during feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  n. GER in the post-prandial period (150 min after feeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of apnea, desaturation and bradycardia during feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of apnea, desaturation and bradycardia during post-prandial period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean duration of apnea during feeding and post-prandial period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean and minimum desaturation level during feeding and post-prandial period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean and minimum heart rate during feeding and post-prandial period&#xD;
&#xD;
      MII/pH variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swallow frequency during feeding and post-prandial period (events/h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Presence Time (BPT): seconds between bolus entry and bolus exit in the distal&#xD;
           channel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Head Advancing Time (BHAT): seconds between bolus entry in proximal channel and&#xD;
           entry in distal channel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Head Advancing Time Corrected for Esophageal Length (BHATc): BHAT corrected for&#xD;
           esophageal length (BHATc = BHAT / esophageal length)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux pH: minimum pH value registered during each GER event. It classifies refluxes&#xD;
           into 3 different types: acid (pH &lt; 4), weakly acid (pH 4-7) and weakly alkaline (pH &gt; 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GER frequency, (events/h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Clearance Time (BCT): reflux duration, recorded at distal channel (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Reflux Extent (BRE), (n. channels)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proximal GER frequency (events/h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus Exposure Index (BEI): percentage of time in which GER involves esophagus during&#xD;
           MII/pH monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux Index (RI): percentage of time during which pH falls below 4 during MII/pH&#xD;
           monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: the alternate use of feeding bottles A and B is set by a binary random&#xD;
      sequencing generated by Microsoft Office Excel software that indicates the first feeding&#xD;
      bottle to be used. This is a single-blind study since the sequence is unknown to the&#xD;
      specialist in charge of reporting MII/pH and CR monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis is made with Statistical Software Package For Windows® (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa,&#xD;
      Oklahoma, USA). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and exploratory data analysis are used to define&#xD;
      normality range. Data will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), or as median and&#xD;
      interquartile range if more appropriate. Differences among cardiorespiratory and MII/pH&#xD;
      variables will be evaluated with Student paired T test or Wilcoxon test if more appropriate.&#xD;
      Significance will be considered as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
