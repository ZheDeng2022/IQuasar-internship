      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The common varicella-zoster virus causes both chickenpox and shingles. Both diseases&#xD;
           cause rashes, but they can also have complications such as bacterial infections of the&#xD;
           skin, pneumonia, or eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By drawing and studying blood samples from people who have been infected with the&#xD;
           varicella-zoster virus or who are receiving or have received the varicella vaccine,&#xD;
           researchers hope to learn more about the immune system s response to the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the immune system s response to the varicella virus, either in its existing&#xD;
      form or given as part of a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 18 years of age and older who have had or are receiving the varicella&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 5 years of age and older who currently have chickenpox or shingles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center for an initial physical examination, and&#xD;
           will provide blood samples for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will determine the number of samples to be taken and the amount of blood to&#xD;
           be drawn as needed based on the participants medical history and exposure to the&#xD;
           varicella-zoster virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators in this study will not be giving subjects either the chickenpox or shingles&#xD;
      vaccine. They will only be looking at the response to the vaccine in persons who are&#xD;
      receiving or have received the vaccine from their health care provider.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). Antibody is&#xD;
      important for control of varicella as evidenced by the role of varicella immune globulin in&#xD;
      limiting the severity of disease in immunocompromised persons. Limited information is&#xD;
      available regarding the individual viral proteins to which antibodies are produced during&#xD;
      primary infection with VZV or after vaccination. Furthermore, commercially available tests to&#xD;
      determine seropositivity to VZV after vaccination have limited sensitivity, and improved&#xD;
      assays are needed. We will obtain blood from persons with varicella, zoster, and those&#xD;
      vaccinated with the varicella (not zoster) vaccine at the NIH Clinical Center and measure&#xD;
      immune responses against specific viral proteins, look for virus in the blood, and in some&#xD;
      cases measure immune responses against cellular proteins over time. Elucidation of these&#xD;
      responses might help to develop more sensitive assays for VZV seropositivity after&#xD;
      vaccination and determine how the varicella vaccine protects against varicella.&#xD;
