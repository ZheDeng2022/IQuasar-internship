      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and accuracy of the IVBG System (the&#xD;
      &quot;System&quot;) when used to track blood glucose in insulin treated subjects with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      in an in-clinic setting for up to 72 hours (per subject). Reference blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements will be collected across the entire reportable range of the System (e.g., 40 400&#xD;
      mg/dL) with adequate sampling at the upper and lower ends of this range. IVBG System accuracy&#xD;
      will primarily be assessed relative to ISO 15197 criteria (i.e., within ±15 mg/dL at YSI&#xD;
      glucose levels &lt; 75 mg/dL, and within ±20% at YSI glucose levels &gt;75 mg/dL).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing to participate in one 72-hour in-clinic session during which up to 72 venous&#xD;
             blood samples drawn for YSI measurement of glucose concentration (maximum sampling&#xD;
             frequency of 4 per hour), a fingerstick blood glucose measurement will also be&#xD;
             performed at the time of each YSI blood draw;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If instructed, be willing not to perform any activities that would result in&#xD;
             submersion of the Sensor/Potentiostat in water or willing to wear a waterproof&#xD;
             covering when submerging the Sensor/Potentiostat;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have been diagnosed with insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus and are on multiple daily&#xD;
             injections (MDI) or Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) insulin therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to speak, read, and write English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have skin conditions or existing (or planned) medical instrumentation and/or dressings&#xD;
             that preclude wearing the IVBG Sensor (e.g., extensive psoriasis, recent burns or&#xD;
             severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive scarring, extensive tattoos, dermatitis&#xD;
             herpetiformis, or surgical dressings at the proposed wear site);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are pregnant (as demonstrated by a positive pregnancy test within 72-hours of device&#xD;
             insertion);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a contraindication to placement of a dedicated peripheral IV line;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a known history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current participation in another investigational study protocol (if a subject has&#xD;
             recently completed participation in another drug study, the subject must have&#xD;
             completed that study at least 30 days prior to being enrolled in this study);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with&#xD;
             their participation in the trial or pose an excessive risk to study staff handling&#xD;
             venous blood samples (e.g., known history of hepatitis B or C).&#xD;
