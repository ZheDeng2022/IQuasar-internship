    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AVN944 is an experimental cancer treatment drug, not yet approved by the U.S. Food and&#xD;
           Drug Administration. To date, AVN944 as a single drug has been tested in several studies&#xD;
           involving humans, including healthy volunteers, patients with leukemia, and patients&#xD;
           with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of AVN944.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of AVN944.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause&#xD;
           unacceptable side effects) of AVN944.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if AVN944 has any effect on patients' tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how the body breaks down AVN944.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who have advanced stage solid tumors for which&#xD;
           standard therapies do not exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a screening visit and five clinic visits during the first&#xD;
           treatment cycle. Additional treatment cycles will involve two clinic visits during each&#xD;
           28-day cycle. After participation in the study ends, patients will be asked to return&#xD;
           within 28 days after the last dose of study drug for final study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations before the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test&#xD;
           for women who can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about medications and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease evaluation with CT, chest x-ray, and additional laboratory tests depending on&#xD;
           the type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will have blood samples taken at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will take specific doses of AVN994 as directed by researchers, and will be&#xD;
           asked to keep a diary to record their doses and any side effects. They will be monitored&#xD;
           with frequent blood draws at each study visit to provide information on the safety and&#xD;
           effectiveness of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During different cycles, patients will have their disease evaluated by researchers and&#xD;
           will be asked if they wish to continue taking AVN994 as part of the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate limiting step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides is catalyzed by the&#xD;
           enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and so inhibition of this enzyme will&#xD;
           result in depletion of guanine nucleotide pools, cessation of DNA synthesis, cell cycle&#xD;
           block at the Gr(1)/S interface and interference with cell division.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reduction in guanine nucleotide pools interferes with the ability of G-coupled&#xD;
           proteins to act as intracellular signal transducers. IMPDH inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AVN944 is a small-molecule, uncompetitive inhibitor of cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase I study in patients with hematologic malignancies is active and accruing&#xD;
           subjects. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached and no pattern of&#xD;
           organ-specific or dose-progressive toxicity has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose limiting toxicities with AVN944 in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MTD with AVN944 in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of AVN944 by study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent of IMPDH inhibition on tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
           (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of AVN944 on tumors by measuring guanine nucleotide pools levels using&#xD;
           PBMC's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of AVN944 on tumors by analyzing expression of genes related to IMPDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Phase I Trial using 3+3 trail design using starting cohort of 150 mg twice per day&#xD;
           escalating to 750 mg twice per day.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The effects of AVN944 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Age greater than or equal to 18 Years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of AVN944 in patients less than 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received&#xD;
             investigational therapy within 14 days of the first scheduled day of dosing&#xD;
             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no&#xD;
             regulatory authority approved indication). Clinically significant toxicities from this&#xD;
             therapy must have resolved to less than Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known active brain metastases or other CNS involvement with less than 6&#xD;
             months since curative-intent treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients receiving growth factors&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior treatment with an IMPDH-inhibitor e.g. Mycophenolate Mofetil, &amp; Tiazofurin&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled current illness requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
             within the past 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AVN944 agent has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             AVN944, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AVN944.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of solid organ transplant and are on IMPDH inhibitors (mycophenolate mofetil)&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HIV-positive patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The following medications and/or treatments are not permitted during the trial (i.e.,&#xD;
             through completion of the post treatment follow-up) and would constitute exclusion&#xD;
             from the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other investigational treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any hormonal therapy except GnRH agonists / antagonists for patients with&#xD;
                  prostate cancer or medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
