      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumors depend on blood vessels to provide the nourishment that allows them to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are among the&#xD;
           tumors that contain the most blood vessels. Thus, endocrine tumors are important for the&#xD;
           study of new blood vessel formation in tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To obtain tissues from endocrine tumors for examination to determine how they differ from&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients who are scheduled for surgery to remove an endocrine tumor, those in or around the&#xD;
      thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland, pancreas, or any neuroendocrine tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissues will be obtained from patients during surgery to remove thyroid, parathyroid,&#xD;
           adrenal, pancreas, or neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 400 patients will be enrolled in the study over a period of 5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endocrine neoplasms are among the fastest growing tumors in incidence in the United&#xD;
           States. Between 1995 and 2005, the incidence of thyroid carcinoma has increased 98&#xD;
           percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumors of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors&#xD;
           are among some of the most highly vascularized tumors seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consequently, endocrine neoplasms provide an extremely important model for the study of&#xD;
           tumor angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Tumor Angiogenesis Section of the Surgery Branch, NCI has a focus on studying&#xD;
           neovascular formation in neoplastic tissues. In addition, this section has primary&#xD;
           responsibility for providing endocrine surgery consultative services to the NIH. As&#xD;
           such, our Section is uniquely positioned to acquire and perform important studies on&#xD;
           endocrine tissue to help advance our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in tumor&#xD;
           vessel development. The majority of the patients enrolled on this study will be patients&#xD;
           on other protocols throughout the NIH, for which our Section is consulted in order to&#xD;
           perform their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To develop a class predictor model based on gene expression patterns to distinguish benign&#xD;
      from neoplastic endocrine tissue for each of the endocrine histologies under study. This&#xD;
      objective will drive the statistical endpoints of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To utilize the tissue obtained from these endocrine neoplasms for studies of gene&#xD;
           expression changes, proteomic changes, and methylation changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform histologic examination of these tissues including immunohistochemistry and in&#xD;
           situ hybridization in order to study changes in tumor neovessel formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain, when accessible, adjacent normal endocrine tissue for comparison with the&#xD;
           neoplastic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect tissues from endocrine neoplasms arising in the thyroid, parathyroid,&#xD;
           adrenal, pancreas, and extraadrenal neuroendocrine rests for future analysis and&#xD;
           correlation with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with radiographic evidence of, biochemical evidence of, or&#xD;
           histologically/cytologically proven, endocrine neoplasms, including lesions of the&#xD;
           thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, extra-adrenal endocrine rests, paragangliomas,&#xD;
           neuroblastomas and pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable&#xD;
           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of surgical&#xD;
           operation for the removal of neoplasms of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas,&#xD;
           paragangliomas and or extraadrenal rests of neuroendocrine tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue will be processed at the time of collection, stored and then shipped to the PI's&#xD;
           laboratory for further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational therapy will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that 400 patients will be enrolled over a period of 5 years.&#xD;
