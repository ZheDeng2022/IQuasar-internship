      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and immunological response to&#xD;
      the study product, TLI, as an adjuvant therapy in subjects with Stage III Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal cells in the body have an established lifespan. Cancer cells on the other hand have&#xD;
      the ability to continue to divide into new cells indefinitely. More than 85% of cancer has&#xD;
      this ability because of an enzyme found in the cancer cell. The Investigational Product,&#xD;
      Transgenic Lymphocyte Immunization (TLI), is aimed at helping the immune system target this&#xD;
      enzyme found in most cancerous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo a leukapheresis in which&#xD;
      white blood cells will be collected and used to manufacture their own personal study product.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 3 infusions of TLI roughly 1 month apart and will be followed over a 2&#xD;
      year period with routine laboratory draws, computed tomography (CT) scans and physical exams.&#xD;
