      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent is the process by which prospective participants in clinical trials&#xD;
           learn about clinical research in order to decide whether they want to enroll in the&#xD;
           study. It consists of meetings and discussions with the health care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I clinical trials are designed to determine what dose of an investigational agent&#xD;
           is safe to administer to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study communication, comprehension and decision-making during the informed consent&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine ethical, psychological, social, and educational issues regarding informed&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To help researchers understand how to improve informed consent and education about&#xD;
           clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents or guardians of children with cancer who are being considered for participation&#xD;
           in phase I clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective patients for pediatric phase I clinical trials who are between 14 and 21&#xD;
           years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Members of the research team who obtain consent from patients and families for pediatric&#xD;
           phase I clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research assistants observe and record the informed consent conference held with the&#xD;
           research team and the parents and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the conference, the research assistant interviews the parents in a private area&#xD;
           about their experience during the conference and their decision-making process. They are&#xD;
           asked about their thoughts and opinions during the informed consent conference,&#xD;
           including the decision-making process, communication and trust in the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With their parent's permission, patients are interviewed privately to discuss their&#xD;
           experience during the informed consent conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After parents and patients have made their decision about participation in the study,&#xD;
           they are interviewed again about how they made the decision, aspects of the&#xD;
           communication during the conference, and how they feel about the doctor. This interview&#xD;
           is also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents may be contacted 6 months to 2 years from the time of their participation to be&#xD;
           part of a parent advisory group about the informed consent process.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical course and poor prognosis of children and adolescents eligible for&#xD;
           pediatric phase I trials may increase the vulnerability of patients and their families&#xD;
           and confound informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physicians report a tension between presenting reasonable options and a truthful&#xD;
           prognosis while maintaining hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research on the communication and decisions regarding participation in pediatric phase I&#xD;
           trial is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of this study is to understand communication, comprehension, and&#xD;
           decision-making in Phase I childhood cancer trials (Specific Aim 1) by examining:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The way that phase I pediatric trials are presented (Aim 1 Hypothesis 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whether and how alternatives (such as hospice) are introduced (Aim 1 Hypothesis 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What parents and children older than 14 years understand after the consent&#xD;
                discussion (Aim 1 Hypothesis 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How the communication process influences parental comprehension and decision-making&#xD;
                regarding participation of their child in a phase I study (Aim 1 Hypothesis 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How clinician-investigator perspectives may vary from that of the parent of a child&#xD;
                participating in a phase I study (Aim 1 Hypothesis 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare Phase I vs. Phase III pediatric cancer informed consent (Specific Aim 2)&#xD;
           regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parental understanding of the scientific goals of the trial (Aim 2 Hypothesis 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trust, decision making preferences, strength of recommendation by investigators&#xD;
                interactivity as measured by number of parental questions, reasons for decisions,&#xD;
                child's involvement, reading consent document, parental understanding of choice and&#xD;
                trial design/purpose, disclosure of prognosis (Aim 2 Hypothesis 1-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Develop suggestions for interventions to improve informed consent in Phase I&#xD;
                pediatric cancer trials through Parent Advisory Group on Informed Consent&#xD;
                (PAGIC).(Specific Aim 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents or guardians of children and adolescents considering enrollment on Phase I&#xD;
           Trials of anti-cancer agents, gene transfer or vaccine studies are eligible if the child&#xD;
           or adolescent is less than 22yrs with diagnosed with a recurrent or refractory malignant&#xD;
           solid tumor or leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must speak English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents or guardians of children or adolescents who are newly diagnosed with cancer or&#xD;
           previously participated in informed consent research are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, we plan to interview a smaller number of patients who are 14-21 years of&#xD;
           age and who have participated in an informed consent conference for a Phase I cancer&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents (n=132) of children or adolescents (age less than or equal to 21 years) who are&#xD;
           being offered participation in a Phase I clinical trial for cancer will be sequentially&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The methods will include direct observation, digital recording of ICC, and&#xD;
           questionnaires of parent/guardian, patients, and health care team members. Research&#xD;
           Assistants (RAs) will be trained to observe and record all interactions between families&#xD;
           and clinicians that relate to the Phase I clinical trial. Children over 14 years old&#xD;
           will be interviewed using a separate instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be analyzed by quantitative and qualitative analytic methods. To assure 120&#xD;
           cases for analysis, the total accrual is 132 cases at six institutions, up to 100 will&#xD;
           be accrued at the NCI.&#xD;
