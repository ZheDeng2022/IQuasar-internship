  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric solid tumors (Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma) are often&#xD;
           difficult to cure with standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune therapy using an experimental vaccine made from proteins from the patient's tumor&#xD;
           cells may boost the body's immune response against the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of chemotherapy on the immune system can potentially make immunotherapy more&#xD;
           effective if administered soon after completion of chemotherapy. The addition of&#xD;
           recombinant human IL-7 (interleukin 7) (rhIL-7 (recombinant human interleukin 7)) may&#xD;
           make the immunotherapy more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether immune therapy given after immune suppression can help the body fight&#xD;
      the tumor and to determine the safety of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with solid tumors, i.e., Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma whose&#xD;
      disease has recurred after treatment or spread beyond the original site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo tumor biopsy (removal of a piece of tumor tissue) to collect tumor&#xD;
           cells for making a vaccine from proteins in the patient's tumor and apheresis (removal&#xD;
           of a quantity of white blood cells) to collect white cells for re-building the immune&#xD;
           system after immune therapy. Apheresis is repeated three times during immunotherapy&#xD;
           (weeks 8, 14 and 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After receiving standard chemotherapy for their tumor (and an additional course of&#xD;
           fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to further suppress immunity if needed) patients&#xD;
           receive immune therapy in Cohorts A and B. rhIL-7 is given 48 hours before the vaccine,&#xD;
           as an injection under the skin in an extremity that will not be used for the vaccine in&#xD;
           patients in Cohort B only. You will be watched closely for 6 hours after the rhIL-7 for&#xD;
           any signs of reaction. rhIL-7 will be given before vaccine doses #1, #2, #3, and #4. The&#xD;
           vaccine is given at study weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Each vaccine is given as a total&#xD;
           of six separate rhIL-7 followed by injections: three intradermal (like a (tuberculosis)&#xD;
           TB test) on one arm or leg and three subcutaneous (like those for insulin injections for&#xD;
           diabetes). on the other arm or leg. An anesthetic cream may be used to minimize the&#xD;
           discomfort of injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' white cells are returned to them by infusion through a vein on the first day&#xD;
           of immune therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies and immune studies are done at weeks 1, 8 and 20 to determine the&#xD;
           response to treatment on the tumor and on the immune system.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with recurrent or metastatic pediatric solid tumors experience low survival&#xD;
           rates, but using current standard therapies, many patients with these diseases are&#xD;
           rendered into a state of minimal residual disease associated with lymphopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphopenic hosts show augmented immune reactivity, which may be favorable for inducing&#xD;
           antitumor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether Alpha cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) and 8H9 depleted&#xD;
           autologous lymphocytes plus tumor lysate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) pulsed&#xD;
           dendritic cell vaccines plus or minus r-hIL7 (CYT107) can induce immune responses to&#xD;
           tumor lysate in this patient population rendered lymphopenic by cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of administering lymphocytes depleted of cluster of differentiation&#xD;
           4 (CD4) plus CD25plus suppressor T cells plus or minus r-hIL (CYT107 (interleukin 7)) to&#xD;
           lymphopenic hosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic or recurrent pediatric solid tumors of the following&#xD;
           histologies: Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma or neuroblastoma,&#xD;
           synovial cell sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, undifferentiated sarcoma,&#xD;
           embryonal sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have sufficient accessible tumor for biopsy to generate tumor lysate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must meet eligibility criteria upon enrollment and upon completion of standard&#xD;
           therapy prior to administration of immunotherapy as significant time will have elapsed&#xD;
           between the time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunotherapy consists of one autologous lymphocyte infusion depleted of CD25plus&#xD;
           suppressive T cells and depleted of contaminating tumor cells plus 6 sequential tumor&#xD;
           lysate/KLH pulsed dendritic cell vaccines. No cytokine is administered on Arm A and&#xD;
           r-hIL7 (CYT107) is administered on Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for immune responses to tumor lysates using ex vivo assays&#xD;
           and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial uses a one-stage design targeting a response rate of 50 percent. Up to 47&#xD;
           patients will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stopping rules will take effect if excessive toxicity is observed.&#xD;

          -  Multiple recurrences are allowable as long as CD4 count or disease-free intervals have&#xD;
             been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Age/Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  greater than 18 mos. and less than or equal to 35 years at the time of initial&#xD;
             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  greater than 10 kg at the time of apheresis. Patients between 10-15 kg must be&#xD;
             approved by the apheresis unit prior to enrollment on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years old) must sign&#xD;
        a document of informed consent (screening protocol) prior to performing studies to&#xD;
        determine patient eligibility. After confirmation of patient eligibility all patients or&#xD;
        their legal guardians must sign the protocol specific informed consent to document their&#xD;
        understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol&#xD;
        related studies are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine&#xD;
        patient eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Laboratory Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  renal function: creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 or normal age&#xD;
             adjusted serum creatinine (less than or equal to 5 yrs. less than or equal to 0.8&#xD;
             mg/ml; 5-10 yrs. less than or equal to 1.0 mg/ml; 10-15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.2&#xD;
             mg/ml; greater than 15 yrs. less than or equal to 1.5 mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&#xD;
             less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin less than 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hematologic function: platelets greater than 50,000 cells/mcl, hemoglobin (Hgb)&#xD;
             greater than 9.0 gms/dl, prothrombin time (PT) less than 1.5 ULN. Patients may receive&#xD;
             transfusion if necessary to reach the pre-apheresis hematology parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Accessibility of Tissue to Generate Tumor Lysates&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate tumor bulk accessible to biopsy in order to generate the tumor&#xD;
        lysate (at least 2 cm diameter). Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates&#xD;
        will be limited to percutaneous biopsies or open biopsies of readily accessible lesions.&#xD;
        Patients should not undergo biopsies, which will later compromise the ability to render&#xD;
        function preserving local therapy (e.g. limb salvage therapy). To prevent this, all bone&#xD;
        biopsies should be performed in consultation with the orthopedic consultant on the case.&#xD;
        For patients with bone marrow involvement, bone marrow aspirates may be used as a source of&#xD;
        tumor for tumor lysates. Patients are not eligible if, in the opinion of the principal and&#xD;
        associate investigators, tumor biopsy would entail extensive surgery such as thoracotomy or&#xD;
        laparotomy, or if the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk from the biopsy&#xD;
        procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        National Cancer Institute (NCI) Laboratory of Pathology will review all tumor specimens for&#xD;
        diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: for Apheresis/Tumor biopsy portion of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Other conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections,&#xD;
             autoimmunity or organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate&#xD;
             Investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational&#xD;
             agents or are likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allogeneic stem cell or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions related to tumor, which require emergency treatment (airway compression,&#xD;
             spinal cord compression) since enrollment would delay initiation of such therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroids initiated at the time of tumor diagnosis or recurrence for treatment&#xD;
             of nerve compression or other symptoms is permitted during this phase of the trial,&#xD;
             but will not be permitted during the immunotherapy phase, with the exception of a self&#xD;
             limited course of steroids as described in Section 2.1.4.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from cancer are not&#xD;
             excluded provided that the metastatic CNS disease has been effectively treated and&#xD;
             there is no evidence of active CNS disease as evidenced by stable clinical findings&#xD;
             and stable radiographic findings for a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C due&#xD;
             to confounding effects on immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;

        initiation of immunotherapy, all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less&#xD;
        than 18 years old) must sign a second informed consent to document their understanding of&#xD;
        the investigational nature and the risks of this study before any protocol related studies&#xD;
        are performed (other than the studies which were performed to determine patient&#xD;
        eligibility).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ&#xD;
             dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would&#xD;
             compromise the patient's ability to tolerate the investigational agents or are likely&#xD;
             to interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent or progressive cancer following the completion of the standard therapy&#xD;
             phase of the trial will not, in and of itself, preclude receipt of immunotherapy.&#xD;
             However, patients will not receive immunotherapy if they have an Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
             Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status performance status of 3 or 4 or, for children&#xD;
             less than or equal to 10 years of age, Lansky less than or equal to 50 (Appendix III).&#xD;
             Furthermore, patients will be removed from the trial if they develop requirements for&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. radiation therapy) for progressive disease during the&#xD;
             trial as discussed in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C&#xD;
             infection due to confounding effects on immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require chronic daily oral corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted. Also, a time limited course&#xD;
             of steroids does for an unrelated medical condition (e.g. allergic reaction, poison&#xD;
             ivy) will not preclude receipt of immunotherapy provided that two weeks elapse between&#xD;
             the last dose of systemic corticosteroids and initiation of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving other biologic therapies including cytokines or growth&#xD;
             factors not specified by the protocol. Herbal supplements will not result in exclusion&#xD;
             but should be noted and reviewed with the principal investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of CNS metastases from cancer are not excluded provided that&#xD;
             the metastatic CNS disease has been effectively treated and there is no evidence of&#xD;
             active CNS disease as evidenced by stable clinical findings and stable radiographic&#xD;
             findings for a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excluded from Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with history of autoimmune disease (excluding thyroiditis on chronic&#xD;
                  thyroid replacement therapy) or active auto-immune disease, due to a risk of&#xD;
                  exacerbation of autoimmunity with r-hIL7. Patients with a history of B cell&#xD;
                  malignancy due to a risk for growth with rhIL7 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation defined as a QTc greater than or equal&#xD;
                  to 470 ms or a prior history of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or&#xD;
