      To measure and compare pain associated with venipuncture and peripheral intravenous catheter&#xD;
      insertion among pediatric emergency department patients randomized to treatment with one of&#xD;
      three different pain-reduction strategies: J-Tip® jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine,&#xD;
      J-Tip® jet injection of sterile saline, or application of 4% lidocaine topical cream. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that J-Tip® jet injection of 1% buffered lidocaine will provide&#xD;
      superior local anesthesia compared to saline or lidocaine cream.&#xD;

      Background: Venipuncture and PIVC insertion are the most common procedures performed in the&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department. They are painful procedures, and frequently no local&#xD;
      anesthesia is provided. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Pediatric Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine and Section on Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine has recommended that local&#xD;
      anesthesia be provided, but a variety of barriers exist which have prevented implementation&#xD;
      of this recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To measure and compare pain associated with venipuncture and peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous catheter insertion among pediatric emergency department patients randomized to&#xD;
      treatment with one of three different pain-reduction strategies: J-Tip® jet injection of 1%&#xD;
      buffered lidocaine, J-Tip® jet injection of sterile saline, or application of 4% lidocaine&#xD;
      topical cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a partially blinded, placebo controlled, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in the pediatric emergency department. The comparison of J-Tip® jet injection&#xD;
      of 1% buffered lidocaine to J-Tip® jet injection of sterile saline is double blinded, while&#xD;
      the comparison of jet injection to 4% lidocaine topical cream is not blinded. Forty-four&#xD;
      patients per group will be enrolled, and a VAS self-reported measurement will be recorded for&#xD;
      the pain of venipuncture or PIVC insertion following the appropriate treatment. As well,&#xD;
      success of the procedure and complications of treatment will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Pain scores will be analyzed by pairwise comparisons using a t-test and pooled&#xD;
      comparisons using ANOVA. Demographics will be assessed to determine baseline differences&#xD;
      among the three groups. Chi square and regression analysis will be performed on demographic&#xD;
      differences to determine significance if necessary. Final pain results will be reported as&#xD;
      mean, standard deviation, and p-value. Demographics will be reported as number, percent of&#xD;
      patients, and p-value (if a difference exists).&#xD;
