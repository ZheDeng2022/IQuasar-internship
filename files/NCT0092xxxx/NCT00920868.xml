  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to find the highest tolerated dose of the study drugs:&#xD;
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and dasatinib given in combination to subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. This will occur in the first part of the study (Phase I). Once this&#xD;
      dose has been determined, it will be given to subjects with advanced metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer in the second part of the study (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By giving these drugs in combination, researchers hope to evaluate the side effects of the&#xD;
      study drugs in both groups, and to determine if this combination could possibly decrease or&#xD;
      stabilize the cancer being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) and Rocky Mountain Cancer&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After satisfying eligibility and screening criteria, patients will be treated on 21 day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine (Xeloda™) is an oral (taken by mouth) chemotherapy drug in tablet form made&#xD;
           by Roche Laboratories Inc. Capecitabine has been approved for use by the Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) for first line treatment (treatment that should be used for cancer&#xD;
           that has not been treated yet) of metastatic colorectal cancer and also for metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin™) is an intravenous (given by injection into a vein) chemotherapy&#xD;
           drug made by Sanofi-Synthélabo. This drug is also approved by the FDA for use in&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab (Avastin™) is a type of intravenous cancer treatment called anti-angiogenic&#xD;
           therapy (a type of therapy to treat cancer that interferes with blood flow to the tumor,&#xD;
           thereby stopping tumor growth, and possibly leading to tumor shrinkage) made by&#xD;
           Genentech Inc. Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA for first line treatment of metastatic&#xD;
           colorectal cancer in combination with other chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dasatinib (Sprycel™) is an oral drug made by Bristol Myers Squib, Inc (BMS). Dasatinib&#xD;
           is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute&#xD;
           lymphoblastic leukemia or for patients that are resistant to a medicine called imatinib&#xD;
           mesylate (Gleevec™ ).&#xD;
