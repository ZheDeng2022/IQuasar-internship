      Study summary: &quot;Liver transplantation and the reticuloendothelial clearance capacity.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of liver transplantation on the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve the taking of a number of observations but does not involve any&#xD;
      treatment, which differs from normal care. Indications for transplantation are solely based&#xD;
      on the best clinical practice, which is usually performed at the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study measures liver function based on the clearance of different &quot;marker&quot; substances by&#xD;
      the liver. These substances are given intravenously and their clearance will be measured from&#xD;
      bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All substances used in this study are registered in the United Kingdom for clinical&#xD;
      applications and already used in clinical practice over years. They are safe and without any&#xD;
      risk to harm individuals under study. Furthermore no side effects or any symptoms caused by&#xD;
      the administration of these substances are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of liver function are undertaken before transplantation, 1 and 7 days following&#xD;
      the transplant. There is no restriction from any of the patient's prescribed medication. All&#xD;
      blood samples will be removed from the cannula (drip) and will not require repeated&#xD;
      injections. It is hoped that this research will lead to a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      effects of liver transplantation on the immune system.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver cells called hepatocytes undertake the most important metabolic functions of the liver.&#xD;
      The liver also contains a large number of immune cells called Kupffer cells. These cells act&#xD;
      as a filter removing bacteria and other dangerous substances from the blood passing through&#xD;
      the liver. Although we know and understand a great deal about how liver cells behave and&#xD;
      function after transplant we have no idea what happens to the immune cells in the liver.&#xD;
      These immune cells make up 85% of the total body reserves of these cells and serve an&#xD;
      important function by clearing bacteria and bacterial products from the blood. A failure of&#xD;
      these cells is associated with risk of infection. Infections, blood clotting disorders and&#xD;
      many other serious medical issues are typical for patients suffering from chronic liver&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use microscopic particles of a human protein called albumin in the form of&#xD;
      microspheres to simulate bacteria in the blood. We can detect these microspheres by attaching&#xD;
      a radioactive label to the spheres and measuring emission in a detector called a gamma&#xD;
      counter. The level of radiation is quite small and similar to a bone scan. We have previously&#xD;
      shown that healthy liver rapidly clears these albumin microspheres from the blood. We have&#xD;
      also shown previously that after major liver surgery there is a delay in clearance of&#xD;
      microspheres, which we believe equates to a poorly functioning innate immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplantation is the only successful life-extending treatment for patients with&#xD;
      chronic liver failure and cirrhosis. During liver transplantation it is known that a&#xD;
      proportion of hepatocytes damaged and recover following the transplant. We want to establish&#xD;
      the immediate particulate clearance capacity of the liver following transplantation and the&#xD;
      pattern of recovery one week later. This is used as a surrogate for liver clearance of&#xD;
      bacteria and bacterial products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also intend to measure the production of a set of proteins called acute phase proteins,&#xD;
      which are produced by the liver and may be important in helping immune cells recognize&#xD;
      bacteria. These proteins, also called opsonins, bind to the walls of bacteria and make it&#xD;
      easier for immune cells to attach to the bacteria and eat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to find out if there is any difference between non-marginal and marginal liver&#xD;
      grafts and their reticuloendothelial clearance capacity. This study may provide important&#xD;
      information regarding the need for post-operative antibiotics and prevention of infection in&#xD;
      this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be the first of its kind to address this issue in this vulnerable group of&#xD;
      patients and no study has ever looked at the effect of transplantation on the immune cells of&#xD;
      the liver. This study will investigate the ability of the liver to clear particles (albumin&#xD;
      microspheres) from the blood and will monitor the recover and improvement in function of&#xD;
      these cells over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of any pilot studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study also from the eLISTER group (Edinburgh liver injury in surgery and transplantation&#xD;
      experimental research) about the effect of major liver resection on innate immunity to&#xD;
      bacterial endotoxin was approved by Lothian research Ethics Committee LREC/2002/1/31. This&#xD;
      trial was performed between May 2003 and 2005. This study looked at the adaptive response of&#xD;
      the reticuloendothelial system to major liver resection. We found a strong correlation&#xD;
      between clearance of albumin microspheres and ICG (indocyanine green clearance), supporting&#xD;
      the assertion that hepatocellular function and RES phagocytosis are related if only in terms&#xD;
      of liver volume. We also demonstrated marked defects in RES phagocytosis in patients with&#xD;
      chronic liver disease or normal liver function, who had undergone a major liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of technique of measurement of phagocytic clearance of Tc-99m labelled (NanocollÂ®)&#xD;
      microaggregated human albumin To determine reticuloendothelial system (RES) phagocytosis&#xD;
      activity and liver phagocytic function respectively we will measure plasma clearance of 99mTc&#xD;
      labelled micro-aggregated human albumin without any imaging studies. It has been shown in&#xD;
      several studies that this is a reliable method to estimate RES phagocytosis activity. By&#xD;
      measuring the plasma radioactivity disappearance rate instead of doing imaging studies a&#xD;
      radioactivity dose of less than 15 MBq is sufficient to determine 99mTc plasma clearance&#xD;
      accurately. Disappearance of 99mTc blood activity will be measured serially at 3-minutes&#xD;
      intervals to 30 minutes, at 10-minutes intervals to 60 minutes and at 20-minutes intervals to&#xD;
      120 minutes. Three half-life times required for the 99mTc albumin microspheres counting rate&#xD;
      to fall from 100% to 50%, from 50% to 25% and from 25% to 12.5% of the value obtained at&#xD;
      three minutes after injection are noted and the mean half-life and standard deviation,&#xD;
      expressing the microspheres blood clearance, is calculated. To determine the possibly&#xD;
      non-linear nature of albumin microspheres clearance over time the area under the curve will&#xD;
      be calculated over the observation time using integral function. Mean half-life of albumin&#xD;
      microspheres in the blood and area under the curve at day 1 and day 7 after transplantation&#xD;
      will be expressed as a percentage of preoperative values and compared between individuals and&#xD;
      patient groups. We hypothesize that the phagocytosis activity of marginal compared to good&#xD;
      liver grafts is significantly impaired after liver transplantation due to the decreased&#xD;
      number of phagocytes as well as due to the decreased synthesis of substances which usually&#xD;
      facilitates phagocytosis. If this hypothesis is true, the RES phagocytosis activity in the&#xD;
      marginal grafts should be significantly increased after liver transplantation and should be&#xD;
      comparable to the RES phagocytosis activity of non-marginal grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will test the hypothesis that liver transplantation of normal and marginal&#xD;
      grafts results in a significant impairment of innate immunity to bacterial endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to characterise the nature or reticuloendothelial clearance impairment following&#xD;
      liver transplantation and its recovery on marginal and non-marginal grafts. We also wish to&#xD;
      correlate clearance capacity with measures of hepatocyte injury (ALT/AST) and liver&#xD;
      dysfunction score to establish whether the two processes are independent or related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard we will compare marginal and non-marginal organs and the relationship between&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial cell dysfunction and cold ischemic time. Reticuloendothelial clearance&#xD;
      capacity will also be related to evidence of clinical infection in the postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions - Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Liver transplantation results in a significant impairment of innate immunity to bacterial&#xD;
      endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The degree of impairment in innate immunity to endotoxin is directly related to the&#xD;
      functional status of the liver graft. (Patients undergoing liver transplantation with&#xD;
      non-marginal and marginal grafts will be compared).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish whether there is any correlation between liver cell (hepatocyte) injury and&#xD;
      immune cell (Kupffer cell) injury after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To establish the effect of liver transplantation on serum expression of acute phase&#xD;
      protein opsonins.&#xD;
