      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study method achieves lower requirement for medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study method increases overall cecal intubation with comparable assessment of current&#xD;
           experience and patient willingness to repeat future colonoscopy compared with&#xD;
           conventional colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study method results in reduction in medication-related (cardiorespiratory)&#xD;
           complications, faster turn around of patients, compared with conventional colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study method improves bowel preparation and increases polyp pickup rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for the high and the low risk healthy asymptomatic VA&#xD;
      patients is being promoted (VHA directive). Compliance with this Directive will result in an&#xD;
      increased number of VA patients undergoing colonoscopy. The demand for colonoscopy far&#xD;
      exceeds the capacity available to perform the procedure in the VA system. The conventional&#xD;
      practice for colonoscopy at VA facilities across the country is to perform colonoscopy under&#xD;
      conscious sedation with air insufflation. Efficiency is governed by the fact that sedated&#xD;
      patients require time and space for recovery and these are major limiting factors in the&#xD;
      current setting for the use of colonoscopy for CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods that maintain a high success rate and good patient assessment improve overall&#xD;
      compliance for surveillance colonoscopy. Our preliminary experience showed that patients are&#xD;
      able to complete successful colonoscopy without sedation in 52% of cases when colonoscopy was&#xD;
      aided by a water infusion in lieu of air insufflation method. In this group of patients, the&#xD;
      shortened recovery time means a quick turn around of patient and a more efficient endoscopy&#xD;
      service. Patients are able to communicate better with the staff and physician regarding their&#xD;
      problem and discharge instructions, and not subjected to the amnesic effect of sedation. Next&#xD;
      day follow-up of patient by telephone contact which requires commitment of staff time can be&#xD;
      obviated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this randomized study confirms the success of our preliminary findings and this technique&#xD;
      is adopted by more endoscopists, a larger number of VA patients may benefit from less&#xD;
      sedation complications and at the same time allow for more efficient colonoscopy screening&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
