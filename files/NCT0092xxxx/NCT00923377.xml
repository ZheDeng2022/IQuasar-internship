      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research suggests that breast cancers may arise from a population of stem cells in the&#xD;
           normal mammary gland that produce clones of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are now trying to determine what events may initiate the formation of cancer&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for and describe breast stem cells from normal breast tissue from women who do&#xD;
           not have breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the breast stem cells between women at increased risk for breast cancer and&#xD;
           women at average risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show a relationship between the number and type of breast stem cells with the density&#xD;
           (appearance) of the mammogram (breast x-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To make cell cultures (grow cells under controlled conditions) from the breast stem&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Women 18 years of age and older who are at average or increased risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a health history questionnaire, family history questionnaire and risk&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have a mammogram and breast biopsy (surgical removal of a sample of breast&#xD;
           tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who can become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging models of breast cancer suggest that breast cancers arise from a population of stem&#xD;
      cells that are present in the normal mammary gland. The stem cell produces a clone of cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are now attempting to isolate and characterize breast stem cells and determine&#xD;
      what events may initiate the tumorigenic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and characterize breast stem cells from normal breast tissue from women who are&#xD;
      free of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare characteristics of breast stem cells between women at increased risk for breast&#xD;
      cancer and women at average risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate breast stem cell number or characteristics with mammographic density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish cell cultures of breast stem cells from women at increased risk for breast&#xD;
      cancer and women at average risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are at average or increased risk for breast cancer and over age 18 will be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot tissue acquisition trial. Breast biopsies will be obtained from all subjects&#xD;
      and breast cancer risk demographics will be collected at one time point. We aim to enroll 20&#xD;
      average risk and 20 increased risk women.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No abnormal findings in the breast by physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Average Risk: must meet all criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gail model index of less than 1.7% over next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claus model lifetime risk less than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BRCAPro and Couch model less than 10% of being a BRCA mutation carrier OR tested&#xD;
             negative for documented deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Increased risk for invasive breast cancer by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gail Model risk of greater than 1.7% over 5 years from study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claus model lifetime risk to age 79 greater than or equal to 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of high risk pathologic lesion: lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical&#xD;
             hyperplasia, DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2, PTEN or P53.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 10% chance of carrying BRCA1/2 gene mutation as assessed by&#xD;
             BRCAPro and Couch model (22, 23). If a woman has a 20% risk of carrying a BRCA1/2&#xD;
             mutation by either model, she will meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;

        evidence of disease at time of enrollment AND no history of cancer directed treatment in&#xD;
        the 3 months preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

        by the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;

        allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chemotherapy and radiation within 3 months prior to breast biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breastfeeding within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy (determined by urine dipstick).&#xD;
