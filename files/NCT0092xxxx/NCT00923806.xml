  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein present mostly in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with cancer uses blood cells&#xD;
           found in their tumors or bloodstream. These cells are genetically modified using the&#xD;
           anti-CEA gene and a type of virus. The modified cells (anti-CEA cells) are grown in the&#xD;
           laboratory and then given back to the patient to try to decrease the size of the tumors.&#xD;
           This is called gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether advanced cancers that that express the CEA antigen can be treated&#xD;
           effectively with lymphocytes (white blood cells) that have been genetically engineered&#xD;
           to contain an anti-CEA protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread beyond&#xD;
           the original site) and for whom standard treatments are not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' tumors express the CEA antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have the human leukocyte (HLA-A*0201) antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Workup with scans, x-rays and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis to obtain cells for preparing the anti-CEA cells for later infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-CEA cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infusion of anti-CEA cells, followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment. The cells are&#xD;
           given as an infusion through a vein. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a&#xD;
           vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-2 weeks of recovery from the effects of chemotherapy and IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination,&#xD;
           review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both the alpha and beta&#xD;
           chains of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),&#xD;
           which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency (greater&#xD;
           than 30%) without the need to perform any selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A2 and CEA positive tumors, anti-CEA TCR transduced T cells&#xD;
           secreted significant amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-CEA TCR engineered peripheral blood&#xD;
           lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen and&#xD;
           aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the administration of anti-CEA TCR engineered peripheral blood&#xD;
           lymphocytes and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid&#xD;
           depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic cancer that expresses CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metastatic cancer whose tumors express the CEA antigen where the life limiting component&#xD;
           of the disease is hepatic metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred to standard care for&#xD;
           metastatic disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5&#xD;
           times 10(9) cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin&#xD;
           in order to stimulate T-cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 times 10(8) cells to&#xD;
           retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CEA TCR genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous (IV) infusion of&#xD;
           ex vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h&#xD;
           for a maximum of 15 doses). Patients will receive CD8-enhanced anti-CEA TCR transduced&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed&#xD;
           tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four&#xD;
           to six weeks after treatment. If the patient has stable disease (SD) or tumor shrinkage,&#xD;
           repeat complete evaluations will be performed every 1-3 months. After the first year,&#xD;
           patients continuing to respond will continue to be followed with this evaluation every&#xD;
           3-4 months until off study criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design. The protocol will proceed&#xD;
           in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with six cohorts. Should a single patient&#xD;
           experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level, three more&#xD;
           patients would be treated at that 3 dose to confirm that no greater than 1/6 patients&#xD;
           have a DLT prior to proceeding to the next higher level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs&#xD;
           in 3-6 patients has been identified, three additional patients will be accrued at the&#xD;
           next-lowest dose, for a total of 6, in order to further characterize the safety of the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) prior to starting the phase II portion. If a DLT occurs in&#xD;
           the first cohort, that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If 2 DLTs are encountered&#xD;
           in this cohort, patients will be accrued to the de-escalation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD has been determined, the study then would proceed to the phase II portion.&#xD;
           Patients will be entered into two cohorts based on histology: cohort 1 will include&#xD;
           patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and cohort 2 will include patients with&#xD;
           other types of metastatic cancer that express CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each of the 2 strata evaluated, the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal&#xD;
           design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. For each of these two&#xD;
           arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then no&#xD;
           further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients&#xD;
           enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41&#xD;
           evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,&#xD;
           lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-CEA TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able&#xD;
           to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor&#xD;
           of a modest 20% partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).&#xD;

                  Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus&#xD;
                  be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its&#xD;
                  toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
