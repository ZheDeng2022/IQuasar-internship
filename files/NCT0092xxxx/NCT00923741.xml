      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More effective therapies are needed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      whose disease has advanced or spread beyond the original site following standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talactoferrin is a genetically engineered form of the human protein lactoferrin, found in&#xD;
      body secretions such as breast milk, tears and saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, talactoferrin improved life span in patients with NSCLC without causing&#xD;
      toxic side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of talactoferrin on the immune system and determine its effectiveness&#xD;
      in treating NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced NSCLC who have tissue type HLA-A2 and whose cancer has gotten worse&#xD;
      following at least one course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talactoferrin treatment: Patients take liquid talactoferrin twice a day for 12 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by 2 weeks off the drug. Treatment may continue in these 14-week cycles depending on&#xD;
      the drug side effects and the response of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations: Patients are evaluated at the clinic with a physical examination, check of vital&#xD;
      signs and blood tests every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans: Patients have CT scans to monitor disease before starting treatment, again at 6&#xD;
      weeks and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks during the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apheresis: Quantities of white blood cells called lymphocytes are collected through a&#xD;
      procedure called apheresis in order to measure the immune response to treatment. In this&#xD;
      procedure, blood is collected through a needle placed in a vein in the arm (similar to&#xD;
      donating blood) and circulated through a cell separator machine. The lymphocytes are&#xD;
      extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC have a very poor prognosis even with&#xD;
      surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who respond to 1st line chemotherapy invariably develop disease progression, and&#xD;
      their median survival is between 6-8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talactoferrin alfa (TLF) is a recombinant human lactoferrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLF displays anti-infective (against bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties, anti-tumor activity and anti-asthma properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have demonstrated an increase in cytokines that stimulate both innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immunity, as well as increasing the numbers of NK-T cells and CD8+ T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      found in Peyer s Patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in NSCLC have demonstrated safety and evidence of clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To evaluate the effects of administration of talactoferrin to patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer on the quantitative and functional changes in CD4, CD8, NK, and&#xD;
      Treg populations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the levels of cytokines&#xD;
      and chemokines in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To evaluate clinical response to talactoferrin. To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      talactoferrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed progressive, recurrent, or refractory&#xD;
      stage IIIb or IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be HLA-A2 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-arm pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients will be enrolled to receive daily oral talactoferrin (1.5 g/ bid) for up to 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who benefit from treatment will be able to continue on a 12 weeks on 2 weeks off&#xD;
      schedule until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed every 3 weeks with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline,&#xD;
      week 6, and week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologic studies (including apheresis) will be performed at baseline, week 6, and week 12.&#xD;
