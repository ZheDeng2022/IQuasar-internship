      BACKGROUND: Endoscopy was first used in plastic surgery for the treatment of frontal&#xD;
      rhytides. This minimally invasive approach allows the treatment of frontal wrinkles using a&#xD;
      practical procedure that does not directly interfere with the frontalis muscle, acting only&#xD;
      on its antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also possible to treat the middle third of the face, but these evolutions depends on&#xD;
      special surgical instruments. Videoendoscopic approach in rhytidoplasty have been improved by&#xD;
      new devices and surgical instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mid third of the face can be treated in different ways. Zygomatic projection can be&#xD;
      achieved by the use of the Dissector Assisted Malar Elevation (DAME) procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: Evaluate the zygomatic projection achieved by DAME in videoendoscopic rhytidoplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: 30 non-white female patients, 30 to 59 years old, will be submitted to&#xD;
      videoendoscopic rhytidoplasty with malar elevation by the DAME. Pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      facial appearance will be evaluated by digital photogrammetry.&#xD;

      THE NEW SURGICAL INSTRUMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dissector developed by the authors is a stainless steel instrument, 20 cm in length, 1 cm&#xD;
      in diameter, with a cylindrical handle, and an articulated section 3 cm in length and 1cm in&#xD;
      diameter at the distal end. When the most proximal end of the handle is rotated, the&#xD;
      articulated section provides for angulation or articulation of the distal end portion with&#xD;
      respect to the longitudinal axis of the instrument that is similar to the movements of a&#xD;
      distal phalanx of a finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Frontal Region: An incision line, 2 cm long, in the median sagittal plane and 1 cm from&#xD;
           the hairline; an incision line, 2 cm long, parallel and 4 cm from the sagittal line, to&#xD;
           the right and left sides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Temporal Region: An incision line, 3 cm long, 3 cm from the hairline, perpendicular to&#xD;
           and bisected by a line traced from the margin of the nasal wing, passing by the lateral&#xD;
           palpebral commissure and extending in the posterior direction, bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following, the hair was gathered into bundles to allow access to the skin markings, and held&#xD;
      by latex rings, which were obtained by cross-sectional cuts through fingers of sterile latex&#xD;
      surgical gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin antisepsis was performed with 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine, followed by the placement of&#xD;
      sterile surgical drapes, and retracing of the sagittal, parasagittal and temporal incision&#xD;
      lines (described above) with methylene blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right temporal incision was performed on the marked area, cutting through the skin and&#xD;
      superficial temporal fascia, and exposing the deep temporal fascia. Following, the&#xD;
      undermining of the temporal region surrounding the incision was carried out in the&#xD;
      interfascial plane, under direct vision, to prepare the optical cavity. The dissection&#xD;
      proceeded to the orbital and zygomatic regions, under endoscopic vision, using a rigid&#xD;
      endoscope (Karl Storz, model 7230 BWA) 18cm in length, 4mm in diameter and with a 30-degree&#xD;
      angle. The dissection continued until the medial zygomatic-temporal vein (also known as&#xD;
      sentinel vein) was reached; a xenon light source (Karl Storz, model 20131501) was used to&#xD;
      illuminate the optical cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zygomatic-temporal vein was previously cauterized with an endoscopic grasper (Karl Storz,&#xD;
      model 50232 GG) and incised with scissors (Karl Storz, model 50231 GW) to allow dissection&#xD;
      toward the lateral orbital rim. In this region, after passing the lateral palpebral ligament,&#xD;
      the undermining ?) deepened, becoming subperiosteal on the zygomatic bone. The subperiosteal&#xD;
      undermining ?) progressed along the whole inferior orbital rim up to its most medial portion,&#xD;
      superior to the infraorbital nerve, to completely release the inferior orbital rim under&#xD;
      endoscopic vision with the aid of an elevator (Karl Storz, model 50205s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the same surgical instrumentation, a subcutaneous tunnel was created from the temporal&#xD;
      incision towards the middle third of the face until the inferolateral limit of the&#xD;
      orbicularis oculi muscle was reached. From this point, a blunt dissection of the malar fat&#xD;
      pad was performed with the use of a dissector instrument, which had been developed for this&#xD;
      purpose, as described by the author in 2004 and published in 2006. After blunt dissection,&#xD;
      the malar fat pad was projected in the antero-superior direction by means of a suture in the&#xD;
      zygomatic projection to restore the zygomatic contour and the anterior projection of the&#xD;
      middle third of the face. The above procedures were then repeated on the contralateral&#xD;
      hemiface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure was continued with the frontal incisions, which were previously described, by&#xD;
      cutting through the skin to the periosteum (fig. 2). A subperiosteal dissection of the entire&#xD;
      frontal region was performed to a distance of 1 cm above the eyebrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under endoscopic vision, the dissection proceeded to the glabella, where the periosteum was&#xD;
      incised with a sharp dissector to expose the bone insertions of the procerus, corrugator and&#xD;
      depressor supercilii muscles. A thin dissector and an endoscopic grasper with a diathermy&#xD;
      cable (unipolar high-frequency cord, model 26002 M, Karl Storz) were used in the myotomy and&#xD;
      partial myectomy of these muscles. This periosteotomy started at the glabella region, and&#xD;
      continued transversally toward the lateral end of the eyebrow in both sides, passing by the&#xD;
      supratrochlear nerve, and reaching the supraorbital nerve, where it was interrupted to be&#xD;
      continued in a latero-medial direction in the next surgical step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frontal and temporal undermining were united by the incision of the temporal ligament&#xD;
      with a sharp dissector, exposing its most inferior portion, where the Hakme ligament is&#xD;
      located. This ligament was incised with endoscopic scissors; this maneuver simultaneously&#xD;
      released the lateral margin of the detached periosteum. At this level, the periosteotomy&#xD;
      continues marginal to the orbital rim in a lateral-medial direction to the supraorbital&#xD;
      nerve, which was identified and isolated. All fibrous adhesions of the body and tail of the&#xD;
      eyebrow found in this path were dissected using a sharp dissector until the fibers of the&#xD;
      palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle were reached at this level, completing the&#xD;
      horizontal periosteotomy in its entire extension, the treatment of structures, and the&#xD;
      undermining of the periorbital, frontal and temporal regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients in the fixation group, the fixation points of the frontal flap were&#xD;
      determined as the intersection point between the parasagittal line that passes through the&#xD;
      transition of the lateral third with the two medial thirds of the eyebrow and the hairline.&#xD;
      This point was called FEP (flap elevation point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After attaching one end of a 2-0 nylon monofilament thread to the deep temporal fascia, a&#xD;
      Casagrande needle was inserted at the FEP, penetrating the skin and periosteum, and&#xD;
      transfixing the point. Following, the needle was directed to the deep temporal fascia at the&#xD;
      fixation level. At this level, the other end of the nylon thread was passed through the hole&#xD;
      of the Casagrande needle. The needle was pulled back to the FEP and, at this point, the&#xD;
      periosteum was transfixed from depth to surface, up to the deep dermis. Then, the needle was&#xD;
      returned to the depth, to a point located 0.5 cm medially, in order to fix the flap at the&#xD;
      FEP level. The needle was directed to the sagittal incision, where once more it penetrated in&#xD;
      the periosteum from depth to surface, externalizing the nylon thread. The same procedure was&#xD;
      performed on the contralateral side. The two free ends of both nylon threads were tied&#xD;
      together with a surgical knot at their emergence point along the sagittal plane with enough&#xD;
      traction to elevate and fix the eyebrow to a position immediately superior to the superior&#xD;
      orbital rim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incisions were closed with 4-0 monofilament nylon suture on a 2cm triangular needle; the&#xD;
      detached site was drained by a closed vacuum system, with a drain tube (size 10) fixed to the&#xD;
      sagittal incision and maintained for 48 hours. The skin was cleansed with 0.9% saline&#xD;
      solution, tincture of benzoin was applied, and self-adhesive microporous tape (Micropore) was&#xD;
      used and maintained for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHOTOGRAPHIC STANDARDIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs were taken from all patients in a standardized manner, with respect to the&#xD;
      equipment, camera positioning, lighting conditions, and positioning of the cephalic segment&#xD;
      in relation to the Frankfurt plane. Photographs were taken in frontal view preoperatively and&#xD;
      at 12 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIGITAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image analysis was done on a personal computer using the UTHSCSA ImageTool Version 3.0&#xD;
      software for Windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital photogrammetric measurements were made based on the anthropometric landmarks&#xD;
      Endocathion (EN), which corresponds to the medial palpebral commissure, and Exocathion (EX),&#xD;
      which corresponds to the lateral palpebral commissure.22-24 The distance between the EN-right&#xD;
      and EN-left points (EN-EN distance) was measured. The length of a paramedian vertical line,&#xD;
      connecting the intersection of the lateral extension of the EN-EN line with the EX point to&#xD;
      the intersection of the EN-EN line with the outer margin of the eyebrow, which was&#xD;
      denominated EB (eyebrow) or distance EX-EB, was also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the photographs, the Brow Position Index (BPI) was calculated for both the right&#xD;
      (BPIR) and left (BPIL) sides. The BPI was defined as the ratio between the EN-EN (in pixels)&#xD;
      and EX-EB (in pixels) distances multiplied by 100. Following, the difference (delta), in&#xD;
      absolute value, between the preoperative BPI (BPI-pre) and 12month postoperative BPI&#xD;
      (BPI-post) was calculated for both sides.&#xD;
