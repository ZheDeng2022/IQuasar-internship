  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) accounting&#xD;
      for approximately 1,500 individuals annually, which represent 12% of all cancer cases in the&#xD;
      island. The genetic epidemiology of CRC among Hispanic populations is not well studied, hence&#xD;
      studies focused on large, well defined ethnic groups such as Puerto Ricans, are clearly&#xD;
      warranted. The first step towards evaluating the molecular, environmental, and genetic&#xD;
      epidemiology of CRC in PR is to establish a population-based familial CRC registry. The&#xD;
      following specific aims have been proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To prospectively identify and recruit approximately 300 CRC probands from two&#xD;
      distinct geographical areas in PR (Metropolitan and Southern Region). From each proband the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain a pedigree extended to second-degree relatives and cousins.&#xD;
      Assuming 10% will be positive for a family history of CRC, the investigators will then&#xD;
      recruit all 30 probands with a family history of CRC and a sample of 15 family-history&#xD;
      negative probands and obtain: paraffin-embedded tumors blocks, blood samples, risk factor and&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To prospectively identify and recruit selected relatives (parents,&#xD;
      grandparents, and same generation relatives - cousins and siblings) from the 45 probands&#xD;
      identified in Specific Aim 1. In addition, for siblings and cousins of probands (i.e.&#xD;
      relatives in the same generation as the proband), the investigators will obtain risk factor&#xD;
      and food frequency questionnaires, and for colorectal cancer cases, tumor blocks and&#xD;
      pathology reports of their cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To estimate from this pilot study the following parameters: (a) response rate&#xD;
      of probands and their selected relatives; (b) response rate of participants for each data&#xD;
      item; (c) family history of CRC and other cancers; (d) number of living first- and&#xD;
      second-degree relatives and cousins of probands; (e) number of these relatives who live in&#xD;
      the same household and region/municipality; (f) prevalence/distribution of selected risk&#xD;
      factors from the administered questionnaires.&#xD;

      Data obtained from this study will serve as the foundation for our large, island-wide,&#xD;
      population-based, genetic-epidemiologic study of familial colorectal cancer in Puerto Rico.&#xD;
      Through this feasibility study, we will assess the feasibility: (1) of recruiting colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients using the PR Central Cancer Registry, (2) of evaluating family pedigrees and&#xD;
      recruiting the relatives of probands (3) obtaining tumor, blood, medical and exposure&#xD;
      information from both probands and their relatives. Providing important data on Hispanic&#xD;
      populations that would enable family-based case-control studies of risk factors for CRC, with&#xD;
      an emphasis on candidate genes in selected carcinogenic pathways, genetic and epigenetic&#xD;
      modifications. Furthermore, information obtained from this proposal may serve to identify&#xD;
      families that would be informative for linkage studies to potentially map new genes, evaluate&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations, gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions.&#xD;

        1. Probands will be ascertained from the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry (PRCCR),&#xD;
             from the monthly report of incident colorectal cancer cases. Eligible cases were&#xD;
             persons (1) with pathologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer; (2) who were 15 years of&#xD;
             age or older, and (3) without previous history of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Probands will be ascertained from the Oncology Hospital, UDH Hospital and the Ashford&#xD;
             Presbyterian Community Hospital.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with colon polyps or colon cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients will have a colonoscopy or colon surgery to treat a benign condition such as&#xD;
             fissure, fistula, or hemorrhoids&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in this study is limited to persons 15 years or older with colon polyps or&#xD;
        colon cancer and control subjects 21 years or older with no malignant conditions in the&#xD;
        colon and / or rectum. Controls between the ages of 15 to 20 years will be not evaluated.&#xD;
        The reason is colon cancer occurs in people under 21 years, except in special cases&#xD;
        associated with certain genetic causes. People who cannot sign the consent may not&#xD;
        participate in this study.&#xD;
