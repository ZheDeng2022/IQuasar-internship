    <textblock>
      One of the complications of having cancer in the spinal vertebrae is that it can spread and&#xD;
      lead to compression of the spinal cord. Spinal cord compression is a serious event that needs&#xD;
      to be treated quickly in order to prevent permanent damage to the spinal cord and nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers currently do not have the ability to accurately predict whether cancer of&#xD;
           the vertebrae will cause spinal cord compression. It is possible that accurate&#xD;
           predictions could allow doctors to treat patients even before they develop symptoms of&#xD;
           spinal cord compression, thereby preventing some of the long-term consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare patients with cancer of the spinal vertebrae with and without symptoms of&#xD;
           spinal cord compression by looking at markers in the blood and changes on novel magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that might allow researchers to predict who will&#xD;
           experience spinal cord compression before they actually begin to have symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of patients 18 years of age and older who have cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
           vertebrae without symptoms of spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group of patients 18 years of age and older who have cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
           vertebrae with symptoms of spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn from each volunteer for initial tests and for more specific&#xD;
           biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive MRI of the spine, followed by a special type of MRI called diffusion&#xD;
           tensor imaging (DTI). It is believed that DTI may be even more sensitive in revealing&#xD;
           spinal cord abnormalities than regular MRI sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cancer of the vertebrae:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will obtain information such as pathology reports, laboratory results,&#xD;
           diagnosis and treatment history, physical exam (PE) information, results of scans such&#xD;
           as x-rays, MRI, computerized tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET),&#xD;
           and planned treatment details.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples will be taken for specific biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about pain, unusual sensations or numbness, bladder or bowel problems, and&#xD;
           mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive MRI of the spine, followed by a DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who appear to have symptoms of spinal cord compression will be offered standard&#xD;
           radiation treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic Epidural Spinal Cord Compression (MESCC) is an acute and common complication&#xD;
           with grave prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers for early detection and prediction of outcome in these patients may allow a&#xD;
           more objective treatment decision algorithm and hopefully change the unfortunate outcome&#xD;
           described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum S-100b, NSE and GFAP and Plasma NF-H are surrogates for neuronal damage in humans&#xD;
           and animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used in brain disorders, in predicting Spinal&#xD;
           Cord Injury outcome in animal models, and was found to be beneficial in detecting spinal&#xD;
           cord abnormalities in human subjects with acute and slowly progressive cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare and evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of DTI of the spinal cord in&#xD;
           healthy participants, to optimize the DTI Images and determine normal spine DTI values,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe normal variations of serum/plasma and imaging biomarkers in healthy&#xD;
           participants and compare these with serum/plasma and imaging biomarkers values in&#xD;
           patients with vertebral metastases with and without spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect differences in the serum/plasma and imaging biomarkers in patients with&#xD;
           vertebral metastases with and without spinal cord compressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate serum/plasma and imaging biomarkers differences with clinical outcomes of&#xD;
           patients with vertebral metastases with spinal cord compression (pain, ambulation,&#xD;
           continence and survival at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers with no prior history or concomitant central nervous system injury or&#xD;
           inflammatory disease, prior or planned brain or spinal cord radiation therapy or&#xD;
           surgical procedure and with no contraindication for MR scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic cancer in the spinal vertebrae, with or without spinal cord&#xD;
           compression and with no prior history or concomitant central nervous system injury or&#xD;
           inflammatory disease, brain metastases, prior brain or spinal cord radiation therapy or&#xD;
           surgical procedure and with no contraindication for MR scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary DTI studies will be conducted for healthy volunteer participants to&#xD;
           determine normal spine DTI values, choose and optimize the scanning protocol, and&#xD;
           evaluate the presence of artifacts and reproducibility of the DTI Images. Normal values&#xD;
           and variability of serum and plasma biomarkers will be also determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient participants with known vertebral bone metastases with or without spinal cord&#xD;
           compression will undergo a DTI study along with the standard MRI sequences, used to&#xD;
           evaluate MESCC patients. Blood samples for biomarkers will be also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with documented MESCC, will be treated with standard radiotherapy fields, dose&#xD;
           and schedule. Steroid treatment will be used as clinically indicated. All study&#xD;
           procedures will be conducted prior to any therapy. Follow- up visits are planned at 1,&#xD;
           3, 6, and 12 months after radiotherapy completion with history and physical, DTI and&#xD;
           serum/plasma biomarker evaluations.&#xD;
