  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood&#xD;
      cells from participants' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large&#xD;
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow participants to be followed for up to 15 years following treatment on&#xD;
      an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Trial as required by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have been enrolled on an NCI Surgery Branch Gene Therapy Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed with a physical examination and blood tests for up to 15 years&#xD;
      as required by the FDA&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center are required to be enrolled on a&#xD;
           clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following participation in a treatment protocol, it may be in the best interest of the&#xD;
           patient to continue to be followed at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) conducts clinical trials utilizing&#xD;
           gene transfer. The current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for&#xD;
           long-term follow-up are up to fifteen years for some products. As this time-period is&#xD;
           frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a long-term follow-up protocol&#xD;
           is necessary to ensure the follow-up of these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --Provide a mechanism for long-term follow-up of participants who have participated in&#xD;
      research studies in the NCI-SB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant has been enrolled on an NCI-SB treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will undergo physical exams, laboratory evaluation, imaging, or phone&#xD;
           follow-up as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures that entail more than minimal risk to the patient should not be performed for&#xD;
           research purposes on this protocol.&#xD;
