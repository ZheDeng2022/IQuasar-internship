      Background: the objective of the present inquiry was to evaluate the weaning process in&#xD;
      intubated older people subjected to inspiratory muscle training and to correlate the&#xD;
      predictors of ventilatory interruption with its success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the patients were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG, n=14; age=82±4&#xD;
      years) that received conventional physiotherapy plus inspiratory muscle training (IMT) with&#xD;
      threshold IMT® and a control group (CG, n=14; age=81±6 years) that received only conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The predictors evaluates were the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and the&#xD;
      index of Tobin (IT). The protocol for muscle training consisted of an initial load of 30%&#xD;
      MIP, which was increased by 10% daily; training was administered for five minutes, twice a&#xD;
      day, seven times a week with supplemental oxygen for the entire period from the decision to&#xD;
      wean up to extubation.&#xD;

      The sample for this investigation was selected in a randomized way in the period between&#xD;
      December 2007 and November 2008. The individuals were successively entered in the research as&#xD;
      they were admitted to the ICU, in respect of the criteria of inclusion and exclusion. From&#xD;
      the total number of admitted patients in the period (n=67), many were excluded because they&#xD;
      had been tracheostomized (n=25), were dead (n=13) or were transferred out of the hospital&#xD;
      (n=1). Those that remained intubated (n=28) and went to the spontaneous mode were chosen&#xD;
      randomly and in alternating fashion were divided into the experimental group (EG) or the&#xD;
      control group (CG). The EG (n=14; age=82±4 years-old) underwent conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      plus inspiratory muscular training with threshold IMT® (Respironics/EUA - 2004), and the CG&#xD;
      (n=14; age=81±6 years-old) received only conventional physiotherapy with no intervention that&#xD;
      favored the inspiratory muscle strengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As inclusion criteria, the individuals of the sample were required to have undergone MV for&#xD;
      at least 48 hours in a controlled way13, as intubation is diagnostic for acute respiratory&#xD;
      injury type 1 and has a maximum value of MIP of -20 cmH2O16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included any type of acute condition (cardiac arrhythmia) or chronic&#xD;
      condition, such as insufficient congestive heart failure or unstable ischemic cardiac&#xD;
      disease17, that could compromise weaning or could impede the accomplishment of inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle training (neuropathy and myopathy). Tracheostomized patients (in the pre-test), those&#xD;
      with neurological problems (cerebral vascular accident, cerebrospinal trauma or spinal&#xD;
      medullar trauma), those with morbid obesity or those taking medicine that could cause a&#xD;
      disorder of attention, as well as cases of auto-extubation, were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria of inclusion and exclusion were evaluated via examination of the patients'&#xD;
      medical records and physical examination daily and in each session. The daily adherence of&#xD;
      the patients to the necessary parameters for the study was noted for each patient.&#xD;

    <description>Protocol of inspiratory muscle training using threshold IMT®: After the MIP was measured, inspiratory muscle training was initiated. The Threshold-IMT® device of a linear pressure load produces a resistance to inspiration through the use of a flow-independent one-way valve. During expiration there is no resistance because the unidirectional valve opens, while during inspiration the valve closes, becoming &quot;hard&quot; due to the resistance of the spring. The suggested protocol was: initial load of 30% of the M24, increasing daily by 10%, with training for five minutes, twice a day, seven times a week in the period from the beginning of the weaning from the MV until the extubation of the patient.&#xD;
An essential factor was the use of supplemental oxygen (O2) as needed by the patient. The patients were in DD with fowler 45º.</description>
