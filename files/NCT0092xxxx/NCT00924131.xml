      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are greatly interested in knowing more about the long-term effects of&#xD;
           various treatments for cancers such as Hodgkin's disease, particularly from those who&#xD;
           have lived 20 to 30 years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who were treated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) may have undergone&#xD;
           different treatments for which more long-term information is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the body systems of long-term survivors of Hodgkin's disease to see if there&#xD;
           are any long- term consequences of treatment for Hodgkin's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the long-term effects of cancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survivors of Hodgkin's disease who were previously treated at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will need to sign consent forms to allow researchers to obtain&#xD;
           documentation of medical history, including prior treatment for Hodgkin's disease and&#xD;
           prior NIH treatment, including protocol number, where applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pertinent medical records, pathology reports, and radiographic imaging studies will be&#xD;
           reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary care physician's name, address, and other contact information are also required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during the assessment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory studies of blood, urine, and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiologic evaluations, including computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI) scans for all participants and mammograms for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac evaluation, vascular studies, and pulmonary studies to measure heart and lung&#xD;
           function, and digestive tests to measure stomach and intestinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive testing to measure brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires assessing current quality of life&#xD;
           and daily living skills.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly 75% of Hodgkin's Disease (HD) patients can be cured of their disease with chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy, resulting in a growing number of long-term survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of HD treatments, including second malignancies and cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      affect survival and quality of life. Minimizing late toxicities has become a major emphasis&#xD;
      of current and investigational regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better characterization of long-term toxicity and quality of life (QOL) after therapy for HD&#xD;
      and the ability to determine which late toxicities arise from a given modality may allow an&#xD;
      ability to shape future regimens such that late toxicity can be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular function in patients previously treated for&#xD;
      HD at NIH and to correlate this information to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure cardiac function and abnormalities and to correlate these findings with&#xD;
           treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure pulmonary function with pulmonary function testing in survivors of HD and to&#xD;
           correlate these findings with treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure vascular function in survivors of HD and to correlate these findings with&#xD;
           treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if elevated plasma TGF levels correlate with the presence of late radiation&#xD;
      fibrosis in long-term survivors of HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate late quality of life (QOL) in long-term survivors of HD and to correlate QOL with&#xD;
      treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and describe additional exploratory measures of organ function in patients&#xD;
      previously treated for HD at NIH and to correlate this information to the treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the correlation of exploratory functional assays, biomarkers, and single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms with the presence of late chemotherapy or radiation toxicity in&#xD;
      long-term HD survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivors of HD previously treated at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single point in time follow-up evaluation of long-term HD survivors, previously&#xD;
      treated at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for late toxicities in multiple organ systems using imaging&#xD;
      modalities, laboratory tests, functional assays, and investigational studies.&#xD;

          -  Patients must have been previously treated for Hodgkin's Disease at the NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be willing to complete quality of life questionnaires and to answer&#xD;
             questions regarding their medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be willing to provide release of medical information forms for physicians&#xD;
             and hospitals involved in their management&#xD;

&#xD;
        In addition to those above,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to return to NIH/NIA to participate in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a primary physician in the community who is willing to communicate&#xD;
             with NIH regarding clinical findings and collaborate in the clinical management and&#xD;
             follow-up of the patient. This will be substantiated by communicating directly with&#xD;
             the patient's physician prior to evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients are eligible for follow up evaluations and quality of life&#xD;
             evaluations. They will be excluded for any radiological testing and invasive studies.&#xD;

             laboratory tests to be performed have been carried out within the last three months,&#xD;
             those values will be used instead of repeating them. Alternatively, pregnant patients&#xD;
             may choose to participate in the study after the birth of their child to be able to&#xD;
             participate in the full evaluation.&#xD;
