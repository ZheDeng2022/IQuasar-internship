  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study provides cancer care through the National Cancer Institute's Medical Oncology&#xD;
      Branch (MOB) to patients who are not enrolled in an active treatment research protocol.&#xD;
      Patients receive standard treatments only; no investigational therapies are provided on this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this protocol. Candidates are patients&#xD;
      for whom an NCI investigator decides that the interests of the patient and the NCI are best&#xD;
      served by the patient's enrollment in this protocol to receive care and follow-up within the&#xD;
      MOB. This includes patients in the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients previously enrolled in NCI trials whose participation in this protocol may&#xD;
           continue to provide researchers important scientific information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will be eligible for a research protocol within the foreseeable future&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients whose medical welfare will be seriously compromised by referral back to the&#xD;
           community, such as patients with a rare or complex disease for which community resources&#xD;
           are inadequate or unavailable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Terminally ill patients who have received most of their specialized medical care at the&#xD;
           Clinical Center and for whom humanitarian considerations dictate that they continue to&#xD;
           receive their medical care at NIH after going off study for the remaining weeks or&#xD;
           months of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cancer or HIV, or people at risk for cancer or HIV for whom cancer&#xD;
           treatments at the NCI are requested through the MOB consult service&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are participating in a non-treatment NCI research protocol and require&#xD;
           standard-of-care therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cancer or HIV or people at risk for cancer for whom cancer treatment or&#xD;
           management at the NCI would add significant value to the institute's cancer training&#xD;
           program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive standard medical care, including periodic routine laboratory tests,&#xD;
      diagnostic x-rays, and nuclear medicine scans to monitor the course of illness and the&#xD;
      effects of any treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be in the interest of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to evaluate, provide&#xD;
      treatment/interventions and/or follow certain eligible individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to add value to the medical or surgical oncology training&#xD;
      programs by providing consult, treatment and medical follow-up for NCI patients, donors to&#xD;
      NCI patients and other Institute patients and individuals, as specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in the best interests of the individual and the CCR for the individual to receive a&#xD;
      medical evaluation, treatment, or follow-up, or to donate cellular products at the NCI, NIH&#xD;
      Intramural Research Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational therapies will be administered on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle to provide cancer care for individuals&#xD;
      in the intramural research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will provide the administrative vehicle for NCI investigators to provide&#xD;
      consult services to individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical/surgical/radiotherapeutic care, treatment and follow-up is provided for eligible&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
