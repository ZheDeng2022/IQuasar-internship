  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is highly responsive to but not curable by cladribine (CdA). HCL&#xD;
      responds to rituximab, which is not yet standard therapy for HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the CD25-negative variant (HCLv) respond poorly to initial cladribine but do&#xD;
      respond to rituximab in anecdotal reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deoxycytidine kinase phosphorylates cladribine to CdATP, which incorporates into DNA, leading&#xD;
      to DNA strand breaks and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody which induces apoptosis and either complement or antibody dependent cytotoxicity&#xD;
      (ADCC or CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in complete remission (CR) to cladribine have minimal residual disease (MRD) by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry of the bone marrow biopsy (BMBx IHC), a risk for early relapse. Tests&#xD;
      for HCL MRD in blood or marrow include flow cytometry (FACS) or PCR using consensus primers.&#xD;
      The most sensitive HCL MRD test is real-time quantitative PCR using sequence-specific primers&#xD;
      (RQ-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies with limited follow-up, MRD detected by tests other than RQ-PCR can be eliminated&#xD;
      by rituximab after cladribine in greater than 90 percent of patients, but MRD rates after&#xD;
      cladribine alone are unknown. Simultaneous cladribine and rituximab might be superior or&#xD;
      inferior to delaying rituximab until detection of MRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 4 HCL-specific trials are listed on Cancer.gov: a phase II trial of cladribine followed&#xD;
      4 weeks later by 8 weekly doses of rituximab, and phase I-II trials of recombinant&#xD;
      immunotoxins targeting CD22 (BL22, HA22) and CD25 (LMB-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if HCL MRD differs at 6 months after cladribine with or without rituximab&#xD;
      administered concurrently with cladribine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare cladribine plus rituximab vs cladribine alone in terms of 1) initial MRD-free&#xD;
           survival and disease-free survival, and 2) response to delayed rituximab for relapse, to&#xD;
           determine if early rituximab compromises later response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if MRD levels and tumor markers (soluble CD25 and CD22) after cladribine&#xD;
           and/or rituximab correlate with response and clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine, using MRD and tumor marker data, when BMBx can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare response and MRD after the 1st and 2nd courses of cladribine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of cladribine and rituximab on normal T- and B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enhance the study of HCL biology by cloning, sequencing and characterizing monoclonal&#xD;
           immunoglobulin rearrangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCL with 0-1 prior courses of cladribine and treatment indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cladribine 0.15 mg/Kg/day times 5 doses each by 2hr i.v. infusion (days 1-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab 375 mg/m2/week times 8 weeks, randomized half to begin day 1, then repeat for all&#xD;
      patients with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after cladribine. Also may repeat for those&#xD;
      with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after delayed rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD tests used for the primary objective will be limited to BMBx IHC, blood FACS or blood&#xD;
      consensus PCR, all CLIA certified. Blood MRD relapse is defined as FACS positivity or low&#xD;
      blood counts (ANC less than 1500/microl, Plt less than 100,000/microl, or Hgb less than 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification: 68 patients with 0 and 62 with 1 prior course of cladribine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: 80% power to discriminate rates of MRD of 5 vs 25%, or 10 vs 35%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized arm: 20 with HCLv will begin rituximab with cladribine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Ceiling: 152 patients (130 HCL, 2 extra HCL if needed, and 20 HCLv.)&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is highly responsive to but not curable by cladribine (CdA). HCL&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients with the CD25-negative variant (HCLv) respond poorly to initial cladribine but do&#xD;
      respond to rituximab in anecdotal reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purine analogs cladribine and pentostatin have similar efficacy for HCL, both inhibiting DNA&#xD;
      synthesis selectively in HCL cells. Cladribine is effective after just 1 cycle. Rituximab is&#xD;
      an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which induces apoptosis and either complement or antibody&#xD;
      dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in complete remission (CR) to cladribine have minimal residual disease (MRD) by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry of the bone marrow biopsy (BMBx IHC), a risk for early relapse. Tests&#xD;

&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cladribine 0.15 mg/Kg/day times 5 doses each by 2hr i.v. infusion (days 1-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab 375 mg/m2/week times 8 weeks, randomized half to begin day 1, then repeat for all&#xD;
      patients with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after cladribine. Also may repeat for those&#xD;
      with blood-MRD relapse at least 6 months after delayed rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD tests used for the primary objective will be limited to BMBx IHC, blood FACS, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      bone marrow aspirate FACS, all CLIA certified. Blood MRD relapse is defined as FACS&#xD;
      positivity or low blood counts (ANC less than 1500/microl, Plt less than 100,000/microl, or&#xD;
      Hgb less than 11) attributed to HCL. Patients FACS-negative in both blood and bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate are considered MRD-negative complete response (CR) regardless of blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: 68 HCL patients with 0 and 62 with 1 prior course of purine analog&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: 80% power to discriminate rates of MRD of 5 vs. 25%, or 10 vs. 35%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized HCLv arm: 20 patients with HCLv will begin rituximab with cladribine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized HCL arm: 25 newly diagnosed patients will be enrolled to receive rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
      beginning day 1, but beginning before the 1st dose of cladribine, rather than after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual ceiling: 177 patients (155 HCL, 2 extra HCL if needed, and 20 HCLv)&#xD;

        any required vaccination/booster administered at least 4 weeks prior to the initiation of&#xD;
        study treatment. Review of the patient s immunization status for the following vaccinations&#xD;
        is recommended: tetanus; diphtheria; influenza; pneumococcal polysaccharide; Varicella;&#xD;
        measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); and hepatitis B. Patients who are considered to be at&#xD;
        high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and for whom the investigator has&#xD;
        determined that immunization is indicated should complete the entire HBV vaccine series at&#xD;
        least 4 weeks prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
