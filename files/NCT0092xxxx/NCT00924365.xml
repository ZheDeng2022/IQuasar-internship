      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 10,000 children in the United States have been living with HIV infection since&#xD;
           birth. Little is known about the long-term effects of HIV infection and its treatment on&#xD;
           the growth and development of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of their disease, many children with HIV face additional difficulties with their&#xD;
           health, well-being and development, such as success in school and peer relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it affect the&#xD;
           growth and development of children, adolescents and young adults who have been infected&#xD;
           since birth or when they were very young.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop ways to improve the quality of life for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -HIV-infected patients who were followed by the pediatric HIV program in NCI as of December&#xD;
      2004, or an HIV-infected sibling of a participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic evaluation of pubertal development; bone mineralization; body composition and&#xD;
           fat distribution; liver, kidney and heart status; and behavioral, cognitive and academic&#xD;
           or vocational outcome of the study group. Evaluations include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examinations, including height and weight measurements and skin-fold thickness&#xD;
           testing to measure body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical records and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, including pregnancy test in females who can bear children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scans (X-ray test to measure bone strength and how much fat, muscle and bone is in&#xD;
           the body).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing, including evaluation of language, thinking and&#xD;
           problem-solving abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Test using a magnetic field and radio waves to examine&#xD;
           brain structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test: Blood sampling before and one time after the subject drinks&#xD;
           a sugary solution to measure the body's ability to use sugar&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pediatric cohort in this country offers a tremendous opportunity to understand the effect&#xD;
      of HIV and ARTs on key developmental and maturational processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough understanding of the impact of HIV and ARTs on these long-term processes is&#xD;
      extremely relevant as ART programs for HIV-infected children are being developed around the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the clinical features and impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy in an&#xD;
      HIV-infected pediatric cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known HIV disease and followed in the NCI pediatric HIV program as of December 2004, or&#xD;
      HIV-infected sibling of a participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elgibility for the cardiac sub-study is expanded to include any person with HIV acquired in&#xD;
      infancy or young childhood who is older than 7 and meets other inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for cardiac sub-study will also include HIV uninfected subjects (18-30 years of&#xD;
      age) who will server as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial evaluations of pubertal development, bone mineralization, body composition and fat&#xD;
      distribution, hepatic, renal, and cardiac status, and behavioral, cognitive, and&#xD;
      academic/vocational outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings may be shared with the multicenter Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study and lead to more&#xD;
      intensive, focused substudies.&#xD;
