    <description>Starting dose of CEP-9722 is 150 mg/day (total dose). The study consists of a 14-day cycle of CEP-9722 alone, and at least one 28-day cycle of CEP-9722 plus temozolomide (150 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5). Patients who are receiving clinical benefit may receive subsequent cycles of study drug treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant advanced solid&#xD;
             tumor considered unresponsive or poorly responsive to accepted treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has adequate hematologic assessments and adequate renal and hepatic&#xD;
             functions as specified in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has measurable or nonmeasurable disease documented with an appropriate&#xD;
             method of evaluation according to disease characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had no chemotherapy for at least 3 weeks and has resolution of prior&#xD;
             sequelae. If the patient has had prior curative radiation or prior treatment with&#xD;
             nitrosoureas, a minimum of 4 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively, must have elapsed before&#xD;
             treatment with CEP-9722.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had no immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibody therapy, for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks and no hormonotherapy for at least 1 week, with the exception of&#xD;
             patients with prostate cancer, who may continue hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0,&#xD;
             1, or 2.&#xD;

             the study will be withdrawn from the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is participating in another interventional clinical study at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment, has participated in another interventional clinical study within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, or the patient has previously been already enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an active gastroduodenal ulcer, uncontrolled high blood pressure,&#xD;
