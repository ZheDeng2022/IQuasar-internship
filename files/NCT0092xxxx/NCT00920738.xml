      RATIONALE: Gathering information about how often metabolic syndrome occurs in young survivors&#xD;
      of childhood cancer may help doctors learn more about the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying metabolic syndrome in survivors of childhood cancer&#xD;
      and in their healthy sisters and brothers.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the manifestations of metabolic syndrome (MS) in children and adolescents who&#xD;
           are survivors of childhood cancer (CCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the prevalence of MS in CCS to that of matched healthy siblings of similar age&#xD;
           and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate insulin resistance (as measured by the euglycemic insulin clamp) in CCS and&#xD;
           compare to that of healthy siblings of similar age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the extent to which prevalent obesity and insulin resistance are correlated with&#xD;
           other factors that have been identified in the causal pathway associated with the&#xD;
           development of the MS that may be altered in the CCS ( e.g., growth-hormone secretion,&#xD;
           adipokines [adiponectin, leptin], inflammatory mediators [e.g., interleukin-6], tumor&#xD;
           necrosis factor-Î±, and C-reactive protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain dietary and physical activity assessments of CCS and healthy siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore demographic (age at treatment, sex-specific differences) and treatment-related&#xD;
           factors (exposures and dose-related associations with chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
           radiation, steroids) as potential correlates with insulin resistance, vascular function,&#xD;
           and MS in CCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a comprehensive medical examination including current and past&#xD;
      medical history, family history, review of prescription medications, a physical examination&#xD;
      including a body and visceral-fat assessment, and anthropometric (DEXA and bone-age x-ray)&#xD;
      and blood pressure measurement. Blood samples are collected to measure growth hormone,&#xD;
      adipokines (adiponectin, leptin), cytokines (IL-6 and CRP), fasting insulin, fasting glucose,&#xD;
      lipids, oxidized LDL, hypothalami-pituitary-gonadal function (estrogen, FSH, LH,&#xD;
      testosterone), and thyroid function (free T4 and TSH). Patients also complete questionnaires&#xD;
      on dietary intake and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy siblings undergo a complete medical examination as patients do, including blood&#xD;
      samples collection and questionnaire administration.&#xD;

        The childhood cancer survivor (CCS) subjects for this study will be selected from Pediatric&#xD;
        Oncology databases at the University of Minnesota Medical Center and Children&quot;s Hospitals&#xD;
        and Clinics of Minneapolis and St. Paul as described previously. CCS will complete a&#xD;
        comprehensive evaluation in the Masonic Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) over a 2 day time&#xD;
        period. The comparative data on normal children and adolescents will be obtained from&#xD;
        healthy siblings frequency matched by age and gender and who will be evaluated in a manner&#xD;
        similar to the CCS.&#xD;
