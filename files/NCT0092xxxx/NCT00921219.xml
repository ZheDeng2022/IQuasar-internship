      The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability profile&#xD;
      (rate and amount of absorption into the bloodstream) of a test formulation of Ivermectin&#xD;
      solution 1 mg/ml with a marketed reference formulation of Ivermectin 3 mg tablets when taken&#xD;
      after a standard meal. The study is designed in accordance with the EU Note for Guidance on&#xD;
      the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 2001.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine (i.e. a medicine used to eliminate parasitic worms)&#xD;
      for oral administration, and is approved in the US and some other countries in a tablet form.&#xD;
      A new liquid formulation of ivermectin has been developed to facilitate dosing. This is a&#xD;
      single dose, randomised, crossover study in healthy adult male and female volunteers, with&#xD;
      doses taken 20 minutes after a standard breakfast. Doses will separated by washout period of&#xD;
      at least 14 days. Twenty-one blood samples will be taken from each volunteer over 144 hours&#xD;
      in each period. Concentrations of Ivermectin in plasma will be measured using a validated&#xD;
      chromatographic assay (LC-MS/MS). Standard pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained and&#xD;
      bioequivalence on the basis of rate and extent of drug absorption will be assessed.&#xD;
