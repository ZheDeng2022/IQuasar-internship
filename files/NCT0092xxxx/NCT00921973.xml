    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of VAX102 when given with&#xD;
      Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) delivered in the same arm as two separate IM&#xD;
      injections in healthy adults 18 to 49 years. The investigators will measure the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the VAX102 when given with TIV and the antibody response to TIV when given&#xD;
      with VAX102 compared to TIV alone.&#xD;
