  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a novel class of anticancer agent. These&#xD;
           agents lead to the increased acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins, which&#xD;
           leads to rapid cell death in many tumor models. It is thought that the cell death&#xD;
           observed with this class of agents may be mediated, in part, through the selective&#xD;
           acetylation of histone proteins resulting in increased expression of specific genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For solid tumors in general, cell death in preclinical models has not translated to&#xD;
           activity in patients. For this reason, studies increasingly have combined chemotherapy&#xD;
           with HDAC inhibitors to achieve additive and potentially synergistic effects on cancer&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will study a continuous infusion of the HDAC inhibitor belinostat in&#xD;
           combination with cisplatin and etoposide for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a safe and tolerable phase 2 dose for the combination of belinostat with&#xD;
           cisplatin and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate molecular markers of HDAC inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The protocol will be open to all patients with recurrent or advanced cancer (small-cell&#xD;
           lung cancer and other advanced cancers) for whom standard therapy offers no curative&#xD;
           potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will begin with belinostat 400 mg/m (2)/24h administered by continuous IV&#xD;
           infusion on days 1 and 2, cisplatin at 80 mg/m (2) IV on day 2, and etoposide at 100&#xD;
           mg/m (2) IV daily times 3 on days 2 - 4. Dose escalation of belinostat will follow&#xD;
           according to traditional 3 patient cohorts.&#xD;
