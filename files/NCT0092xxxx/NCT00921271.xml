  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how infrared spectroscopy compares to continuous compartment&#xD;
      pressure monitoring in the detection of compartment syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals meeting the study eligibility criteria will be identified at time of admission by&#xD;
      the receiving Trauma and Orthopaedics Registrar who will be trained in the study design and&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will be approached about participating in the study either at time of&#xD;
      admission or shortly afterwards, either by the chief investigator or another doctor trained&#xD;
      in the research protocol. Where the individual is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated,&#xD;
      which is likely in many major trauma victims, inclusion in the study will be discussed with&#xD;
      the patient's legal representative and/or family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent process for the study will consist of having the study protocol explained by&#xD;
      either the chief investigator, or another doctor trained in the study design. Patients will&#xD;
      be allowed to read a participant information sheet, and permitted as much time as they&#xD;
      require to decide if they wish to participate in the study. Verbal and written consent will&#xD;
      be taken using a study specific consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of incapacitated patients, the study design will be explained to their relatives'&#xD;
      legal representatives as appropriate and advice sought from them as to whether they know of&#xD;
      any reason why the patient might object to participate in the study. Upon regain capacity&#xD;
      consent will be sought from the patient for storage and analysis of their study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, the patient will undergo monitoring with both continuous compartment&#xD;
      pressures, and NIRS measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings for both techniques will be taken each hour, as part of the patients normal&#xD;
      observations, from the point of consent until 24 hours after their first operation. Where&#xD;
      patients do not have an operation the total duration of monitoring will be 24 hours. The&#xD;
      measurements will be taken by nursing staff who have received training in both techniques.&#xD;
      The procedure for each technique is described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuous compartment pressures will be recorded in the broken leg, in case of tibial&#xD;
           fractures, in all other patients fitting the inclusion criteria measurements will be&#xD;
           taken from both legs (as both legs are at risk of compartment syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compartment pressures will be recorded using a slit catheter technique. Insertion of the&#xD;
           slit catheter will be performed by either the chief investigator or Orthopaedic&#xD;
           Registrar who will have been trained in the technique. The slit catheter is inserted&#xD;
           using a sterile technique - the skin over the front outer part of the leg is cleaned and&#xD;
           a catheter inserted into the anterior muscle compartment at this point. The catheter&#xD;
           should be sited at the approximate midpoint of the leg, although this can be adjusted up&#xD;
           or down if this would lead to insertion into a fracture site. The catheter is secured&#xD;
           with a sterile dressing and connected to a monitor from which recordings can be taken,&#xD;
           the catheter can be left in place for the duration of the study with no need to re-site&#xD;
           it unless it stops recording accurately. At the same time as compartment pressure&#xD;
           measurements are taken the patient's blood pressure will be monitored and the 'Perfusion&#xD;
           Pressure' for the leg calculated, where:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perfusion pressure = diastolic blood pressure - leg compartment pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NIRS measurements will be taken with an the INVOS system, produced by Somentics. These&#xD;
           measurements will be taken from both legs, the affected leg and other other leg used as&#xD;
           a control for comparison. Where both legs are at risk measurements will be taken from&#xD;
           both legs and the midpoint of the forearm used as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INVOS probe is a small adhesive patch that is stuck to the skin. The probe is sterile and&#xD;
      will be attached using the same sterile technique as the compartment pressure catheter. Where&#xD;
      the overlying skin is hairy the hair overlying the area for the probe should be clipped&#xD;
      before attaching the probe, to ensure adequate adhesion and accurate readings. The probe is&#xD;
      to be sited just below the compartment pressure catheter, although if there is an underlying&#xD;
      haematoma (blood clot), then the probe should be positioned so at to avoid this but still&#xD;
      remaining over the front outer part of the leg. This technique conforms with the&#xD;
      manufacturers recommended use of the equipment and is similar protocol to previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the monitoring period both measuring devices are removed. If the patient has&#xD;
      developed compartment syndrome during this period and required an operation, the NIRS probe&#xD;
      and compartment pressure catheter will be replaced for a further 12 hours of monitoring to&#xD;
      monitor the changes post-operatively and ensure compartment pressures stay low.&#xD;
