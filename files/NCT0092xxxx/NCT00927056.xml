      Overall Objective: To evaluate pain and functional status of patients undergoing surgical&#xD;
      correction for lumbar herniated disc, pre- and post-surgery, using subjective (VAS, Oswestry,&#xD;
      PSQI, Patient Expectation), as well as, objective measures of physical activity (triaxial&#xD;
      accelerometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods: Two groups of subjects will be examined; 1) patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      lumbar herniated disc undergoing minimally invasive microdiscectomy (MD), and 2) patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with lumbar herniated disc undergoing open microlumbar discectomy (OD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who agree to participate, will be assessed (assessments listed below) after the&#xD;
      diagnosis and prior to surgery. The subject will then be assessed postop and they will&#xD;
      continue with follow-up after surgery with a visit at 3 weeks postop. Both methods of&#xD;
      discectomy will be discussed with the subject. Once the subject has consented to participate&#xD;
      (and prior to surgery), subjects will be randomized with a 50/50 chance of being placed in&#xD;
      the MD or OD groups. Subjects will be distributed into the MD group and the OD group using a&#xD;
      block randomization method. The study will be single blinded. A longitudinal, within group,&#xD;
      comparison will be made to assess the change in the measured parameters. Data involving the&#xD;
      MD and OD groups will be accumulated in a cross-sectional fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the referrals to the practices of the Orthopedic and&#xD;
      Neurosurgeon Spine Surgeons at the Health Sciences Centre. This encompasses the majority of&#xD;
      new and currently managed cases in the Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be between the ages of 18 and 90. Male and female subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      into the study. All patients will clinically demonstrate unilateral lower extremity pain in&#xD;
      greater proportion to low back pain symptoms if present. Imaging (CT) will document single&#xD;
      level lumbar herniated nucleus pulposis. Exclusion criteria will be cauda equina syndrome,&#xD;
      progressive neurologic deficit, bilateral lower extremity symptoms, low back pain more than&#xD;
      leg pain, the existence of significant co-morbidity (e.g. cardiac condition, disease, etc.)&#xD;
      of any form, and any other physical limitations (musculoskeletal injury). Subjects&#xD;
      participating will be required to speak and read English.&#xD;
