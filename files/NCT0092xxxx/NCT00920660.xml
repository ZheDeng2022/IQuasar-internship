      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of single, oral&#xD;
      doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and prednisolone as measured by levels of&#xD;
      ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in whole blood of healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes of this study are to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of single,&#xD;
      oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) and prednisolone (30mg) as measured&#xD;
      by levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1beta in whole blood of healthy adult subjects. In addition,&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of SRT2104 following the administration of&#xD;
      single, oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg) in healthy adult subjects&#xD;
      will also be assessed. As exploratory endpoints, transcriptomic profiles, biomarker&#xD;
      exploration, and relationships between plasma SRT2104 levels and ex vivo LPS-induced&#xD;
      TNF-alpha production may also be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, non-therapeutic clinical study of SRT2104 administered&#xD;
      orally as 250 mg capsules. Randomized, double-blind study to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      sensitivity of systemic biomarkers, such as ex-vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and&#xD;
      IL-1beta, to treatment with four-single oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, and&#xD;
      2000 mg), prednisolone (30 mg), and placebo in healthy adult volunteers. Twenty (20) subjects&#xD;
      (males and females of non-childbearing potential) aged 18-60, who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 15&#xD;
      evaluable subjects. Each subject will participate in 6 treatment periods. For each treatment&#xD;
      period subjects will fast for at least 10 hours overnight. After pre-dosing procedures,&#xD;
      subjects will consume a standard, non-high-fat (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30%&#xD;
      of calories derived from fat) meal 15-30 minutes prior to receiving test material. During the&#xD;
      first five treatment periods, subjects will receive a single dose of SRT2104 or matched&#xD;
      placebo; during the last treatment period, subjects will receive 30 mg open-label&#xD;
      prednisolone. Assessments will be performed until 24 hours post dose in each treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to sign the informed consent form(s) at the screening visit. If&#xD;
      eligible and willing to participate, subjects will enter into the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      required to attend the research unit in a fasted state (at least 10 hours without food) on&#xD;
      six separate occasions (treatment visits) during the study. There will be at least a 7-day&#xD;
      washout period between treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first five treatment visits, subjects will receive one of the following five&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. 250 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (one active SRT2104 250 mg capsule +&#xD;
      seven placebo capsules) B. 500 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (two active&#xD;
      SRT2104 250 mg capsules + six placebo capsules) C. 1000 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral&#xD;
      capsules (four active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + four placebo capsules) D. 2000 mg SRT2104&#xD;
      administered as eight oral capsules (eight active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + zero placebo&#xD;
      capsules) E. Eight placebo capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last treatment visit, subjects will receive 30 mg of open-label prednisolone&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to return to the research unit 24 hours after dosing in each&#xD;
      treatment period in order to gather the required PK and PD samples. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the study center for an End of Study safety assessment 7 to 10 days after the last&#xD;
      treatment visit.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be required to attend the research unit in a fasted state (at least 10 hours without food) on six separate occasions (treatment visits) during the study. At approximately the same time every morning, subjects will consume a standard, non-high-fat meal (approximately 650 kcal with 30% of calories derived from fat). Test material (per treatment) will be administered within 15-30 minutes following the meal. There will be at least a 7-day washout period between treatment visits.&#xD;
During the first five treatment visits, subjects will receive one of the following treatments in the form of 8 capsules: 0.25g SRT2104, 0.5g SRT2104, 1g SRT2104, 2g SRT2104, or placebo.&#xD;
During the last treatment visit, subjects will receive 30 mg of open-label prednisolone tablets.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study is open to healthy male and female volunteers, 18 to 60 years of age, with&#xD;
             hematology, clinical chemistry, electrolytes, serology, and urinalysis tests within&#xD;
             normal, allowable limits using normal laboratory values (if out-of-range values&#xD;
             result, they must be considered clinically significant by the Investigator to be&#xD;
             exclusionary) and performed within 21 days to 1 day of receiving the first dose of&#xD;
             test material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All male subjects and their female partners must be willing and able to use an&#xD;
             acceptable form of double-barrier birth control (hormonal or double barrier method of&#xD;
             birth control [condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with&#xD;
             spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]; true abstinence) for at least 12&#xD;
             weeks after the last treatment dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this&#xD;
             study, non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a&#xD;
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
             spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L)&#xD;
             is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
             status is in doubt will be required to use adequate contraception (hormonal or double&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control [condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]; true abstinence) for&#xD;
             the duration of the study dosing and for at least 12 weeks after the last treatment&#xD;
             dose, if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method].&#xD;
