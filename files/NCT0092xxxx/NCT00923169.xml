      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GC1008 is a genetically engineered antibody designed to block the activity of&#xD;
           transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Although TGF-beta has some normal and&#xD;
           beneficial effects in the body, it is often over-produced in malignant melanoma tumors,&#xD;
           and it can help the melanoma grow and spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 of this study enrolled 22 subjects with malignant melanoma or kidney cancer to&#xD;
           determine the highest safe dose of GC1008, which was found to be 15 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three of 22 patients with malignant melanoma in Part 1 of the study developed skin&#xD;
           problems, but it is not known if these problems were related to the administration of&#xD;
           GC1008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the frequency of adverse skin side effects of GC1008 in patients with malignant&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age and older with malignant melanoma for whom previous treatment was&#xD;
      not successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GC1008 is given intravenously (through a vein) at a dose of 15 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for&#xD;
           four doses on study days 0, 28, 42 and 56 (one treatment cycle). Patients whose cancer&#xD;
           responds to GC1008 may receive one or two additional treatment cycles of four doses&#xD;
           given every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and vital signs on study days 1, 14, 28, 42, 56, 84 and 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitals signs on study days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 84 and 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent blood sample collections for routine safety tests, measurement of blood levels&#xD;
           of GC1008, analysis for antibodies against GC1008 and for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI scan, bone scan and PET CT scan before treatment and on study day 84 and 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy of apparently normal skin before treatment and again on day 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medicines and well being on study days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 84, 112 and 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits every 3 months for up 2 years for patients who have not received&#xD;
           additional treatment for their cancer. Evaluations include physical exam, CT or MRI&#xD;
           scan, PET CT scan, blood tests and possibly tumor biopsies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFBeta) is a member of a large family of evolutionarily&#xD;
      conserved proteins with broad activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paradoxically, TGFBeta is involved in both preventing malignant transformation of cells and&#xD;
      promoting tumor progression by enhancing the proteolysis of extracellular matrix, stimulating&#xD;
      tumor cell migration, tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis and inhibiting the immune response to&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC1008 is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes all isoforms of TGFBeta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC1008 reduced metastatic burden and enhanced immune responses against cancers in preclinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and safety of&#xD;
      GC1008 in patients with locally advanced of metastatic renal cell carcinoma or malignant&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic data on GC1008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate tumor response as a preliminary assessment of clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess possible surrogate markers that might predict clinical efficacy by obtaining tumors&#xD;
      and blood samples for exploratory biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with locally advanced, surgically inoperable metastatic renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      or malignant melanoma. The Part 2 cohort expansion will accrue only malignant melanoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have failed greater than or equal to 1 prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 gm/dL granulocyte count (ANC)&#xD;
      of greater than or equal to 1500/miocroliter and platelets greater than or equal to&#xD;
      100,000/microliter; creatinine less than or equal to 2 mg/dL, serum bilirubin less than or&#xD;
      equal to 1.5 x ULN, meet criteria for AST/ALT and have a normal PT/PTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable disease by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must test negative for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immune&#xD;
      deficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient must be greater than 4-weeks since major surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be treated with a single intravenous dose of GC1008 at&#xD;
      doses of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg as prescribed by the protocol (This part has been completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: A cohort expansion will treat an additional 6 subjects with GC1008 15 mg/kg to&#xD;
      estimate the frequency of unacceptable skin adverse events (e.g., keratoacanthomas, etc). If&#xD;
      an unacceptable frequency of skin adverse events are observed, an additional 6 subjects will&#xD;
      be treated at the lower dose of 10 mg/kg to determine the phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be observed for adverse events and PK studies obtained for 4-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then receive three additional doses of GC1008 at same dose every 2-weeks.&#xD;
      Responding patients and those with stable disease may receive additional treatments.&#xD;
