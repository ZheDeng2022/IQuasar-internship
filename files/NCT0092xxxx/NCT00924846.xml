      Background/Objectives: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is a frequent cause of&#xD;
      pediatric ICU admission. Early treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) plus conventional&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (CMV) improves oxygenation, responsiveness being significantly&#xD;
      influenced by alveolar recruitment level. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFV) is&#xD;
      conceptually very attractive as constant mean airway pressure optimizes lung recruitment;&#xD;
      this could maximize iNO effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To analyze the effects of HFV on oxygenation indexes in AHRF children under CMV and&#xD;
      iNO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Children with AHRF (oxygenation index ≥10) aged between one month and 14 years under&#xD;
      CMV with PEEP≥10cmH2O and 5ppm iNO for 1h were randomly assigned to CMV (CMVG, n=12) or HFV&#xD;
      (HFVG, n=12) in a crossover design. Children with chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases were&#xD;
      excluded. Patients were kept under one of the two ventilation modes for 8h, crossing to the&#xD;
      other for 8h, and then back again to complete 24h observation. Blood gas analysis,&#xD;
      oxygenation indexes, and hemodynamic variables were recorded at enrollment (Tind), 1h after&#xD;
      iNO start and then every 4h (T4h etc). The Mann-Whitney U test compared group ages and PRISM&#xD;
      scores, and the Fisher test genders. Moments and groups were compared by repeated measure&#xD;
      analysis for independent groups. Significance was considered at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is a frequent cause of admission and complicates&#xD;
      evolution of critically ill children. Mortality rate is still high, mainly when acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) evolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management of AHRF is essentially supportive and includes control of underlying&#xD;
      infections, fluid balance and hemodynamic status, nutritional support, and optimized&#xD;
      protective mechanical ventilation4,5,6. Ventilatory strategies should be directed at&#xD;
      minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), eliminating oxygen toxicity, and&#xD;
      controlling lung inflammation. Also, when hypoxemia persists, additional treatments may be&#xD;
      implemented, such as inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation&#xD;
      (HFOV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we have demonstrated that early treatment with iNO associated with protective&#xD;
      conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) causes acute and sustained improvement in&#xD;
      oxygenation, with earlier reduction in ventilator settings that are associated with a high&#xD;
      risk of VILI and oxygen toxicity; this might contribute to reducing the mortality rate in&#xD;
      children with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many studies have given no value to iNO therapy because of a lack of impact on&#xD;
      mortality rate. Despite this, it should be considered that the improvement in oxygenation&#xD;
      promoted by NO inhalation may be useful as rescue therapy. Also, it is known that&#xD;
      responsiveness to iNO can be significantly influenced by applying sufficient positive and&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP), as this seems to recruit additional alveoli for gas exchange. In&#xD;
      this sense, HFOV is very attractive as the application of a constant mean airway pressure&#xD;
      maintains an &quot;open lung&quot; and optimizes lung recruitment; this could maximize iNO effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experimental studies have shown increased iNO effects when the gas was used together with&#xD;
      HFOV. In ARDS adults, Authors studied this association and demonstrated improvement in&#xD;
      oxygenation with significant reduction in FiO2, probably due to the degree of alveolar&#xD;
      recruitment during HFOV which may increase the amount of alveolar/capillary interface&#xD;
      available for iNO to act upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatrics, there is one study combining iNO and HFOV in newborn babies with severe&#xD;
      persistent pulmonary hypertension which concluded that the association is often more&#xD;
      successful than each treatment alone23. After neonatal period, a retrospective (post hoc)&#xD;
      data analysis from a multicenter, randomized controlled trial on the effects of iNO in the&#xD;
      treatment of AHRF concluded that the combination of HFOV with iNO causes greater improvement&#xD;
      in oxygenation than either treatment strategy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the question about the potential role of the association between iNO therapy and&#xD;
      HFOV in AHRF children is still open and remains to be defined. Our hypothesis is the&#xD;
      association between early iNO treatment and HFOV improves oxygenation more consistently and&#xD;
      for longer time than the association of the gas with protective conventional mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of HFOV on oxygenation indexes in AHRF&#xD;
      children under CMV and iNO therapy.&#xD;
