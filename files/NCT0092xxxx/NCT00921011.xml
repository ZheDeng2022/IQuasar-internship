      The study hypothesis (or theory) is that monthly loss of iron before menopause may reduce&#xD;
      women's risk of hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses noninvasive, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of arteries in&#xD;
      women entering menopause. This will help to determine if there is a correlation between iron&#xD;
      accumulation and hardening of the arteries. In addition, blood levels of hormones will be&#xD;
      measured to help show differences due to hormone levels vs. iron accumulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is the underlying disease responsible for the&#xD;
      vast majority of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and afflicted over 30 million&#xD;
      Americans in 2005. While the prevalence of atherosclerosis is similar in women and men, women&#xD;
      enjoy a ~5-10 year lag in onset of cardiovascular events compared to men. After menopause, a&#xD;
      state defined by marked reduction in ovarian hormone production, the incidence of events such&#xD;
      as heart attack and stroke caused by atherosclerotic plaque rises up to threefold regardless&#xD;
      of age range. This has prompted numerous investigations of hormone therapy (HT) to lower&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk to premenopausal levels. Therapeutic trials, however, have not realized a&#xD;
      cardiovascular benefit; in fact, initiating HT in large randomized trials did not decrease&#xD;
      and possibly increased cardiovascular risk. Studies of coronary heart disease prevention have&#xD;
      shown mixed results using estrogen alone vs. estrogen plus progestin, while studies of stroke&#xD;
      prevention have consistently shown increased risk with HT. Clearly, different therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions warrant consideration. This proposal seeks to investigate a novel perspective&#xD;
      using longitudinal clinical studies in women at risk of atherosclerosis. The studies involve&#xD;
      a new noncontrast, noninvasive MRI method with blood tests that measure cholesterol, hormone&#xD;
      levels, and inflammation.&#xD;
