      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pharmacokinetic (PK) study of a new drug involves taking several blood samples over a&#xD;
           period of time from study participants to determine how the body handles the substance.&#xD;
           These studies provide critical information about new drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Often, patients or parents of children in drug studies choose not to participate in&#xD;
           optional PK studies that are part of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A better understanding of why patients or families do or do not agree to participate in&#xD;
           PK studies may help researchers make it easier for people to participate in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn why some people do or do not agree to participate in PK blood sampling studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older and parents or guardians of children who are&#xD;
           participating in a study of a drug that includes the option of participating in PK&#xD;
           sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants fill out a 2-page survey asking about why they did or did not participate&#xD;
           in the study's PK sampling.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic studies provide critical information about the disposition of anticancer&#xD;
      drugs in children. However, participation of children in the pharmacokinetic portion of phase&#xD;
      I studies is optional when there is not prospect of direct benefit to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of participation in optional PK studies on COG Phase I Consortium Studies has been&#xD;
      60-70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no recent data on why families do or do not agree to participate in optional PK&#xD;
      studies. Understanding families' reasons may reveal barriers to participation that could be&#xD;
      overcome, leading to increased participation rates in optional PK sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use a simple 2 page survey to gather preliminary information on why parents/children agree&#xD;
      to participate in Phase I Studies do or do not agree to participate in the voluntary&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) portion of those studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (greater than or equal to 18 years old) or parents/guardians of subjects who are&#xD;
      minors who consented to Phase I studies with optional PK sampling with the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for the primary Phase I treatment protocol must be active (not withdrawn).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No limit on the number of prior Phase I studies in which the subject or subject's child&#xD;
      participated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may only participate in this study once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual who provided consent to the treatment study that included optional PK sampling&#xD;
      will complete a short questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (n=50) from a convenience sample will complete and return the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for participating or agreeing to participate will be tabulated. Correlations between&#xD;
      answers and subject demographics, time required by PK, need for additional IV will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will meet off study criteria when the questionnaire is returned, lost to follow up,&#xD;
      or consent for data submission to this or the primary treatment protocol is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total accrual is 50 subjects. Accrual ceiling at the POB, NCI is 25 subjects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who consented within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment on this questionnaire&#xD;
             study to a Phase 1 study that included optional PK sampling. (If the subject was a&#xD;
             minor and a parent or legally authorized representative provided consent, subject for&#xD;
             this questionnaire study refers to the parent). The PK questionnaire should be&#xD;
             completed within 4 weeks of when the subject consented to the study that included&#xD;
             optional PK sampling. (Note: The Phase 1 study need not have been a COG study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are eligible regardless of whether they initially agreed to participate in&#xD;
             the PK portion and regardless of whether they actually completed the PK sampling (as&#xD;
             long as reason for not completing the sampling was not withdrawal of consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have withdrawn consent to the study that included optional PK&#xD;
             sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have initially agreed to optional PK sampling but then withdrawn&#xD;
             consent for sampling prior to completing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are eligible regardless of how many phase 1 or other studies they have&#xD;
             enrolled in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject may participate only once in the survey.&#xD;
