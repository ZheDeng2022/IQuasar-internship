      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blister fluid contains many of the same biomarkers (substances that can be used to&#xD;
           determine the effects of certain kinds of treatments) as blood and urine samples,&#xD;
           particularly regarding changes in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Radiation Oncology Branch and others are conducting research studies that require&#xD;
           blood and urine samples from healthy volunteers and from patients with cancer. In&#xD;
           addition to these samples, researchers would like to collect the fluid from blisters to&#xD;
           examine markers of inflammation in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare blood, urine, and blister fluid samples of patients with cancer who are&#xD;
           undergoing radiation therapy to that of volunteers without cancer who will not be&#xD;
           receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gather more information about the effects of radiation therapy on the skin and body&#xD;
           fluids of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who will be receiving radiation therapy for either&#xD;
           breast or prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A separate group of healthy volunteers will also participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood samples to determine eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blister induction, conducted before the start of radiation treatment, at completion of&#xD;
           radiotherapy (last day of treatment), and at a visit 12 months after the end of&#xD;
           radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blisters will be created through the use of a suction blister device on the hip (for&#xD;
           patients with prostate cancer) or on the treated breast or location of removed breast&#xD;
           (for patients with breast cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blisters will take approximately 30 minutes to form, and fluid will be removed with a&#xD;
           needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples will also be collected at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation treatment for breast or prostate cancer will be conducted according to&#xD;
           standard procedures, or as directed by a separate research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test&#xD;
           for women who can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after the end of radiation therapy for&#xD;
           physical examination and disease assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study will end 1 year after the final radiation treatment, upon the collection of the&#xD;
           final (third) blister fluid sample.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blister fluid has been used to measure cytokine expression, proteomic profiles, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in a variety of disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blister fluid inside radiation treatment fields has been shown to have altered expression of&#xD;
      cytokines and products of collagen metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of blister fluid in normal skin inside and outside the radiation field may allow&#xD;
      the development of a minimally invasive marker of radiation exposure or damage induced by&#xD;
      radiation in irradiated skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will evaluate the ability to determine a cytokine pattern and global changes at&#xD;
      the protein level measured in blister fluid that correlates with radiation exposure, absorbed&#xD;
      skin dose, or skin toxicity from patients receiving radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in whom radiotherapy is required for standard management of theirbreast or prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers with no history of cutaneous inflammatory condition of the skin such as&#xD;
      eczema, or psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to evaluate blister fluid in and out of the radiation field in&#xD;
      patients that are receiving radiation therapy and in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo blister induction and blister fluid collection prior to treatment&#xD;
      outside of the radiation field, and after completion of radiation within the radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blisters will be induced in a non-sun exposed area and if possible in matched sites (i.e.&#xD;
      left and right).&#xD;
