    <textblock>
      This study will collect tumor samples from people with cancers of the blood, bone marrow, or&#xD;
      lymph glands for laboratory study of the biology of these conditions. Such studies contribute&#xD;
      to a better understanding of cancer biology and to the development of new treatments. Planned&#xD;
      studies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of individual cancer cells and to search for differences compared to other&#xD;
           types of cancer and normal cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the chromosomes and genes in cancer cells and to search for differences&#xD;
           compared to other types of cancer and normal cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of sensitive methods to detect small amounts of cancer that remain after&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for new cancer proteins that might serve as targets for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of methods to develop cancer vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from birth to 75 years of age with acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and other hematologic malignancies may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood or bone marrow samples will be collected when sampling is required for the patient's&#xD;
      medical care. Cells from some individuals will be grown in test tubes, establishing cell&#xD;
      lines or in animals, establishing xenograft models. (A xenograft is transplantation of cells&#xD;
      of one species to another species.)&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of&#xD;
      pathophysiology and to the development of new therapies for hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to facilitate biologic study of leukemias, pre-malignant&#xD;
      conditions, myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphomas, and other blood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a sample acquisition protocol for targeted study of hematologic malignancies by a&#xD;
      collaborative network of NIH investigators from multiple Institutes/Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. A variety of laboratory investigations designed to support NIH&#xD;
      translational trials; to apply new methodologies in the study of cellular, and molecular&#xD;
      biology; to probe for new therapeutic targets; and to develop new treatment approaches will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of any hematologic malignancy or pre-malignant conditions, including but not&#xD;
      restricted to the following: Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia&#xD;
      (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), Juvenile&#xD;
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML, J-CML), Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin s Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue that has been previously collected and is available for study or that can be&#xD;
      collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during sampling required for routine&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient age: birth to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic assays relevant to the investigation of hematologic malignancies will be performed&#xD;
      in an exploratory fashion, some studies are developmental, i.e., assay design in support of&#xD;
      current or planned CC clinical trials. Others are standard assays that will be applied in&#xD;
      attempt to identify new targets or test new therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
