      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser therapy can help the&#xD;
      recovery process for the procedure of liposuction of the thighs, hips and stomach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Erchonia EML Laser is designed to administer low level laser therapy (LLLT). It has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that LLLT may reduce pain and promote nerve regeneration through the speculated&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immune enhancement properties of the therapy. Prior research has&#xD;
      indicated LLLT to be a potentially safe and effective means of reducing pain. This clinical&#xD;
      study was designed to evaluate the potential of the Erchonia EML Laser in offering a novel&#xD;
      means of delivering LLLT to reduce pain and enhance healing following liposuction.&#xD;
