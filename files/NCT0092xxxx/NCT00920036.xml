      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a handheld biofeedback device as&#xD;
      an adjunct treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and to estimate its clinical&#xD;
      effect size. A recent summary of 22 studies on OIF/OEF (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation&#xD;
      Enduring Freedom) veterans revealed that many individual and system factors (e.g., stigma,&#xD;
      concern about promotion/employment, lack of providers) prevented access to mental health&#xD;
      services. For veterans who did seek help, the largest treatment trials of pharmacologic,&#xD;
      outpatient psychotherapy, and residential treatment programs were not very effective.&#xD;
      Currently, prolonged exposure therapy is the most validated PTSD treatment. The VHA enrollees&#xD;
      from OIF/OEF are more likely to live in rural areas, hindering them from pursuing treatment&#xD;
      due to travel distance and time commitment. Thus, new treatments and delivery methods are&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial body of preclinical literature documents autonomic nervous system (ANS)&#xD;
      dysregulation in patients with PTSD. Preliminary results suggest that portable heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV)/respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback is a promising adjunct&#xD;
      treatment for autonomic arousal disorders. The StressEraser, a HRV/RSA biofeedback device, is&#xD;
      indicated for relaxation, relaxation training, and stress reduction. This small handheld&#xD;
      device measures and displays real-time RSA via an infrared finger sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were able to randomize 16 OIF/OEF veterans receiving care for PTSD at CAVHS&#xD;
      community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) to a 24-week course of StressEraser use (N=8)&#xD;
      versus usual care (N=8). A trouble-shooting phone call to participants occurred at 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Follow-up clinical assessments occurred at 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment consisted of a screening interview for comorbid anxiety and substance&#xD;
      use disorders, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 9-item depression Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and a quality of life measure (Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self&#xD;
      Administered [QWB-SA]). In addition, psychophysiologic assessment of reactivity and&#xD;
      attentional bias to combat-related PTSD relevant stimuli occurred through virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) and acoustic startle stimuli at the North Little Rock psychophysiologic reactivity lab.&#xD;
      The StressEraser group was trained to operate the device at baseline and instructed to use it&#xD;
      for 5-20 minutes daily before bedtime for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At six weeks, a research assistant phoned the StressEraser group to address any problems with&#xD;
      the device and the usual care group to insure adherence with ongoing treatment. The 12-week&#xD;
      assessment involved phoning both groups to administer the psychometric measures (CAPS, PHQ-9,&#xD;
      and QWB-SA). At 24 weeks, the sample returned to the lab for administration of the&#xD;
      psychometric measures and assessment of psychophysiologic reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the StressEraser group returned the device. The time spent using the&#xD;
      StressEraser and the total number of resonant frequency respirations were the feasibility&#xD;
      measures. The StressEraser logged the date, time, and duration of use and the amount of&#xD;
      resonant frequency breathing, which is the resonance between the respiratory and baroreflex&#xD;
      rhythms, the two primary sources of cardiac stimulation. Acceptability was measured through a&#xD;
      short debriefing interview.&#xD;

      The aims of this proposal are to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using a&#xD;
      handheld biofeedback intervention as an adjunct treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) and to estimate the effect size of the biofeedback intervention as an adjunct&#xD;
      treatment for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent RAND Corporation Report summarized 22 studies of OIF/OEF (Operation Iraqi&#xD;
      Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom) veterans, giving a typical range of 5-15% for veterans&#xD;
      meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD, with some studies reporting rates as high as 30%. Of&#xD;
      those active duty service members meeting criteria for mental health referral based on the&#xD;
      post-deployment health assessment, only about half (41.8-61.0%) received mental health&#xD;
      services. Many individual and system factors (e.g., stigma, concern about&#xD;
      promotion/employment, wait times, lack of providers) prevented access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, for those veterans who access treatment for combat-related PTSD, the largest&#xD;
      treatment trials of pharmacologic, outpatient psychotherapy, and residential treatment&#xD;
      programs have not shown these treatments to be very effective. More recently, the Institute&#xD;
      of Medicine has recommended prolonged exposure therapy as the most validated of PTSD&#xD;
      treatments. However, rural OIF/OEF veterans are hindered by travel distance and the time&#xD;
      commitment necessary to receive such recommended treatments. The VA Office of Rural Health&#xD;
      reported that VHA enrollees from OIF/OEF were more likely to live in rural areas. Thus, new&#xD;
      treatments and new treatment delivery methods are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial historic and growing preclinical literature documents autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) dysregulation in patients with PTSD. Preliminary results suggest that portable heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV)/ respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback appears to be a&#xD;
      promising adjunct treatment for disorders of autonomic arousal. The StressEraser, a HRV/RSA&#xD;
      biofeedback device, is indicated for relaxation, relaxation training, and stress reduction.&#xD;
      The StressEraser is a small handheld device that measures and displays real-time RSA, a&#xD;
      measure of HRV, via an infrared finger sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomize 30 OIF/OEF veterans receiving care for PTSD at CAVHS community-based&#xD;
      outpatient clinics (CBOC's) to a 24-week course of StressEraser use (N=15) versus usual care&#xD;
      (N=15). The baseline assessment will consist of a screening interview for comorbid anxiety&#xD;
      and substance use disorders, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 9-item&#xD;
      depression Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to determine symptoms of depression, and a&#xD;
      quality of life measure (Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self Administered [QWB-SA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will participate in assessment of psychophysiologic measures in&#xD;
      response to virtual reality (VR) and acoustic startle stimuli and attentional bias measures&#xD;
      to combat-related PTSD relevant stimuli. Subjects in the StressEraser group will be trained&#xD;
      to use and demonstrate proficiency in using the device at completion of the baseline&#xD;
      assessment. These subjects will be instructed to use the StressEraser for 5-20 minutes daily&#xD;
      before bedtime for 24 weeks. Follow-up assessments will occur at 12 and 24 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline for both the StressEraser and usual care subjects. Subjects will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone at 6 weeks to address any problems using the StressEraser (intervention group) and to&#xD;
      insure adherence with ongoing treatment in the usual care group. The 12-week assessments will&#xD;
      occur over the phone and address current symptom severity of PTSD (CAPS) and depression&#xD;
      (PHQ-9) and health-related quality of life with the QWB-SA. The 24-week assessment will be&#xD;
      in-person at the psychophysiologic reactivity lab in North Little Rock for repeat assessment&#xD;
      of psychophysiologic measures through VR and acoustic startle stimuli and attentional bias&#xD;
      measures to combat-related PTSD relevant stimuli and will include the psychometric measures.&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to bring the StressEraser with him/her to the 24-week assessment to&#xD;
      document the duration and frequency of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be measured by the amount of time the subject spends using the StressEraser.&#xD;
      The StressEraser logs the date, time, and duration of use. It also logs the amount of&#xD;
      resonant frequency breathing achieved, which is the resonance between the respiratory and&#xD;
      baroreflex rhythms, the two primary sources of cardiac stimulation. This information can be&#xD;
      easily downloaded from the StressEraser device. The feasibility measures will be total&#xD;
      duration of use and total number of resonant frequency respirations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability will be measured using a short debriefing interview at 12 weeks and a longer&#xD;
      debriefing interview at 24 weeks. Additional measures will include change in CAPS, PHQ-9, and&#xD;
      QWB-SA scores measured at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks and changes in psychophysiologic&#xD;
      reactivity at 24 weeks compared to baseline.&#xD;
