  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the duration and direct cost of pediatric primary&#xD;
      care visits consisting of medical concerns only, behavioral concerns only, and medical and&#xD;
      behavioral concerns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial issues of children and adolescents are often brought&#xD;
      to the attention of primary care physicians by parents (Smith, Rost, &amp; Kashner, 1995). In&#xD;
      fact, behavioral health concerns are the primary reason for visits to physicians in 15% to&#xD;
      21% of cases (Kelleher, Childs, Wasserman, McInerny, Nutting, &amp; Gardner, 1997; Lavigne,&#xD;
      Gibbons, Arend, Rosenbaum, Binns, &amp; Christoffel, 1999; Williams, Klinepeter, Palmes, Pulley,&#xD;
      &amp; Foy, 2004). During 50% to 80% of child health care visits, parents or physicians raise&#xD;
      concerns of behavioral or psychosocial issues (Cassidy &amp; Jellinek 1998; Fries, Koop, Beadle,&#xD;
      Cooper, England, Greaves, et al., 1993; Sharp, Pantell, Murphy, &amp; Lewis, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several concerns have been raised when patients seek mental health services from primary care&#xD;
      physicians, including an increase in the number of medical visits, an increase in the time&#xD;
      spent with the physician, lost revenue if a patient takes more time than scheduled, a lower&#xD;
      reimbursement rate for mental health issues, limited training in mental health treatment, a&#xD;
      decrease in the number of patients seen, an increase in the risk of physician burnout,&#xD;
      unsatisfied patients, an increase in impairment in patient health and functioning, and an&#xD;
      increase in the use of acute and emergency care (Connor, McLaughlin, Jeffers-Terry, O'Brien,&#xD;
      Stille, Young, &amp; Antonelli, 2006; deGruy, 1997; Leaf, Owens, Levelthal, Forsyth,&#xD;
      Vaden-Kiernan, Epstein, et al., 2004; Strosahl, 2002; Young, Klap, Sherbourne, &amp; Wells,&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited studies examining the time and cost incurred by physicians for treating&#xD;
      patients with behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial issues. Average primary care visits&#xD;
      last between 13 and 17 minutes (Blumenthal, Causino, Chang, Culpepper, Marder, Saglam, et&#xD;
      al., 1999; Bryant &amp; Shimizu, 1988) A more recent study conducted in rural communities found&#xD;
      that physicians spent an average of 5 to 7 minutes longer on visits where behavioral issues&#xD;
      were raised (Cooper, Valleley, Polaha, Begeny, &amp; Evans, 2006). Primary care physicians see&#xD;
      four or five patients per hour (deGruy, 1997), which is an insufficient amount of time for a&#xD;
      detailed psychological assessment or management of mental health symptoms. Therefore,&#xD;
      frequent or longer visits are scheduled. Additionally, physicians are reimbursed for medical&#xD;
      diagnosis but not mental diagnoses (deGruy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on previous work documenting that pediatric primary care visits increased&#xD;
      in duration when behavioral concerns were identified prior to the visit and spontaneously&#xD;
      raised during the visit (Cooper, et al., 2006). Additionally, this study calculates the&#xD;
      reimbursement rate associated with those visits in addition to the duration of the visit.&#xD;
      Finally, this study is a replication of a study previously approved through the University of&#xD;
      Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board (i.e., IRB # 449-07-EP).&#xD;
