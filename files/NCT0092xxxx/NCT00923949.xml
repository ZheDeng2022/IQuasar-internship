      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pioglitazone is a drug that belongs to the class of antidiabetic agents called&#xD;
           thiazolidinediones. It is approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research suggests that the thiazolidinediones may have anticancer activity that can&#xD;
           reduce cancer risk or cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To test how a pioglitazone works as a treatment of Stage IA to IIB Non-Small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (NSCLC) and to look at the effect of the drug on cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age or older who will undergo surgery for Stage IA to IIB non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The study includes a screening visit to determine eligibility, treatment with pioglitazone,&#xD;
      a follow-up visit after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment and a post-surgery visit. Procedures&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history, physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bronchoscopy to obtain cancer cells. This is done before pioglitazone treatment begins&#xD;
           and again during lung surgery. Some patients may also require mediastinoscopy or biopsy&#xD;
           to collect cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment with pioglitazone tablets once a day for at least 2 weeks and no more than 6&#xD;
           weeks, depending on when surgery has been scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan before starting pioglitazone treatment. National&#xD;
           Cancer Institute (NCI) patients also have a follow-up PET scan after treatment but&#xD;
           before surgery.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (US). Chemoprevention&#xD;
      is an active area of investigation for reducing the burden of this disease. However, the&#xD;
      choice of chemopreventive targets requires sufficient human data to justify extensive&#xD;
      clinical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a ligand activated nuclear&#xD;
      transcription factor that is a key regulator of adipogenic differentiation. PPAR gamma&#xD;
      ligands, particularly the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents exemplified by&#xD;
      pioglitazone, are under investigation as chemopreventive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPAR gamma is expressed in normal lung and in NSCLC. PPAR gamma ligands induce apoptosis in&#xD;
      NSCLC cell lines and modulate their differentiation status. Animal carcinogenesis studies,&#xD;
      however, show equivocal efficacy in prevention of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant human data are limited to an epidemiologic study showing that lung cancer risk is&#xD;
      decreased in diabetics taking thiazolidinediones and a small phase IIa trial of pioglitazone&#xD;
      in oral leukoplakia showing an 80% clinical response (partial response (PR)+ complete&#xD;
      response (CR)). Further data are needed prior to engaging in a phase II lung chemoprevention&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this pilot feasibility study are to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on&#xD;
      the expression of multiple biomarkers in NSCLC tumor tissue and in histologically normal and&#xD;
      premalignant tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint will be the effect of pioglitazone on Ki-67, a marker of&#xD;
           proliferation, in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objectives are to determine the effects of pioglitazone on multiple&#xD;
           biomarkers in tumor, premalignant, and histologically normal bronchial epithelium and in&#xD;
           serum:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tumor tissue biomarkers: apoptotic index (AI), cyclin D1, p21/Waf1, PPAR gamma,&#xD;
                mucin 1 (MUC1), gelsolin, proline oxidase, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase&#xD;
                (15-PGDH)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Premalignant tissue biomarkers: Ki-67, apoptotic index, PPAR gamma&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Histologically normal tissue biomarkers: Ki-67, PPAR gamma&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum markers affected by pioglitazone; C-reactive protein, CA 15-3&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum tumor markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the toxicity and safety of pioglitazone in this patient population,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if limited treatment with pioglitazone affects tumor metabolic&#xD;
                activity as determined by fludeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed stage Ia-IIb resectable&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer who are eligible for and scheduled to undergo definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label, multi-center, non-randomized pilot study to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone&#xD;
      on the expression of multiple biomarkers in NSCLC tumor tissue and in histologically normal&#xD;
      and premalignant tissue obtained from treatment-naive individuals who will receive oral&#xD;
      pioglitazone prior to definitive surgery. The primary endpoint is Ki-67 measured in tumor&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive pioglitazone 45 mg po qd for a minimum of 2 weeks or a maximum of 6&#xD;
      weeks, with duration of treatment determined by standard of care and scheduling of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening visit, baseline bronchoscopy with tissue acquisition,&#xD;
      pioglitazone treatment for 2-6 weeks, a 2-week on-treatment clinic visit, definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection with bronchoscopy performed at the time of resection, and a post-surgery visit.&#xD;
      Tissue (visually normal and abnormal areas identified during bronchoscopy) and tumor will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and at the time of surgery. Patients who receive their treatment at NCI&#xD;
      will also undergo a follow up FDG-PET scan after a minimum of 2 weeks of pioglitazone&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 patients are expected to be enrolled to identify 20 patients with adequate tissue&#xD;
      for biomarker analysis.&#xD;

                  consent. Should the bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy be negative for non-small&#xD;
                  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the patient will be taken off study prior to drug&#xD;
                  treatment. At National Cancer Institute (NCI), histologic confirmation of the&#xD;

               2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of less than or equal&#xD;
