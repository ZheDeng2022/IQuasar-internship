      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are trying to learn what causes certain types of cancer to spread to other&#xD;
           organs in the body (metastasis). Cancer tumors may produce a very small number of&#xD;
           specific cells (cancer stem cells) that cause the tumors to grow in other organs&#xD;
           throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By examining cancer tumor tissue, normal tissue, blood, bone marrow, and other body&#xD;
           fluids, researchers may determine whether these samples contain cancer stem cells.&#xD;
           Cancer stem cells may provide information on whether the cancer will come back or spread&#xD;
           before other routine x-ray studies or lab tests indicate its presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To acquire a collection of solid organ cancer stem cells for future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze solid organ cancer stem cells from various types of cancer on a genetic&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if solid organ cancer stem cells are present in the blood or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 16 years of age and older who have solid organ cancer (cancer in the liver,&#xD;
           colon, rectum, anus, pancreas, stomach, breast, skin, muscles, fat, connective tissue,&#xD;
           uterus, ovary, cervix, vagina, vulva, or inner lining of the abdomen) or a precancerous&#xD;
           growth, and who are scheduled to have a biopsy or surgery to remove the cancer as part&#xD;
           of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective trial designed to procure solid organ cancer stem cells before&#xD;
           either surgery or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients registered to this trial will undergo surgery to extirpate their cancer in&#xD;
           the NCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to surgery or biopsy, 8 tablespoons of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the surgery or biopsy, a sample of normal tissue will be removed along with the&#xD;
           cancerous or precancerous tissue. If separate consent is given, samples of bone marrow&#xD;
           will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After discharge, patients will return to the clinic for routine visits every month for&#xD;
           the first 3 months following surgery, and then about every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
           then every 6 months for 3 years. During the visits, patients will have routine blood and&#xD;
           imaging studies done, and researchers will take additional blood samples (about 8&#xD;
           tablespoons at each visit) and optional bone marrow samples (4 teaspoons every 6 months)&#xD;
           to be used for research.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traditional models of cancer metastasis posit that cancer metastases might originate&#xD;
           stochastically in any cancer cell while, the Cancer-Stem-Cell hypothesis suggests that&#xD;
           the metastasizing cells are Solid Organ Cancer Stem Cells (SOCSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOCSC are relatively resistant to current cancer therapies. Thus, effective treatment&#xD;
           for metastatic cancers might require the targeting of SOCSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge on SOCSC is chiefly derived from cell lines. However, data suggest vast&#xD;
           differences between cell lines and SOCSC obtained from fresh tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is designed to facilitate fresh tissue procurement to study SOCSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To study the natural history of SOCSC from various primary and metastatic solid organ&#xD;
      cancers using established phenotypic and functional markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze SOCSC for potential targets that can be used to design novel cancer therapies&#xD;
           that target cancer stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether SOCSC are present in the blood and/or bone marrow, and study their&#xD;
           quantitative and/or qualitative changes from time of surgical resection to time of&#xD;
           recurrence and/or metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential of SOCSC and their quantitative and/or qualitative changes&#xD;
           over time after surgery, to be used in future studies as biomarkers for the early&#xD;
           detection of cancer recurrence and/or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect detailed history, demographic, and treatment data as well as perioperative&#xD;
           findings to evaluate potential correlation with the presence or absence of SOCSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop an animal model to investigate potential interaction between bone marrow&#xD;
           derived stem cells and solid organ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the course of normal stem cells over time in patients who had benign tumors&#xD;
           that do not show evidence of cancer over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the course of normal stem cells with that of stem cells from patients with&#xD;
           solid organ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To specifically investigate families with clusters of cancer to determine if there is a&#xD;
           relationship between SOCSC and potential familial genetic mutations specific to a&#xD;
           particular cancer and if present, to compare these genetic abnormalities with&#xD;
           individuals from the same family without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 16 years of age or older with primary or metastatic solid organ cancers&#xD;
           requiring resection or other cancer directed therapy that is deemed in the best interest&#xD;
           of their cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with premalignant neoplasms who are scheduled to undergo surgery or biopsy as&#xD;
           part of their diagnostic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable&#xD;
           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective trial designed to procure SOCSC from various benign and solid&#xD;
           organ cancers tumors (primary or metastatic) and follow their natural history from time&#xD;
           of surgery and or other cancer directed therapy to time of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOCSC will be isolated using phenotypic and functional markers. Investigations will be&#xD;
           performed on the following tissues: Blood prior and after surgery, tumor and adjacent&#xD;
           normal tissue when available, bone marrow (strictly optional under separate consent),&#xD;
           and peritoneal washings when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After surgery blood will be drawn at 1 and 3 months and every 3-6 months thereafter&#xD;
           during the follow-up period (5 years). Bone marrow may be analyzed every six months&#xD;
           during the follow-up period (strictly optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed with standard of care or other cancer directed therapy deemed&#xD;
           in the best interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that between 274 and 676 patients will be enrolled over a period of 5&#xD;
           years (2-5 patients per month).&#xD;
