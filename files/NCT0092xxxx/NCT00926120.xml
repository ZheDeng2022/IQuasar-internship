  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if administering Mogroside Sweetener &quot;PureLo&quot; (the&#xD;
      study substance) for 14 days will lower the hepatitis C viral load and liver function alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels.&#xD;

      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and efficacy of administering&#xD;
      Mogroside Sweetener &quot;PureLo&quot; to genotype 1 subjects at a dose level of 5 grams every 6 hours&#xD;
      for 14 days on hepatitis C viral load and serum ALT levels. Percentage change in HCV load&#xD;
      over the first 48 hours and daily for 14 days and change in serum ALT levels over the two&#xD;
      week period of study, will be calculated for each patient. The number of subjects who show a&#xD;
      decline in viral load of at least 50% will then be calculated, as will the number of subjects&#xD;
      who decrease their serum ALT levels by at least 50%. All efficacy and safety analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted at the end of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum HCV RNA quantifiable &gt; 20,000 copies/mL at screening period and demonstrate&#xD;
             abnormal ALT &gt; 40 for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinical suspicion or radiological evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and a serum&#xD;
             AFP &lt; 50 ng/mL.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interferon with or without RBV therapy at any previous time or any other systemic&#xD;
