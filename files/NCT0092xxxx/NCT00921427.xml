      The purpose of our study is to explore the efficacy of combination of brain stimulation with&#xD;
      visual rehabilitation in patients with visual field loss resulting from brain lesions. It is&#xD;
      shown that the effect of sensorimotor training of hand can be enhanced in patients with&#xD;
      stroke using brain stimulation. We decided to explore this combination for visual field loss&#xD;
      because visual dysfunction following brain lesions is considered intractable. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that combination of noninvasive brain stimulation, in the form of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS), with visual rehabilitation would have greater efficacy than visual&#xD;
      rehabilitation alone.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this study is to improve recovery of visual function after brain injury.&#xD;
      A prominent theme of current neuroscience research regarding the sequelae of brain injury&#xD;
      posits that activity-dependent plasticity underlies neuro-recovery. If that is the case,&#xD;
      there is good reason to believe that neurological changes underling recovery can be&#xD;
      facilitated by established means of enhancing cortical activity. Studies suggest that&#xD;
      altering cortical excitability may prime or prepare the cortex for subsequent training and&#xD;
      furthermore, may improve overall functional outcomes (Webster et al, 2006; Brown &amp; Pilitsis,&#xD;
      2006; Khedr et al, 2005). The working hypothesis of this pilot study is that computer-based&#xD;
      visual rehabilitative training (using NovaVision's Vision Restoration TherapyTM; &quot;VRT&quot;&#xD;
      software) enhances visual function (defined as an increase in functional visual field) by&#xD;
      reinforcing synaptic connections within sensory networks of visual cortex associated with the&#xD;
      visual field loss (Kasten et al., 1998; Sabel, 1999). Potentially, this reinforcement can be&#xD;
      enhanced by concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) leading in turn, to&#xD;
      enhanced visual performance (quantified by the extent of visual field measured by visual&#xD;
      perimetry allowing for a direct statistical comparison of visual field change over time and&#xD;
      on an individual basis) in patients with partial of complete hemianopic visual field loss&#xD;
      caused by brain injury. Both computer based visual rehabilitative training and TDCS are&#xD;
      established techniques and this novel approach aims to provide preliminary data regarding the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of a combined intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that results from this study will provide an objective basis for a larger, formal&#xD;
      randomized controlled study combining the two therapies. Our long term goals are to maximize&#xD;
      the benefits of a modern vision rehabilitative therapy, lay the groundwork for&#xD;
      neurophysiological correlates associated with the recovery of visual function following brain&#xD;
      injury and propose possible refinements for future neurorehabilitation strategies. Data from&#xD;
      our collaborators at Columbia University Medical Center as well as others indicate that a 6&#xD;
      month course treatment therapy of VRT can lead to dramatic improvements in visual function&#xD;
      (as quantified by increases in functional visual field) (Kasten et al., 1998; Kasten et al.,&#xD;
      2006). TDCS is well known to bring about transient positive changes in both functional as&#xD;
      well as electrophysiological measures of cortical brain function. If overall visual function&#xD;
      can be further enhanced via a combined synergetic effect of VRT and TDCS, we will conduct a&#xD;
      larger randomized controlled study. If there is no enhancement effect with combined TDCS and&#xD;
      VRT, we will need to reconsider factors as to why this is the case. For example, a lack of&#xD;
      enhancement effect could be related to patient selection including the degree and&#xD;
      profoundness of vision loss prior to treatment, the age of the individual and duration of the&#xD;
      insult, as well as their level of motivation in participating with the computer-based&#xD;
      training program. Other considerations include longer combined treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The loss of visual function following brain injury can be highly debilitating for an&#xD;
      individual. Typically, damage to the occipital cortex or optic radiations following a brain&#xD;
      lesion or trauma leads to a loss of visual function in visuotopically corresponding parts of&#xD;
      the visual field while sparing the remaining areas (e.g. half the visual field as in the case&#xD;
      with hemianopia). This partial blindness and loss in visual function has generally been&#xD;
      considered untreatable due to the fact that the highly specific neuronal organization&#xD;
      underlying normal visual function is determined early in development and not regenerative&#xD;
      particularly after the &quot;critical period&quot; of development has been reached. More recent&#xD;
      evidence (including that from our laboratory) has demonstrated that a considerable degree of&#xD;
      plasticity and reorganization of the visual system occurs not only after cerebral damage but&#xD;
      also in adulthood, that is, well after the critical period of development has occurred. For&#xD;
      example, evidence of spontaneous post-lesion neuroplasticity has been demonstrated in the&#xD;
      adult visual system as documented by extensive receptive field reorganization following&#xD;
      lesions in the retina or visual cortex (e.g. Kass 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-based training strategies have been developed to train and rehabilitate various&#xD;
      cerebral functions such as language learning deficits. Computer-based training has also been&#xD;
      extensively studied as a treatment for partial blindness in adult brain-injured patients&#xD;
      (Kasten et al., 1998; Sabel and Trauzettel-Klosinksi, 2005; Sabel et al., 2005). However, the&#xD;
      neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the reported beneficial effect following VRT remains&#xD;
      poorly understood. One important issue is that if the restoration of visual field and&#xD;
      function is the result of localized neuroplastic changes in cortical circuitry within visual&#xD;
      cortex, one can posit that modulation of cortical excitability should in turn influence the&#xD;
      degree of this restorative effect. More specifically, increasing the level of overall&#xD;
      cortical excitability of the visual cortex should potentiate synaptic neuroplastic&#xD;
      interactions and thus translate into improved visual functional gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) represents a noninvasive method of brain&#xD;
      stimulation that could potentially modulate such an effect. TDCS utilizes low amplitude&#xD;
      direct currents applied via scalp electrodes to inject currents in the brain and thus&#xD;
      modulate the level of excitability. Direct Current (DC) stimulation has been used in various&#xD;
      forms since the inception of modern electrophysiology at the beginning of nineteenth century.&#xD;
      There has been a recent upsurge in interest in TDCS as a tool for neuroscience research as&#xD;
      well as an assessment and treatment modality for various neurological and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders including depression, Parkinsonism, stroke recovery, and chronic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      TDCS has the distinct advantage of being inexpensive, easy to administer, noninvasive and&#xD;
      painless. We have extensive experience with TDCS and are currently running parallel studies.&#xD;
      We now wish to extend these principles into the visual rehabilitation domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRT: Computer-based training strategies have been developed to train and rehabilitate adult&#xD;
      brain-injured patients with partial visual loss due to brain damage (Kasten et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Sabel and Trauzettel-Klosinksi, 2005; Sabel et al., 2005). Vision restoration therapy (VRT)&#xD;
      involves identifying and stimulating regions in the visual field that are only partly damaged&#xD;
      by brain injury or trauma. Patients receive a customized program designed for their visual&#xD;
      field deficits to use at home daily. Through a specific pattern of visual stimuli that gauge&#xD;
      the user's ability to identify and react, users can gradually expand their visual fields and&#xD;
      restore lost vision. The training can be done at home in front of a computer-based device,&#xD;
      usually in 30-minute sessions, twice a day. During the training, hundreds of visual&#xD;
      stimulations are presented on the monitor to the areas of residual vision. It has been&#xD;
      proposed that repetitive stimulation of damaged visual areas leads to neuroplastic changes&#xD;
      altering nerve activity related to vision, and strengthening synaptic interactions that can&#xD;
      help restore some of a person's visual functions. Work by Sabel and colleagues reported&#xD;
      findings from fifteen patients that underwent six and 12 months of VRT (Kasten et al., 2006).&#xD;
      Visual field assessments were performed before and after VRT and then repeated an average of&#xD;
      46 months after completing VRT. After six months of VRT, sample stimulus detection increased&#xD;
      significantly from about 54% to 63%. The number of undetected stimuli decreased significantly&#xD;
      in both eyes. Continuing VRT for 12 months improved the results achieved at six months. The&#xD;
      follow-up examination after a therapy-free interval of more than three years showed that the&#xD;
      benefits of VRT remained stable, and vision loss did not occur in most instances. According&#xD;
      to this study, patients with vision loss after brain injury benefit regardless of the&#xD;
      severity of the lesion or how much of their vision is affected. Furthermore, the larger the&#xD;
      areas of residual vision, the better the outcome with VRT. It is clear that VRT has varying&#xD;
      results. In this study, one-third of patients studied had little or no effect from VRT,&#xD;
      one-third had moderate but noticeable improvement, and one-third had strong or dramatic&#xD;
      improvement. Patient compliance with VRT is reported to be very good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovaVision VRT™ is the first and only FDA-cleared medical device or rehabilitative therapy&#xD;
      clinically proven to improve visual field defects in brain injury survivors who have become&#xD;
      left partially blind due to their condition. In an on-going multi-center trial sponsored by&#xD;
      NovaVision, over 70% of study participants from 16 U.S. centers who underwent a six-module&#xD;
      (six month) course of therapy showed a three percent or greater improvement in stimulus&#xD;
      detection on visual field testing. The average improvement in stimulus detection was 12&#xD;
      percent. Previous studies suggest that people who regain three percent or more of their&#xD;
      visual field have functional improvements that may include enhanced quality of life through&#xD;
      better reading performance, watching television and playing sports, although functional&#xD;
      outcomes were not measured in this study. These results were presented at the 2007 Academy of&#xD;
      Neurology meeting in Boston, MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS: Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) has been used for several decades.&#xD;
      Numerous human clinical and animal studies have demonstrated that this technique is able to&#xD;
      modulate neuronal activity and function through the delivery of polarizing currents applied&#xD;
      to the surface of the brain. Surface anodal polarization of the cortex increases spontaneous&#xD;
      neuronal activity, whereas cathodal polarization generally depresses neuronal activity&#xD;
      (Creutzfeld et al., 1962). Recent human studies have demonstrated that stimulation with TDCS&#xD;
      changes motor cortex excitability according to the stimulation polarity: whereas anodal&#xD;
      stimulation increases cortical excitability, cathodal stimulation decreases it (Nitsche et&#xD;
      al., 2003a and b). Moreover, and from a clinical therapeutic point of view, the effects of&#xD;
      TDCS appear to be long-standing. For example, 13 minutes of TDCS has been shown to modulate&#xD;
      cortical excitability and last up to 2 hours following the stimulation period itself (Nitsche&#xD;
      and Paulus, 2001). Two recent studies (including one by a co-investigator listed here)&#xD;
      explored the effects of TDCS on motor function in stroke patients and showed that these&#xD;
      modulatory effects of TDCS can be used to improve motor function (Fregni et al., 2005a;&#xD;
      Hummel et al., 2005a and b). Interestingly, similar modulatory effects have also been&#xD;
      described in the visual cortex (Antal et al., 2001; Antal et al., 2004) leading support to&#xD;
      the notion that activity within visual cortical areas can be modulated and in turn lead to&#xD;
      behavioral changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS modulates the excitability of a targeted brain region non-invasively by altering&#xD;
      neuronal membrane potentials (Bindman et al. 1962; Purpura &amp; McMurtry, 1965). Thus, this&#xD;
      technique can be used to increase or decrease the excitability of neurons in a targeted brain&#xD;
      area and this can establish a causal relation between a given region of the brain and a&#xD;
      specific sensory, motor or cognitive function. Unlike Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS), TDCS does not depolarize neurons causing them to fire. TDCS only alters the likelihood&#xD;
      that neurons will fire by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing brain tissue (depending on the&#xD;
      stimulation parameters used). The neurophysiological basis of TDCS has been attributed to a&#xD;
      mechanism akin to long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Hattori et al.&#xD;
      1990; Moriwaki, 1991; Islam et al. 1995). Certain medications such as dextromethorphan (an&#xD;
      NMDA antagonist) suppress post-TDCS stimulation effects of both anodal and cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation which strongly suggests the involvement of NMDA receptors in both types of&#xD;
      DC-induced neuroplasticity. In contrast, Carbamazepine selectively eliminates anodal effects.&#xD;
      Since Carbamazepine stabilizes the membrane potential voltage-dependently, the results reveal&#xD;
      that after-effects of anodal TDCS require a depolarization of membrane potentials (Liebetanz&#xD;
      et al., 2002). This study by Liebetanz et al., (2002) provided pharmacological evidence that&#xD;
      induction of the after-effects of TDCS requires a combination of glutamatergic (excitatory)&#xD;
      and membrane mechanisms, similar to the induction of established types of short- or long-term&#xD;
      neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animals, anodal cortical stimulation of 5-30 minutes has been shown to cause excitability&#xD;
      increases lasting for hours after the stimulation, primarily through modulation of the&#xD;
      resting membrane potential (Terzuolo &amp; Bullock, 1956; Creutzfeldt et al. 1962; Eccles et al.&#xD;
      1962; Bindman et al. 1964; Purpura &amp; McMurtry, 1965; Artola et al. 1990; Malenka &amp; Nicoll,&#xD;
      1999). In humans, 13 min of TDCS resulted in an increase in excitability up to 150% and&#xD;
      lasting 90 min (Nitsche &amp; Paulus, 2001). Research with TDCS has revealed that anodal&#xD;
      stimulation can induce transient (on the order of 30 minutes) improvements in performance on&#xD;
      cognitive, motor and linguistic tasks. For example, Hummel et al. (2005a,b) found that anodal&#xD;
      TDCS delivered to the primary motor area in the lesion hemisphere elicited significant&#xD;
      improvements in motor control of the paretic limb. The effect lasted for more than 25 minutes&#xD;
      after stimulation. In a recent study, Fregni et al (2005a) also verified that anodal TDCS to&#xD;
      the affected hemisphere and cathodal TDCS to the contralesional hemisphere improved motor&#xD;
      function. Other examples highlighting the efficacy of anodal TDCS include Fregni et al.&#xD;
      (2005b) - anodal TDCS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex elicited an improvement in working&#xD;
      memory; Nitsche et al. (2003a) - stimulation to primary motor cortex improved motor learning;&#xD;
      Antal et al. (2004) - TDCS delivered to primary motor area or to visual area V5 induced&#xD;
      improvements in visuo-motor coordination; Kincses et al. (2004) - anodal stimulation of&#xD;
      fronto-polar regions improved probabilistic classification learning; and Lyer et al. (2005) -&#xD;
      left prefrontal cortical stimulation lead to increased verbal fluency. These studies attest&#xD;
      to the efficacy and safety of TDCS in brain injury patients, as well as its potential for&#xD;
      therapeutic applications in brain lesion recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we propose to conduct a pilot experiment testing whether visual function&#xD;
      in-patients with hemianopic field loss caused by brain injury can be improved by combining&#xD;
      transcranial direct stimulation and computer based vision training. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      computer based vision training will reinforce visual cortical networks primed by concurrent&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) and lead to improved visual performance. The&#xD;
      BIDMC investigators will be responsible for TDCS application and VRT, as well as associated&#xD;
      data processing / interpretation.&#xD;
