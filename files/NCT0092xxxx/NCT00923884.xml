      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Lung Cancer section of the National Cancer Institute s Medical Oncology Branch is&#xD;
           running a study to better understand which genes might be important in patients who are&#xD;
           undergoing therapy for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if differences (also called polymorphisms) in specific genes lead to&#xD;
           differences in outcomes (such as treatment success and survival rates) for patients who&#xD;
           have been diagnosed with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a repository of genetic information for future studies of these differences&#xD;
           and their relation to lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any individual who has been diagnosed with lung cancer and is being treated through the&#xD;
           National Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After entrance in this study, patients will provide information to the researchers on&#xD;
           age, gender, race/ethnicity, treatments received and response to treatments, and other&#xD;
           specific information about their disease. This information will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately half a tablespoon of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated for lung cancer with normal treatment methods, as if they had&#xD;
           not been enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some patients may be offered the option of enrolling in separate research protocols for&#xD;
           cancer treatment, involving chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite modern surgical, radiation, and chemotherapeutic interventions, the prognosis&#xD;
           for patients with lung cancer remains poor, with an overall cure rate of less than 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, growth factor and&#xD;
           hormonal receptors, DNA repair enzymes, and transcription factors might affect an&#xD;
           individual s response to chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interindividual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy and&#xD;
           radiation are especially important given the narrow therapeutic index of these&#xD;
           modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many of these differences have not been extensively explored in patients with lung&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship between genetic polymorphisms&#xD;
           and clinical outcomes, with a focus on overall survival, following lung cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand differences in outcome between Caucasian and African American&#xD;
           patients being treated for lung cancer as a function of genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a DNA repository for the investigation of polymorphisms related to outcomes&#xD;
           in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop methodology for the isolation, enumeration and live cell culture of&#xD;
           circulating tumor cells (CTC) from lung cancer patients with microfiltration devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All individuals with the diagnosis of lung cancer being treated at the Washington D.C.&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center or the Medical Oncology Branch of the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single 7-ml sample of venous blood will be obtained from all patients enrolled onto&#xD;
           this study, for isolation of DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two 5 ml samples of venous blood, drawn immediately following the 7 ml sample, will be&#xD;
           obtained from all patients enrolled on this study at the NCI Clinical Center (only), for&#xD;
           CTC studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polymorphisms in the following genes: ABCB1, ABCG2, COMT, CYP17, CYP19, CYP1B1, CYP1A1,&#xD;
           CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, DPYD, EPHX2, ERalpha, ERbeta, ERCC1,&#xD;
           ERCC2, GSTP1, HIF1A, MPO, MTHFR, NQO1, p53, PPARD, SLCO1B3, TYMS, UGT1A1, VEGF, VEGFR,&#xD;
           EGFR, SLC28A1, CDA, XRCC1, OCT1, OCT2, CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 will be analyzed by the&#xD;
           Clinical Pharmacology Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methodology for the isolation, enumeration, and live cell culture of CTC with&#xD;
           microfiltration devices will be developed by the NCI Genetics Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed at the medical oncology clinic at the Washington DC VA Medical&#xD;
           Center or the NCI and the following information will be recorded in a confidential&#xD;
           database: age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking history, histology, stage, treatment(s)&#xD;
           received, response, toxicity, time to disease progression, time to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associations between genetic polymorphisms and response to therapy, toxicity and&#xD;
           clinical outcomes will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results of the CTC studies will be applied to the initial development and clinical&#xD;
&#xD;
      validation of CTC technology and lung cancer assays.&#xD;
