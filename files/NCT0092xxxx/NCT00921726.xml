  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due in part to widespread availability of oseltamivir and clinical experience using&#xD;
      oseltamivir to treat H5N1 influenza virus infections, many strains of influenza have become&#xD;
      resistant to it. Other reliable methods of treating H5N1 must be identified in case of a&#xD;
      pandemic. One such option is intravenous zanamivir used in combination with oseltamivir. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the interaction between oral oseltamivir and&#xD;
      intravenous zanamivir administered as either a continuous or intermittent infusion in healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is very likely that during an influenza pandemic, intravenous zanamivir will be used in&#xD;
      combination with oseltamivir. Although the potential for a drug interaction between the two&#xD;
      drugs is very low, the likelihood of coadministration combined with the common route of renal&#xD;
      clearance of both drugs and the current lack of information on the organic anion transporter&#xD;
      polypeptides (OATP) inhibition potential of zanamivir in vivo warrants verification of a lack&#xD;
      of an interaction. This study will provide clinical guidance for the use of intravenous&#xD;
      zanamivir in settings where oral oseltamivir is commonly used, such as areas in which human&#xD;
      cases of H5N1 have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study participation is approximately 13 weeks. Each participant will&#xD;
      have a screening visit, four treatment steps, and a follow-up visit. The screening visit to&#xD;
      determine enrollment eligibility will be conducted within 45 days prior to receiving the&#xD;
      first dose. Participants will be randomized to receive either Regimen A or B for Step 1.&#xD;
      Participants who received Regimen A will receive Regimen B in Step 2 and vice versa. After&#xD;
      completing Step 2, all participants will continue with Regimens C and D, consecutively, in&#xD;
      Steps 3 and 4, with at least 3 days between each step. A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days&#xD;
      after completing the last treatment assessments or withdrawing from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A consists of continuous intravenous zanamivir infusion (800 mg) for 16 hours.&#xD;
      Regimen B consists of 150 mg oral oseltamivir tablets taken five times over 3 days. Regimen C&#xD;
      consists of 150 mg oral oseltamivir tablets taken five times over 3 days plus continuous&#xD;
      intravenous zanamivir infusion (3600 mg) for 36 hours. Regimen D consists of 150 mg oral&#xD;
      oseltamivir tablets taken five times over 3 days plus intermittent intravenous zanamivir&#xD;
      infusion received in five 30 minute intervals (3000 mg total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine collection, vital signs, pharmacokinetic sampling, adverse event assessment,&#xD;
      and pregnancy test for females will occur at each step in the study. The follow-up visit will&#xD;
      involve blood and urine collection, vital signs, adverse event assessment, and pregnancy test&#xD;
      for females.&#xD;
