      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One standard way of giving radiation is to combine external beam treatments with&#xD;
           internal brachytherapy treatments, which involve short-range radiation therapy that&#xD;
           gives a high dose of radiation directly to a cancer or to the area where cancer cells&#xD;
           were removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachytherapy is done by placing hollow implant device(s) into the area to be treated&#xD;
           and then moving a radiation source into each. The type of device depends on the type of&#xD;
           cancer and the site to be treated. These devices can range from hollow applicators and&#xD;
           needles to balloon-like equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the quality of the brachytherapy procedure at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health s Radiation Oncology Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cancer who could potentially benefit from high-dose brachytherapy as part&#xD;
           of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In conjunction with their existing treatment, patients will be treated with high-dose&#xD;
           brachytherapy as determined appropriate for their particular type of cancer and cancer&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each treatment will take place in the Radiation Oncology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient does not have implant devices, the clinic staff will insert them and&#xD;
           check their placement through a computed tomography (CT) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The calculations to determine the appropriate brachytherapy dose will take a few hours;&#xD;
           the brachytherapy treatment itself will take between 10 and 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of brachytherapy treatments will vary according to the individual needs and&#xD;
           requirements of each type of cancer and each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will return to the Radiation Oncology Clinic for followup visits at 1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
           and 12 months after the completion of radiation therapy. Followup evaluations will&#xD;
           include a medical history and physical examination, assessment of any side effects of&#xD;
           radiation therapy, and a repeat of any imaging (i.e., CT, MRI, X-ray) that was done at&#xD;
           baseline to evaluate the tumor response.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) is a challenging technique utilized in many&#xD;
           malignancies in order to deliver a high dose of radiation therapy to a tumor in a&#xD;
           conformal fashion with a rapid dose fall-off with the objective of sparing normal&#xD;
           surrounding tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HDR therapy has been targeted to particular subsites as an integral part of either&#xD;
           definitive management or palliation for malignancy-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective is to determine the quality of high dose rate brachytherapy&#xD;
           implants performed in the radiation oncology branch. An implant will be adequate if 90%&#xD;
           of the GTV receives 90% of the dose prescribed and 80% of the CTV receives 85% of the&#xD;
           prescribed dose. An implant will be inadequate if the above dose limitations are not&#xD;
           met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate local control and late toxicity rates following brachytherapy at the NCI ROB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase the flow of oncology participants requiring brachytherapy to the NCI ROB, as&#xD;
           these participants lend themselves to special study and have unique educational value&#xD;
           for the purpose of educating nurses, medical students, residents, physicists, clinical&#xD;
           fellows, and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Participants with cancer who could potentially benefit from the use of high dose rate&#xD;
      brachytherapy as a component of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo appropriate work-up and clinical evaluation to determine if&#xD;
           high-dose brachytherapy would be beneficial in either primary treatment or palliation of&#xD;
           their disease. Participants will be treated with high-dose brachytherapy appropriately&#xD;
           sequenced with other modalities in their treatment regimen. This treatment will be&#xD;
           administered in accordance with standard radiation oncology practice and per the ABS&#xD;
           (American Brachytherapy Society) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant s disease status and toxicity outcomes will be documented for a 12-month&#xD;
           period at 3-months intervals.&#xD;

    <description>Brachytherapy, the placement of a radioactive source close to a tumor, is a well-established part of the treatment of many malignancies, both for palliative and definitive applications. High dose brachytherapy is useful in many malignancies in order to deliver a high dose of radiation therapy to tumor in a conformal fashion with a rapid dose fall-off with the objective of sparing normal surrounding tissue.</description>
