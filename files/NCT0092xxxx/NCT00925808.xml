    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study with the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the prevalence of unsuspected VTE in oncology patients on routine staging CT&#xD;
           scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify symptoms commonly associated with VTE that are present in cancer patients&#xD;
           undergoing routine staging CT scans with findings of unsuspected VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify the risk factors and demographic characteristics in outpatient cancer&#xD;
           patients associated with the development of unsuspected VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the incidence of recurrence of new VTE in patients with unsuspected VTE at&#xD;
           3 and 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with cancer are routinely scheduled for staging CT scans. The CT scans are&#xD;
      obtained to stage a new cancer diagnosis, to restage a cancer after treatment initiation or&#xD;
      to evaluate abnormal masses, disease progression or metastasis. The study population will&#xD;
      include outpatients scheduled for routine CT scan of the chest, abdomen and/or pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While patients are waiting in the Diagnostic Imaging waiting area, they will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Study eligibility will be determined by administering a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire. Cancer patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in the study. It is imperative that the patient completes the surveys and not the caregiver.&#xD;
      A caregiver may lend assistance in transcribing the information but may not complete the&#xD;
      instruments independent of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these tools are brief and the estimated completion time should be approximately 15 to&#xD;
      30 minutes. Additionally completing the instruments will not extend beyond the time the&#xD;
      patient is in the CT scan waiting area prior to the scheduled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of study enrollment, patients will be asked to complete Brief Fatigue Inventory&#xD;
      (BFI), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), Dyspnea Numerical Scale (DNS), Cancer Dyspnea&#xD;
      Scale (CDS), ECOG/Zubrod Performance scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), VTE&#xD;
      Symptom Enrollment Questionnaire and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General&#xD;
      (FACT-G). The patients will also complete a questionnaire on symptoms of VTE such as chest&#xD;
      pain, pain or swelling of the extremities and other common symptoms reported in VTE patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VTE Symptom Follow-up Questionnaire:This instrument was designed for this study. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked at 3 and 6 months the treatments received, recurrence of VTE, incidence of&#xD;
      bleeding episodes and other health related conditions.&#xD;
