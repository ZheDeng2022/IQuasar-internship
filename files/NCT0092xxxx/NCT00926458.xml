      The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the value of 5 different non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic methods in patients with chest pain suspected for coronary artery disease. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to include 200 patients over a 3 year period in the study. The&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from patients referred to coronary angiography at the&#xD;
      institution. Before the angiography the participants will (1) test the effect of sublingual&#xD;
      Nitroglycerin, (2) give their medical history so mathematical models can estimate the&#xD;
      probability of the presence of coronary artery disease, (3) take part in a contrast stress&#xD;
      echocardiography and (4) a 2D-strain stress echocardiography and a myocardial scintigraphy.&#xD;
      Stenosis found at the angiography will be the gold standard.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of various non-invasive methods. The&#xD;
      study is divided into five substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy NITRO&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate whether a subjective effect of Nitroglycerine is associated with&#xD;
      significantly narrowed coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are instructed to alternate between rest and Nitroglycerine as treatment for&#xD;
      chest pain attacks during a 2 week period. Chest pain score is recorded in a diary handed out&#xD;
      at day 1 together with 30 tablets Nitroglycerine in the maximal tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy SCORE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To test and compare the ability of different statistical methods using clinical data to&#xD;
      predict the presence of narrowed coronary arteries in a contemporary Danish population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy CONTRAST&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate if the blood flow in an area in the heart muscle measured by contrast&#xD;
      adenosine stress echocardiography can predict the presence of significant stenosis in the&#xD;
      coronary artery supplying the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 2D strain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To Evaluate if lack of increase in 2D strain during adenosine stress echocardiography&#xD;
      can predict the presence of narrowed coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy SPECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate whether the result of a myocardial scintigraphy can predict symptomatic&#xD;
      chest pain relief 6 months after a coronary angiography and possible treatment with balloon&#xD;
      or bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Annually around 1,500 coronary angiographies are performed at Region Hospital&#xD;
      Herning. We intend to include 200 patients referred by their physicians to coronary&#xD;
      angiography in the study and expect the data collection phase to last 3 years.&#xD;
