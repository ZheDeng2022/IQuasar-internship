  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult intracranial ependymoma is a relatively rare brain tumour entity, accounting for 2-5%&#xD;
      of all intracranial neoplasms. The pertinent prognostic factors as well as the pattern of&#xD;
      recurrence remain to be elucidated. According to several recent reports, the prognostic value&#xD;
      of Karnofski performance status, tumour location, the extent of surgical removal,&#xD;
      histological grade and even postoperative radiotherapy remain controversial. As a&#xD;
      consequence, optimal therapeutic management of adult intracranial ependymomas remains an&#xD;
      ongoing debate. For this reason, a retrospective study conducted by the French society of&#xD;
      neurosurgery (SFNC), neuropathology (SFNP) and the association of the neuro-oncologists of&#xD;
      French expression (ANOCEF) was undertaken and allowed to collect 258 cases coming from 25&#xD;
      centers, initially diagnosed as intracranial ependymomas between 1990 and 2004. Clinical and&#xD;
      follow-up data of these patients are known and the paraffin embedded samples as well as the&#xD;
      frozen tissues available have been centralized. Central pathological review of these 258&#xD;
      cases was conducted by two senior neuropathologists and confirmed the diagnosis of ependymoma&#xD;
      in 152 cases, thus constituting the most important series of the literature. Few molecular&#xD;
      studies were carried out on ependymomas. The investigators have the opportunity, based on&#xD;
      this important series, to determine the clinicopathological criteria and the molecular&#xD;
      markers who will allow a better characterization of the diagnosis and the prognosis of these&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
