      This study will report on the outcomes of rTMS administered 3 times per week, compared with&#xD;
      the standard protocol of 5 times per week. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      frequency condition and depressive symptomatology will be measured weekly using a range of&#xD;
      clinician and self-rated questionnaires. Participants will remain in the study for at least 4&#xD;
      weeks, with the option of continuing for a further 2 weeks as judged by the study&#xD;
      psychiatrist. It is hypothesised that rTMS administered three times per week will be equally&#xD;
      as effective as rTMS administered five times per week in reducing depressive symptomatology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of active rTMS over sham rTMS for depression;&#xD;
      however, few have systematically studied the optimal frequency of treatment sessions to&#xD;
      achieve this efficacy. To date, the majority of studies have administered rTMS every weekday,&#xD;
      although this approach has not been widely contested. In addition, most studies have only&#xD;
      assessed the effectiveness of rTMS over a two week period, which has resulted in some&#xD;
      improvement in depressive symptomatology; however, a longer treatment course would likely&#xD;
      result in greater improvement. In this study depressed patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive rTMS either 3 or 5 times per week, for a period of 4-6 weeks. A range of rating&#xD;
      scales will be used to assess the improvement of depressive symptomatology within and between&#xD;
      the two frequency groups, to ultimately determine whether TMS is needed 5 times per week to&#xD;
      achieve adequate anti-depressant effects or whether 3 times per week is sufficient in&#xD;
      achieving a similar level of efficacy for patients.&#xD;
