      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of new technologies now allow scientists to investigate the molecular basis&#xD;
      and clinical manifestations of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL), chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia(CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom&#xD;
      macroglobulinemia (WM), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Applying these methods in&#xD;
      a natural history study can clarify processes involved in disease progression and possibly&#xD;
      lead to the discovery or validation of treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study the history of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL in patients prior to and after&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characterize clinical, biologic and molecular events of disease stability and&#xD;
                progression of patients enrolled on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diagnosis of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with CLL/SLL in remission after chemotherapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients are typically followed every 6 to 24 months in the clinic and have blood&#xD;
                drawn. When required patients may undergo additional testing that may include bone&#xD;
                marrow biopsy and aspiration, blood drawing, lymph node biopsy, x-ray studies,&#xD;
                positron emission tomography and CT and MRI scans. Some of these tests may be&#xD;
                required to monitor CLL/SLL, LPL/WM, and SMZL patients. Other tests, such as bone&#xD;
                marrow biopsy and aspiration, lymph node biopsy, may not be clinically indicated,&#xD;
                but patients may be asked to undergo these procedures for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No treatment will be administered on this study. If a patients requires treatment&#xD;
                for their cancer, available NIH clinical trials and alternative treatment options&#xD;
                will be discussed with the patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to collect blood, tissue (bone marrow and lymph node&#xD;
      biopsies) and/or imaging studies (PET and CT scans) from patients with monoclonal B cell&#xD;
      lymphocytosis (MBL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL),&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), and splenic marginal&#xD;
      zone lymphoma (SMZL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be used for clinical and translational research investigating the molecular&#xD;
      basis of MBL, CLL/SLL, LPL/WM, SMZL and their clinical manifestations. New technologies now&#xD;
      permit the simultaneous characterization of pathogenic events ranging from the control of&#xD;
      gene expression to the characterization of the molecular events of cell-cell interactions.&#xD;
      Applying these methods to MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL in the context of a natural history&#xD;
      protocol can help unravel cellular pathways involved in pathogenesis and disease progression&#xD;
      and lead to the discovery or the validation of therapeutic targets. MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL&#xD;
      is an incurable disease for which there are no reliable cell lines and only a few mouse&#xD;
      models. There is an urgent need to obtain a flow of primary samples to advance research into&#xD;
      pathogenesis and novel treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of MBL/CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be typically followed every 6-12 months for the first 2 years and every 12-24&#xD;
      months thereafter. Interim visits may occur at the discretion of the research team. Patients&#xD;
      may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes. Clinical&#xD;
      information will be obtained and stored in a central databank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the history of MBL/CLL/SLL/WM/SMZL in patients prior to and after&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Apply the expertise and available technologies of the investigators to advance our&#xD;
                understanding of disease pathogenesis by studying MBL/CLL/SLL and closely related&#xD;
                B-cell malignancies, LPL/WM and SMZL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Develop novel treatment approaches for CLL/SLL/LPL/WM/SMZL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide evaluation, diagnostic studies and monitoring for patients on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide blood and tissue linked to clinical and biologic information for&#xD;
                translational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment-free survival, measured as the time from dianosis or last therapy to the&#xD;
                development of active disease that requires treatment at which time patients will&#xD;
                be evaluated for a treatment protocol or seek treatment outside of NIH.&#xD;
