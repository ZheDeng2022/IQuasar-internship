      The main purpose of this phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical feasibility-in terms of&#xD;
      patients without dose limiting toxicities or premature treatment withdrawal or death-of&#xD;
      administering adjuvant chemotherapy of pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed/oxaliplatin&#xD;
      immediately post-video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in patients with completely resected&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the largest number of cancer deaths annually,&#xD;
      worldwide. (Ferlay et al, 2007) Of these, about 30% are early stage patients (stage I and&#xD;
      II). For this group of patients, radical surgery with mediastinal lymph node dissection has&#xD;
      been the mainstay of therapy with a reasonable curative option. However, 5-year survival&#xD;
      rates for patients with pathologically staged IA-IIB disease are ranging from 67% to 39%.&#xD;
      (Mountain et al, 1997) Following surgery, distant recurrence is the most common form of&#xD;
      relapse and eventual cause of death. Assuming that these recurrences are due to occult&#xD;
      micrometastases at the time of surgery, trials on adjuvant systemic therapy have been&#xD;
      performed in an attempt to reduce the risk of recurrence and to improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some of the recently published trials a clear benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in early&#xD;
      stage NSCLC could not be achieved. (Tada et al, 2004; Scagliott et al, 2003; Waller et al,&#xD;
      2004) In marked contrast to these studies, three recent, big randomized trials on early stage&#xD;
      NSCLC patients with modern platin-based two-drug chemotherapy-regimens revealed a significant&#xD;
      advantage for overall or relapse free survival for chemotherapeutically treated patients.&#xD;
      (Arriagada et al, 2004; Winton et al, 2005; Douillard et al, 2006) The majority of patients&#xD;
      in the adjuvant treatment setting received a combination of cisplatin and vinorelbine. A&#xD;
      pooled analysis of five big randomized studies demonstrated that adjuvant cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy significantly improves survival in patients with NSCLC (overall HR of death&#xD;
      0.89, P=0.005) corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4% from chemotherapy. (Pignon&#xD;
      et al, 2008) However, toxicity and inadequate dose delivery have been critical issues in all&#xD;
      trials performed so far. Grade 3/4 toxicities are observed up to 73% with rates of&#xD;
      neutropenic fever up to 7%. Up to 77% of the patients had at least one dose reduction or&#xD;
      omission and 55% required one dose delay or more, most related to neutropenia. (Pisters et&#xD;
      al, 2005; Winton et al, 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few data in the literature about how soon after surgery a patient begins adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, although most trials seem to start after a post-surgical interval of 4-6 weeks.&#xD;
      A recent study reported that 26 patients, who underwent thoracoscopic (video-assisted&#xD;
      thoracic surgery, VATS) lobectomy, receiving chemotherapy, 73% completed a full course on&#xD;
      schedule and 85% received all intended cycles. (Nicastri et al, 2008) In another study,&#xD;
      complete resection was performed by thoracotomy in 43 patients and by thoracoscopy in 57&#xD;
      patients, compared with thoracotomy, patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy had&#xD;
      significantly fewer delayed (18% versus 58%, P &lt; 0.001) and reduced (26% versus 49%, P =&#xD;
      0.02) chemotherapy doses. A higher percentage of patients undergoing thoracoscopic resection&#xD;
      received 75% or more of their planned adjuvant regimen without delayed or reduced doses (61%&#xD;
      versus 40%, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in time to initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy or toxicity. (Peterson et al, 2007) In comparison, the Cancer and Leukemia Group&#xD;
      B trial 9633 reported that 57% of patients received full-dose chemotherapy (Strauss et al,&#xD;
      2008) and the Intergroup JBR.10 trial reported that 55% of patients had at least 1 dose&#xD;
      delay. (Winton et al, 2005) Approximately 34% of patients in the Adjuvant Lung Project Italy&#xD;
      series chemotherapy wing received all scheduled doses without adjustment or delay; 69%&#xD;
      completed their treatments with or without adjustments or delay.(Scagliotti et al, 2003) It&#xD;
      is conceivable that patients who undergo VATS may have a quicker recovery and in general more&#xD;
      strength to tolerate chemotherapy. There are theoretic survival benefits to starting&#xD;
      chemotherapy immediately after surgery because the body's tumor burden should be lowest, and&#xD;
      tumor growth fastest, at this time. Thus, chemotherapy administered immediately post-surgery&#xD;
      would be most effective, assuming that wound healing is adequate. (Nicastri et al, 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed, a multi-target folate antimetabolite, shows clear activity in non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. In a phase III study for patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, the efficacy of single-agent pemetrexed, as determined by overall survival, was&#xD;
      similar to that of docetaxel. (Hanna et al, 2004) The combination of oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      pemetrexed has been of particular interest because it has demonstrated both good efficacy and&#xD;
      a tolerable side effect profile. Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane-containing platinum&#xD;
      compound that inhibits DNA replication and transcription by forming DNA adducts. Its&#xD;
      mechanism of action is similar to that of the classic platinum drugs, but molecular&#xD;
      pharmacology studies suggest that oxaliplatin represents a distinct family of platinum&#xD;
      compounds. It has a different cytotoxicity profile from cisplatin and can be safely given in&#xD;
      the outpatient setting without hydration therapy. (Raymond et al, 1998) Moreover, oxaliplatin&#xD;
      appears to interact synergistically with pemetrexed. (Raymond et al, 2002) Phase I studies&#xD;
      evaluated pemetrexed plus oxaliplatin in patients with solid tumors, and showed the regimen&#xD;
      was efficacious and well tolerated. (Misset et al, 2004) The combination of oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      pemetrexed was compared with carboplatin and pemetrexed as first-line therapy for advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC in a randomized phase II study. Response rates were 27 and 33%, respectively, and not&#xD;
      statistically different. However, toxicity in the oxaliplatin/pemetrexed arm was quite low,&#xD;
      this doublet can be delivered easily and is well tolerated. Furthermore, it results in a 7.3%&#xD;
      rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia only and the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 2.4%. Dose&#xD;
      reductions occur only in 2.6% cycles. Patients received 95.3% and 100% of the planned weekly&#xD;
      mean doses of pemetrexed and oxaliplatin, respectively. (Scagliotti et al, 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems reasonable to test a less toxic regimen also in early stages after&#xD;
      complete (R0) resection of the tumor, where reduced toxicities might improve the feasibility&#xD;
      of drug delivery, compliance and the convenience of treatment for the patient and hence&#xD;
      perhaps improve survival. The main purpose of this phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      feasibility-in terms of patients without dose limiting toxicities or premature treatment&#xD;
      withdrawal or death-of administering adjuvant chemotherapy of pemetrexed followed by&#xD;
      pemetrexed/oxaliplatin immediately post-VATS in patients with completely resected NSCLC.&#xD;
