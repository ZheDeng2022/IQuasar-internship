      Young patients with adnexal lesions may have variable presenting symptoms. In this study, we&#xD;
      reviewed the clinical characteristics of young Korean patients who took the operation in&#xD;
      university hospital with adnexal lesions over the past 14 years.&#xD;

      The incidence of gynecologic surgery during the pediatric and adolescent period remains low.&#xD;
      In this age group, the causes of gynecologic surgery were usually divided into three parts,&#xD;
      congenital anomalies, genital traumas, and pathologic lesions of genital tract including&#xD;
      uterine bady and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. Among these, adnexal&#xD;
      masses generally have been the most common cause of gynecologic surgery in the pediatric and&#xD;
      adolescent patients. Adnexal lesions span a spectrum of pathology from functional&#xD;
      (non-neoplastic), benign to highly aggressive malignant neoplasms. The actual incidence of&#xD;
      adnexal lesions in the young women is unknown; however, of the ovarian neoplasms operated on&#xD;
      during childhood or adolescence, 10-30% are malignant. Therefore, early detection and&#xD;
      adequate management of adnexal lesions are prerequisite for the life saving and future&#xD;
      preservation of fertility potential. But until now, there have been limited studies regarding&#xD;
      the clinical characteristics of patients with adnexal mass during this period, and most&#xD;
      studies have been conducted with small numbers of patients. Therefore, more informations&#xD;
      regarding the clinical characteristics of patients with adnexal lesions are very important&#xD;
      for the early diagnosis and adequate management of the adnexal lesions in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we reviewed the clinical characteristics of 494 young Korean patients who took&#xD;
      the operation in university hospital with adnexal lesions over the past 14 years.&#xD;
