  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research involves the establishment of a cohort including as much as possible cases of&#xD;
      macrothrombocytopenia related to a &quot;MYH9 syndrome&quot; and the study of mutations and&#xD;
      polymorphisms of MYH9 gene in all these patients. As MYH9 syndrome is an autosomal dominant&#xD;
      disorder, patients should be heterozygous for a MYH9 gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of our project is looking for correlations between genotype and phenotype. It&#xD;
      is planned to characterize the phenotype and genotype of a cohort of patients, including&#xD;
      family members that will be addressed during the study in order to better understand the&#xD;
      platelet disorder and improve the epidemiological knowledge of MYH9 syndrome. The data will&#xD;
      be recorded in a database.&#xD;

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained&#xD;
      in other fields, such as comparison(s) studied. The patients that will participate in the&#xD;
      study will be suffering or suspected suffering from MYH9 syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of MYH9 gene will be proposed to the patients but also to both parents of the&#xD;
      propositi and other family members (children and adults), whether symptomatic or not. The&#xD;
      relatives who will be proved to be heterozygotes for a MYH9 mutation will be considered as&#xD;
      new cases and therefore included in the cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups of controls (individuals who are not affected by a decrease in the platelet&#xD;
      count) will be constituted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1: controls for proplatelets production study A2: controls for platelet proteome study B:&#xD;
      controls for MYH9 gene analysis C: controls for leukocytes immunofluorescence study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients will be included at the 6 sites of the national Reference Center for&#xD;
      Inherited Platelet Disorders (CRPP) after signing an informed consent form. During the visit&#xD;
      of inclusion (V1), data usually required for the diagnosis of MYH9 syndrome will be&#xD;
      collected: clinical examination, auditory and ocular check, blood tests including MYH9 gene&#xD;
      analysis, and search for proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with a MYH9 mutation, a limited number will be recruited in a second step for&#xD;
      participating to specific studies focused on the consequences of MYH9 mutations on the&#xD;
      proplatelets production and the platelet proteome. The selected patients should be&#xD;
      representative of the different phenotypes of MYH9 syndrome. They should be adults and have a&#xD;
      platelet count above 50 G / L. A blood sample will be drawn for this purpose during a second&#xD;
      visit (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An annual control will be offered at year 1, year 2 and year 3 after inclusion to all the&#xD;
      patients confirmed to have MYH9 syndrome (with MYH9 mutation). Each control will include:&#xD;
      clinical examination and record of bleeding episodes, if any, during the past year, blood&#xD;
      tests, search for proteinuria. The last control (end of the study) will also include auditory&#xD;
      and ocular tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives The relatives will be included in the study after signing informed consent form&#xD;
      during an inclusion visit (VAP) at one of the 6 sites of CRPP. During the visit, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be drawn for platelet and MYH9 gene study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls The controls will be included in the study after signing informed consent at 6 sites&#xD;
      of the CRPP. During their inclusion visit (VT), a blood sample will be drawn for platelet and&#xD;
      MYH9 gene study.&#xD;
