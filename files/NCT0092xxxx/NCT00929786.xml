      The purpose of this study is to evaluate plasma levels of hepatotoxic anti-tuberculous drugs&#xD;
      (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide plus significant metabolites) among patients on&#xD;
      antituberculosis treatment (ATT) and compare the same among those who develop drug induced&#xD;
      hepatitis on follow up versus those who do not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem in both the developing and developed countries&#xD;
      because of its resurgence in the immunosuppressed patients. World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      in 1993 declared tuberculosis to be a 'global emergency' with more than a third of the&#xD;
      world's population infected. Globally 8.9 million new cases of tuberculosis occur annually,&#xD;
      of which 1.8 million (20%) occur in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-course chemotherapy containing isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and pyrazinamide (PZA)&#xD;
      has proved to be highly effective in the treatment of tuberculosis. One of its adverse&#xD;
      effects is hepatotoxicity. It is the most common side effect leading to interruption of&#xD;
      therapy. It is associated with mortality of 6-12% if these drugs are continued even after the&#xD;
      onset of symptoms. Risk of hepatotoxicity is increased when these drugs are combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time interval between the start of anti-TB drugs and appearance of hepatotoxicity varies&#xD;
      from 3 to 135 days. In most cases hepatitis is evident within three months of start of&#xD;
      antituberculosis treatment (ATT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) is still not entirely clear for most&#xD;
      anti TB drugs including rifampicin. Hypersensitivity is a definite possibility Rifampicin&#xD;
      induced hepatitis has been postulated to occur as a part of systemic allergic reaction and,&#xD;
      due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia as a result of competition with bilirubin for uptake&#xD;
      at hepatocyte plasma membrane. DIH caused by rifampicin occurs earlier as compared to&#xD;
      isoniazid. While a dose related toxicity may exist, a direct correlation between serum drug&#xD;
      levels and hepatotoxicity has not been well reported. Thus the clinical relevance of&#xD;
      therapeutic monitoring of serum rifampicin concentrations in managing DIH is still being&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present study done to observe serum rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide level in patients on&#xD;
      ATT and to compare it retrospectively between patients who develop drug induced hepatitis vs&#xD;
      those who do not.&#xD;
