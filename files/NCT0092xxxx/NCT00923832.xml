      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fungal infections of the lung (pneumonia) can be caused by molds, such as Aspergillus&#xD;
           and Zygomycetes, but these causes are often difficult for a doctor to diagnose. Early&#xD;
           and accurate diagnosis of these infections can help doctors to select the correct&#xD;
           medicines for proper treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A number of methods are used to diagnose fungal pneumonia. Ones that are commonly used&#xD;
           in clinical practice include radiographic imaging (chest X-rays and computed tomography&#xD;
           (CT) scans), blood tests, and cultures taken from fluid from the lungs (broncho-alveolar&#xD;
           lavage (BAL) fluid). Other new methods may improve the diagnosis of fungal pneumonias.&#xD;
           These methods include tests that can detect DNA from the fungal germ in blood and BAL&#xD;
           fluid of some patients with these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To help develop better and more accurate methods of diagnosing fungal lung infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect fungal DNA and chemicals in the bloodstream and BAL fluid of immunocompromised&#xD;
           patients with pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Immunocompromised patients who are currently enrolled in another NIH protocol and who have&#xD;
      a CT scan that shows a possible fungal infection of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will review patients' existing medical records and CT scans, and current&#xD;
           pneumonia treatment plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will provide blood and BAL samples for the duration of their treatment for&#xD;
           pneumonia, as required by researchers. Additional CT scans will not be performed, except&#xD;
           as part of existing treatment plans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of infectious disease, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in immunocompromised patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,&#xD;
      aplastic anemia, autoimmune diseases, and primary immune deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foremost among the more lethal of these infections are invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and&#xD;
      zygomycosis. Early detection of these infections allows timely initiation of specific&#xD;
      antifungal therapy, which may be life saving. However, early diagnosis of respiratory fungal&#xD;
      infections is difficult, often leading to delay in therapy and inaccurate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Immunocompromised Host Section has developed a series of sensitive and highly specific&#xD;
      PCR assays for the detection of these life-threatening infections. We also have characterized&#xD;
      the expression of cell wall derived biomarkers, (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan and galactomannan in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo. Laboratory animal studies indicate that these assays may complement&#xD;
      current diagnostic modalities and allow for more accurate and earlier detection of invasive&#xD;
      pulmonary fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to improve the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary&#xD;
      aspergillosis and invasive pulmonary zygomycosis in immunocompromised patients through the&#xD;
      addition of molecular biomarker detection methodology to the standard diagnostic systems used&#xD;
      in clinical microbiology laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To compare the diagnostic yield and analytical performance of the PCR, galactomannan and&#xD;
      (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan to standard diagnostic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To evaluate the effect of different independent variables on expression of the&#xD;
      aforementioned assays&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To characterize the variables that may contribute to therapeutic outcome (global response;&#xD;
      survival)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. To characterize the use of these biomarkers in the context of EORTC/MSG definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. To identify genetic markers which may predispose patients to invasive fungal pulmonary&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunocompromised patients currently enrolled in any NIH IRB approved Clinical Center&#xD;
      protocol for the evaluation and/or treatment of his/her primary disease, or patients&#xD;
      receiving treatment at the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) who develop a pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrate radiologically compatible with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or invasive&#xD;
      pulmonary zygomycosis, by EORTC/MSG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, prospective diagnostic interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to the Clinical Center for evaluation and treatment in primary research&#xD;
      protocols will be eligible for enrollment in this protocol at the Clinical Center. Patients&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria may also be enrolled from the CNMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have compatible radiologic signs and are at risk for development of invasive&#xD;
      pulmonary aspergillosis and invasive pulmonary zygomycosis will have specimens of&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid supernatant and /or tissue from lung biopsy when&#xD;
      available, obtained for the measurement of diagnostic PCR for Aspergillus and Zygomycete&#xD;
      identification, proteomics, cytokines and for the presence of galactomannan and&#xD;
      (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan. The BAL will be performed only if clinically indicated as part of the&#xD;
      patient's routine care of pneumonic infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be obtained from patients meeting the eligibility requirements, regardless of&#xD;
      whether they have had a BAL or lung tissue biopsy, to be submitted for the measurement of&#xD;
      diagnostic PCR for Aspergillus and Zygomycete identification, proteomics, cytokines, presence&#xD;
      of galactomannan and (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan and host genomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital copies of computer tomography (CT) images, that are part of routine care will&#xD;
      utilized to reconstruct multi-dimensional volumetric images and correlate clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory outcomes with the extent of lung volume involvement.&#xD;
