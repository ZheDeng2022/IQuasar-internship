  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is two-fold. (1) We will determine if in mid- to late pubertal&#xD;
      girls without hyperandrogenism (HA), progesterone (P4) acutely reduces waking luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone (LH) frequency to a greater extent than sleep-associated LH frequency. (2) We will&#xD;
      determine if in mid- to late pubertal girls with HA, P4 will acutely suppress waking LH&#xD;
      frequency to a lesser degree than it does in girls without HA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study to test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses: (1) In normal mid- to late pubertal girls without hyperandrogenism&#xD;
      (HA), progesterone acutely suppresses waking LH pulse frequency more than sleep-associated LH&#xD;
      pulse frequency; and (2) compared to normal mid- to late pubertal girls without HA, acute&#xD;
      progesterone suppression of waking LH pulse frequency is impaired in mid- to late pubertal&#xD;
      girls with HA. Studies will be performed in mid- to late pubertal girls (at least Tanner&#xD;
      breast stage 3 but no more than 2 years postmenarcheal). Subjects will complete two 18-hour&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) admissions in separate menstrual cycles. Immediately before and&#xD;
      during the first CRU admission, either oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg/dose) or&#xD;
      placebo (randomized) will be given at 0700, 1500, 2300, and 0700 h. During the CRU admission,&#xD;
      blood will be obtained every 10 minutes through an indwelling iv catheter from 1800 to 1200&#xD;
      h. This will allow full characterization of pulsatile LH secretion in addition to other&#xD;
      hormone measurements. A second CRU admission (performed at least 2 months later given blood&#xD;
      withdrawal limits) will be identical to the first except that placebo will exchanged for&#xD;
      progesterone or vice versa (treatment crossover). The primary endpoint is LH pulse frequency&#xD;
      while awake. (LH pulse frequency while asleep is an important secondary endpoint.) Results in&#xD;
      pubertal girls without HA were recently published (Kim et al, J Clin Endocrinol Metab&#xD;
      2018;103:1112-1121). Data from girls with HA will be compared to recently-published results&#xD;
      in girls without HA. Mean LH pulse frequency while awake will be analyzed via a hierarchical&#xD;
      linear mixed model (HLMM). HA status (HA vs. non-HA), sleep status (wake vs. sleep), and&#xD;
      treatment (progesterone vs. placebo) will represent fixed-effects, along with all associated&#xD;
      interactions. Random effects will be used to account for hierarchical variance-covariance&#xD;
      structure of the crossover study design. With regard to hypothesis testing, the association&#xD;
      between HA status and wake LH pulse frequency will be evaluated via linear contrasts of HLMM&#xD;
      least squares pulse frequency means. The differential impact of exogenous progesterone on&#xD;
      wake LH pulse frequency in pubertal girls with and without HA (primary analysis) will be&#xD;
      evaluated via the same testing method. Using published and preliminary data, we determined&#xD;
      that, if 16 pubertal girls with HA complete both admissions, we should have at least an 80%&#xD;
      chance of detecting a 0.2 pulse/hour differential effect of P4 on wake LH pulse frequency&#xD;
      between the HA and the non-HA groups with a two-sided false positive rejection rate of no&#xD;
      more than 0.05.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mid- to late pubertal adolescent girl (at least Tanner breast stage 3, but no more&#xD;
             than 2 years postmenarcheal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For girls without hyperandrogenism: serum (calculated) free testosterone concentration&#xD;
             within the Tanner stage-specific reference range and the absence of hirsutism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For girls with hyperandrogenism: serum (calculated) free testosterone concentration&#xD;
             greater than the Tanner stage-specific reference range and/or unequivocal evidence for&#xD;
             hirsutism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, hyperandrogenism, and&#xD;
             adequately-treated hypothyroidism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of and willing to provide informed assent (adolescents under age 16 years)&#xD;
             and/or consent (adolescents over age 16 years; custodial parents or guardians of all&#xD;
             adolescent volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during&#xD;
             the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males will be excluded (hyperandrogenism is unique to females)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test or current lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice,&#xD;
             clitoromegaly)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian&#xD;
             or adrenal tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DHEA-S elevation &gt; 1.5 times the upper reference range limit. Mild elevations may be&#xD;
             seen in adolescent HA and in PCOS, and will be accepted in these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase,&#xD;
             which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during&#xD;
             the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular&#xD;
             phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing,&#xD;
             an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and&#xD;
             adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperprolactinemia: Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in HA/PCOS, and elevations&#xD;
             within 20% higher than the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency, or acromegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
             (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea&#xD;
             (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating&#xD;
             patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit &lt; 36% and hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total&#xD;
             white blood count &lt; 4,000 cells/microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose &gt; or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
             &gt; or = 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent liver panel abnormalities, with two exceptions. Mild bilirubin elevations&#xD;
             will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Also, mild transaminase&#xD;
             elevations may be seen in obesity/HA/PCOS; therefore, elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal will be accepted in such girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any other cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (with the exception of basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma) unless they have remained clinically disease&#xD;
             free (based on appropriate surveillance) for five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to micronized progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentile &lt; 5% (underweight)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the amount of blood being drawn, adolescent volunteers with body weight &lt; 25 kg&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restrictions on use of other drugs or treatments: No medications known to affect the&#xD;
             reproductive system, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, or blood pressure can be&#xD;
             taken in the 2 months prior to the screening visit and in the 3 months prior to the&#xD;
             start of the study medications. Such medications include oral contraceptive pills,&#xD;
             progestins, metformin, systemic glucocorticoids, some antipsychotic medications, and&#xD;
             sympathomimetics/stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate).&#xD;
