  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In treatment-resistant depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively reduce depressive symptoms, though the underlying neurobiological mechanism is&#xD;
      still unclear. The serotonergic system, and in particular the inhibitory serotonin-1A&#xD;
      (5-HT1A) receptor, appears to be significantly involved in the effectiveness of ECT. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to assess the effects of ECT on the 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BPND)&#xD;
      and distribution in humans in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and the&#xD;
      radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 patients suffering from severe, therapy-resistant unipolar depression will undergo 3 PET&#xD;
      scans, two of these scans taking place before the ECT treatment, consisting of 6-14 ECTs, the&#xD;
      third scan taking place after the ECT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This imaging study hypothesizes that upon completion of the ECT, the overall 5-HT1A receptor&#xD;
      BPND in the brain of depressed patients will significantly change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be the first to demonstrate an effect of electroconvulsive therapy on the&#xD;
      5-HT1A receptor binding in humans in vivo. Given the involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of mood disorders, the present study would be an important step towards a&#xD;
      better understanding of antidepressant treatment and treatment response. By comparing&#xD;
      treatment effect and the underlying biological mechanism, the study might help to identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that distinguish patients who are likely to benefit from ECT from patients who&#xD;
      will rather be non-responders. Finally, by investigating the role of the 5-HT1A receptor in&#xD;
      ECT, is highly discussed relevance for antidepressant action will be further elucidated and&#xD;
      might prepare the ground for new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
