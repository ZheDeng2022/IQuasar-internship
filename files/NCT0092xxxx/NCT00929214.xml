      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if adding local therapy (surgery&#xD;
      and/or radiation) to standard therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine therapy) in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer can help to control the disease for a longer period of&#xD;
      time than standard therapy alone.&#xD;

      Study Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard of care for breast cancer patients whose disease has spread to the bones is&#xD;
      to treat them with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. However, using radiation and surgery as&#xD;
      well may help to get rid of the cancer cells in the bone lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive separate consent documents to sign that will explain the&#xD;
      routine surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the imaging scans show that you are not at increased risk for bone fracture, you will&#xD;
      receive 3 to 9 months of systemic therapy that is most appropriate for you as decided by your&#xD;
      doctor. You may also be placed on endocrine therapy as decided by your doctor. If you have&#xD;
      received drugs in the past that could cause heart-related side effects and/or a history of&#xD;
      heart disease, you may have heart function tests, if your cancer doctor decides it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have received 3-9 months of standard therapy, you will receive an MRI scan, a&#xD;
      PET/CT scan, an X-ray, and a whole-body bone scan to make sure you still have no more than 3&#xD;
      bone metastases. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests will also be collected to make&#xD;
      sure you have no more than 3 bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you still have no more than 3 bone metastases, local treatments including high-dose&#xD;
      radiation therapy and/or surgery will be given. The most appropriate local therapy will be&#xD;
      chosen by your treating radiation oncologist, surgeon, and medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For bones with fractures or at risk for fracture, a rod or other devices may be placed in the&#xD;
      bone to fix the bone. Radiation therapy involves daily treatments during weekdays that may&#xD;
      last 5 to 7 weeks in a row. Each daily treatment may last 30 - 40 minutes. For special cases,&#xD;
      shorter courses of radiation therapy may be offered to treat the lesions in the spine.&#xD;
      Radiation types, such as photon, electron, or proton will be selected by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have a risk of bone fracture due to the cancer, you may be treated with surgery and/or&#xD;
      radiation first, before starting standard therapy. Again, the most appropriate local therapy&#xD;
      will be chosen by your treating radiation oncologist, surgeon, and medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the local therapies, you will receive an MRI scan, a PET/CT scan, a X-ray,&#xD;
      and a whole-body bone scan to make sure you still have no more than 3 bone metastases. Blood&#xD;
      (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will also be collected to make sure you have no more than 3&#xD;
      bone metastases. Then, you will receive 3 to 9 months of systemic therapy that is most&#xD;
      appropriate for you as decided by your doctor. You may also be placed on endocrine therapy as&#xD;
      decided by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard systemic therapy treatments may last 3 to 9 months. The radiation therapy&#xD;
      process may last 6 to 8 weeks. Surgery, including recovery, may last 4 to 6 weeks. You will&#xD;
      be taken off study early if you are found to have more than 3 lesions, if the disease&#xD;
      worsens, or if you have intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the local and standard therapies are finished, you will have a follow-up visit at 3&#xD;
      months and every 3 months for the 1st year after the therapies, and then every 6 months for&#xD;
      the 2nd and 3rd year after the therapies. At each of these visits, the following tests will&#xD;
      be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have periodic tests which may include an MRI scan, a PET/CT scan, an X-ray, and&#xD;
           a whole-body bone scan to check on the status of the disease. Your doctor will decide&#xD;
           which tests you will need. The tests will be done every 3 months for the first year and&#xD;
           then every 6 months for the next 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected to check on the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete QOL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the 36 month visit, you are encouraged to follow-up at any time after&#xD;
      the last visit up to 1 year. Your doctor may request that you have an MRI scan, a PET/CT&#xD;
      scan, an X-ray, and/or a whole-body bone scan to check on the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of local treatments (surgery and radiation therapy)&#xD;
      to treat metastatic lesions of the bone is investigational. The use of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy is standard of care for breast cancer patients with metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 75 evaluable patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
