    <textblock>
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a form of disease that results from removal of a significant&#xD;
      portion of the intestine leading to poor nutrient absorption. Infants with short bowel&#xD;
      syndrome suffer from diarrhea and poor growth. The care of these infants is limited by the&#xD;
      lack of effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble fiber (guar gum) is an indigestible form of sugar that is mostly contained in fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables. Soluble fiber can reduce the severity and duration of persistent (constant)&#xD;
      diarrhea in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the many effects of fiber added in the diet&#xD;
      of infants with SBS&#xD;

      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a form of disease that results from removal of a significant&#xD;
      portion of the intestine leading to poor nutrient absorption. Infants with short bowel&#xD;
      syndrome suffer from diarrhea and poor growth. The care of these infants is limited by the&#xD;
      lack of effective therapies. As the intestine tries to grow back some of its length, a&#xD;
      process that can take many months, these infants become dependent on intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      nutrition in order to survive. Liver disease and sepsis (a blood stream infection) are common&#xD;
      complications of IV nutrition and are the two most common causes of death in this population.&#xD;
      Therefore, clinicians have tried different ways to improve feeding and shorten the amount of&#xD;
      time of IV nutrition, for example continuous feedings through the intestine, use of partly&#xD;
      digested formulas and change in diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble fiber (guar gum) is an indigestible form of sugar that is mostly contained in fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables. Soluble fiber can reduce the severity and duration of persistent (constant)&#xD;
      diarrhea in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the many effects of fiber added in the diet&#xD;
      of infants with SBS.&#xD;

        Pediatric infants (less than 1 y of age) who&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have Short Bowel Syndrome defined by a history of congenital or surgical loss of&#xD;
             intestinal absorptive function resulting in parenteral nutrition dependency of longer&#xD;
             than 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are receiving at least 20% of their caloric needs from enteral nutrition and have been&#xD;
             on enteral nutrition for at least 1 week following intestinal resection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have increased stool output as manifested by watery stools (3-12/day) and increased&#xD;
             ostomy output (20-50 cc/kg/day);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have not received antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics for 2 weeks prior to study&#xD;
