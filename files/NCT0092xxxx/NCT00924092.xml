  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out the maximum tolerated dose of the GI-6207 vaccine (the highest dose that&#xD;
           does not cause unacceptable side effects), and to evaluate any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if GI-6207 has any effect on patients tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how the vaccine causes immune responses against the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with a cancer that has not&#xD;
           responded to standard treatments. Patients must not be allergic to yeast or yeast&#xD;
           products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial physical examination, blood and tissue sampling, computed tomography (CT) scan,&#xD;
           and skin test to determine eligibility for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with GI-6027 in seven 14-day cycles as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine administered on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, and 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine given at four sites around the body: right and left chest area below the armpit,&#xD;
           and right and left upper thigh in the pelvic region. (These areas drain into parts of&#xD;
           your body that contain large numbers of lymph nodes. The lymph nodes contain immune&#xD;
           cells that may be activated by the vaccine to target cancer cells.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits for physical examinations to check vital signs, take additional blood and&#xD;
           urine samples, and perform other tests needed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After day 85 (about 3 months), patients will continue to receive vaccine monthly (or&#xD;
           every 28 days) as long as the vaccine is not producing harmful effects or side effects&#xD;
           and the cancer is either stable or reducing. Patients who do well on the vaccine may&#xD;
           continue to receive it for as long as it is available.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is overexpressed in multiple adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical studies utilizing CEA-based vaccine therapy have demonstrated safety,&#xD;
      T-cell immune responses against CEA, and preliminary evidence of clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have shown that Saccharomyces-CEA (yeast-CEA) can induce a strong immune&#xD;
      response to CEA as well as therapeutic antitumor responses in a CEA-transgenic host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous and ongoing clinical studies utilizing whole, heat-killed recombinant Saccharomyces&#xD;
      cerevisiae yeast genetically modified to express mutated Ras (GI-4000) or hepatitis C&#xD;
      (GI-5005) proteins demonstrated this vaccine vehicle to be well tolerated, with no&#xD;
      product-related serious adverse events in &gt;200 treated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of a heat-killed yeast-based&#xD;
      vaccine that targets tumors that express CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate CD4 and CD8 immunologic response as measured by an increase in CEA-specific&#xD;
           T cells measured by ELISPOT in HLA-A2, -A3 and -A24(+) patients, and proliferation in&#xD;
           response to CEA protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate evidence of clinical benefit, such as progression-free survival, RECIST&#xD;
           criteria, reduction in serum markers, and/or reduction in circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: (dose escalation phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have metastatic cancer that is CEA-positive (either a CEA serum level &gt; 5 ng/mL or a&#xD;
      tumor that stains positive for CEA in &gt; 20% of a tumor block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have completed or had disease progression on at least one prior line of&#xD;
      disease-appropriate therapy, or not be a candidate for therapy of proven efficacy for their&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must be ECOG Performance Status 0 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of immune dysfunction; no serious&#xD;
      intercurrent medical illness;&#xD;
&#xD;
      No untreated brain metastasis (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6&#xD;
      months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any hypersensitivity reaction to yeast-based products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: (extension phase: 10 additional patients at highest tested dose/MTD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same as for the dose escalation phase with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be HLA-A2, -A3, or -A24(+) for immunologic monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG PS = 0 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, phase I trial with sequential cohorts of patients (3-6 patients per&#xD;
      dose cohort) with dose escalation of heat-killed GI-6207 vaccine (see statistical analysis&#xD;
      section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI 6207 vaccine will be administered subcutaneously at 4 sites biweekly for 7 visits (days 1,&#xD;
      15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85), then monthly until patients meet off-study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on a given dose level will have completed 1 month on-study before enrollment can&#xD;
      begin on the next dose level or on the extension phase (see statistical analysis section).&#xD;

&#xD;
        E. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. ECOG performance status of 0 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal OR creatinine&#xD;
        clearance on a 24-h urine collection of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min.&#xD;

        with Gilbert s syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        J. Recovered completely from any reversible toxicity associated with recent therapy.&#xD;
        Typically this is 3 4 weeks for patients who most recently received cytotoxic therapy,&#xD;
        except for the nitrosoureas and mitomycin C for which 6 weeks is needed for recovery. There&#xD;
        should be a minimum of 2 weeks from any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        K. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3)&#xD;
&#xD;

        orchiectomy has been done).&#xD;
&#xD;
        O. Patients must be negative for yeast allergy skin test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        P. Patients must have baseline pulse oximetry greater than 90% on room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (EXTENSION PHASE: 10 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AT HIGHEST TESTED DOSE/MTD):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility: Same as with the dose escalation phase with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be HLA-A2, A3, or A24 positive for immunologic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS equal to 0 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients should have no evidence of immune dysfunction as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus positivity due to the potential for decreased immune&#xD;
             response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             might be stimulated by vaccine treatment. This requirement is due to the potential&#xD;
             risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. Patients with endocrine autoimmune disease that is&#xD;
             controlled by replacement therapy, including thyroid disease and adrenal disease; or&#xD;
             those with vitiligo, may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses for systemic steroid&#xD;
             replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use. Limited doses of&#xD;
             systemic steroids to prevent IV contrast, allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis (in&#xD;
             patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. History of allergy or untoward reaction to yeast-based products (any hypersensitivity to&#xD;
        yeast-based products will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Serious intercurrent medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the&#xD;
        patient to carry out the treatment program, including, but not limited to, inflammatory&#xD;
        bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6&#xD;
        months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the cause&#xD;
        of neurologic toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Concurrent chemotherapy. An exception is to allow for patients on the extension phase&#xD;
        only with breast cancer who are receiving trastuzumab to continue therapy with trastuzumab&#xD;
        while receiving the vaccine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        K. Chronic hepatitis infection, including B and C, because of potential immune impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        L. Patients requiring continuous tricyclic antidepressant therapy should be excluded due to&#xD;
        the interference with the yeast skin test in creating false negative test results.&#xD;
