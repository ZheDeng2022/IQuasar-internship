  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of every five people experiences tinnitus (a ringing, buzzing, or roaring sound in&#xD;
      the ear) ranging from mild to severe impairment. To date, there are no effective therapies&#xD;
      available that have been shown to decrease tinnitus awareness. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate a treatment option for tinnitus that uses a technique called Repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), which could prove to be an effective means of&#xD;
      alleviating or reducing the symptoms of tinnitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 subjects, including males and females ages 19-89 years old and of all races, and&#xD;
      with tinnitus severe enough to seek medical attention, will be enrolled in this study. All&#xD;
      participants must be evaluated or have documentation of being evaluated prior to beginning&#xD;
      therapy with rTMS in order to confirm eligibility and to rule out any medically treatable&#xD;
      causes of tinnitus. An MRI scan of the head may or may not be required, depending upon the&#xD;
      results of this evaluation, in order to rule out specific middle ear pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require participation in at least three weeks (4 weekdays per week) of rTMS&#xD;
      sessions, including two active weeks and a sham (or placebo) week. There will be a three week&#xD;
      washout period following each treatment week. At the completion of the three treatment weeks,&#xD;
      subjects who have noticed an improvement in their tinnitus will have the option of&#xD;
      participating in a maintenance rTMS program providing up to 8 additional weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline on the daily analogue rating of tinnitus awareness. Analogue ratings are a validated self report instrument assessing subjects awareness of tinnitus in daily life. Possible scores range from 0 (no tinnitus) to 100 (painfully loud tinnitus). Change equals the average rating for a given treatment week or washout period minus the average rating over three baseline assessments.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 58 participants were enrolled. Recruitment used a waitlist of subjects who already expressed interest in tinnitus studies and from advertisement.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 58 subjects enrolled, only 39 were assigned to study groups. Two subjects who initially failed screening were re-enrolled via a waiver before assignment. Ten had participated in an early version of the protocol that was not comparable. Seven subjects dropped out after baseline. So 2+10+7= the 19 participants who were enrolled but not started in the participant flow.</pre_assignment_details>

Only 9/58 adverse events were coded as study related and these are described in the Adverse Event Additional Description field.</desc>
