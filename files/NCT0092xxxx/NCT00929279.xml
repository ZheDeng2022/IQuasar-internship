    <textblock>
      In full responders to clopidogrel scheduled to undergo PCI for NSTEACS, the use of abciximab&#xD;
      bolus only plus 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose will result in a non-inferior inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet aggregation after 4 hours as measured by LTA (20micromol ADP) when compared with&#xD;
      abciximab plus infusion and 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on the outcome of the EPIC trial, and the sub-optimal results with a single abciximab&#xD;
      bolus compared with bolus and infusion, it was recommended to prolong platelet inhibition by&#xD;
      a 12h infusion of abciximab after the initial bolus administration in patients undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, lower outcomes in the single bolus group&#xD;
      in the EPIC study were entirely driven by the rates of urgent repeat revascularization at 30&#xD;
      days (3•6 percent bolus group versus 0•8 percent bolus and infusion group, p &lt; 0.001), a&#xD;
      complication probably related to the lack of stent use at that time. Importantly, there was&#xD;
      no significant difference in terms of death or myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, the use&#xD;
      of clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary stenting may currently reduce the need for&#xD;
      infusion after a single abciximab bolus and it is likely that the soon to come availably of&#xD;
      even more potent oral thienopyridines with faster onset of action such as prasugrel may&#xD;
      further contribute to make post-bolus abciximab infusion of marginal clinical benefit. Yet,&#xD;
      it is known that infusion, as compared to bolus only regimen increases the bleeding rate and&#xD;
      the incidence of thrombocytopenia. Thus, bolus only regimen has the potential to maintain&#xD;
      protection from ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI while optimizing the safety&#xD;
      profile of the treatment in the current era of intervention based on stents and&#xD;
      thienopyridines with fast onset of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLEAR-PLATELETS study has recently shown that 600 mg clopidogrel does not affect the&#xD;
      degree of platelet inhibition throughout infusion of eptifibatide, which is consistent with&#xD;
      the notion that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition at steady state leads to near maximal&#xD;
      platelet blockade. No study has so far investigated the effect of clopidogrel, given at high&#xD;
      loading dose, in patients treated with abciximab bolus only. In particular, it is not known&#xD;
      whether the administration of clopidogrel at high loading dose may prolong the effect of&#xD;
      abciximab bolus on the degree of platelet inhibition and if so at which time point the&#xD;
      combination of abciximab bolus and clopidogrel may become suboptimal in terms of platelet&#xD;
      inhibition as compared to currently recommended 12h infusion of abciximab after the initial&#xD;
      bolus administration. This information would lead to relevant clinical implications as it may&#xD;
      define the time frame for a safe and effective intervention after bolus only of abciximab in&#xD;
      current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, double-blind prospective randomized pharmacodynamic investigation of&#xD;
      2 antiplatelet regimens in patients undergoing coronary stenting for non-ST segment elevation&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes (NSTECACS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Abciximab bolus followed by infusion plus on-label clopidogrel administration at 300 mg&#xD;
           loading dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. abciximab bolus without infusion plus high loading dose of clopidogrel at 600 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigation is to test the hypothesis that the administration of&#xD;
      abciximab bolus only plus high loading dose of clopidogrel at 600 mg will provide a non&#xD;
      inferior level of inhibition of platelet aggregation 4 hours after administration as compared&#xD;
      to abciximab bolus followed by standard infusion in combination with clopidogrel loading dose&#xD;
      of 300 mg in patients with normal response to clopidogrel (as evaluated after 14-30 days).&#xD;
