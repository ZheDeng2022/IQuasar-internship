  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STOP-HF study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial recruiting asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals with risk factors for left ventricular dysfunction from 50 primary care clinics&#xD;
      in Dublin and south east Ireland. It is designed to determine whether using natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide measurement as a screening tool following a general cardiovascular risk factor screen&#xD;
      will reduce the prevalence and severity of ventricular dysfunction in conjunction with&#xD;
      specialist follow-up at St. Vincent's University Hospital.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of the population has substantial left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and&#xD;
      do not have symptoms (Stage B heart failure). For many of these patients, if identified and&#xD;
      treated appropriately, it is possible to prevent the subsequent development of heart failure&#xD;
      (HF). Although the current gold standard for detection of LVD is echocardiography, it is&#xD;
      expensive and impractical for mass screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptides are attractive candidates for screening populations for asymptomatic LVD&#xD;
      particularly because of high negative predictive values. Furthermore, some studies have shown&#xD;
      that, in the right setting, screening with natriuretic peptides might prove cost effective in&#xD;
      combination with echocardiography for patients with elevated levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in common with many accepted screening strategies, there are no randomised studies&#xD;
      which show that screening the population with natriuretic peptides for asymptomatic LVF&#xD;
      alters the natural history of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a large, community based cardiovascular risk screening programme including more than&#xD;
      13,000 patients, patients in the catchment area of St Vincent's University Hospital are&#xD;
      invited to participate in the STOP-HF study. The objective of this work is to determine&#xD;
      whether or not using natriuretic peptide screening in conjunction with specialist follow-up&#xD;
      will reduce the prevalence and severity of LVD in a well-defined, at-risk, primary care&#xD;
      population. It also aims to: evaluate the natural history of natriuretic peptides over time&#xD;
      in this population; to clarify optimal screening cut-offs for the detection of LVD; to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, genetic and proteomic determinants of&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides in this setting; to determine whether the clinical benefits of the STOP&#xD;
      HF screening programme, if any, are cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is prospective, randomised and parallel group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the prevalence and severity LVD after 5 years of follow up. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include: the natural history of natriuretic peptides; the relationship between&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides and severity of LVD, death, hospital admissions; clinical, demographic,&#xD;
      biochemical, pharmacological, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic determinants of natriuretic&#xD;
      peptides; screening cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who fulfill entry criteria at baseline will sign an informed consent and will be&#xD;
      randomised onto the Usual Care or Intervention Care arm of the study. Usual care is defined&#xD;
      as continued management of the patient by the primary care services using standard risk&#xD;
      factor monitoring and intervention strategies. Intervention Care is defined as a&#xD;
      collaborative cardiovascular management between primary care and specialist hospital based&#xD;
      services. All participants will receive an intensive education session from a cardiovascular&#xD;
      nurse on their risk factors and advice on healthy dietary and lifestyle habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 years of enrollment with annual review and 5 years of follow-up to the&#xD;
      primary endpoint. Permission has been received to extend the follow up period to 10 years.&#xD;
      Regardless of randomisation, all patients receive full clinical and laboratory assessment at&#xD;
      baseline and on completion of the STOP HF study (year 5). Additionally, all participants will&#xD;
      receive echocardiography assessment during and at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on all participants regarding their medical history and current&#xD;
      medications. The source of data collection will be from medical records kept at the primary&#xD;
      care practices and from patient interview. All participants will receive a booklet in which&#xD;
      they will be asked to record any visits to their primary care practitioner, alterations in&#xD;
      medications, new diagnoses and hospital admissions. Local hospital discharge records will be&#xD;
      screened to detect any events throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At annual intervals, the cardiovascular research nurse will conduct clinical assessments on&#xD;
      all participants including weight, abdominal girth measurement, blood pressure (triplicate&#xD;
      measurements while lying in supine position), heart rate and observe for evidence of limb&#xD;
      oedema. The nurse will also question the participants to investigate for symptoms of&#xD;
      dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, orthopnoea, palpitations and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and handling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn on all participants at annual intervals.&#xD;
      Samples to assess natriuretic peptides will be drawn into vacutainers containing EDTA and&#xD;
      samples to assess renal function, collagen turnover and lipid profile will be collected in&#xD;
      vacutainers containing lithium heparin. BNP and Lipid profile assessment will be analysed&#xD;
      using point of care meters, Biosite (Triage, USA) and Cholestech respectively. Each of the&#xD;
      remaining samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the serum will be then aliquoted and&#xD;
      stored at -80Â°C before analysis of biochemical, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic Doppler analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, targeted M-mode and Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained in each patient. M-mode measurements are taken according to the&#xD;
      guidelines laid down by the American Society of Echocardiography. All echocardiographic data&#xD;
      will represent the mean of 3 measurements on different cardiac cycles. It is the aim of the&#xD;
      STOP HF investigators that a single observer will conduct all measurements, recording archive&#xD;
      images in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
