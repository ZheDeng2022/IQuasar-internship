      To study the in vivo life span in healthy volunteers of red blood cells generated in vitro&#xD;
      from autologous peripheral stem cells. The study will be carried out in 4 phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  production in vitro of the equivalent of 1 ml of blood, i.e. 5x10e9 enucleated RBC from&#xD;
           mononuclear cells isolated from an HSC graft obtained from a healthy volunteers donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  labeling of these cRBC with 51 Cr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reinjection of the autologous cRBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow up of the receivers for a maximum 33 days to measure the half-life span of the&#xD;
           injected cells.&#xD;

      1. GENERALITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Clinical grade production of cRBC In this study the cRBC is both the active&#xD;
           principle and the final product subjected to radioactive chromium labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The quantity of 5x109 cRBC to be reinjected is determined by the necessity to have a&#xD;
           quantity of radioactivity lying between 2500 and 5000 kBq in order to have sufficient&#xD;
           sensitivity to measure the life span.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Hypothesis tested Since the cRBC have in vitro all the functional characteristics of&#xD;
           native RBC, it is hypothesized that they will be viable in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This viability will be evaluated by measuring their life span. It will be compared to&#xD;
           the reported life span of native RBC, i.e. 30+3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Principal objective Study of the life span in vivo of cultured Red Blood Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1 Principal: The principal criterion is the measured life span of the cRBC. It will&#xD;
           be compared to the reported life span of native RBC, i.e. 30+3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study involves labeling a cohort of cRBC: after administration, this cohort of cRBC&#xD;
           will age in the circulating blood and then disappear at the end of its &quot;life span&quot;. The&#xD;
           results will be interpreted in the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - if the radioactivity of the first 3 blood samples remains constant (after correction&#xD;
           for decay), this will be taken as evidence in favor of an absence of premature cell&#xD;
           destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following 3 samples will be drawn later [within the limit of 30 days, after which&#xD;
           measurement of the radioactivity of the samples will no longer be possible due to the&#xD;
           decay of chromium 51, elimination of chromium from the cells at the rate of 1.2% per day&#xD;
           and lack of precision of the radioactive count for very low activities]. One will&#xD;
           conclude that the life span of the cRBC is superior to 33 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - if, in the first 3 samples, the radioactivity diminishes in a significant manner and&#xD;
           earlier than on the reference curves, three other samples taken close together will&#xD;
           enable estimation of the mean life span of the cRBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Type of study Clinical feasibility assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Experimental plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be carried out in 4 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. production in vitro of the equivalent of 1mL of blood, i.e. 5x109 enucleated RBC,&#xD;
                from mononuclear cells isolated from an HSC graft obtained from a healthy&#xD;
                benevolent donor,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. labeling of these cRBC with 51Cr, according to the classical protocol used to study&#xD;
                the life span of red blood cells,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. reinjection of the autologous cRBC into the same donor,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. follow-up of the receiver for a maximal duration of 33 days to measure the&#xD;
                half-life of the injected cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RECEIVERS 4.1 Description of the study population The choice of&#xD;
           conducting the study in healthy volunteers and not in patients is based on the necessity&#xD;
           to have a healthy physiological context avoiding any situation which could lead to&#xD;
           hemolysis. As the protocol requires mobilization with a growth factor, the donors of&#xD;
           peripheral stem cells (PSC) receive G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The voluntary receivers will be recruited among intra-familial donors of PSC, in order to&#xD;
      avoid the unnecessary exposure of a healthy donor to G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of the mobilization of HSC, they will receive for 5 days subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections of G-CSF at a dose of 10 µg/kg body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 Collection of mononuclear cells by cytapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of the starting material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells will not be taken for the production of cultured&#xD;
      RBC unless the graft destined for the patient contains &gt; 7x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight of&#xD;
      the patient receiver, the cell dose established in the literature as being sufficient to&#xD;
      reconstitute the hematopoiesis of a patient receiving an allogenic graft. Thus the research&#xD;
      protocol will incur no loss of chance for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 Isolation of CD34+ cells for the protocol The CD34+ cells to be used for research will&#xD;
      be selected on a positive immunomagnetic selection column using an Isolex® system. A minimum&#xD;
      of 45x106 CD34+ cells is necessary for good functioning of the system. These limiting factors&#xD;
      oblige us to use as starting material stem cells mobilized with G-CSF. After removal of this&#xD;
      sample for the study, the graft will have to contain a minimum of 7x106 CD34+ cells/kg body&#xD;
      weight of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-selection starting material will consist of clinical grade CD34+ cells purified by&#xD;
      immunomagnetic selection. A purity of more than 50% CD34+ cells should be obtained after&#xD;
      immunomagnetic selection. The percentage of viable cells will be determined by staining with&#xD;
      trypan blue. The purified CD34+ cells will be frozen in a 4% albumin solution containing 10%&#xD;
      DMSO and conditioned in 2.5 mL cryotubes containing 1x106 CD34+ cells. After thawing, the&#xD;
      cell viability should be more than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 1 million viable CD34+ cells is necessary for seeding in culture on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.3 Biological characterization of the cRBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active principle is filtered cRBC and the final product cRBC labeled with 51Cr. As the&#xD;
      product should be reinjected immediately after labeling, characterization will be performed&#xD;
      on the active principle and will involve the following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active principle should consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RBC characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  their morphology (on slides stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  their hemoglobin content (MHC &gt; 25 pg measured in a Sysmex XE-2100 automate) (see&#xD;
                3.2.S.4.3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. acidophilic erythroblasts &lt; 1.2% (in &gt; 10,000 cells counted on a slide);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to the exclusion of all other cell types in &gt; 10,000 cells counted on a slide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.4 Sufficient criteria of the active principle (cRBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product will be labeled with chromium if it presents the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 to 10x109 RBC with MHC &gt; 25 pg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 1.2% acidophilic erythroblasts,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an absence of leukocytes. The remaining microbiological controls will be known a&#xD;
           posteriori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.5 Labeling with chromium 51&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step will be performed in the nuclear medicine clinic. Labeling is carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  using a suspension of cRBC,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and a sterile solution of [51Cr] sodium chromate having an activity of 37 MBq/mL on&#xD;
           calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The labeling procedure itself is performed under clinically sterile conditions. The&#xD;
      suspension is injected in 0.3 mL fractions (constraint linked to measurement of the 51Cr&#xD;
      activity of the syringes before injection) using 2 mL syringes closed with a stopper. The&#xD;
      maximal volume reinjected will be 5 mL by intravenous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.6 Sufficient criteria of the final product labeled with 51Cr&#xD;
&#xD;
      The labeled product will be injected into the healthy volunteer if it presents the following&#xD;
      characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  51Cr activity between 2,500 KBq (minimum) and 5,000 KBq (maximum),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an absence of 51Cr not bound to cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.7 Injection into receivers This step will take place within 2 months after stem cell&#xD;
      collection. Direct intravenous injection of labeled cRBC in a volume of 1 mL, in a room&#xD;
      reserved for the administration of radioactive drugs, situated in the nuclear medicine clinic&#xD;
      and adjacent to the preparation laboratory, for regulatory reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of a venous route until the end of the period of surveillance. Collection of 2&#xD;
      samples of 10 mL of blood into EDTA by venous puncture at the bend of the elbow, at T+1h and&#xD;
      T+3h after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discharge from the clinic: absence of fever or shivering, normal blood pressure&#xD;
      and normal clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the post-injection surveillance: 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Planning of the appointments for measurement of the life span of cRBC Collection of 10 mL&#xD;
      samples by venous puncture at the bend of the elbow and follow-up of the receivers will be&#xD;
      carried out at the CIC St Antoine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer of the tubes to the nuclear medicine clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third sample will be taken T+24h after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following 3 will be taken on days chosen according to the decay estimated from the&#xD;
           first samples (between T+48h and T+30 days after injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of establishment of fixed dates of sampling is justified by the necessity to adapt&#xD;
      to the kinetics of this homogenous population of cRBC, at present unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical examination will be carried out at each appointment. After performing the&#xD;
      measurements, the samples will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this approach has several advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It avoids injecting a growth factor, G-CSF, into a healthy volunteer for the sole&#xD;
           objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The autologous situation avoids any immunological risk and any risk of transmission of&#xD;
           infectious agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 51Cr is an emitter of gamma radiation of energy 320 keV and has a radioactive period of&#xD;
           27.7 days. The irradiation resulting from this study involves no measurable risk. No&#xD;
           particular radioprotective precautions need to envisaged, either for the receiver or for&#xD;
           those in contact with him.&#xD;
