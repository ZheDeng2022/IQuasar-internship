  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tanezumab for chronic&#xD;
      low back pain. Patients who were randomized and treated with study medication in a previous&#xD;
      chronic low back pain &quot;parent&quot; study will be eligible to enroll in this safety extension&#xD;
      study at the Preferred Rollover Time Point visit or at the Early Termination visit of the&#xD;
      parent study upon discontinuation due to lack of efficacy.&#xD;

      This study was terminated on 30 November 2010 following a US FDA clinical hold for tanezumab&#xD;
      chronic low back pain clinical studies which halted dosing and enrollment of patients on 19&#xD;
      July 2010 for potential safety issues.&#xD;

        <description>NIS: 74 items, assess muscle weakness, reflexes and sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each side). Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae) and sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0 = normal, 1= decreased, or 2 = absent. Total possible NIS score range 0-244, higher score=greater impairment.</description>

          <description>NIS: 74 items, assess muscle weakness, reflexes and sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each side). Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae) and sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0 = normal, 1= decreased, or 2 = absent. Total possible NIS score range 0-244, higher score=greater impairment.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set. 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. Data was not collected for tanezumab 10 mg arm at Week 56 since none of the participants received dosing beyond Week 32 and safety assessment was only required for 16 weeks after treatment discontinuation due to clinical hold.</population>

        <description>BPI-sf: 11-item self-report questionnaire consists of 5 questions, to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Question/item 1-4 (Q1-Q4) measure impact of pain (worst, least, average, right now). Question 5 (Q5) consists of 7 items which measure level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life). Each item answered on 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain/interference) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes).</description>

          <description>BPI-sf: 11-item self-report questionnaire consists of 5 questions, assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Q1-Q4 measure impact of pain (worst, least, average, right now). Q5 (7 items) measure level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each item answered on 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain/interference) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes). 7 items in Q5 averaged to obtain function composite score, range: 0 to 10; higher score=greater impairment.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of IV or SC study medication during this study, A4091039 (NCT00924664). 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.

        <description>BPI-sf: 11-item self-report questionnaire consists of 5 questions, assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Q1-Q4 measure impact of pain (worst, least, average, right now). Q5 (7 items) measure level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each item answered on 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain/interference) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes). 7 items in Q5 averaged to obtain function composite score, range: 0 to 10; higher score=greater impairment.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf: 11-item self-report questionnaire consists of 5 questions, assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Q1-Q4 measure impact of pain (worst, least, average, right now). Q5 (7 items) measure level of interference of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each item answered on 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain/interference) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes). 7 items in Q5 averaged to obtain function composite score, range: 0 to 10; higher score=greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From A4091012 (NCT00876187) Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) at Week 24 and 56</title>
        <description>WPAI:SHP: 6-item, binary question on current employment, 3 questions on hours of work and work-loss, 2 questions based on 0-10 point scale to judge how CLBP affects ability to work, perform regular activities(0=no effect on work/activity, 10=completely prevented from working/activity). Four scores derived as percent: activity impairment, impairment while working, overall work impairment, work time missed. Total possible score: 0-100 (0=no impairment/high productivity, 100=completely impaired/low activity). Each of 4 scores expressed as impairment percentages, high percentage=more impairment, less productivity.</description>
