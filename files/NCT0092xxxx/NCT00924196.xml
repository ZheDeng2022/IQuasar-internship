      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder in which patients are at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing tumors (usually non-cancerous) of the central and peripheral nervous system.&#xD;
      The disease affects essentially every organ system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural course of NFI over time is poorly understood. For most patients the only&#xD;
      treatment option is surgery. A better understanding of NF1 may be helpful for the design of&#xD;
      future treatment studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate people with NF1 over 10 years in order to better understand the natural history&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the patient population and to examine how NFI affects patients quality of&#xD;
      life and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children, adolescents, and adults with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have a comprehensive baseline evaluation including genetic testing, tumor&#xD;
      imaging, pain and quality-of-life assessments, and neuropsychological, motor and endocrine&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are monitored every 6 months to every 3 years, depending on their individual&#xD;
      findings at the baseline study. Tests may include the following, as appropriate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole body and face photography to monitor visible deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing, quality-of-life evaluations, motor function tests,&#xD;
           endocrinologic evaluations, heart and lung function tests, hearing tests, bone density&#xD;
           scans and other bone evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI and PET scans to detect and assess plexiform neurofibromas (tumors that arise from&#xD;
           nerves and can cause serious problems), paraspinal neurofibromas (tumors that arise from&#xD;
           nerves around the spine and can cause problems by compressing the spinal cord), and&#xD;
           malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (a type of cancer that arises from a peripheral&#xD;
           nerve or involves the sheath covering the nerve).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exams, MRI scans and PET scans to evaluate optic pathway gliomas (tumors arising&#xD;
           from the vision nerves or the brain areas for vision) and the chemicals within the tumor&#xD;
           and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exams and photographs to evaluate the development of Lisch nodules (non-cancerous&#xD;
           tumors on the eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of dermal neurofibromas (tumors of the skin), cafe-au-lait spots (dark or&#xD;
           pigmented areas on the skin that are often the first signs of NF1) and other skin&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain evaluations to monitor the different types of pain patients experience, causes of&#xD;
           the pain, how often the pain occurs, effect of the pain on quality of life, and what&#xD;
           pain medications and alternative treatments, such as acupuncture, are effective.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant, progressive genetic disorder&#xD;
      characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. Patients with NF1 have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including plexiform&#xD;
      neurofibromas (PN), dermal neurofibromas, optic pathway tumors, brain tumors, malignant&#xD;
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and&#xD;
      pheochromocytomas. In addition, NF1 manifests in essentially every organ system, with for&#xD;
      example, skeletal and vascular abnormalities, and cognitive deficits. Thus, the care for&#xD;
      individuals with NF1 requires a multidisciplinary approach. The natural history of NF1&#xD;
      related tumor and other manifestations is poorly understood, and for most NF1 related tumor&#xD;
      manifestations the only standard treatment option is surgery. The NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      provides the ideal infrastructure for evaluation of the natural history of rare diseases. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the natural history of NF1 related tumor and other manifestations&#xD;
      will be helpful for the design of treatment studies. The NCI, POB has an active clinical&#xD;
      trials program for NF1 related tumor manifestations including PN, MPNST, and in collaboration&#xD;
      with Dr. Douglas Stewart from the NHGRI, dermal neurofibromas. Unlike individuals with&#xD;
      refractory solid cancers, individuals with NF1 have near normal life expectancy, and their&#xD;
      benign tumors progress more slowly than solid cancers. Individuals with NF1 may thus&#xD;
      participate in multiple treatment trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this descriptive NF1 Natural History study is to serve as an umbrella&#xD;
      protocol for the ongoing NF1 clinical trials program to allow the longitudinal evaluation of&#xD;
      individuals with NF1 for NF1 related tumor and non tumor manifestations irrespective whether&#xD;
      they are currently enrolled on a treatment study or not, and to develop a better&#xD;
      understanding of the biology of NF1 related manifestations. Following these patients&#xD;
      longitudinally will allow investigators to develop a better understanding of the natural&#xD;
      history of these manifestations, provide the basis for the development of endpoints for&#xD;
      clinical trials and to potentially develop more effective treatments. NF1 manifestations,&#xD;
      which will be followed longitudinally, include PN, MPNST, optic pathway tumors, dermal&#xD;
      neurofibromas, NF1 associated pain, and neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine function. A&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment plan and recommendations will be developed and communicated with the&#xD;
      patient and primary caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children, adolescents, and adults with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of NF1 or a confirmed&#xD;
      NF1 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts will be made to have all individuals undergo a comprehensive baseline evaluation&#xD;
      including clinical phenotyping, genotyping, imaging of tumor manifestations, and pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, neuropsychological, motor, and endocrine evaluations. The NF1 manifestations&#xD;
      will be longitudinally monitored with a frequency of every year to every three years, with&#xD;
      the extent and timing of follow-up evaluations depending on the findings at baseline.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA PATIENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Less than or equal to 35 years of age for new patients evaluated at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No upper age limit for patients previously enrolled on clinical trials at NIH or&#xD;
                  for patients diagnosed with MPNST, or with clinical concern for MPNST, or with&#xD;
                  infrequent or unusual NF1 related manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis: Patients who are diagnosed with NF1 using the NIH Consensus Conference&#xD;
             criteria or have a confirmed NF1 mutation with analysis performed in a CLIA-certified&#xD;
             laboratory. NF1 mutation testing to confirm eligibility will not be performed on this&#xD;
             protocol, but as part of a separate screening study. Histologic confirmation of NF1&#xD;
             related benign tumors is not necessary in the presence of consistent clinical and&#xD;
             radiographic findings, but is required for individuals with MPNST who enroll on this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For the clinical diagnosis of NF1 all study subjects must have at least two or more&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus Conference):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (greater than or equal to 0.5 cm in prepubertal&#xD;
                  subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in postpubertal subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Greater than or equal to 2 neurofibromas or 1 plexiform neurofibroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Freckling in the axilla or groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Optic glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Two or more Lisch nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. A first-degree relative with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior and current therapy: For NF1 related benign tumor manifestations there is no&#xD;
             standard effective medical treatment, and surgery is the only standard treatment.&#xD;
             Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are additional treatment options for malignant NF1&#xD;
             related tumors. For the purpose of this study, subjects who have not previously&#xD;
             received medical or surgical treatment, patients, who have previously received medical&#xD;
             or surgical treatment, and patients who are currently receiving medical treatment&#xD;
             and/or radiation for a NF1 related manifestation will be eligible. Prior and current&#xD;
             treatment for NF1 related manifestations will be recorded at trial entry and&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Performance Status: ECOG less than or equal to 3. Subjects who are wheelchair bound&#xD;
             because of paralysis will be considered ambulatory when they are up in their&#xD;
             wheelchair. Subjects have to be able to travel to the NIH for evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Informed Consent: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than&#xD;
             18 years old) must sign an IRB-approved document of informed consent to demonstrate&#xD;
             their understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study before&#xD;
             any protocol-related studies are performed. When appropriate, pediatric subjects will&#xD;
             be included in all discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): All subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
             will be offered the opportunity to assign DPA so that another person can make&#xD;
             decisions about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively&#xD;
             impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In addition, subjects participating in evaluation for variation in gene expression&#xD;
             must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have at least 1 plexiform neurofibroma and be able to undergo MRI analysis of the&#xD;
                  plexiform neurofibroma(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If possible, but not absolutely required, have one or both biologic parents (NF1&#xD;
                  affected or not) willing to donate a blood or cheek swab, or mouthwash sample for&#xD;
                  DNA extraction. A separate informed consent will be obtained from biologic&#xD;
                  parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the opinion of the investigator the patient is not able to return for follow-up&#xD;
             visits or obtain required follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the opinion of the investigator the patient is not able to obtain an MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding or who become pregnant while enrolled&#xD;
             on this trial will not be excluded from participation, but will not undergo&#xD;
             radiographic evaluations or MRI scans requested for research purposes, or other&#xD;
             studies which might negatively impact on the pregnancy.&#xD;
