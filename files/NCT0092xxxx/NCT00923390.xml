  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An experimental cancer treatment procedure involves taking a patient s own tumor or&#xD;
           blood cells, modifying them with a gene that targets proteins on the surface of tumor&#xD;
           cells, and growing those cells in a laboratory. The modified cells are then given back&#xD;
           to the patient by intravenous (IV) transfusion, in the hope that the new cells will&#xD;
           attack and destroy the cancer cells without harming healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This procedure has been used for melanoma patients, and researchers are now attempting&#xD;
           to use this treatment for patients with renal (kidney) cancer. In the laboratory, this&#xD;
           attack kills nearly all kidney cancers tested, but not normal tissues. However, the&#xD;
           effectiveness and possible side effects of this treatment are still being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if cells modified to target DR4 and TRAIL (two proteins found on the surface&#xD;
           of many kidney tumors) are effective in treating kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause&#xD;
           unacceptable side effects) of the modified cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic renal cancer whose disease has not&#xD;
           responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be divided into two study branches: Arm A for those who will be receiving&#xD;
           modified cells from their biopsied tumor, and Arm B for those who will be receiving&#xD;
           their own modified white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five-stage treatment process, outpatient for stages 1 and 5 and inpatient for stages 2&#xD;
           through 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work-up (1 to 2 weeks): Physical examination, heart and lung function tests, imaging&#xD;
           tests, blood and/or tumor samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV chemotherapy (1 week): Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to prepare for the new cell&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV cell infusion and treatment with IL-2 to support the modified cells (4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recovery (1 to 2 weeks): Recover from effects of chemotherapy and infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (every 1 to 6 months): Return to clinic for physical exam, review of side&#xD;
           effects, other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up evaluations will continue to determine the success of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test&#xD;
           for women who can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease evaluation and monitoring on both inpatient and outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because researchers do not know the long-term side effects of gene therapy, patients&#xD;
           will be asked to participate in long-term follow up for up to 15 years. The follow-up&#xD;
           will involve yearly physical exams and medical history, and blood collection (3, 6 and&#xD;
           12 months after treatment, and every year after that).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical administration of tumor-reactive T-cells grown in vitro is a highly active&#xD;
           therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma in experimental protocols when they are&#xD;
           combined with preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy and systemic IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We cloned a novel T-cell from the blood of a patient with renal cell cancer (RCC), which&#xD;
           recognizes nearly all human renal cancer lines irrespective of MHC haplotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The alpha sign and beta sign chain of T-cell receptor from this clone, 2G-1, can be&#xD;
           introduced into human lymphocytes by retroviral transduction and confers this same&#xD;
           recognition of RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This TCR was found to recognize TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) bound to&#xD;
           its receptor DR4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both TRAIL and agonist antibodies to DR4 have tumor specificity and are in current&#xD;
           clinical trials for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two amino acid modifications of the native TCR greatly augmented its recognition of RCCs&#xD;
           without altering background reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine if the administration of T-cells retrovirally transduced with the 2G-1&#xD;
                TCR, with preparative chemotherapy and IL-2, can cause the regression of metastatic&#xD;
                RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for cells incorporating a TCR in PBL&#xD;
                and in TIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the toxicities of these T-cells administered in the above fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine TCR and vector presence in the post treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with measurable metastatic clear cell renal cancer who have previously received&#xD;
           at least one systemic standard care regimen and have progressed or be found to be&#xD;
           intolerant of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be eligible for high-dose IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must not have active or clinically symptomatic CNS metastases within the&#xD;
           previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have acceptable hematopoietic and major organ function as determined by&#xD;
           laboratory and/or functional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase I-II dose escalating protocol with 2 arms. Patients in Arm A will receive&#xD;
           peripheral blood lymphocytes transduced with the 2G-1 TCR; patients in Arm B will&#xD;
           receive renal TIL transduced with the 2G-1 TCR. Arm B will begin after a safe dose has&#xD;
           been defined in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once MTD has been established for each arm, up to 24 patients will be enrolled in each&#xD;
           arm of the phase II stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed in one to four days by IV&#xD;
           infusion of their transduced cells and subsequent IV aldesleukin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 106 patients may be enrolled over 3-4 years.&#xD;
