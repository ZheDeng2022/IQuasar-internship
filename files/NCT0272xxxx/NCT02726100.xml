  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's a community-based parallel-arm cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). An interactive&#xD;
      mobile health management system will be developed to support lay family health promoters and&#xD;
      healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (T2DM). 2,000 participants from 80 sites will be chosen from urban (40 communities)&#xD;
      and rural (40 villages) settings in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province.&#xD;

      Study design and Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster randomised controlled trial involving 80 sites (40 communities in urban Shijiazhuang&#xD;
      and 40 villages in rural Shijiazhuang) and 2,000 people with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interactive mobile health management system can support lay family health promoters (FHP)&#xD;
      and healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMARTHealth Diabetes is an interactive mobile health platform to promote improved&#xD;
      self-management for people with T2DM. It comprises the following core features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management support based on best practice clinical guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management tools and resources for family members&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Password protected registration of patients and their nominated FHP to access this&#xD;
           information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population of key clinical information into a desktop application used by health care&#xD;
           providers when applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 urban communities and 40 rural villages from geographically dispersed regions will be&#xD;
           selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each community/ village must have at least one community health station providing&#xD;
           services to ≥1,000 adult residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff at the community health station must be willing to participate in the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 clusters and a mean community cluster size of 25 participants (2,000 total) will provide&#xD;
      90% power to detect an absolute improvement of 10% in the primary outcome. This assumes 20%&#xD;
      of people in the control arm will achieve ≥2 'ABC' diabetes goals ((HbA1C&lt;7%; Blood Pressure&#xD;
      &lt;140/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol &lt;100mg/dl or 2.6mmol/L) at end of study; an intra-class&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of 0.05, a 20% loss to follow-up, and a 2-sided significance level of&#xD;
      0.05. This translates to a mean reduction of 0.35% for HbA1C, 0.14 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      and 3.4mmHg for systolic BP. Primary analyses will be conducted at the patient level.&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will be conducted at the cluster level. Sub-group analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted at the community level (based on size and health service characteristics) and&#xD;
      patient level (based on demographic factors (co-habitation with FHP) and clinical factors&#xD;
      (control rate of 'ABC' risk factors at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chinese government has placed prevention and treatment of diabetes as one of 11 National&#xD;
      Basic Public Health Services. Despite great promise for mobile health (mHealth) interventions&#xD;
      to improve access to effective healthcare, there remains uncertainty about how this can be&#xD;
      successfully achieved. These uncertainties pose substantial dilemmas for health system&#xD;
      planners. The findings are likely to inform policy on a scalable strategy to overcome&#xD;
      sub-optimal access to effective health care in China.&#xD;
