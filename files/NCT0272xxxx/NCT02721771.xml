  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, in both the&#xD;
      developed and developing world. It is a complex, multisystem disease which, in its severe&#xD;
      form, affects the cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological and haematological systems.&#xD;
      The University of Cape Town-associated medical institutions alone were responsible for the&#xD;
      treatment of 800 women in 2014, who were classified as having preeclampsia with severe&#xD;
      features. Given the complexity of the disease, anesthetic management for Caesarean section in&#xD;
      these patients remains very challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have begun to demonstrate novel markers of preeclampsia severity, including&#xD;
      point-of-care ultrasound (POC-US) and acid-base (AB) abnormalities. For example, pilot&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia&#xD;
      show signs of increased intracranial pressure and elevated lung water as evaluated by point&#xD;
      of care ultrasound. These findings could serve as noninvasive markers of disease severity,&#xD;
      and thus may be used to predict maternal and fetal outcome in preeclamptic women. Point of&#xD;
      care ultrasound is playing an increasing role in perioperative diagnosis, and newer, less&#xD;
      expensive devices are continuously being developed, and will in all likelihood play an&#xD;
      important role in South Africa in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent trial performed at the University of Cape Town, a comprehensive acid-base&#xD;
      analysis in severe preeclamptic women demonstrated significant abnormalities in independent&#xD;
      acid-base determinants. In addition, strong indications were found that changes in acid-base&#xD;
      status in preeclampsia are more pronounced earlier in pregnancy and are associated with&#xD;
      urgent deliveries. As in other clinical arenas in critically ill patients, acid-base&#xD;
      abnormalities are associated with increased lung water, increased intracranial pressure, and&#xD;
      outcome, and we hypothesize that similar associations might be found in severe preeclamptic&#xD;
      women. Therefore, one aim of this study is to evaluate the association of venous acid base&#xD;
      abnormalities (an inexpensive and readily available test) observed in late onset severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia and organ manifestations identified with ultrasound, a well-validated and robust&#xD;
      tool for identifying these manifestations. Investigators will further examine the association&#xD;
      between ultrasound findings and/or venous acid-base abnormalities with urgent delivery. It is&#xD;
      intended to do a subsequent comparison between early- and late onset preeclampsia, when a&#xD;
      suitable tertiary site has been identified.&#xD;

      I. Introduction / Specific Aims Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality (15-20 %&#xD;
      in developed countries) and acute and long-term morbidity for the mother and newborn. It is a&#xD;
      multi-system disorder characterised by abnormal vascular response to placentation, associated&#xD;
      with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the&#xD;
      coagulation system, and endothelial dysfunction. Preeclampsia is defined by a number of signs&#xD;
      and symptoms, but is characterized by multi-organ changes that encompass the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS), lungs, liver, kidneys, systemic vasculature, coagulation, and the heart .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Derived from other clinical arenas of intensive care medicine, new potential markers of&#xD;
      disease severity in women diagnosed with preeclampsia have recently been identified. Using&#xD;
      noninvasive point-of-care (POC) ultrasound, pulmonary interstitial edema and raised&#xD;
      intracranial pressure were identified in 25% and 20% respectively of women showing features&#xD;
      of severe preeclampsia. In addition, echocardiographic and laboratory studies in women&#xD;
      diagnosed with preeclampsia indicate an incidence of diastolic dysfunction and increased left&#xD;
      ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in up to 30%. These findings could have a&#xD;
      significant impact on maternal outcome and the detailed methodology of anesthesia care for&#xD;
      the parturient with severe preeclampsia (PreE), including the mode of anesthesia, positioning&#xD;
      of the patient, fluid management, and hemodynamic goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent investigation performing a comprehensive physicochemical acid/base analysis in&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic women (AB-PreE-Trial), the presence of simultaneous hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis&#xD;
      and hyperchloraemic acidosis was identified. In addition, investigators found indications&#xD;
      that hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis is more marked in early versus late onset disease and is&#xD;
      associated with mode of delivery. In other critical care arenas it has been shown that&#xD;
      reduced albumin and acid-base abnormalities are associated with pulmonary interstitial edema,&#xD;
      elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and poor clinical outcomes. Venous acid-base analysis&#xD;
      may therefore be a widely available and inexpensive marker of pulmonary interstitial edema&#xD;
      and elevated ICP in preeclampsia, with potentially important impact on anesthesia care.&#xD;
      Therefore, one aim is to evaluate the association between elevated base excess to changes in&#xD;
      albumin concentration (BE(Alb)) with pulmonary interstitial edema and increased ICP (both&#xD;
      evaluated with non-invasive ultrasound) in patients with late onset severe preeclampsia.&#xD;
      Investigators will further evaluate for an association with urgent delivery (fetal or&#xD;
      maternal indication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term goal will be to use findings to guide clinical decision-making by anaesthetists to&#xD;
      identify individual patients with acute organ system failures, helping better plan&#xD;
      anaesthetic management during Cesarean delivery. Also, the findings from a larger future&#xD;
      study could predict maternal and fetal complications, and show differences between early- and&#xD;
      late onset disease. This should be of significant future benefit in the South African&#xD;
      context, where preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To explore the association between ultrasound findings and/or venous acid-base&#xD;
      abnormalities, with urgent delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that patients with acid-base changes secondary to albumin, interstitial&#xD;
      edema and/or elevated ICP will experience a greater proportion of urgent deliveries, compared&#xD;
      to patients without these abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the association between pulmonary interstitial edema and increased ICP&#xD;
      with changes in BE(Alb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Based on prior studies showing the association of low albumin with&#xD;
      increased extravascular lung water and worse cerebral edema it is hypothesised that the mean&#xD;
      BE(Alb) will be higher in patients with pulmonary interstitial edema and increased ICP&#xD;
      (assessed with POC ultrasound), compared to patients without interstitial edema and normal&#xD;
      ICP. Point-of-care ultrasound is a validated method of identifying both pulmonary&#xD;
      interstitial edema and elevated ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Among patients with late onset disease, prior data suggests that 30% of patients will&#xD;
      have a BE(Alb) &gt; 4 meq/L, with a rate of fetal distress &gt;70% in this population, as compared&#xD;
      to a fetal distress rate of 25% in women with a BE(Alb) &lt; 4 meq/L. Based on the observation&#xD;
      that 70% of women in late onset disease will have a BE(Alb) &lt; 4 meq/L at diagnosis, and&#xD;
      considering an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.8, 70 patients will be needed to reject&#xD;
      null hypothesis of predicting delivery status with BE(alb) &gt; 4mEq/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: In addition, available data suggests that the incidence of elevated intracranial&#xD;
      pressure and interstitial pulmonary edema diagnosed by ultrasound in severe preeclampsia is&#xD;
      approximately 25%, and an elevated BE (Alb) is found in approximately 30% of patients with&#xD;
      severe preeclampsia. Prior data in critically ill patients indicates a mean albumin of 2.8&#xD;
      g/dL (SD 0.7) in patients with normal lung water, compared a mean albumin of 2.2 g/dL (SD&#xD;
      0.7) in patients with increased lung water. When converted to the BE (Alb) scale (assuming a&#xD;
      mean pH of 7.4) and with the biologically plausible assumption of a similar relationship with&#xD;
      ICP, in order to show a statistically meaningful difference in the mean BE (Alb) level among&#xD;
      patients with severe preeclampsia with and without interstitial edema and with and without&#xD;
      elevated ICP, we will need to recruit a total of 80 patients, with an alpha level of 0.05 and&#xD;
      a power of 0.9. Furthermore, on the BE (Alb) scale, the mean BE (Alb) of the low albumin&#xD;
      group (mean albumin of 2.2 g/dL) is approximately equal to a BE (Alb) of 4 meq/L and may&#xD;
      represent an important clinical endpoint. Thus, assuming a normal distribution, 50% of this&#xD;
      group is expected to have a BE (Alb) &gt; 4 meq/L. The increased albumin group (mean albumin of&#xD;
      2.8 g/dL) lies approximately 1 standard deviation from the decreased albumin group, and&#xD;
      assuming a normal distribution, we would expect 18% of this group to exceed the BE (Alb) &gt; 4&#xD;
      meq/L cut point. Using these two proportions, a chi-squared test with a sample ratio of 3:1,&#xD;
      power of 0.8, and alpha level of 0.05 will require a total sample size of 84 patients (21&#xD;
      with the ultrasound findings and 63 without findings).&#xD;
