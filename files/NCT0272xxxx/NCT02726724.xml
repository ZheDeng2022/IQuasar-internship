  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Endotracheal intubation (ETI) of a neonate is a procedure that usually attracts a large&#xD;
      number of observers. The fear of being judged by others could cause an increased level of&#xD;
      stress, especially on the junior trainees. Little research has focused on the effect of the&#xD;
      audience on the level of stress and therefore, on the success rate of complicated procedures&#xD;
      in neonatal intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:Investigators hypothesize that time to successful intubation (in seconds) will be&#xD;
      longer with the presence of observers.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study will be to provide objective evidence supporting that junior&#xD;
      trainees are less successful at neonatal ETI when in the presence of a large audience. If&#xD;
      this hypothesis is correct, this data will provide evidence to support the residents request&#xD;
      for less people around during the procedure, which may increase the chance of a successful&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Investigators obtained written consent - the selected student-will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      cardiac monitor and 5 minutes later after a period of rest, they will be called in the&#xD;
      delivery room. Two minutes after their arrival they will be given a stylet and a 3.5 ET tube&#xD;
      and will be asked to intubate orally a mannequin, after 30 seconds, the operator will be&#xD;
      reminded of the time. After 45 seconds the attempts will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed of their right to discontinue participation at any time. The&#xD;
      trainee will be informed at the end of the experience about the aim of the study and will be&#xD;
      asked to keep it confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trainees will be randomized in two groups that differentiate in the conditions under&#xD;
      which they will start the intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition A: Only the staff will be present with the operator Condition B: An audience of 5&#xD;
      people with at least 2 neonatologists will be present in case of junior resident or the&#xD;
      responsible of stage in case of respiratory therapy students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The residents who performed intubation in condition A will do a repeat intubation 24 hours&#xD;
      later using condition B and vice versa. The time and the local of the 2 procedures will be&#xD;
      the same in both conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to successful intubation will be compared between the two experimental conditions for&#xD;
      each subject with paired t test. A p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the required sample size, Investigators used the study O'Donnel and al who gave&#xD;
      an approximate intubation time for trainees of 38 seconds with standard deviation of 20&#xD;
      seconds (14). Using an alpha threshold of 0.05 and power of 80 %, a sample size of 51&#xD;
      subjects is required to detect 8 second difference time between the two different groups.&#xD;
      Eight seconds represents a 25 % change in time to intubate and is clinically significant for&#xD;
      a newborn.&#xD;
