      This is a web-based randomized survey to evaluate management of respiratory symptoms among&#xD;
      physicians in Sweden. The aim of this study is to determine if there is a gender bias in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD and how often physicians identify that chronic refractory breathlessness&#xD;
      requires treatment as compared to refractory pain.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. An American randomized web-based study showed important differences in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of COPD among female and male patients.Women were more likely to be misdiagnosed as&#xD;
      chronic cough or asthma instead of COPD and physicians were more reluctant to refer further&#xD;
      women for spirometry.This is of importance as treatment and follow-up differ between the&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathlessness, a subjective experience of breathing discomfort, is the cardinal symptom of&#xD;
      cardiac and pulmonary disease. In advanced COPD, 98% of patients experience breathlessness&#xD;
      which persists at rest or on minimal exertion, despite optimal treatment of the underlying&#xD;
      disease (chronic refractory breathlessness). Dyspnea is linked to reduced physical activity,&#xD;
      worsening deconditioning, increased anxiety and depression, impaired quality of life, loss of&#xD;
      the will to live near death, increased risk of hospitalization, and earlier death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred treatment for the relief of chronic refractory breathlessness is a systemic&#xD;
      (oral or parenteral) low dose opioid (Level I evidence). In a recent meta-analysis of 16&#xD;
      studies (271 patients in total), low dose opioids reduced chronic refractory breathlessness&#xD;
      in advanced COPD, without any reported serious adverse effects. Lower dose opioids were not&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of admission to hospital or death in a large register-based&#xD;
      Swedish study of 2,249 patients with oxygen-dependent COPD patients treated with lower dose&#xD;
      opioids (≤ 30mg of oral morphine/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the growing evidence that support the use of opioids, physicians are reluctant to&#xD;
      prescribe low dose opioids for breathlessness in COPD. In a review of 2000 random dispensed&#xD;
      opioid prescriptions among patients with advanced COPD, most of whom suffered from severe&#xD;
      chronic breathlessness, the most common stated indication was pain (97%), with only 2% for&#xD;
      breathlessness. In a survey, Dutch chest physicians were reluctant to prescribe opioids for&#xD;
      refractory breathlessness in advanced COPD due to perceived resistance from the patient and&#xD;
      fear of adverse effects, including respiratory depression. Qualitative studies from Canada&#xD;
      has shown that physicians in pulmonary medicine and primary care, families and patients feel&#xD;
      that low dose opioids can be helpful for the relief of breathlessness, but that treatment was&#xD;
      delayed or avoided due to lack of guidelines, lack of related knowledge and experience about&#xD;
      opioids, and fears related to the potential adverse effects and legal censure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized trial has compared how physicians assess and treat refractory breathlessness&#xD;
      versus refractory pain, how often opioids are considered for treatment of breathlessness and&#xD;
      what factors affect the choice of treatment in chronic breathlessness as compared to pain in&#xD;
      advanced COPD. Furthermore, it remains unknown if there is a gender bias in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      COPD among physicians treating COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, triple-blind, parallel group-, web-based study based on a survey&#xD;
      instrument which is answered by certified physicians who treat patients with respiratory&#xD;
      problems in Sweden. The survey is based upon a hypothetical patient case which regards&#xD;
      situations and considerations that are part of physicians' daily clinical management and&#xD;
      treatment of COPD patients. Two randomizations take place regarding the hypothetical case 1)&#xD;
      Sex 2) Symptom. The participant is shown a hypothetical patient case which is randomized&#xD;
      (1:1:1:1) regarding sex and symptom to one of four potential case scenarios:&#xD;
      man+breathlessness; man+pain; woman+breathlessness; or woman+pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine if there is a gender bias in the diagnosis of COPD; how&#xD;
      often physicians identify that chronic refractory breathlessness requires treatment as&#xD;
      compared to refractory pain, which symptomatic treatments are considered with focus on&#xD;
      morphine; explore physicians perception regarding the grade of evidence for different&#xD;
      treatments for the relief of chronic breathlessness; and examine which factors affect&#xD;
      physicians decision to treat refractory breathlessness with opioids.&#xD;
