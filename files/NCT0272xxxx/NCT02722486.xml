  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare rehabilitation progress between control patients who will&#xD;
      undergo routine vestibular rehabilitation exercises and experimental patients who will&#xD;
      undergo exercises using a vibrotactile balance belt (Sensory Kinetics Balance Rehabilitation&#xD;
      System) in addition to their routine vestibular rehabilitation regimen during recovery from&#xD;
      diseases affecting the vestibular system. The results of this pilot study will help to&#xD;
      determine if the vibrotactile balance belt is a useful supplement to traditional vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation techniques in children suffering from vestibular impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized pilot trial to examine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      vibrotactile balance belt on vestibular rehabilitation in the pediatric population. All&#xD;
      consented patients will be randomly allocated by a statistician to either the experimental&#xD;
      group where participants will undergo SKBRS exercises in addition to their routine vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen, or to the control group where participants will undergo routine&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation exercises without the SKBRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo weekly vestibular rehabilitation sessions for 3 months (a total of&#xD;
      12 sessions). During these sessions, standard balance training exercises will be done at the&#xD;
      discretion of the therapists. Experimental subjects will also undergo 15 minutes of SKBRS&#xD;
      exercises during each standard vestibular rehabilitation session. This device uses&#xD;
      video-based exercises and a non-invasive vibrotactile belt to measure the subject's position&#xD;
      in space and trunk tilt/sway while performing various balance tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo the following 3 routine tests throughout the course of the therapy&#xD;
      to determine their progress: The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) to measure the subject's&#xD;
      static balance, the Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance (CTSIB), an office-based&#xD;
      version of the computerized dynamic postuography test, and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI),&#xD;
      which measures dynamic balance. Finally, the investigators will ask all subjects to provide&#xD;
      their subjective opinion of their vestibular rehabilitation program and their opinion of the&#xD;
      SKBRS by filling out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is a comparison of relative balance improvement between subjects&#xD;
      who underwent standard vestibular rehabilitation exercises and those who underwent additional&#xD;
      therapy with the SKBRS during their rehab sessions. This progress will be measured by the&#xD;
      degree of change in the BESS, CTSIB, and DGI scores between subjects' first and final&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation sessions. The secondary outcome will be the subjects' subjective&#xD;
      assessments of the effectiveness of their vestibular rehabilitation (measured by the VRBQ) as&#xD;
      well as the experimental subjects' feedback on the SKBRS device (measured by the SKBRS&#xD;
      feedback survey).&#xD;

    <description>With this device, a subject stands on a force platform on the ground, which measures his/her center of pressure. Additionally, there is laptop displaying the video-based exercise programs and a camera that senses the subject's linear sway, roll, and pitch. Information about the subject's position is transmitted via Bluetooth technology to a non-invasive vibrotactile belt which fits comfortably around the subject's waist, over his/her clothing. Using the Sensory Kinetics software, the subject will play a series of games projected on the laptop screen, which prompt him/her to sway in various directions while keeping both feet planted on the force platform.</description>
