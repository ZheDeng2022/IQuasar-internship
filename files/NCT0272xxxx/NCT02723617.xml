  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different quantities of lean beef&#xD;
      (0.5, 2.5, 5.5 oz/day) on lipids, lipoproteins, and vascular health endpoints in the context&#xD;
      of a modified Mediterranean dietary pattern that is representative of foods typically&#xD;
      consumed in the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) dietary pattern, the USDA Food Pattern,&#xD;
      and the American Heart Association (AHA) Diet are all recommended for the reduction of LDL-C&#xD;
      and blood pressure, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The recommended&#xD;
      food-based dietary patterns emphasize consumption of vegetables, fruits and whole grains;&#xD;
      include low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts;&#xD;
      and limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red meats. The Mediterranean&#xD;
      dietary pattern has gained widespread popularity because of an impressive evidence base&#xD;
      showing health benefits in the prevention of many chronic diseases including CVD. The&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet Pyramid recommends that red meat be consumed less than 2 servings per&#xD;
      week, with an emphasis on lean cuts. However, as the BOLD (Beef in an Optimal Lean Diet)&#xD;
      study has demonstrated, lean beef can be included in a heart healthy dietary pattern that&#xD;
      achieves both low density lipoprotein and blood pressure-lowering effects. The BOLD study&#xD;
      utilized beef consumption levels of 4 or 5.4 ounces of lean beef daily, which is&#xD;
      significantly higher than the American average of app. 3 ounces per day. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate three levels of beef in the context of a Mediterranean diet, compared to an Average&#xD;
      American diet.&#xD;
