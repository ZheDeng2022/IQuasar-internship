    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-200, an investigational drug-delivery&#xD;
      system, is safe and tolerable in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) between&#xD;
      diagnosis and radical cystectomy (RC).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In Arm 1, subjects must have residual visible tumor following TURBT. In Arm 2,&#xD;
             subjects must be fully resected (i.e., no visible tumor or as little tumor as&#xD;
             possible) after restaging TURBT 2-6 weeks prior to Study Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, as assessed by the following&#xD;
             requirements conducted within 21 days prior to dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to undergo a cystoscopy on study for investigational product&#xD;
             removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for and willing to undergo RC per the attending urologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be deemed ineligible for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy by the&#xD;
             attending medical oncologist.&#xD;

             shingles (varicella zoster infection) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
