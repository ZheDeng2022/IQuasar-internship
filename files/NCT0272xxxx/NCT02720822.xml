  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness is an overwhelming symptom affecting tens of thousands of Australians every&#xD;
      day. For many people, it persists even when all the underlying causes have been optimally&#xD;
      managed (chronic breathlessness). In these circumstances, it often occurs at rest or with&#xD;
      minimal exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from a number of clinical studies suggests that a small, regular dose of morphine&#xD;
      helps to reduce safely the sensation of breathlessness. However, it is not well established&#xD;
      which patients derive more benefit and what is the net clinical effect of this treatment&#xD;
      (weighing benefits and harms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase III, multi-site, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe chronic breathlessness&#xD;
      which will explore several important questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are regular, low doses of morphine at four possible doses over 3 weeks more effective&#xD;
           than placebo at improving breathlessness?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does increasing the dose in people who already are experiencing some benefit provide&#xD;
           even greater reduction in worst breathlessness?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the medication have any effect on daily activity and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the common or serious side effects of this intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the benefit from the medication outweigh the side effects it produces?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there specific characteristics of people who are more likely to receive benefit from&#xD;
           extended release morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive once daily extended release morphine (plus laxative, docusate with&#xD;
      senna), or placebo (placebo laxative) in addition to their usual medication for up to 3 weeks&#xD;
      at increasing doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical interview and physical examination to collect some general&#xD;
      health information, and baseline measurements including; daily activity, symptoms, and&#xD;
      quality of life. A small amount of blood may be required to check eligibility. Further blood&#xD;
      samples may be taken at week 1 and 3 to enable testing on how individuals respond to opioids,&#xD;
      further consent will be obtained for these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on benefits, side effects, and medical care will be collected during comprehensive&#xD;
      weekly visits. Participants will also fill out a simple diary twice daily for weeks one to&#xD;
      three of the study, and for one day each week during an optional 6 month extension stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study may enable better management of symptoms and activity in people&#xD;
      COPD with medicines that are shown to be effective and safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Three hundred thousand (300,000) Australians are breathless at rest or on minimal&#xD;
      exertion, often for years, despite optimal treatment of the underlying cause(s). This&#xD;
      includes more than 70,000 people who are too breathless to leave their homes often for long&#xD;
      periods of time. Underlying causes for such severe and ongoing breathlessness include chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, heart failure,&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neurone disease and cachexia from any cause. The&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic refractory breathlessness will continue to increase as the population&#xD;
      ages because the chronic progressive diseases where breathlessness is common are increasing&#xD;
      in prevalence. Nearly one half of all people experience distressing breathlessness during the&#xD;
      last year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Thoracic Society defines breathlessness as &quot;a subjective experience of breathing&#xD;
      discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally, no medication is registered for the symptomatic reduction of chronic&#xD;
      refractory breathlessness despite recommendations from the American Thoracic Society, the&#xD;
      American College of Physicians, the Canadian Thoracic Society and the American College of&#xD;
      Chest Physicians that regular, low-dose morphine is the evidence-based pharmaceutical option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To enhance the evidence base for the pharmacological treatment of chronic refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness using potential therapies compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the difference of the net clinical effect (benefits and harms)&#xD;
      on chronic refractory breathlessness in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) and baseline breathlessness of 3 or 4 on the modified Medical Research Council&#xD;
      breathlessness scale (mMRC) taking once daily, extended release oral morphine at two&#xD;
      different doses when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary objective: To compare the difference in steps per day measured using the FitbitR&#xD;
      between people taking once daily, extended release oral morphine , by dosing level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is regular, low dose extended release oral morphine safe, including when the dose is&#xD;
           titrated upwards, in a population of people with refractory breathlessness and COPD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do people whose breathlessness is helped by regular, low dose extended release oral&#xD;
           morphine get additional benefit by further increasing the dose of morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Over what period of time does benefit continue to increase once a dose level with&#xD;
           benefit is achieved?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What percentage of people derive clinically significant benefit at each of four dosing&#xD;
           levels, over and above placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At the lower doses, is there evidence that any benefit does not last the full 24 hours?&#xD;
           (end-of-dose failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Can we predict response, benefit and side effects from baseline demographic and clinical&#xD;
           data in those people who get morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Does the treatment of breathlessness with regular, low dose morphine have any effect on&#xD;
           general health status and quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Is there any difference in activities of daily living in those treated with regular, low&#xD;
           dose extended release oral morphine when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Assess any effects of each treatment on anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Understand the longer term benefits and side effects from extended release morphine in&#xD;
           people with COPD when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Do participants, while still blinded, have any preference at the end of the three week&#xD;
           study?&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Do caregivers notice any change in the burden and challenge of caregiving if the person&#xD;
           they care for receives regular, low dose, extended release oral morphine for chronic&#xD;
           breathlessness?&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Do participants experience withdrawal from opioids at the end of the study as study&#xD;
           medication ceases?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that may help to predict which&#xD;
           individuals will achieve the greatest benefit in week one of therapy (8mg/day,&#xD;
           16mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify pharmacogenomic variations in opioid receptors and signaling that may help to&#xD;
           predict clinical response (benefit, side effects or no response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the effect on sleep in people participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the impact on simulated driving in a sub-group of participants using&#xD;
           commercially available driving simulators&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare caregiver self-efficacy at the end of weeks one and three between groups when&#xD;
           compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare the within trial incremental cost and cost effectiveness of the therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluate any changes in total testosterone from baseline to the end of the 6-month&#xD;
           extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis #1: In people who have COPD with refractory breathlessness, there is no&#xD;
      difference in worst breathlessness intensity in the previous 24 hours with the addition of&#xD;
      regular, low dose oral extended release morphine when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis #1: The addition of regular, low dose oral extended release morphine&#xD;
      reduces the intensity of worst breathlessness in the previous 24 hours in people with COPD&#xD;
      and chronic breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis #2: In people who have COPD with refractory breathlessness, there is no&#xD;
      difference in the number of steps taken each day with the addition of regular, low dose oral&#xD;
      extended release morphine when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis #2: The addition of regular, low dose oral extended release morphine&#xD;
      increases people's activities in people with COPD and chronic breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A five stage, national, multi-site, double-blind, parallel arm, block randomised, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, factorial, dose increment phase III study of opioids for chronic refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness in people with COPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0 - baseline (2 days); Stage 1 - randomisation #1 (1 week); Stage 2 - randomisation #2&#xD;
      (1 week); Stage 3 - randomisation #3 (1 week); and Stage 4 - an optional blinded extension&#xD;
      arm (up to 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0. Baseline assessment: All consenting participants will complete 2 full days of&#xD;
      baseline diary (evening) in order to become accustomed to completing the diary regularly and&#xD;
      to provide stable baseline data regarding breathlessness, symptoms and activity (as measured&#xD;
      by FitBit®). At completion of the 2 days, the participant will be reviewed, complete the&#xD;
      remaining baseline assessments (questionnaires, measures and baseline safety data), and will&#xD;
      then be eligible to be randomised the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: Two full days (4 diary entries)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1. Randomisation #1: Randomisation to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg extended release&#xD;
      morphine OR 16mg extended release morphine. Daily diary. A FitBit will be worn this week.&#xD;
      Participants randomised to extended release morphine will also receive blinded docusate with&#xD;
      sennosides, while those randomised to placebo will receive identical laxative placebo. This&#xD;
      is the primary outcome (end point) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. Randomisation #2: While continuing the arm assigned in Stage 1, add a randomisation&#xD;
      to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg extended release morphine. Daily diary. Participants who were&#xD;
      randomised to placebo in Stage 1 and extended release morphine in Stage 2 will have blinded&#xD;
      docusate with sennosides replace the laxative placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3. Randomisation #3: While continuing the arm assigned in Stages 1 and 2, add a third&#xD;
      randomisation to mane orally: placebo OR 8mg extended release morphine. Daily diary. A FitBit&#xD;
      will be worn this week. Participants who were randomised to placebo in Stages 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      extended release morphine in Stage 3 will have blinded docusate with sennosides replace the&#xD;
      laxative placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4. Extension (optional for each individual participant): Continue double blind&#xD;
      medications from Stages 1, 2 and 3 for up to six months. Diary one day each week. A blood&#xD;
      test at the end of the six months will be taken for total testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time period: up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: This study is for people with optimally treated chronic breathlessness&#xD;
      (modified Medical Research Council Scale (mMRC) of 3 or 4) and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and its assessment: Change in the worst intensity of breathlessness in the&#xD;
      previous 24 hours each morning, measured using an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale, recorded&#xD;
      in the evening diary entry by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The study will answer several practical questions including whether regular,&#xD;
      low dose extended release oral morphine delivers a net benefit in people with COPD in&#xD;
      reducing breathlessness on exertion (worst breathlessness in a 24 hour period) in steady&#xD;
      state; whether dose increases beyond initial response provide a greater net benefit; the&#xD;
      pattern of symptomatic response in the days after successful titration; and the proportion of&#xD;
      people who derive a clinically meaningful symptomatic benefit at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Missing data&#xD;
      will be imputed using multiple imputation with 50 resamples drawn. The primary comparisons on&#xD;
      which the study is powered are at the end of week 1: placebo compared to 8mg extended release&#xD;
      morphine daily; and placebo compared to 16mg extended release morphine daily. Change in&#xD;
      breathlessness in the first week between these groups will be evaluated using a random&#xD;
      effects mixed model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation All calculations assume Type I (family wise error rate (FWER)) error&#xD;
      rate of 5% and Type II error rate of 20% (power of 80%) respectively. The primary analyses&#xD;
      comprise two comparisons made at the end of week 1 (placebo compared to 8mg and placebo&#xD;
      compared to 16mg), each assessed at alpha = 0.025 (two-sided) to protect the overall type 1&#xD;
      error rate. Using the variance-covariance matrix and mean responses from data arising from&#xD;
      the MOP study, it was found through simulations (n = 1000) and using a mixed model analysis&#xD;
      over 8 days, that 45 subjects per group are required to detect a difference of 1.09 NRS units&#xD;
      where the standard deviation at each day varied between 2.0 and 2.5 NRS units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second family comprises one comparison, involving only those subjects who improved by&#xD;
      1.09 NRS unit after receiving a given dose vs. not. Based on this 38 per group are needed.&#xD;
      Using the same dataset 52% of those in the active group improved by at least this amount. For&#xD;
      a total sample of N, there are N/3 subjects who receive 0mg, 8mgand 16mg at week 1. In the&#xD;
      control arm (0mg) there are no responses at the end of the first week. For the N/6 subjects&#xD;
      receiving 8mg at the start of week 2, N/6*0.52 are expected to respond. In the arm receiving&#xD;
      8mg, N/3*0.52 are expected to respond at the end of the first week. Of the N/3*0 .48 that&#xD;
      didn't respond in the first week 52% are expected to respond at the end of the second week.&#xD;
      The same situation pertains to the group receiving 16mg at the start of week 1. For the&#xD;
      sample of 135 subjects this implies that 82 in total are expected to respond. Assuming equal&#xD;
      numbers are randomised to receiving the next incremental dose or remaining on the same dose&#xD;
      this provides over 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing for 20% attrition requires a total sample size of 171 subjects.&#xD;
