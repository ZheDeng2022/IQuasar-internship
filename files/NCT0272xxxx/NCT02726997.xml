      This phase I/II trial studies how well durvalumab works when given in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage III-IV ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      durvalumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel may be a better treatment for&#xD;
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore basal levels and effects of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy on&#xD;
      molecular markers in immune-related pathways, including but not limited to, deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) copy number, mutation, and level of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression,&#xD;
      before and after durvalumab and chemotherapy treatment in women with primary advanced high&#xD;
      grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival of paclitaxel and carboplatin and durvalumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced stage, metastatic ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the feasibility of combination therapy and maintenance durvalumab in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of combination and&#xD;
      maintenance durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To report overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate circulating lymphoid populations (subsets). II. To determine tissue programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and T-cell infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure circulating immune-related cytokines/chemokines. IV. To capture patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (symptoms, quality of life, and patient utilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Before debulking surgery, patients receive durvalumab and&#xD;
      carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo debulking surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: After 3 courses of chemotherapy, patients undergo debulking laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning after debulking surgery, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, and durvalumab IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 and 15. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9,&#xD;
      10, and 12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
