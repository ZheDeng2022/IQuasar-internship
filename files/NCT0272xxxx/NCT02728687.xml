  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) are not very effective and have&#xD;
      multiple side effects. To find out if a menthol cream alone or with added mannitol treats&#xD;
      PDPN effectively, 90 participants with PDPN, after one month of observation, will receive&#xD;
      randomly assigned menthol cream or the same cream with mannitol added for 3 months with a&#xD;
      crossover for 3 additional months. At time 0, 1,4 and 7 months their BPI pain severity and&#xD;
      interference scores, DN4 scores, cream % effectiveness and side effects will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: to find out if a menthol cream containing mannitol is more effective than the same&#xD;
      cream without mannitol in relieving painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN). The test&#xD;
      cream which will, at a later date, be marketed as QR cream contains Water, Mannitol,&#xD;
      Propylene glycol, Isopropyl palmitate. Caprylic capric triglyceride, Ceteareth 20, Cetearyl&#xD;
      alcohol, Glyceryl stearate, Polyethylene glycol 100 Stearate, Dimethicone, Octyldodecanol,&#xD;
      Menthol, Lecithin, Ethylhexyl glycerin, Phenoxyethanol. The control cream contains the same&#xD;
      ingredients minus the mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: a menthol cream containing mannitol is more effective at relieving the pain, the&#xD;
      physical limitations and the emotional distress caused by PDPN than the same cream without&#xD;
      mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: PDPN is common and can be disabling because of the intensity of the pain it&#xD;
      can cause. Less than 50% of those suffering from this condition get adequate pain relief from&#xD;
      their current medications. The oral medications, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, NSAIDS,&#xD;
      marijuana derivatives and narcotics have numerous side effects and are potentially addictive.&#xD;
      Topical local anaesthetics have short-lived effect over only a small area and topical&#xD;
      capsaicin often causes burning on application and prolonged use destroys the affected nerves.&#xD;
      A previous study has demonstrated mannitol's effectiveness in down regulating the capsaicin&#xD;
      receptor which is believed to cause the burning sensation of PDPN. A cream containing&#xD;
      mannitol has few side effects, and, if effective, may decrease the need for other, more&#xD;
      dangerous medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: to show that a menthol cream containing mannitol is more effective, over a period&#xD;
      of 28 weeks, than the same cream without mannitol at relieving the pain, the physical&#xD;
      limitations and the emotional distress caused by PDPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: this is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial&#xD;
      involving 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are taking medications or insulin to treat diabetes will have on/off&#xD;
      vibration test on the hallux of each foot. If at least 5 of their 8 vibration tests are&#xD;
      erroneous or &quot;I don't know&quot;, their score on the DN4 questionnaire is &gt;4/10 they will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 month's observation period, 90 participants will be given either a menthol cream with&#xD;
      mannitol or the same cream without mannitol to apply to their feet for 3 months, following&#xD;
      which the creams will be crossed over for an additional 3 months. Which cream is to be&#xD;
      applied in the first 3 months will be chosen at random. Participants and clinicians will be&#xD;
      blinded as to cream assignment for the duration of the study. Participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to rub the cream on their feet and the tender nerves supplying their feet, 2 to 4 times&#xD;
      daily, as needed for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 0,1,4 and 7 month, their BPI pain severity and interference scores, DN4 scores, cream %&#xD;
      effectiveness and side effects will be recorded. At 4 and 7 months, they will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: primary endpoint, BPI pain interference scores (how much pain&#xD;
      interferes with function and relationships) . t-tests will compare the difference between the&#xD;
      maximum daily pain interference score for the menthol cream as compared with the mannitol and&#xD;
      menthol cream at 4 and 7 months. Secondary endpoints: BPI pain severity score and DN4 score&#xD;
      (how many symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are registered), % cream effectiveness, incidence&#xD;
      of side effects.&#xD;
