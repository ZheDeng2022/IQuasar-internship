      The main objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of continuous nerve blocks with&#xD;
      single injection in terms of perioperative patient satisfaction after scheduled orthopedic&#xD;
      ambulatory surgery. Subgroup analyses will be performed, a priori, according to patients Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives comprise the assessment of pain, readmission rates, patient&#xD;
      mobilization, quality of sleep and heart rate collected by an activity tracker. Scales about&#xD;
      quality of recovery will be performed on day 1, about quality of life on day 45 and presence&#xD;
      of neuropathic pain will be screened at 3 months. An economic study will also be conducted,&#xD;
      including work resumption at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentric prospective study. Three hundred patients will be randomized in two&#xD;
      parallel groups: continuous nerve blocks delivered thru remote-controlled electronic pump&#xD;
      versus single local anesthetics injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the EVAN-G patient satisfaction scale, scored at day 2. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include assessment of pain, opiates consumption, sensitivity and motricity&#xD;
      scores, rate of catheter falls at home, hospital readmission, patient mobilization, sleep and&#xD;
      heart rate as assessed by an activity tracker, PCS before the surgery and Quality of Recovery&#xD;
      (QoR-40) scale at day 1, Short-Form 36 (SF36) at day 45 and Neuropathic Pain assessment (DN4)&#xD;
      at day 90.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute postoperative pain is poorly treated. More than three-quarters of patients complain of&#xD;
      pain, from moderate to extreme, after surgery. In orthopedic surgery, continuous nerve blocks&#xD;
      analgesia has proved effective among in-hospital patients but single injection strategy is&#xD;
      easier to implement in the growing outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of continuous nerve blocks with&#xD;
      single injection in terms of perioperative patient satisfaction after scheduled orthopedic&#xD;
      ambulatory surgery. Subgroup analyses will be performed, a priori, according to patients Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives comprise the assessment of pain, readmission rates, patient&#xD;
      mobilization, quality of sleep and heart rate collected by an activity tracker. Scales about&#xD;
      quality of recovery will be performed on day 1, about quality of life on day 45 and presence&#xD;
      of neuropathic pain will be screened at 3 months. An economic study will also be conducted,&#xD;
      including work resumption at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are adults undergoing outpatient scheduled orthopedic surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia with regional analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria are patients over 80 years, documented cognitive impairment, inability&#xD;
      to complete a self-administered questionnaire, presenting American Society of Anesthesiology&#xD;
      (ASA) physical status 3 unsteady or 4, or spontaneously requiring analgesic perineural&#xD;
      catheter or a single injection of local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentric prospective study. Three hundred patients will be randomized in two&#xD;
      parallel groups: continuous nerve blocks delivered thru remote-controlled electronic pump&#xD;
      versus single local anesthetics injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the EVAN-G patient satisfaction scale, scored at day 2. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include assessment of pain, opiates consumption, sensitivity and motricity&#xD;
      scores, rate of catheter falls at home, hospital readmission, patient mobilization, sleep and&#xD;
      heart rate as assessed by an activity tracker, PCS before the surgery and Quality of Recovery&#xD;
      (QoR-40) scale at day 1, Short-Form 36 (SF36) at day 45 and Neuropathic Pain assessment (DN4)&#xD;
      at day 90.&#xD;
