      CardioMEMS is an implantable wireless hemodynamic monitoring system which can transmit the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure. This device is FDA approved to be used as a diagnostic tool to&#xD;
      help management of selected heart failure patients. Heart failure patients with NYHA class&#xD;
      III heart failure, irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction, and a previous&#xD;
      hospital admission for heart failure in the past 12 months, without stage IV or V chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease are candidates to receive a CardioMEMS device. Our goal is to create a&#xD;
      registry of all patients that receive a CardioMEMS device and monitor outcomes, primarily&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalizations, heart failure related quality of life and re-admissions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Clinical trials with CardioMEMS were done and the device is now FDA approved for&#xD;
      use in heart failure patients with NYHA class III heart failure for at least three months,&#xD;
      irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction, with a previous hospitalization for&#xD;
      heart failure in the last 12 months. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV or V are&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, the CHAMPION Trial, which was published in the Lancet (Lancet 2011; 377: 658-66),&#xD;
      enrolled patients in 64 centers in the USA and were randomly assigned by the use of a&#xD;
      centralized electronic system to management with CardioMEMS or a control group. The patients&#xD;
      were followed for six months. The treatment group used daily measures of pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressures in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone in the control group.&#xD;
      The protocol for the treatment group was to lower the pulmonary artery pressures when&#xD;
      elevated, using neurohormonal, diuretic, or vasodilator drugs. The control group continued to&#xD;
      have drug changes in response to patients' clinical signs and symptoms rather than the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure. All patients were on optimum drug and device therapies at the time&#xD;
      of sensor implantation in accordance to the ACC and AHA guidelines. At six months the&#xD;
      treatment group had a 37% reduction in heart failure related hospitalizations, patients with&#xD;
      more days alive outside the hospital, and better quality of life compared to the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up study was published in the Lancet (Lancet 2016; 387:453-461) which examined the&#xD;
      extended efficacy of this strategy over 18 months looking at the clinical effect of open&#xD;
      access to pressure information and monitored the original treatment group for an additional&#xD;
      13 months. After pulmonary artery pressure information became available to guide therapy&#xD;
      during open access (the devices in the control group were activated and followed for the 13&#xD;
      months after the initial six months), rates of admissions to hospital for heart failure in&#xD;
      the former control group were reduced by 48% compared with rates of admissions in the control&#xD;
      group during randomized access (initial six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies show that both short term and long term management of NYHA Class III heart&#xD;
      failure based on home transmission of pulmonary artery pressure with an implanted pressure&#xD;
      sensor has significant short-term and long-term benefit in lowering hospital admission rates&#xD;
      for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 years or older with moderate NYHA functional class III heart failure for at&#xD;
      least 3 months, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction or cause, and a&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure within the past 12 months are eligible for a CardioMEMS&#xD;
      device. If the patient is thought to be a good clinical candidate, with difficult to manage&#xD;
      fluid status, the patient and their Heart Failure Cardiologist will discuss the option of&#xD;
      having a CardioMEMS device implanted for standard of care treatment. If the device is&#xD;
      implanted, the patient will be asked to be enrolled in the registry. The patient will have&#xD;
      normal clinical follow up and clinically standard interrogations. The device interrogations&#xD;
      will be sent daily from the patient and reviewed once a week unless the patient calls with&#xD;
      symptoms or weight gain in which it will be reviewed at that time. If changes in medications&#xD;
      are made, the patient's device will be interrogated daily for 3 subsequent days and then&#xD;
      return to the baseline weekly interrogation. The data obtained from the interrogation is the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure. There are no research interventions outside of normal standard&#xD;
      clinical care. All of the clinically collected data will be recorded in the Penn CardioMEMS&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up in clinic one month after implant, then 3 months and then as&#xD;
      determined by their Heart Failure Cardiologist as part of usual clinical care. A quality of&#xD;
      life assessment will be done at each clinic appointment for the first year (Minnesota Living&#xD;
      with Heart Failure questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded as they occur. There are device-related or system-related&#xD;
      complications such as bleeding complications or pressure-sensor failures defined as the&#xD;
      inability to obtain recordings. Of note, during the clinical trials there were no&#xD;
      pressure-sensor failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected from the clinical electronic medical record and administrative&#xD;
      data sets at the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard statistical methods will be used. Statistical analysis will be done with Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test and student's t test with alpha=0.05. Patient survival rates will be analyzed&#xD;
      by Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible patients will undergo implantation of a pulmonary artery sensor (CardioMEMS), a wireless implantable hemodynamic monitoring system in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. This system has a passive wireless, radiofrequency sensor without batteries or leads. Patients transmit data through a device in their home that interacts wirelessly with the sensor. Clinicians retrieve this data via a web interface to use in making management decisions for patients.</description>
