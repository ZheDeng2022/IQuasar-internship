      Background: Epiphysis of distal end of tibia fracture is quite common in children epiphysis&#xD;
      injury, because of the complex damage mechanism and often leads to growth retardation and&#xD;
      joint deformity, the patient's physical and mental damage larger; also epiphysis injury&#xD;
      restoration requires higher standard and more difficult to fixed, and methods are being&#xD;
      actively explored to improve the curative effect and prevent the sequelae. Our hospital&#xD;
      pediatric department of orthopedics expects to conduct prospective study through multi center&#xD;
      to study the influence of factors such as the tibia epiphysis fracture of distal injury's&#xD;
      mechanism and initial and residual displacement and treatment etc. on patients' prognosis of&#xD;
      late growth disorders, joint deformity and ankle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: To join the multi center research collaboration group of the south&#xD;

      Introduction Epiphyseal and Epiphyseal plate are all immature skeletal growth mechanism, the&#xD;
      epiphyseal plate injury also known as epiphyseal injuries, fracture line through the&#xD;
      epiphyseal plate can also spread to the epiphysis or metaphysis. Epiphyseal plate's&#xD;
      connection is weaker than normal tendon, ligament, or joint capsule, so the children of&#xD;
      epiphyseal injuries are common. Distal tibial epiphyseal injuries accounted for about 25%-&#xD;
      38% of the epiphyseal injuries. Because after the injury of the distal epiphysis of the tibia&#xD;
      injury often leads to growth retardation and joint deformity, the patient's physical and&#xD;
      mental damage larger. Because of the complexity of the pathogenesis of this disease, and&#xD;
      there are many related factors. The research of related factors of the disease is benefit to&#xD;
      evaluate the prognosis, and conducive to early intervention, benefit to avoid the occurrence&#xD;
      or development of severe sequelae, has positive significance in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the disease is related to many factors, and the serious cases of this disease are&#xD;
      less, the multi center cooperation is conducive to the collection of sufficient cases to&#xD;
      analyze and achieve the objective and effective results, so establish the multi center topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and overview In epiphyseal growth stage, the epiphyseal plate connects weaker than&#xD;
      normal tendons, ligaments, or joint capsule, so epiphyseal plate is more vulnerable to be&#xD;
      injured. Every epiphyseal complex is composed of each epiphysis and epiphyseal plate, its&#xD;
      growth and blood supply are interdependent, which any damage may reinforce each other. The&#xD;
      Ranvier district around the epiphysis has the ability to ossify. It is easy to form a bone&#xD;
      bridge and growth arrest and angular deformity after injury. Epiphyseal fracture is belongs&#xD;
      to intra-articular fractures, such as not timely reset, prone to complications. About 15% of&#xD;
      children with fractures involving the epiphyseal injuries, the number of boys are more than&#xD;
      girls, as the chance of injury is more, this is because men's epiphyseal plate closure time&#xD;
      later than women's. X-ray manifestation of epiphyseal injuries, while more complex, but the&#xD;
      epiphyseal and backbone of the corresponding position of the dislocation and epiphyseal line&#xD;
      broadening is the most important, a slight shift and (or) epiphyseal line broadening is the&#xD;
      most easy to be ignored, should X-ray the healthy side at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, fracture involving the epiphyseal growth plate and articular surface is easily&#xD;
      occurred in two kinds of complications: first distal tibia epiphyseal premature closure&#xD;
      causes valgus or varus malleolus and limb shortening; the second is the distal tibial&#xD;
      articular surface damage causes the ankle joint degenerative changes and bone arthritis.&#xD;
      According to Salter Harris bone epiphysis injury types were divided into five types, and in&#xD;
      the distal tibial epiphysis injury I, II type are common in clinic. Therefore, the biggest&#xD;
      problem is the formation of the bone bridge, early epiphyseal closure, resulting in growth&#xD;
      arrest, angular deformity. From the current literature, the most important related factors&#xD;
      are in injured mechanism and degree of displacement Leary JT's research shows: the initial&#xD;
      fracture displacement and damage mechanism for determining development of PPC after the&#xD;
      fracture of epiphysis of distal end of tibia may have a significant predictive value. Ankle&#xD;
      fracture Lauge - Hansen parting is ankle fracture classification system put forward by Lauge&#xD;
      - Hansen doctors in 1950 according to the damage position and violence that cause deformity,&#xD;
      able to quickly assess the damage mechanism of 90% - 95% cases, and has been widely used. Its&#xD;
      clinical significance lies in: 1 find fracture and classify injury and be able to make the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ligament injury. 2 guide manipulative reduction. The general principle is:&#xD;
      closed manipulative reduction and fracture have the opposite force mechanism.3 for the distal&#xD;
      tibial epiphysis fracture, can also understand the severity of the injury and the existence&#xD;
      of the risk of soft tissue embedded. Therefore, we think, it is necessary to research on the&#xD;
      lauge Hansen classification and correlation of prognosis. The relationship between the&#xD;
      fracture displacement and correlation of prognosis is in the extent of the shift, the vast&#xD;
      majority of doctors think less than 2mm shift can be accepted, and to shift more than 2mm,&#xD;
      there are different opinions. Gonc U et al think ankle joint fracture usually involving the&#xD;
      tibia and fibular epiphyses in children and adolescents. Although they do not occur with&#xD;
      growth arrest, but may still lead to traumatic arthritis. Therefore, for more than 2 mm of&#xD;
      residual displacement there is a need for surgical treatment. And David podeszwa Da thinks is&#xD;
      greater than 3mm residual displacement often means embedded with soft tissue, may increase&#xD;
      early closure of epiphysis of probability. Russo F the most pessimistic, he thinks a shift of&#xD;
      the S - H type â…¡ tibial distal epiphyseal fracture is a challenging problem. Rate of&#xD;
      epiphyseal early closure is very high (&gt; 43%). Even if incision and anatomical repositioning,&#xD;
      removal of embedded organization, also cannot reduce the incidence of PPC, and may increase&#xD;
      the risk of subsequent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considered in the design, what JOHN A.O GDEN points out &quot;epiphyseal separation should be&#xD;
      reset as soon as possible, each delay 1 d will increase the difficulty as it repair soon. For&#xD;
      type II epiphyseal injuries after more than 10 d, if you don't use excessive force can not&#xD;
      make manual reduction success, however it could damage the cartilage epiphyseal plate and&#xD;
      damage the early osteotylus, therefore, for type II epiphyseal injuries that see a doctor&#xD;
      later (after (7-10 d) ,had better let it be malunion, and cannot use powerful technique or&#xD;
      surgical repositioning, lest cause obvious epiphyseal growth stopped, heals the residual&#xD;
      deformities can then use the appropriate correction osteotomy&quot;. This view is widely agreed.&#xD;
      In the inclusion criteria we chose cases that injury within 7 days. In addition, the Risser&#xD;
      ilium epiphyseal ossification sign is a commonly used method for determination of the bone&#xD;
      age, JiShiJun's pediatric bone science thinks &quot; ossification of the crista iliaca is usually&#xD;
      in conformity with the stop of limbs' longitudinal growth&quot;, this is the important index for&#xD;
      determining growth potential in include and exclude criteria in this topic, so there is&#xD;
      reason to believe that when a Risser sign V degrees distal tibial epiphyseal growth stopped,&#xD;
      fixed limb length and Angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping Divide the patients into groups according to the residual displacement of the&#xD;
      fracture after the first manual reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: the residual displacement is less than or equal to 2mm, select closed reduction and&#xD;
      external fixation (such as splint, plaster or traction, frame of external fixation, etc.)&#xD;
      Group B: the residual shift is between 2-4mm, manual reset once again, as still between&#xD;
      2-4mm, the cooperation of each unit to choose closed reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: the residual shift is between 2-4mm, manual reset once again, as still between&#xD;
      2-4mm, the cooperation of each unit to choose closed reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: residual displacement is greater than 4mm, open reduction and internal fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria According to OVADIA et al' evaluation criteria: excellent, Joint function&#xD;
      restore basic consistent with that of the healthy side, without any symptoms, or joint&#xD;
      flexion range is more than 75% of the healthy side, mild sore and swollen after walking,&#xD;
      restore normal work; Good, joint flexion range is 50% - 70% of the healthy side, joint is&#xD;
      mild soreness, markedly swollen after walking, unable to attend the heavy physical work; Can,&#xD;
      joint flexion range is 25% - 50% of the healthy side, joint is obvious swelling and pain,&#xD;
      difficulty walking, and accept joint arthrodesis at the end; Poor, joint range is less than&#xD;
      25% of the healthy side, joint is markedly swollen, pain, stiffness, unable to walk, and&#xD;
      accept joint arthrodesis at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection To hospital after conventional laboratory tests, X-ray the anteroposterior&#xD;
      and lateral film of the affected side, the contralateral tibiofibula (including ankle) and&#xD;
      posteroanterior radiograph of pelvis, scan the affected ankle with CT (fracture displacement&#xD;
      measurement, tibial epiphyseal radius vector and the transverse diameter and cross section).&#xD;
      Select cases according to the inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria Divide the patients into&#xD;
      groups according to the X-ray films of the affected side, the degree of displacement after&#xD;
      measuring residual displacement after the first manual reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treated according to the grouping, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1-5 years after surgery&#xD;
      follow-up.Between 3 to 12 months, each time X-ray films were taken on both ankles, observe&#xD;
      whether there are the early closure of epiphysis; 1 to 5 years, each time we measure whether&#xD;
      the tibia shortening or angle, OVADIA efficacy assessment and ankle function evaluation&#xD;
      (using the table of &quot;AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale &quot;), until 5 years long and the distal tibial&#xD;
      epiphyseal closure of the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization and implementation The projects will be written by Foshan Hospital of TCM&#xD;
      pediatric orthopaedic and submitted to the south pediatric orthopaedic multicenter study&#xD;
      group. The project design will be discussed, modified by the hospital experts. The projects&#xD;
      will be submitted for approval by the hospital medical ethics committee. Then the various&#xD;
      units sign a cooperation agreement after the experts determine and clear scientific, the&#xD;
      feasibility of this topic, and the study will be registered on the United States NIH&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov website and updated according to the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the process of implementation, the southern pediatric orthopaedic multicenter study group&#xD;
      will communicate and consult with each other to timely solve the problems and difficulties&#xD;
      appeared in the research through the email, WeChat and phone, even on a business trip and&#xD;
      other means of collaboration, besides the plenary meeting each quarter, to ensure the&#xD;
      implementation of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management Statistic analysis Foshan Hospital of TCM pediatric&#xD;
      orthopaedic formulated the tibial distal epiphyseal fracture tracking table and send it every&#xD;
      cooperative unit to record whether there is patients epiphyseal closed early, and if there&#xD;
      is, record the shortening length of the affected limb and angle of angulation deformity, and&#xD;
      record the ankle limb function (valgus, varus and back stretch, plantar flexion), assess the&#xD;
      pain index and rank according to the evaluation criteria of OVADIA etc. During the&#xD;
      implementation of the project, the data should be filled in the table timely, accurately and&#xD;
      objectively by cooperative unit, to keep a record of each item shall be seriously not&#xD;
      omissions, and regular follow-up. At the same time, set up the monitor, regularly or randomly&#xD;
      go to the test center to check and ensure that the original data is real and effective.&#xD;
      Accounting personnel chose by Foshan Hospital of TCM to do the double entry, ensure the data&#xD;
      entry is correct. If in doubt, the monitor will investigate then return the data. Use the&#xD;
      SPSS16.0 to input the data, and describe normal measurement data with mean + / - standard&#xD;
      deviation, average between the group by t test, counting data, with chi-square, finally with&#xD;
      Logistic regression model to analysis multi-factor.&#xD;
