  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 20 million infants worldwide, representing 16 per cent of all births, are born with&#xD;
      low birth weight, 96 per cent of them in developing countries. Bangladesh having one of the&#xD;
      highest incidence rate (21.6%) in the world.The short-term consequences of LBW is 12 times&#xD;
      higher perinatal mortality. It is estimated that LBW causes 60 to 80 % of neonatal deaths.&#xD;
      For the survivors, the effects are long lasting and largely irreversible. Infants born LBW&#xD;
      are at 2-4 times greater risk to develop acute diarrhea, pneumonia or acute respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection than their normal birth weight counterparts. Adults born with LBW suffer increased&#xD;
      risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease (CHD), non insulin dependent diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, obstructive lung diseases, or renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genitourinary (GU) infection, as a major risk factor for low birth weight deliveries&#xD;
      affecting a very large number of women both in the industrialized and the developing world.&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, there was a high incidence of UTI in 21-25 years age group (44.61%). The&#xD;
      bottom line for GU infection is that lactobacilli, healthy bacteria lose their dominant.&#xD;
      Recently, the protective role of the commensal microbiota has come into focus for its&#xD;
      infection-inhibiting function. Lactobacilli that colonize the gastrointestinal tract or&#xD;
      vagina can either significantly modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of&#xD;
      specific prebiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria or reducing undesired&#xD;
      intestinal colonization of pathogenic bacteria. Prebiotic like Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is&#xD;
      known to promote growth of normal healthy flora like lactobacilli (LAB). FOS supplementation&#xD;
      in early pregnancy improves vaginal or gut microflora with LAB , which will control GU&#xD;
      infection and improve pregnancy outcome and promote infant's growth and development&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medical research over the last ten years has identified genitourinary (GU) infection, as a&#xD;
      major risk factor for low birth weight deliveries affecting a very large number of women both&#xD;
      in the industrialized and the developing world. It is estimated that up to about 1 billion of&#xD;
      women are affected annually by urinary infections worldwide. Urinary tract infections (UTI)&#xD;
      are also most common bacterial infections during pregnancy. In Bangladesh, there was a high&#xD;
      incidence of UTI in 21-25 years age group (44.61%). The bottom line for GU infection is that&#xD;
      lactobacilli, healthy bacteria lose their dominant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of normal vaginal micro-biota in urogenital health Recently, the protective role of&#xD;
      the commensal microbiota has come into focus for its infection-inhibiting function.&#xD;
      Lactobacilli are now the favourite probiotic (&quot;health promoting&quot;) bacteria. There are&#xD;
      clinical evidence to show that Lactobacillus strains GR-1 and RC-14 were shown to reduce UTI,&#xD;
      BV and infections associated with yeast pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructoligosacharride, a prebiotic agent At present, considerable attention is focused on&#xD;
      determining ways to increase the number of probiotic microorganisms including lactobacilli&#xD;
      that colonize the gastrointestinal tract or vagina. Prebiotics are substances that can either&#xD;
      significantly modulate the colonic microbiota by increasing the number of specific probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria or reducing undesired intestinal&#xD;
      colonization of pathogenic bacteria by mimicking their attachment sites on the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods In a, double- blind, placebo- controlled study, 210 early pregnant&#xD;
      community women (6-12 weeks gestation) will be randomized to either FOS or placebo,&#xD;
      administered orally, 6g/day for 6 months. Vaginal smear and urine samples will be followed&#xD;
      for LAB using Nugent's score and to exclude UTI respectively. Birth events including weight&#xD;
      will be documented. Stool or nasopharyngeal samples from their infants will be obtained at&#xD;
      week-24, 30, and 36 to see levels of LAB. Anthropometry and diseases morbidity will be&#xD;
      monitored during infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: 1. Incidence of LBW (birth weight below 2500 gram)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary 1. Rate of vaginal and intestinal colonization of LAB and/or GU infection at&#xD;
           week 12, 24, 36 gestation and gain in z-score (weight for height, weight for age and&#xD;
           height for age) of infant from birth&#xD;
