      Post exercise irisin levels in PWS patients Obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, hypotonia&#xD;
      and impaired cognition are the major clinical features of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a&#xD;
      complex neurogenetic disorder due to lack of expression of paternal genes in the chromosomal&#xD;
      region 15q11-13. Abnormal body composition with decreased muscle mass and increased fat mass&#xD;
      contributes to low resting energy expenditure in PWS. Severe caloric restriction in the range&#xD;
      of 800 kcal per day along with daily exercise regimens are needed to prevent weight gain and&#xD;
      complications of obesity in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) once thought to be present only in infants, but now known to be&#xD;
      present in adults as well, differs from the more abundant white adipose tissue (WAT) by&#xD;
      dissipating energy through thermogenesis as a result of increased activity of the&#xD;
      mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP-1). Recently evidence shows that exercise activates&#xD;
      mitochondrial UCP-1 in subcutaneous WAT cells resulting in conversion of WAT to BAT-like&#xD;
      adipocytes (Beige or BRITE adipose tissue). Various factors including natriuretic peptides,&#xD;
      interleukin-6 and myokines (irisin, fibroblast growth factor 21, and ÃŸ-aminoisobutyric acid)&#xD;
      appear to mediate the effects of exercising muscle on subcutaneous adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased amount and/or activity of BAT might contribute to the lower energy expenditure and&#xD;
      extreme difficulty in weight-control in PWS. Lower levels or decreased myokine production&#xD;
      could result in failure to convert subcutaneous WAT to Beige or BAT-like adipocytes, and&#xD;
      therefore minimize or negate the otherwise beneficial metabolic effects of exercise. Direct&#xD;
      measurement of peak oxygen uptake in PWS adults show that this population has markedly lower&#xD;
      VO2 values compared with normal BMI-matched controls. BAT activity in vivo can be accurately&#xD;
      measured only by performing PET/CT scans which include administrating radioactive tracers.&#xD;
      For ethical reasons, direct assessment of BAT is not possible for purposes of clinical&#xD;
      research in PWS individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study humoral responses to exercise in 16 (8 males) PWS&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults and compare results with responses in a similar number of sex,&#xD;
      age, and BMI-matched controls. At an initial one-hour meeting study participants will learn&#xD;
      to perform aerobic (treadmill) exercise and resistance training under the supervision of an&#xD;
      experienced exercise physiologist. Exercise intensity will be assessed by direct measurement&#xD;
      of VO2 max. On a different day, a blood sample will be drawn before and immediately at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the same exercise regimen. Blood samples will be assayed for irisin,&#xD;
      interleukin-6, atrial natriuretic peptide, FGF-21, in addition to glucose, growth hormone,&#xD;
      cortisol, norepinephrine, and lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that PWS participants will show weaker humoral responses to&#xD;
      similar exercise regimens compared to normal control subjects. Data showing lower levels of&#xD;
      myokines, such as irisin, following exercise in PWS might suggest that inadequate conversion&#xD;
      of WAT to BAT-like adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue results in decreased&#xD;
      thermogenesis and abnormally low energy expenditure in this population. Potentially,&#xD;
      development of pharmacologic agents which mimic irisin or other myokines by activating UCP-1&#xD;
      and converting WAT to BAT-like adipocytes could offer a new approach to weight-control in PWS&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
