    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data show a significant rate of failure of endodontic treatment of 20 to 50%&#xD;
      worldwide, probably directly related to the difficulty of the procedure. A successful&#xD;
      pulpotomy allows the preservation of a vital radicular pulp into the root canal. The presence&#xD;
      of a biological tissue into the root canal is definitely more efficient than a &quot;complete&quot;&#xD;
      filling with an inert material. It has been shown on animal and human studies that this pulp&#xD;
      stump in contact with the biomaterial is able to regenerate a dentinal plug, with the same&#xD;
      architecture as physiologic dentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : To compare the success rates of root canal treatment (reference) and&#xD;
      conservative treatment (pulpotomy) for treating inflamed dental pulp on permanent mature&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives : (1) To describe the clinical and biological prognostic factors of&#xD;
      these two treatments; (2) to assess the additional value of biomarkers expression levels as a&#xD;
      prognostic tool for clinical decision making (radical vs. conservative treatment); (3) to&#xD;
      assess the impact of treatment on post-procedural pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of conservative pulpal treatment over&#xD;
      endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients consulting in one of the seven study centers, presenting one of the indications&#xD;
      retained for the trial and giving written informed consent will receive the treatment&#xD;
      (endodontic treatment or conservative treatment) allocated by randomization (stratified over&#xD;
      the clinical diagnosis of the pulp status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up of patients include, a phone call at D15, and visit at 1, 6, 12 and 14 post&#xD;
      operative months. Clinical examination and Xrays at 6, 12 and 24 months) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the success or failure of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, a sample of pulp tissue will be withdrawn and transferred to a&#xD;
      molecular biology laboratory for analysis of inflammation biomarkers. The aim of this part of&#xD;
      the sudy is to assess a putative relationship (1) of regulation of biomarkers expression and&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis, and (2) of regulation of these biomarkers and success rate of pulpotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success/failure evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the time to necessity of endodontic reintervention (analysed as a&#xD;
      time to failure). This study will use an Intention To Treat analysis as its main assessment ;&#xD;
      a secondary assessment accounting for peroperative conversions will assess the practical&#xD;
      impact of these conversions. We will distinguish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct failure (means that the failure is directly correlated to the treatment) : the&#xD;
           reintervention need is due to the evolution of the treated tooth. This includes delayed&#xD;
           onset of desmodontitis, periodontal space enlargement and/or periapical/periradicular&#xD;
           radiolucency (PAI&gt;2) demonstrating an infection of the root canal system (filled by&#xD;
           either pulpal stump or filling material).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect failure (means that the cause of the failure is not directly related to the&#xD;
           endodontic treatment choice) : any event leading to endodontic reintervention indication&#xD;
           NOT caused by radicular infection or restoration failure attributable to inadequate&#xD;
           restoration. For example : new need of post-placement for treatment of loss of another&#xD;
           tooth, unexpected progression of periodontal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both these failure modes are of interest for analysis : the direct failure time is an&#xD;
      indication if the intrinsic value of a therapy, whereas the gross (direct+indirect) failure&#xD;
      time is an indication of its clinical relevance (a good therapy applicable in rare cases may&#xD;
      be less interesting than a mediocre but widely applicable one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical methods of descriptive analysis will be used to describe the raw results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to make inferences directly on possible clinical results, this study will be&#xD;
      analyzed in a Bayesian framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed in reference with a frequentist demonstration of&#xD;
      non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-inferiority trial with first and second species error rates α and β has the same&#xD;
      operational characteristics as a superiority (unilateral trial) of error rates alpha and&#xD;
      beta, which in turn needs the same study size as a comparison (=bilateral) trial with error&#xD;
      rates α and 2β.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final planned size of the trial is established as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ideal plan : a nonparametric comparison (logrank test) fulfilling these goals according&#xD;
           to this plan needs 158 patients overall under &quot;perfect information&quot; assumptions (no loss&#xD;
           to follow-up, single analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow-up : the expected loss to follow-up will cause about 22% of included&#xD;
           patients to drop out of the study before final analysis this leads to include 194&#xD;
           patients overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential analysis : since we wish to be able to follow the progress of the study, and to&#xD;
      interrupt it if the main goal is reached, we choose to use a sequential analysis. A Pocock&#xD;
      scheme needs to increase the sample size by 16% , leading to plan to recruit 226 patients&#xD;
      overall.&#xD;

      The accepted management for any pulpal intervention on a vital dental pulp is the pulpectomy&#xD;
      (ablation of the whole dental pulp, preparation and filling of the whole root canal system,&#xD;
      which is difficult and invasive). However, it has been shown that radicular pulp has a&#xD;
      reparative potential and interesting immune defence properties. A pulp chamber pulpotomy&#xD;
      (ablation of the coronal part of the pulp, easier and less invasive) may therefore be a&#xD;
      better alternative. Its feasibility, known on decidual and immature permanent teeth (where it&#xD;
      is a routine treatment) has been shown on mature permanent teeth. We aim to prove its&#xD;
      non-inferiority to pulpectomy and study its prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective and primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the success rates of root canal treatment (i.e. pulpectomy, reference treatment)&#xD;
      and conservative treatment (pulpotomy) for treating dental pulpal inflammatory disease on&#xD;
      permanent teeth, assessed by time to indication of re-treatment (time-to-failure) (primary&#xD;
      endpoint). The investigator in charge of the patient proposes a classification of the&#xD;
      failure, which must be validated by an adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of treatment on post-procedural pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the clinical prognostic factors of these two treatments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the additional value of biomarkers expression levels as a prognostic tool for&#xD;
           clinical decision making (pulpectomy vs. pulpotomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, comparative, randomized study (randomized clinical trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with indication of pulpal intervention on a permanent mature non-necrosed&#xD;
      tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjudication committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjudication committee will review the classification of the failure for each patient, on&#xD;
      the basis of data and radiographs and if necessary will submit queries sent to investigator.&#xD;
      The adjudication committee will finally classify the failure as direct or indirect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Power consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum of 226 patients, based on analogy with frequentist analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-inferiority study, α =0.05, 1- β =0.8;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  expected rate of failure in the control group: 10% /year;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal inferiority margin: hazard ratio=2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two years of accrual, one year of follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each patient is followed up to the end of study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  expected loss to follow-up 10%/year:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  loss of power due to interval censorship of clinically silent failure: negligible;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sequential analysis (Pocock scheme, final test with final critical p=0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayesian analysis, analogous to a frequentist non inferiority study (RRmin=2) with α=0.05 and&#xD;
      β=0.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayesian modelling of survival of retreatment indication-free, assessing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intergroup differences (Cox proportional hazards model if applicable, parametric&#xD;
           modelling otherwise)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Covariates impact (regression models) Assessment of predictive values of (clinical and&#xD;
           biological) covariates.&#xD;
