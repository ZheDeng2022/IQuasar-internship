  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the effect of an online facilitated discussion&#xD;
      group on engagement with a stress management intervention delivered to employees in the UK&#xD;
      via the Internet. The investigators primary hypothesis is that the intervention group with&#xD;
      access to an online facilitated discussion group (delivered via a message board) will show&#xD;
      greater engagement than the intervention group that does not have access to the discussion&#xD;
      group. The investigators also hypothesise that participants in the intervention groups will&#xD;
      improve significantly on psychological distress and subjective wellbeing measures compared to&#xD;
      the waiting list control group, and that the group with access to the online facilitated&#xD;
      discussion group will show the greatest improvement.&#xD;

      The aim of the pilot study is to identify and address some of the challenges of delivering&#xD;
      online psychological interventions in the workplace. There is clear research evidence for the&#xD;
      delivery of online psychological interventions within clinical settings (e.g. Andersson &amp;&#xD;
      Cuijpers, 2009), but this evidence does not translate to online interventions delivered in&#xD;
      work settings (e.g. Geraedts, Kleiboer, Twisk, Wiezer, van Mechelen, &amp; Cuijpers, 2014).&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that one of the barriers to the efficacy of online interventions may be the&#xD;
      low level of engagement and adherence (Cavanagh &amp; Millings, 2013). This study aims to address&#xD;
      this by asking the question: &quot;How can we increase engagement with and adherence to an online&#xD;
      intervention delivered in the workplace?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study is a three-arm RCT comparing a minimal guided online Cognitive Behaviour&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) based stress management intervention (WorkGuru) delivered with and without an&#xD;
      online facilitated bulletin board, to a waiting list control. Both active conditions will&#xD;
      have access to an online programme with minimal support from a coach. The discussion group&#xD;
      condition will also have access to a facilitated online bulletin board. Up to 90 employees&#xD;
      from UK based organisations will be recruited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will include age 18 or over, elevated levels of stress (defined as 1SD&#xD;
      above the mean norm on the PSS-10 scale), access to a computer or tablet, and the Internet.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be engagement, as defined by the number of logins to the&#xD;
      site; secondary outcome measures will include further measures of engagement (the number of&#xD;
      pages visited, the number of modules completed and self-report engagement) and measures of&#xD;
      effectiveness (psychological distress and subjective wellbeing). Possible moderators will&#xD;
      include measures of intervention quality (satisfaction, acceptability, credibility, system&#xD;
      usability), time pressure, goal conflict, level of distress at baseline, and job autonomy.&#xD;
      Measures will be taken at baseline, 2 weeks (credibility and expectancy measures only), 9&#xD;
      weeks (completion of intervention) and 16 weeks (follow-up). Analyses will be conducted on&#xD;
      intention to treat and per protocol principles. Data will be collected electronically using&#xD;
      Qualtrics survey software.&#xD;
