  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed interactive, multimedia-intensive, computer-based treatment&#xD;
      programs that include depression (Problem-Solving Therapy), stress management, and conflict&#xD;
      management. Together the three modules are called PATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem-solving module is based on an evidence-based psychotherapy called Problem-Solving&#xD;
      Therapy in which depressed patients identify problems in their lives and work through a&#xD;
      structured format for solving these problems. We have subjected the problem-solving module to&#xD;
      Phase 1-3 feasibility, acceptability and efficacy trials which have been positive and without&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conflict program uses a cognitive-behavioral-therapy-based approach. The program includes&#xD;
      a conflict briefing, an interactive conflict simulation, a conflict assessment tool, an&#xD;
      interactive training exercise in interest-based negotiation, and a cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress program also uses a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. In the program,&#xD;
      the mentor introduces the &quot;stress pyramid&quot;, which demonstrates how stress triggers can lead&#xD;
      to different feelings, actions and thoughts, which are analogs to the CBT realms of&#xD;
      dysfunctional emotions, maladaptive behaviors, and faulty cognitive processes. The stress&#xD;
      management content is delivered over 6 sessions, with each session including exercises in the&#xD;
      3 domains of thoughts, feelings, and actions. The program includes briefings, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring exercises, interactive scenarios, and self-assessments. This program has been&#xD;
      evaluated with law and business students and was shown effective in reducing stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to make the problem-solving, stress, and the conflict&#xD;
      modules available through the internet for any adult 18 or older in order to assess their&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness under naturalistic conditions.&#xD;

      Objective: To assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of PATH under&#xD;
      naturalistic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Greater than 50% of users referred to the problem-solving module will complete at least 4&#xD;
      treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Users will report that problem-solving module is acceptable as a stand-alone treatment&#xD;
      for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: On average, user's self-reported depression severity scores on the PHQ-9 will decrease&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: More workers and family members will access the program directly than through referral&#xD;
      from a clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: Users will find the stress and conflict content acceptable and helpful in learning better&#xD;
      stress and conflict management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H6: On average, user self-reported stress severity scores on the PSS will decrease over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive employees and faculty members receiving evaluations in the EAP programs of&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Dartmouth College and identified as being&#xD;
      depressed or having issues with conflict or stress and as potentially able to benefit from&#xD;
      using PATH will be referred to the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programs are also available to any adult on their own or through their organization at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Path.Dartmouth.edu&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the user signs up, they create a username and password and select they do not have a&#xD;
      token and then are presented with an electronic consent. When they click accept (providing&#xD;
      consent), they are given access to the programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials: PATH programs available on the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be automatically collected by the suite of programs (problem-solving,&#xD;
      stress management, conflict management). Evaluation data (i.e., PHQ-9 scores and&#xD;
      acceptability of the program) will be collected at each session. Information entered into the&#xD;
      program as part of using PATH (e.g., the types of problems worked on, success with solving&#xD;
      the problems, satisfaction with effort, compliance with homework, obstacles encountered) will&#xD;
      also be automatically stored. Stress and conflict management programs collect the user input,&#xD;
      the paths they take, and evaluation data. Users will create a login that will enable their&#xD;
      use of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-based programs are hosted at Dartmouth College. The web-app has passed an Acunetix&#xD;
      security scan, run by Dartmouth Central Computing. It has been set up as a DISC level 3&#xD;
      security server. This has been evaluated by the Research Privacy and Security Officer at&#xD;
      Dartmouth College and has been approved for use. Only gender will be collected. No&#xD;
      identifying information (e.g., name, address, dob, SS#) will be collected. All entered data&#xD;
      will be stored according to the assigned ID. To monitor for potentially nefarious hackers, IP&#xD;
      addresses connecting to our servers will be collected and geo-located to ensure the router or&#xD;
      internet service provider they are connecting from corresponds to those expected based on our&#xD;
      research locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not propose to screen the participants for the study. Participants will be referred to&#xD;
      the programs by their EAP counselor at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, their FEAP&#xD;
      counselor at Dartmouth College, their provider at DHMC, or by advertisement through Live Well&#xD;
      Work Well or Dartmouth College EAP. Participants may also be referred through an outside&#xD;
      organization or use the program on their own. As an effectiveness study, we are interested in&#xD;
      making the programs available without exclusions to the general population. There are no&#xD;
      eligibility criteria based on severity level of depression or suicidal ideation. There are no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for participation in the study. Suicidality is not a reason for not being&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is being made available to Geisel Medical Students, as well as Dartmouth College&#xD;
      and Dartmouth Hitchcock Employees through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), the Faculty and Employee Assistance Program (FEAP)&#xD;
      at Dartmouth College and their D-H primary care physicians in order to assess their&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness under naturalistic conditions. Additionally, to&#xD;
      test whether workers and their families are likely to access on-line treatment if they can&#xD;
      access the treatment directly, we will make it possible for participants to connect to the&#xD;
      programs directly, without referral from a clinician. We will be additionally testing these&#xD;
      programs through making them freely available on the internet as well as through&#xD;
      organizations that express interest in using them with their employees, members, etc. who are&#xD;
      18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from outside of Dartmouth populations will be self-referred or referred to the&#xD;
      program by people in their organization. We will not direct how the organizations will&#xD;
      implement use of the programs but will collect information from the organizations about their&#xD;
      implementation strategies. We may share usage data with the organizations but will not&#xD;
      provide information for specific individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these populations, we will be analyzing usage data (i.e. completion of modules, return&#xD;
      visits to modules), data collected by the program (i.e. progress through the modules),&#xD;
      acceptability (i.e. from the questionnaires embedded in the programs such as the depression&#xD;
      program), effectiveness (i.e. for those programs that include repeated assessments), and&#xD;
      implementation strategies from different organizations that partner with us to use the&#xD;
      program (i.e. reminder systems, adjunctive use with therapist, use in group settings).&#xD;
