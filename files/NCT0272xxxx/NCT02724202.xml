    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find the response rate of combining the&#xD;
      dietary supplement, curcumin, with the standard of care, FDA-approved chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5FU, Adracil) and see what effects (good and bad) that the combined&#xD;
      treatments have on colon cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Confirm clinical safety and identify clinical response rate of combination treatment with&#xD;
      curcumin and 5FU in chemorefractory CRC patients. To determine whether curcumin&#xD;
      administration induces systemic alterations in inflammatory and epigenetic biomarkers in&#xD;
      patients with chemoresistant metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). To correlate altered&#xD;
      biomarker findings with clinical response according to RECIST V1.1 and survival criteria.&#xD;
