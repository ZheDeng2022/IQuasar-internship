      This research is being done to evaluate whether or not the Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App (a&#xD;
      smartphone application) is a feasible and valid tool to assess pain from radiation sores&#xD;
      (also referred to as &quot;mucositis&quot;) when treating head and neck cancers with radiation. The&#xD;
      mobile app will be designed to help people better understand the pain from the radiation&#xD;
      sores.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a single-arm, observational, supportive care clinical trial for patients&#xD;
      with tumors involving the oral cavity, oropharynx, or unknown primary expecting to receive at&#xD;
      least a 50 Gy dose of definitive radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OM PAIN APP (DESCRIPTION): The Oral Mucositis (OM) PAIN APP (App) is a smartphone application&#xD;
      that was designed to permit patients to key in pain severity, using a visual analog 0-10&#xD;
      scale. The App is programed with an alarm to prompt the patient to record pain severity at&#xD;
      prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient input. Data collected on each&#xD;
      patient's smartphone can be backed up wirelessly to a central server where the data can be&#xD;
      analyzed remotely or data can be viewed on the device. The software is capable of generating&#xD;
      a time-weighted measure of pain, total area under the pain cure (AUC), a summary measure that&#xD;
      integrates serial assessments of a patient's pain over the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAILY OBSERVATION: Subjects will receive a preprogrammed alarm four times a day from their&#xD;
      smartphones prompting them to directly enter OM pain levels on the device. Patients may&#xD;
      submit as many pain entries as they wish beyond the four minimum levels. Data recording will&#xD;
      not commence until radiation starts. Because symptoms of mucositis do not commence typically&#xD;
      until the third week of radiation therapy, and no sooner than week 2, recordings from week 1&#xD;
      will be used for baseline data. Recording of data will cease four weeks after the end of&#xD;
      radiation therapy at which time mucositis symptoms typically start to resolve and pain&#xD;
      symptoms substantially abate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCELEROMETER: Each patient will be issued an accelerometer and will be encouraged to wear it&#xD;
      continuously during the study period. To help determine whether decline in physical activity&#xD;
      is associated with severity of pain, physical activity will be assessed directly with&#xD;
      accelerometers (activity monitor). Participants will wear an accelerometer during sleep and&#xD;
      waking hours, but not while bathing, starting one week prior to the start radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Accelerometer output data will be obtained in 1-minute epochs that will be then summed to&#xD;
      provide raw daily average activity units, which will be subsequently divided by 1000 for&#xD;
      clarity. Data will by synced weekly by the study coordinator to a computer connected to a&#xD;
      central server.&#xD;
