  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to combine a single infusion of Ketamine with 7-days of trauma&#xD;
      focus psychotherapy to relieve post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms more&#xD;
      effectively. This treatment has the potential to produce a significant therapeutic effect&#xD;
      that otherwise would take months to occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current research findings on the therapeutic effectiveness of trauma focus&#xD;
      psychotherapy and of ketamine, combining the two treatments may yield a promising new rapid&#xD;
      7-day treatment for PTSD. As PTSD symptoms' structure is comprised of several unique clusters&#xD;
      which include re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing/depression and hypervigilance the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that by combining Ketamine with prolonged exposure (PE) the&#xD;
      investigators can address these symptoms clusters more effectively. This treatment has the&#xD;
      potential to produce a significant therapeutic effect that otherwise would take months to&#xD;
      occur by tapping on the enhanced neuroplasticity and the antidepressant effect of ketamine&#xD;
      (which lasts between 24hrs to 7 days), to promote rapid changes in learning and memory using&#xD;
      prolonged exposure therapy within this unique &quot;window of opportunity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit participants will undergo a clinical interview to establish a PTSD&#xD;
      diagnosis and other eligibility criteria. If found eligible participants will be invited to&#xD;
      take part in this 7-day rapid treatment trial for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first therapy visits, participants will be educated about the psychological treatment&#xD;
      that will be provided and the potential benefit of ketamine to enhance the psychotherapy&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second day of the study, participants will receive an infusion of ketamine or placebo&#xD;
      and will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and will receive the second&#xD;
      psychotherapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 3-6 participants will attend a 60-90 minutes psychotherapy session to address their&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 will include another MRI scan and the last psychotherapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to come back for a follow up evaluation of their PTSD symptoms 30&#xD;
      and 90 days post discharge.&#xD;

    <description>PTSD Symptoms severity will be evaluated overtime using PTSD Check List (PCL-5). Evidence for the PCL suggested 5 points as a minimum threshold for determining whether an individual has responded to treatment and 10 points as a minimum threshold for determining whether the improvement is clinically meaningful. PCL Score &gt; 33 indicates probable PTSD.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The self-report BDI-II will be used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. A higher score is associated with higher severity of depression. The score is interpreted as follows: 0-13 indicates minimal depression, 14-19 indicates mild depression, 20-28 indicates moderate depression and 29-63 indicates severe depression</description>

             risk of suicide in the investigator's judgment, or a history of serious suicidal&#xD;
             behavior, which is defined using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)&#xD;
             (Posner et al., 2011) as either (1) one or more actual suicide attempts in the 3 years&#xD;
             before study entry with the lethality rated at 3 or higher, or (2) one or more&#xD;
             interrupted suicide attempts with a potential lethality judged to result in serious&#xD;
