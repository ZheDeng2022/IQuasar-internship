      Objective Sedation is a depression of consciousness varies between anxiolysis and general&#xD;
      anesthesia. It is used to facilitate diagnostic tests and minor surgeries. Respiratory&#xD;
      complication is the main side effect of the sedation. His Early diagnosis and adequate&#xD;
      management prevent serious complications such as hypoxic brain damage or death. A development&#xD;
      of a learning program of sedation is required. Simulation as a teaching tool has improved the&#xD;
      clinical expertise of learners. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      simulation based medical education program on the performance of non-resident&#xD;
      anesthesiologists for the management of complications related to sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This trial is randomized, controlled and single blinded. Non-resident&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, without prior training on sedation, are included and randomized to receive&#xD;
      or not a simulation based sedation learning. This program includes a pharmacology sedatives&#xD;
      learning, teaching technical skills for airway management on low fidelity mannequin and&#xD;
      high-fidelity simulation scenarios of these complications. Two evaluators, single-blinded,&#xD;
      visualise the recorded performance of residents in simulation session. The evaluation is&#xD;
      based on a performance checklist developed by Delphi technique. It compares the performance&#xD;
      of the residents within the same group before and after the simulation based medical&#xD;
      education program and to compare groups of residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The sample size is based on similar simulation studies. The results are&#xD;
      compared with the variance analysis for repeated measures. The difference in performance&#xD;
      before and after simulation is compared using a t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypotheses that improved performance scores following the simulation based&#xD;
      medical education would put the dot on the importance of simulation as a learning tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is a drug depression of consciousness and alertness. It involves intravenous&#xD;
      hypnotics and narcotics administration. Depending on doses and blood levels of administered&#xD;
      agents, there is a continuum between anxiolysis, light sedation (monitored anesthesia care),&#xD;
      deep sedation and general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation is used to facilitate diagnostic examinations, minor surgery, endoscopic surgery and&#xD;
      endovascular or transcutaneous therapeutic radiological procedures. It provides comfort to&#xD;
      the patient during the procedure and better conditions for examination or treatment for the&#xD;
      operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk during procedural sedation is compromising the patient's respiratory function&#xD;
      and airway. The obstruction of the upper airway by the tongue, soft palate or epiglottis on&#xD;
      one hand and respiratory depression due to the sedative on the other hand are the major&#xD;
      problems of sedation. In addition to respiratory depression, decreased airway protective&#xD;
      reflexes during sedation exposes to the gastric contents aspiration and consequent&#xD;
      respiratory complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major complications are rare: one case of death of 160,000, 1 case of tracheal intubation of&#xD;
      58 000 and no cases of permanent neurologic damage of 646,000 gastrointestinal endoscopies&#xD;
      performed under sedation. More common, the incidence of partial obstructions requiring airway&#xD;
      maneuvers release (mandibular subluxation, oropharyngeal airway device, nasopharyngeal airway&#xD;
      device) is 14.4%, 12.8% of hypoxemia, 0.1% of ventilation with face mask and in 0.6% the&#xD;
      ongoing procedure needed to be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these incidents are without clinical severity, they can cause serious complications&#xD;
      if diagnosed late or in inadequate care. Various analyzes of the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology claims related to sedation, prove the seriousness of these complications and&#xD;
      the importance of their early management, 40% of claims involving death or hypoxic permanent&#xD;
      brain injury could be prevented and 50% of claims are related to anesthetic procedures&#xD;
      performed outside the operating room. Respiratory depression associated with an absolute or&#xD;
      relative overdose of sedative is the primary mechanism of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation can be practiced by non-anesthesiologists. There are several publications, other&#xD;
      than in the anesthesiology field, on sedation regimes used and their safety and efficacy. The&#xD;
      heterogeneity of definitions of respiratory complications and lack of power of these studies&#xD;
      failed to show a reduction in respiratory complications and safety of sedation according to&#xD;
      the standards of the anesthesiologist. The complications are associated to limited knowledge&#xD;
      of anesthetic drugs pharmacology, the monitoring of sedation and the airway management. The&#xD;
      anesthesiologist should play a central role in establishing safe sedation standards when&#xD;
      administered by non-anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the sedation learning need, the majority of residents and&#xD;
      non-anesthesiologists sedation practitioners, strongly express their interest in a learning&#xD;
      sedation. This interest is related to the residents' discomfort when using sedation&#xD;
      associated to a lack of mastering of sedatives pharmacology and airway managements&#xD;
      principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulation as a teaching tool is increasingly used. The literature has shown that&#xD;
      simulation can improve the performance of trainees in various technical and non technical&#xD;
      skills (expertise, crisis resource management principles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation is used as an assessment tool of education techniques. It assesses the performance&#xD;
      of trainees through reproducible situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation based medical education success depends on several factors. The relevance of the&#xD;
      subject taught in the professional context, the target population, the identification of&#xD;
      educational goals, the educational activities implemented to achieve these objectives, the&#xD;
      choice of parameters to be measured and the measurement method are all factors that can&#xD;
      strongly affect the impact of the simulation based medical education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent meta-analysis of McGraphie and colleagues reviewed all the studies, from 1990 to&#xD;
      2011, evaluating the effectiveness of simulation based medical education. It shows the&#xD;
      simulation based medical education superiority over the traditional clinical education in&#xD;
      acquiring limited designed skills. The explanation of simulation use is based on the fact&#xD;
      that the simulation seems to fill some gaps of traditional clinical learning, such as delayed&#xD;
      and random clinical exposure and scarcity of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of simulation for learning sedation to non-anesthesiologists seems to meet the&#xD;
      requirements dictated by the subject to teach. It should, indeed, allow sedative drugs&#xD;
      pharmacology learning and technical skills mastering. It should also allow, through&#xD;
      reproducible scenarios, in high-fidelity simulation, improvement of the overall&#xD;
      complications' sedation management and the assessment of the impact of simulation based&#xD;
      medical education. However, even if the simulation offers all the theoretical and practical&#xD;
      components of safe sedation educational program, the overall result of education based on&#xD;
      simulation on the ability of non-resident anesthesiologists to manage sedation's&#xD;
      complications remains to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the impact of a high fidelity&#xD;
      simulation based sedation learning on non-anesthesiologists residents' performance in the&#xD;
      management of sedation's complications, during simulated scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of the simulation based sedation learning program&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program's goal is to offer a comprehensive approach to theory and practice of&#xD;
           sedation. It must provide the resident a vision adapted to their daily practice. Being&#xD;
           based on the simulation, education should draw profile of all components provided to&#xD;
           education from simulation tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The simulation based sedation learning program consists of different modules in response&#xD;
           to residents' needs in the practice of sedation. The teaching is based on specific&#xD;
           educational objectives, experimental learning conditions, repeated practice and an&#xD;
           assessment based on the achievement rate of tasks. These modules are developed by&#xD;
           anesthesiologists practicing in academic fields and practicing sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program includes online learning. It is followed by development of interactive&#xD;
           presentations, based on simulated cases or simulated patients (actors), low fidelity&#xD;
           simulation for specific technical skills as well as high fidelity scenarios of&#xD;
           complications related to sedation. The purpose of the high-fidelity simulation is to&#xD;
           enable the resident to integrate theoretical and practical learning received, in a&#xD;
           similar context to his clinical practice, to develop a comprehensive and contextual&#xD;
           (material, human resources and authorized techniques) management of sedation, to&#xD;
           prevent, to anticipate, to make an early diagnosis and adequate management of simulated&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, trial. The study is&#xD;
           conducted in the University of Montreal simulation centre. The robotic model used is the&#xD;
           SimMan 3G (Laerdal, Inc. http: / /www.laerdal.com/doc/85/SimMan-3G).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective is the performance scores before and after a simulation based&#xD;
           sedation learning program during a high fidelity simulated scenario of sedation's&#xD;
           complications managed by non anesthesiologists residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Population Included in this study, all residents from surgery programs, radiology,&#xD;
           gastroenterology, pneumology, family medicine , emergency medicine of the University of&#xD;
           Montreal. Residents must have academic supervision with 1: 1 by a senior during their&#xD;
           practice. Residents who have received prior instruction on sedation or advanced learning&#xD;
           technical skills for airway management during residency will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruited participants were randomized according to a randomization table,&#xD;
           computerized, established prior to inclusion in intervention group that receives&#xD;
           simulation based sedation learning and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment method and developing the performance checklist The evaluation is based on a&#xD;
           list of tasks and behaviours (technical and non technical skills) of the resident during&#xD;
           the management of simulated complications related to sedation. It includes items related&#xD;
           to the specific management of complications (expertise) and non-specific items of&#xD;
           communication and collaboration (Crisis Resource Management principles). It is divided&#xD;
           in a) an initial assessment of the situation b) diagnostic steps c) management d)&#xD;
           secondary evaluation. The performance list is developed and validated using the modified&#xD;
           Delphi method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedure A description of the high-fidelity simulation is performed, and a&#xD;
           participation in an uncomplicated sedation scenario is made initially for the two&#xD;
           groups. This first experience allows them to become familiar with the environment of the&#xD;
           simulation and the use of mannequin interface / physician. This simulation is not&#xD;
           followed by a debriefing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are then randomized in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents included in this group will go through the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simulation of respiratory complications related to sedation: Base line performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulation based sedation program, described above. A second simulation of respiratory&#xD;
      complications related to sedation: Post test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments are conducted by independent instructors blindly. The evaluators attribute scores&#xD;
      by viewing the recorded performances, without knowing the group to which the candidate is&#xD;
      included, or whether simulation based sedation program is realized or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents included in this group carry out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complication related to sedation simulation: Base line performance, not followed by a&#xD;
      debriefing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self visualization of a video describing sedation in adults. A second simulation, about 2&#xD;
      months later: Post test For equity training, the control group will be offered the simulation&#xD;
      based sedation program after the end of the study, if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Analysis of results The tasks are classified in 2 categories: properly performed or not /&#xD;
      not properly performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance score represents adequately performed tasks on the total number of tasks&#xD;
      (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the comparison of (a) performance scores between pre-test and&#xD;
      post-test for each group (b) performance scores related to technical skills (c) performance&#xD;
      scores related to non technical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are compared with the analysis of variance for repeated measures. The difference&#xD;
      in performance before and after the simulation based sedation program is compared using a t&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants was the number of eligible residents and who agreed to participate&#xD;
      (convenience sample). As the selected population in this study consists of a larger sample,&#xD;
      as several residency programs are concerned, the investigators opt for two groups of 25&#xD;
      participants (total n 50).&#xD;
