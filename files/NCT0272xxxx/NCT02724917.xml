    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in patients with schizophrenia is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 3 doses (low, mid, high) of APN1125 compared with&#xD;
      placebo when administered as repeated daily oral doses.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of APN1125 following 14 days of once-daily oral dosing in subjects with&#xD;
      schizophrenia on stable second-generation antipsychotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 2-week, multiple ascending dose study of APN1125. This&#xD;
      study will enroll up to three sequential cohorts of subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      each randomly assigned to receive one of three doses (low, medium, or high) of APN1125 or&#xD;
      matching placebo. Following admission to an Early Phase Clinical Unit (EPCU), APN1125 will be&#xD;
      administered once daily for 2 weeks. All subjects will remain confined to the EPCU for a&#xD;
      total of 20 days, consisting of admission, dosing and observation periods.&#xD;
