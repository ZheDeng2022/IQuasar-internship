      Summary The aim of this study is to evaluate through clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      immunological parameters using PLGA microspheres (lactic-co-glycolic acid polyacid)&#xD;
      containing doxycycline in periodontal therapy in smokers with chronic periodontitis. For this&#xD;
      study, 40 patients will be selected, with an average age between 30 and 59 years old of both&#xD;
      genders (male and female), who spontaneously seek the clinic graduate of the Piracicaba&#xD;
      Dental School -FOP / UNICAMP, and exhibiting at least four bleeding sites, including 2 sites&#xD;
      with a probing depth (PD) between 5 and 6 mm and two sites PS ≥7 mm in uniradiculares teeth.&#xD;
      Patients should have a minimum of 20 teeth. Will be excluded from relevant systemic disease&#xD;
      carriers or antibiotics used in the 6 months preceding the study. All patients will receive&#xD;
      oral hygiene instruction and will undergo a pre-treatment, which will be held supragingival&#xD;
      sweeps and removal of plaque retentive factors. Patients will be divided into 2 groups (DB +&#xD;
      DOX: Debridement + Doxycycline, test group and DB: only debridement, control group) of 20&#xD;
      patients who will receive the following treatments: periodontal debridement ultrasound for 45&#xD;
      minutes associated with the local administration of 1 mg microspheres containing doxycycline,&#xD;
      or just mechanical debridement, for each selected site. Will be assessed the following&#xD;
      clinical parameters: gingival index (GI) Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding on Probing (BOP),&#xD;
      Position of the gingival margin (PGM), Probing Depth (PD) and Relative Clinical Attachment&#xD;
      Level (RCAL). The microbiological evaluation will be made by means of polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction - real time ( &quot;real time&quot; - PCR) to detect bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis,&#xD;
      Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and&#xD;
      Prevotella intermedia. The enzyme immunoassay (LUMINEXMAGPIX) allow the detection of cytokine&#xD;
      levels of GM-CSF, INF-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. The analysis&#xD;
      of the proteolytic enzyme activity is accomplished by using zymography to assess MMP-8 and&#xD;
      MMP-9. The described parameters will be evaluated at baseline, 45 and 90 days after the&#xD;
      initial visit. The results are compared statistically by analysis of variance with repeated&#xD;
      measures with 5% significance level.&#xD;

           the Piracicaba Dental School - UNICAMP, will be selected among the patients who seek&#xD;
           spontaneously treatment in clinics Graduate FOP-UNICAMP (where also will be performed&#xD;
           the clinical phase of the study), 40 patients with an average age between 30 and 59&#xD;
           years, of both genders (male or female) according to the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients smokers, but overall good health&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patients initially diagnosed with moderate or severe chronic periodontitis&#xD;
                (according to the American Academy of Periodontology- AAP, 1999) verified the&#xD;
                presence of radiographic periodontal pockets and bone loss;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who have at least four bleeding sites with probing depth (PD)&gt; 5 mm in&#xD;
                uniradiculares teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of a minimum of 20 teeth;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  formal consent to participate in research, after explaining the risks and benefits&#xD;
                for individual not involved in it. (Resolution No. 196 of October 1996 and the&#xD;
                Dental Code of Professional Ethics (C.F.O.) 179/93).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  periapical or pulp change Presence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of systemic changes or use of medications (6 months prior to the study)&#xD;
                that may influence response to periodontal treatment (eg, phenytoin, cyclosporine,&#xD;
                calcium channel antagonists, and anti-inflammatory steroids and non-steroidal);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence hypersensitivity to tetracyclines and their derivatives;&#xD;

             -  Teeth with involvement furcation in the case of premolars.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy and lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be clinical, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel design, and&#xD;
           the treatments are randomly distributed among the patients. Selected patients will be&#xD;
           divided into 2 groups, whose teeth receive the treatments, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           DB group (20 patients), - mechanical debridement in one session and application of&#xD;
           placebo microspheres in four periodontal pockts greater than 5 mm DB + DOX group (20&#xD;
           patients), - mechanical debridement in one session associated with the application of 1&#xD;
           mg of microspheres loaded with doxycycline per periodontal pockt, into four sites equal&#xD;
           to or greater than 5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PLGA microspheres, used in this study as a controlled drug delivery system, will be&#xD;
           produced in the Biomaterials Laboratory of Medicine of the Catholic University of São&#xD;
           Paulo, according to Moura, 2015. The microspheres are loaded with doxycycline&#xD;
           hydrochloride ( EMS Sigma Pharma-Generics, Hortolandia, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Plan Initial examination: Selection of 40 patients according to pre-established&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial therapy: All patients will be educated about the causes and consequences of&#xD;
      periodontal disease as well as on the importance of prevention techniques, (sulcular brushing&#xD;
      and flossing) for periodontal therapy. In this phase, there will be supragingival periodontal&#xD;
      debridement of all mouth and removal of plaque retentive factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: All patients will be treated by subgingival debridement of mouth all by the same&#xD;
      operator and will be reassessed in 3 months by the study investigator. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed through a list generated by computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of treatment: Patients will be instructed in oral hygiene and will be held the&#xD;
      professional control of supragingival biofilm in follow-up visits. To standardize the&#xD;
      location of the collection of clinical data, guiding probing devices will be made - &quot;stents&quot;&#xD;
      with acrylic sheets 1mm thick in a vacuum plasticizing, to survey the sites with PS≥ 7 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical: The clinical parameters are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gingival Index - IG (Löe and Silness, 1963): Inflammatory signals are collected through&#xD;
           the following scores: 0 (absence of gingival inflammation); 1 (mild inflammation - small&#xD;
           change in color, texture, absence of bleeding on probing); 2 (moderate inflammation -&#xD;
           moderate brightness, redness, swelling and hypertrophy, bleeding on probing); 3 (severe&#xD;
           inflammation - marked redness and hypertrophy; spontaneous bleeding, and tendency to&#xD;
           ulceration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plaque Index - IP (Ainamo &amp; Bay, 1975): Evaluation of the presence / absence of plaque&#xD;
           in binominal standard. Number of faces engaged with plate divided by the number present&#xD;
           in all faces the patient's teeth 0- no visible plaque; 1- presence of visible plaque&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bleeding on probing - SS (Mühlemann &amp; Son, 1971): Standard dichotomous. 0-absence of&#xD;
           bleeding; 1- presence of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. position gingival margin - PMG: distance of demarcation in the &quot;stent&quot; to the free&#xD;
           gingival margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e Insertion Relative Clinical Level - NICR: distance of demarcation in the &quot;stent&quot; to the&#xD;
      base, clinically detectable, the periodontal pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f- Depth Survey - PS (NICR - PMG): distance from the gingival margin to the base, clinically&#xD;
      detectable, the periodontal pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical parameters are obtained using a periodontal probe of the North Carolina type at&#xD;
      baseline, 45 and 90 days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the methods that affect the research subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once selected the study volunteers, they receive all the guidelines relating to the Consent&#xD;
      and Informed research following the recommendations of Resolution 466/12 of the CNS. Any&#xD;
      discomfort that may be caused by periodontal debridement treatment by ultrasound are not&#xD;
      different from those caused by treatment coronorradicular scraping, consisting of moderate&#xD;
      pain in the treated area and the possibility of dentine hypersensitivity due to exposure of&#xD;
      dentinal tubules on the root surface. To minimize possible discomfort for these volunteers&#xD;
      will be prescribed aftertreatment analgesics and mouthwash fluoride solution in all cases,&#xD;
      regardless of whether or not feature dentinal hypersensitivity. Local administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics (doxycycline) poses no risk to volunteers, since the administered dose will cause&#xD;
      only local effects, according to the studies consulted for the preparation of this project.&#xD;
      Moreover, even if undesirably the administered antibiotic does not achieve the expected&#xD;
      results, it can be said that this will not result in patient exposure to some kind of risk,&#xD;
      since the dose to be given is insufficient to cause increased discomfort. Still, if the&#xD;
      conventional treatment with or without the local use of the antibiotic does not yield results&#xD;
      in some patients, they will be benefited by the methods of oral hygiene education and&#xD;
      clarification on oral health, which contribute to improving the quality of life of patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the &quot;real time&quot;. This test will allow&#xD;
      the quantitative detection of the following bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella&#xD;
      forsythia, Treponema denticola, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella&#xD;
      intermedia, held in the Discipline of Periodontology Laboratories, located in FOP / UNICAMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. collection of subgingival The area for the collection of material, will be properly&#xD;
           insulated and dry with sterile cotton rolls. The portion of supragingival bacterial&#xD;
           biofilm is removed to then obtain samples of subgingival plaque, by placing strips of&#xD;
           paper (Periopaper - (OraFlow Inc., New York, USA)) inside bags moderate (5-6 mm ) and&#xD;
           deep pockets (≥ 7 mm) of each patient, for 45 - 60 seconds. The volume of gingival&#xD;
           crevicular fluid collected is measured with the Periotron 8000 (OraFlow Inc., New York,&#xD;
           USA) and the paper strips are then placed in microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf), coded&#xD;
           for each of the patients, and 400 or 200l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.05%&#xD;
           Tween-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DNA Purification The bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture&#xD;
           Collection (ATCC) P. intermedia (Pi) (ATCC 25611), P. gingivalis (Pg) (ATCC 33277), A.&#xD;
           actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) (ATCC 29522) from a culture pure T. denticola (Td) and&#xD;
           T.forsythia (TF) will be used as positive controls and standards. The bacterial DNA is&#xD;
           purified using DNA isolation kit PowerSoil® (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). The DNA&#xD;
           concentration is adjusted to 15 ng / ul in water and then an additional six dilutions in&#xD;
           10-fold serial be made. Three replicate samples of each dilution (5 ul / sample) are&#xD;
           then assayed as described below for each specific DNA. The sensitivity of each assay was&#xD;
           determined as the lowest dilution of DNA that produced a statistically significantly&#xD;
           lower (p &lt;0.001) higher than the control without template using a t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. real PCR team DESIGN OF PRIMERS: The &quot;primers&quot; specific to intermediate P., P.&#xD;
           gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. and T. forsythensis denticola will be used. All&#xD;
           &quot;primers&quot; will be checked for their specificity by verifying the Melting curve (obtained&#xD;
           after running the LightCycler) and running gel for product verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTIMIZATION OF REACTIONS: The use of SYBR Green I requires getting specific PCR products, on&#xD;
      that basis the effectiveness of responses to &quot;primer&quot; will be optimized before the start of&#xD;
      the actual reactions. Concentrations ranging from 2 to 5 mM MgCl 2 and 0,2 to 0,5 uM of each&#xD;
      &quot;primer&quot; will be used to determine the reaction conditions which have the best efficiency.&#xD;
      These conditions suggested by the manufacturer of the equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REACTIONS OF REAL-TIME PCR (RT-PCR): The RT-PCR reactions are performed with the LightCycler&#xD;
      system (Roche DiagnosticsGmbH, Mannheim, Germany) using the kit &quot;FastStart DNA Master SYBR&#xD;
      Green I (Roche DiagnosticsCo.) &quot;. The profile of the reactions will be determined following&#xD;
      the equipment manufacturer's recommendations. For each of the &quot;racing&quot; Aqua will be used as&#xD;
      negative control, and the product of the reaction is quantified using the manufacturer's own&#xD;
      program (Software LightCyclerRelativeQuantification - DiagnosticsGmbH Roche).&#xD;
&#xD;
      immunoenzymatic evaluation of gingival crevicular fluid For a comprehensive analysis of the&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory markers present in the gingival crevicular fluid collected from&#xD;
      periodontal sites, will use the Luminex / Magpix system for the identification and&#xD;
      quantification of these inflammatory markers: IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL 8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23,&#xD;
      TGF-β, TNF-alfa, IFN-alfa and GM-CSF. For this analysis, are added to beads labeled sample to&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies specific for each marker to be quantified. After the addition of the&#xD;
      beads, the sample is hybridized placed on plates and incubated for 2 hours at 37 ° C. The&#xD;
      plate is then washed and a secondary antibody joined to a substrate (biotin) is added. This&#xD;
      assembly is then incubated for 1 hour until, after washing, fluorescent marker (Streptavidin&#xD;
      / R-phycoerythrin). The plates will then be analyzed by a Luminex 100 instrument program&#xD;
      (MiraiBio, Alameda, CA, USA). This identifies and quantifies the fluorescence of each bead,&#xD;
      corresponding to the inflammatory marker. This fluorescence is then transformed, by means of&#xD;
      standard curves (third-orderpolynomialequation) values are processed in pg / ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of proteolytic enzyme activity - zymography Will evaluate the presence and activity&#xD;
      of two proteolytic enzymes - MMP 9 (gelatinase - which degrades mainly collagen type IV) and&#xD;
      MMP 8 (collagenase - major degradation of collagen type I, II, III) after three months of the&#xD;
      completion of debridement mechanical subgingival. For this purpose it will be used zymography&#xD;
      technique. This technique is based on digestion of association between the substrate and&#xD;
      verification of the molecular weight of the protease. It is used to identify proteolytic&#xD;
      activity in enzymes separated (bands) in a polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions.&#xD;
      Gels are stained with Coomassie blue and the enzyme activity is demonstrated by the absence&#xD;
      of coloration (white streaks) in areas where the substrate was degraded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gel zymography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gel zymography resembles gel electrophoresis also being mounted on a plate system. This&#xD;
      gel is composed of two parts: Starting from the gel and gel separation. The two are divided&#xD;
      as to have different position and composition.&#xD;
