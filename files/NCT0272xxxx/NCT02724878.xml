    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. In this research the investigators are&#xD;
      studying the combination of Atezolizumab with Bevacizumab. Participants will receive both&#xD;
      vascular endothelial targeted therapy and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Atezolizumab for Advanced&#xD;
      Non-Clear Cell Kidney Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Bevacizumab with Interferon (IFNα) as a treatment option for Advanced&#xD;
      Kidney Cancer.&#xD;

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months .</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response recorded on treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria.&#xD;
CR and PR must meet the following lesion criteria without having any new lesions as well:&#xD;
Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Non-Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;
Non-CR/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Must have PR in target lesion.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate by Histological Subtypes</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response recorded on treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria. Please see the primary endpoint &quot;Best Overall Response Rate&quot; description for the definition of CR and PR.&#xD;
Non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma includes different histologic and genetic subtypes to include: papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, unclassified, translocation, and medullary carcinoma. These subtypes are measured using established methods.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse events are measured continuously on treatment and up to thirty days after going off treatment (up to ~32 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. All treatment-related all-grade adverse events occurring in &gt;10% of participants.&#xD;
Treatment Related is discerned as follows:&#xD;
Yes: There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of atezolizumab or bevacizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to atezolizumab or bevacizumab or with similar treatments; and/or the AE resolves upon discontinuation of the study drugs or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.&#xD;
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drugs (e.g., pre existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to the study drugs administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response (based on RECIST 1.1) is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR and PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune Related Best Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR) or Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR) is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).&#xD;
irCR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as complete response (CR).&#xD;
irPR: Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all target and all new measurable lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SPD increases by &gt; 25% when compared to SPD at nadir.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants followed for up to 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression (PD) or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Progression is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria 1.1 (RECIST) as follows:&#xD;
- &gt;20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline if it's the smallest). The sum must also demonstrate an increase of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
-Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. For patients with PD at the first on-treatment imaging assessment, patients will be allowed to remain on study until confirmation at the next assessment at investigator discretion if patient is benefiting from treatment.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>The best overall response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response recorded on treatment based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria.&#xD;
CR and PR must meet the following lesion criteria without having any new lesions as well:&#xD;
Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
(PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Non-Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;
Non-CR/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Must have PR in target lesion.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months .</time_frame>

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>The duration of overall response (based on RECIST 1.1) is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR and PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.</time_frame>

        <title>Immune Related Best Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>The best overall Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR) or Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR) is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).&#xD;
irCR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as complete response (CR).&#xD;
irPR: Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all target and all new measurable lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SPD increases by &gt; 25% when compared to SPD at nadir.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks while on treatment. Off-treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to two year. Participants were followed up to 32 months.</time_frame>
        <population>Since the trial was designed in 2015, immune-related response has been infrequently used in VEGF/IO trials for kidney cancer. Most RCC trials have mainly focused on the traditional RECIST-based response as the primary endpoint. Therefore, the study team did not pursue immune-related response assessment and that data was not collected.</population>

        <title>Median Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression (PD) or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Progression is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria 1.1 (RECIST) as follows:&#xD;
- &gt;20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline if it's the smallest). The sum must also demonstrate an increase of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
-Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. For patients with PD at the first on-treatment imaging assessment, patients will be allowed to remain on study until confirmation at the next assessment at investigator discretion if patient is benefiting from treatment.</description>

        <title>Brief Fatigue Inventory Score - Items 1-3</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory Score (BFI) is a 9 item questionnaire with each items 1-3 scored on a scale of 0-10 Scores are categorized is mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), or severe (7-10). A global fatigue score can be found by averaging the score obtained on each test item completed. Items 1-3 of the 9 are reported here.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, week 9, week 15, week 21, week 27, and end of therapy.</time_frame>
        <population>Number analyzed reflects the number of participants with a evaluable questionnaire at each timepoint. Items 1-3 are reported because they are fatigue related and fatigue is the most common toxicity in the cohort.</population>

        <title>6-Month Progression-Free Survival by Histological Subgroups</title>
        <description>6-Month Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the probability of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause 6 months from treatment start date as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Progression is defined by RECIST 1.1 as follows:&#xD;
- &gt;20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The sum must also demonstrate an increase of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
-Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. For patients with PD at the first on-treatment imaging assessment, patients will be allowed to remain on study until confirmation at the next assessment at investigator discretion if patient is benefiting from treatment.&#xD;
Histological subgroups are categorized using established methods.</description>

        <title>6-Month Progression-Free Survival by Sarcomatoid Differentiation</title>
        <description>6-Month Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the probability of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause 6 months from treatment start date as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Progression is defined by RECIST 1.1 as follows:&#xD;
- &gt;20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The sum must also demonstrate an increase of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
-Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. For patients with PD at the first on-treatment imaging assessment, patients will be allowed to remain on study until confirmation at the next assessment at investigator discretion if patient is benefiting from treatment.&#xD;

Patients who have not progressed and alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. Progression is defined by RECIST 1.1 as follows:&#xD;
- &gt;20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum. The sum must also demonstrate an increase of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
OR&#xD;
-Appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. For patients with PD at the first on-treatment imaging assessment, patients will be allowed to remain on study until confirmation at next assessment at investigator discretion if patient is benefiting from treatment.&#xD;

CR and PR must meet the following criteria without having any new lesions as well:&#xD;
Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
(PR): &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesion, taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.&#xD;
Non-Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;
Non-CR/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1+ non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Must have PR in target lesion.&#xD;

        <title>1-Year Overall Survival by Prior Systemic Therapy</title>
        <description>1-Year Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the probability of survival at 1 year from treatment start date. Survival probability is estimated using Kaplan Meier methods. An event is considered to be death due to any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up before the 1 year mark are censored at date last known alive.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate by Prior Systemic Therapy</title>
        <description>The objective response rate is the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response on treatment using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
CR and PR must meet the following criteria without having any new lesions as well:&#xD;
Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
(PR): &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesion, taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.&#xD;
Non-Target Lesion:&#xD;
(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological (&lt;10 mm short axis).&#xD;
Non-CR/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1+ non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Must have PR in target lesion.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks while on treatment. The median (range) of treatment time was 9.5 (1-42) cycles, thus participants were assessed up to ~32 months .</time_frame>
