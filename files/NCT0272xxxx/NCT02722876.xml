  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cross-education rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on ameliorating the acute&#xD;
      losses to function and performance. The cross-education phenomenon describes the strength&#xD;
      gain in the opposite, untrained (surgical) limb following unilateral resistance training of&#xD;
      the 'trained' (non-surgical) limb.&#xD;

      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 eligible and consenting patients (allowing for 20% attrition) with unilateral anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament (ACL) injury that have elected to undergo surgical reconstruction will be&#xD;
      recruited into this study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two different&#xD;
      conditions: 1) standard ACL rehabilitation plus 8-weeks of contralateral muscle resistance&#xD;
      training, [INTERVENTION]; 2) standard ACL rehabilitation plus placebo exercises (time-matched&#xD;
      unrelated upper limb flexibility exercises, [CONTROL].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of knee extensor and knee flexor neuromuscular performance of both limbs will be&#xD;
      obtained prior to, at 10-weeks post- and at 6-months post- surgery. Assessments of function&#xD;
      (1-leg hop for distance) and patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation&#xD;
      Committee [IKDC]) will also be conducted at these times. Further, all patients will be asked&#xD;
      to wear a tri-axial accelerometer to gain an objective measure of habitual physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) and sedentary time and pattern for one week pre-surgery (5 weekdays and 2 weekend days),&#xD;
      during the first and final week of the INTERVENTION/CONTROL and then again at 6 months post-&#xD;
      INTERVENTION/CONTROL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial assessments at 10-weeks post-surgery will evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      contralateral training programme, specifically whether the training intervention on the&#xD;
      non-injured leg elicited changes in the performance of the injured leg compared to the&#xD;
      control group. The assessments at 6-months post-surgery will evaluate any carry-over effects&#xD;
      of the contralateral training programme, specifically whether any changes in performance of&#xD;
      the injured leg were retained at 6-months post-surgery compared to the control group.&#xD;
      6-months post-surgery is currently the earliest opportunity when we would permit patients to&#xD;
      return to sports and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACL surgeries will be performed by the same three surgeons at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital&#xD;
      throughout the study and according to standardised techniques and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The means and standard deviations of the primary outcome measure (peak strength) and the&#xD;
      correlation coefficient between baseline strength and 8-weeks of strength training, all&#xD;
      needed to calculate the sample size, were based on previously accrued data from our&#xD;
      laboratory on similar cohorts of ACL patients. Assuming the trial will be powered to detect a&#xD;
      difference between the groups of 50N (12.5% of peak strength) with 80% at a two-sided p=0.05&#xD;
      significance level, the trial will require 18 patients in each group assuming analysis will&#xD;
      be by ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance; see formula in Borm et al., 2007). Based on a drop-out&#xD;
      rate of 20%, the trial will require a sample size of 22 patients per trial arm (44 patients&#xD;
      in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment Potential participants will be identified from records of patients listed&#xD;
      for ACL surgery and during out-patient clinics. They will be approached by a member of the&#xD;
      clinical trial team (consultants, registrars, physiotherapist, lead researcher). The study&#xD;
      information and design will be explained to the patients meeting the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      who are interested. They will be given a patient information leaflet and informed consent&#xD;
      form to take away with them. These patients will be contacted by phone by the physiotherapist&#xD;
      or lead researcher at least 24-hours later to ascertain their verbal consent into the study&#xD;
      and to arrange an appointment for an initial assessment. Patients will have the opportunity&#xD;
      to ask any questions about the study at this stage also. Written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained at the first appointment, prior to the initial assessment. Once consented in to the&#xD;
      study, patients will be assigned a number. A master copy of individuals' unique&#xD;
      identification number and all data will be held on a password-protected computer, stored in a&#xD;
      locked cabinet, in a locked NHS research office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled monthly meetings with the research team will enable monitoring of study progress.&#xD;
      Quarterly meetings of the RJAH data monitoring group will provide independent monitoring of&#xD;
      the study. No adverse advents are expected, however, ant will be recorded in the on-site file&#xD;
      and reported immediately to the data monitoring group.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo resistance training of the thigh musculature of the non-injured (contralateral) limb 3 times per week. The exercises will consist of unilateral: knee extensions; knee flexions and; leg-press, all performed on commercially-available resistance training machines. To optimise strength gains, patients will work to the 5 repetition-maximum rule (Kraemer et al. 2002); 3 sets of each exercise will be performed and a 2-minute rest will separate each set. Sessions will take no longer than 15-20 minutes, including rest.</description>

    <description>Patients will perform 'placebo' flexibility training of the upper limb, which will involve a time-matched stretching programme targeting the latissimus dorsi, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, trapezius and pectoral muscles of both limbs. Each stretch will be performed twice, held for 20-30 seconds each time and will be followed by a 30-second rest (McCrary et al. 2015)</description>
