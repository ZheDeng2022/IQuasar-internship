    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (Week 0) to End of First Period (Week 16) in the Modified Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>First 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The modified CDASI has 3 activity measures (erythema, scale, and erosion/ulceration) and 2 damage measures (poikiloderma and calcinosis) which are assessed over 15 body areas. In addition, Gottron's papules on the hands are evaluated both for activity and damage. Lastly, the activity of periungual changes and alopecia is assessed.&#xD;
Absence of skin lesions as described above is scored with &quot;0&quot; for each of the above described areas. Skin lesion will be scored with at least &quot;1&quot; (present), some lesions will be graded from &quot;1&quot; (less severe) to &quot;2&quot; (severe); others with &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;. For the total activity score as well as for the total damage score the sub-scores will be added up. The score for total activity ranges from 0 to 100, for total damage from 0 to 32 points. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity or greater disease damage respectively.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Week 0) to End of First Period (Week 16) in the Modified Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI)</title>
        <description>The modified CDASI has 3 activity measures (erythema, scale, and erosion/ulceration) and 2 damage measures (poikiloderma and calcinosis) which are assessed over 15 body areas. In addition, Gottron's papules on the hands are evaluated both for activity and damage. Lastly, the activity of periungual changes and alopecia is assessed.&#xD;
Absence of skin lesions as described above is scored with &quot;0&quot; for each of the above described areas. Skin lesion will be scored with at least &quot;1&quot; (present), some lesions will be graded from &quot;1&quot; (less severe) to &quot;2&quot; (severe); others with &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;. For the total activity score as well as for the total damage score the sub-scores will be added up. The score for total activity ranges from 0 to 100, for total damage from 0 to 32 points. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity or greater disease damage respectively.</description>

If confirmed deterioration (deterioration at 2 consecutive visits) during the First Period, subjects will be switched to the alternate treatment. After response assessment at Week 16, all subjects with no confirmed deterioration during the First Period will continue receiving 2.0 g/kg of Octagam 10% every 4 weeks during the subsequent 6-months open-label Extension Period.

An AE was considered to be associated with the most recent treatment administered, octagam 10% or placebo.

If confirmed deterioration (deterioration at 2 consecutive visits) during the First Period, subjects will be switched to Octagam 10%. After response assessment at Week 16, all subjects with no confirmed deterioration and subjects switched to Octagam 10% due to confirmed deterioration but with not further confirmed deterioration during the First Period will continue to receive 2.0 g/kg of Octagam 10% every 4 weeks during the subsequent 6-months open-label Extension Period. At Week 28, subjects who are stable on 2.0 g/kg Octagam 10% can be switched to 1.0 g/kg Octagam 10%, at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects randomized to placebo and switched to Octagam 10% due to confirmed deterioration, who deteriorate also during Octagam 10% treatment at 2 consecutive visits will drop-out after response assessment at Week 16 and will not enter the Extension Period.</description>
