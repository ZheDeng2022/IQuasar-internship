                  patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can be&#xD;
                  appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This effort&#xD;
                  is continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease features or&#xD;
                  characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes. Therefore, if new&#xD;
                  features are identified after the writing of this protocol, patients can be&#xD;
                  enrolled with the approval of two members of the study committee.&#xD;

             and left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%. For children that are not able to&#xD;
             cooperate with MUGA and echocardiography, such should be clearly stated in the&#xD;
             physician's note.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, FVC ≥ 40% predicted, and absence of O2 requirements. For&#xD;
             children that are not able to cooperate with PFTs, a pulse oximetry with exercise&#xD;
             should be attempted. If neither test can be obtained it should be clearly stated in&#xD;
             the physician's note.&#xD;

             status is defined as Karnofsky score ≥ 70% (≥ 16 years of age) or Lansky score ≥ 50&#xD;
             (pediatrics)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential and males with partners of&#xD;
                  child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control during study&#xD;
