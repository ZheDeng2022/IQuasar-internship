  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study if plasma volume expansion is influenced by the rate at which a colloidal solution&#xD;
      is administered in patients with a systemic inflammatory response induced by major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed postoperatively at the day of surgery with a 1:1 ratio with&#xD;
      no stratification and the study drug will be given as a slow (3 hours) or rapid (30 minutes)&#xD;
      intravenous infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major surgery is one of many triggers of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS),&#xD;
      which disrupts the normal regulation of transcapillary fluid exchange with tissue oedema and&#xD;
      hypovolemia as a consequence. Hypovolemia will amplify the inflammatory reaction by reducing&#xD;
      cardiac output and oxygen delivery, which creates a vicious circle. Fluid therapy is&#xD;
      therefore a cornerstone in the perioperative treatment patients subjected to major surgery.&#xD;
      However, even if fluid therapy is life saving it is also associated with side effects such as&#xD;
      further oedema formation, coagulopathy and further endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical perspective, it is therefore important that the fluid administered to&#xD;
      antagonize hypovolemia as far as possible remains intravascularly. Colloids are&#xD;
      macromolecules for which the vessel wall has a low permeability and proponents of colloid&#xD;
      containing fluids argues that less volume is required for equal plasma volume compared to&#xD;
      crystalloids. However, extravasation of colloids is not only a function of the vessel wall&#xD;
      permeability but is also dependent on the volume of fluid to that is filtered across the&#xD;
      vascular wall, which in turn depends on the trans-capillary hydrostatic pressure. This means&#xD;
      that administration of colloids in a way that minimizes the increase in capillary pressure&#xD;
      could be important for the plasma volume expanding effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In support of this hypothesis is the experimental result that the plasma volume expansion of&#xD;
      a colloidal solution can be affected by the rate of administration (Bark et al., 2013). If&#xD;
      this finding proves to be valid also in a clinical setting, it will be very important for how&#xD;
      colloidal solutions are prescribed in the clinic and may change current clinical practice in&#xD;
      which suspected hypovolemia often is treated with a bolus infusion of fluid. This study&#xD;
      intend to investigate whether these findings can be reproduced after a so-called Whipple's&#xD;
      operation or after major gynaecological cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be studied after these procedures because because they are large and&#xD;
      standardized operations that trigger an inflammatory condition with capillary leakage and&#xD;
      therefore can be considered as a model for major surgical procedures as well as ICU patients&#xD;
      with SIRS triggered by for example sepsis.&#xD;
