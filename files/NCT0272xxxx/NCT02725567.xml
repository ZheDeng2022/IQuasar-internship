      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of ivacaftor treatment, and PK of&#xD;
      ivacaftor and metabolites in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are &lt;24 months of age at&#xD;
      treatment initiation and have an ivacaftor-responsive CF transmembrane conductance regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR) gene mutation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of any illness or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;

             within 2 weeks before Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study involving administration of either an&#xD;
             investigational or a marketed drug within 30 days or 5 terminal half-lives before&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &lt;9.5 g/dL at screening&#xD;
