    <textblock>
      Many people who have had a stroke have problems recovering the use of their affected arm and&#xD;
      these problems may persist for a long time. The investigators' research will test new ways to&#xD;
      boost recovery by using non-painful brain stimulation together with training of arm movements&#xD;
      using basic science principles. The training program will be done using the latest technology&#xD;
      in rehabilitation such as virtual reality and robotics. The investigators will compare three&#xD;
      groups of patients who have had a stroke. Each group will receive different combinations of&#xD;
      brain stimulation and arm training. Another aspect of this proposal is that the investigators&#xD;
      will do the same training programs in three different countries - Canada, Israel and India.&#xD;
      In this way, the investigators will combine knowledge and skills to create training programs&#xD;
      that can be applied anywhere in the world and that are not necessarily limited to high-income&#xD;
      countries. Also, by combining expertise, the investigators will help to build the capacity to&#xD;
      do research in India, a middle-income country that has great potential to contribute new&#xD;
      knowledge to rehabilitation medicine.&#xD;

      Training approaches based on established principles of motor learning and neural plasticity&#xD;
      and non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and&#xD;
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) show promise in modulating brain activity in&#xD;
      order to enhance upper limb (UL) motor recovery. However, the potential for recovery may&#xD;
      still not be attained if training programs do not specifically focus on remediating motor&#xD;
      impairment as defined by motor control science. This project is driven by a major theory of&#xD;
      motor control (Threshold Control Theory) suggesting that rather than directly specifying&#xD;
      motor commands to muscles, descending systems regulate spatial thresholds (STs) of reflexes&#xD;
      to generate and control voluntary movement within specific areas of joint space. In patients&#xD;
      with stroke, ST control is diminished leading to the appearance of muscle spasticity,&#xD;
      weakness and abnormal muscle activation patterns during voluntary movement within&#xD;
      well-defined spatial (angular) zones. The investigators hypothesize that recovery of&#xD;
      voluntary motor control is tightly linked to the recovery of threshold control. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a training program that incorporates personalized tDCS to balance&#xD;
      cortical hypo/hyperexcitability as well as personalized movement arm reaching training based&#xD;
      on the identification of disorders in ST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall objectives of the proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effectiveness of personalized training programs to increase the range of&#xD;
           regulation of STs in the elbow during reaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of repetitive tDCS aimed at inhibiting excessive/exciting&#xD;
           diminished cortical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the feasibility of implementing personalized training programs in high and&#xD;
           low-to-middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients with sub-acute (3 wks-6 mos) stroke will be recruited in this multi-site&#xD;
      international trial taking place in Canada, Israel and India. Participants will have&#xD;
      spasticity in the elbow flexors and/or extensors, with some active elbow control. Each site&#xD;
      will recruit and randomize patients into one of 3 treatment groups. Group 1 will receive tDCS&#xD;
      and practice personalized arm motor training. Group 2 will also receive tDCS with&#xD;
      non-specific practice. Group 3 will receive Sham-tDCS and personalized practice. Training&#xD;
      will consist of the application of tDCS in the first 30 minutes of a 50-minute arm reaching&#xD;
      practice session,, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Primary outcome measures (Pre, Post,&#xD;
      Follow-up) are elbow flexor and extensor STs and related spasticity/active control zones.&#xD;
      Secondary measures are clinical measures of UL motor activity. By accounting for the spatial&#xD;
      structure of motor deficits, our research will benefit both researchers and clinicians by&#xD;
      advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying unimpaired/impaired motor control&#xD;
      and recovery.&#xD;
