  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate, which primarily inhibits thymidylate synthase,&#xD;
      dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase in the&#xD;
      folate-dependent metabolic process. Nowadays, pemetrexed is used to treat malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies&#xD;
      showed that pemetrexed had cytotoxic activity in many kinds of cancers including colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. Erlotinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of EGFR, which was approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib also showed activity to colorectal cancer&#xD;
      cells. Recently, Zhang et al. demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity of pemetrexed and&#xD;
      gefitinib in preclinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, non randomized, open label phase II study, investigators aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pemetrexed and Erlotinib combination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, aged ≥ 19 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologic or cytologic confirmed diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma with metastatic&#xD;
             (STAGE IV) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed KRAS(codon 12 or 13) status&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease is required; prior regimens must include&#xD;
             fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who can swallow oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase(SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 X&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal (≤ 5 times the upper institutional limits of&#xD;
                  normal if hepatic metastases are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal or&#xD;
                  Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of Pemetrexed and Erlotinib on the developing human fetus at the&#xD;
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, female participants of child&#xD;
             bearing potential and male participants whose partner is of child bearing potential&#xD;
             must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the study and for 6&#xD;
             months thereafter. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
             study. Voluntary signed and dated written informed consent form in accordance with&#xD;
             regulatory and institutional guidelines obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol-related procedures not part of normal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment with Pemetrexed and Erlotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Pemetrexed or Erlotinib or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who can not allow the administration of Folic acid or Vitamin B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Past or current history of neoplasm other than colorectal carcinoma with a&#xD;
             disease-free interval of less than 5 years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Systemic chemotherapy within three weeks after the administration of the last before&#xD;
             the test treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major surgical operation or major trauma within 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have had wide-ranged radiotherapy within 4 weeks or limited radiotherapy&#xD;
             within 2 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Persistent toxicity (&gt; CTCAE grade 1) related to previous treatment except for the&#xD;
             hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Breast-feeding or pregnant female&#xD;
