  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal cancer has developed into a serious health problem in China. 80%-90%&#xD;
      patients were detected at middle and later stage. The five-year survival rate for advanced&#xD;
      cancer patients is less than 10%. The main reason of the bad clinical diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      is that the present technical method is difficult to achieve early diagnosis. Endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsy is still the main method for confirming gastrointestinal cancer. But it is limited to&#xD;
      identify early tumors and it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early tumors and the poor&#xD;
      overall therapeutic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endoscopy (CLE) can obtain pathologic information of lesion in real time and&#xD;
      improve the diagnostic rate of early tumors. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy(pCLE)&#xD;
      is a new technology recently. Since its laser probe is applicable to all conventional&#xD;
      endoscopes, pCLE greatly increased its clinical application. However, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      motility has greatly influence on pCLE imaging quality and inspection effect owing to the&#xD;
      poor stability of the small probe manipulation. Scopolamine (654-2, in China) is clinically&#xD;
      used to inhibit bowel peristalsis, but its effect is still not ideal and its side effects are&#xD;
      common.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buscopan can more effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm, and its side effects is fewer.&#xD;
      It has been reported that Buscopan can more effectively relieve gastrointestinal spasm,&#xD;
      facilitate scope insertion and improve patients' comfort during endoscopy.Buscopan may make&#xD;
      the endoscopic physicians to observe easily and effectively improve the diagnostic rate.&#xD;
      Buscopan may effectively inhibit duodenum motility and facilitate the ERCP operation.It has&#xD;
      not been reported in the literature whether Buscopan can be used on pCLE examination to&#xD;
      improve imaging quality and the detection accuracy of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators plan to develop a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      study, the effect of Buscopan on gastrointestinal imaging quality and diagnosis accuracy with&#xD;
      probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, in order to confirm the practical application&#xD;
      value of Buscopan in pCLE examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection, grouping, and operating process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criterion from the volunteers&#xD;
      eligible for this trial who are inpatient or outpatient applying for pCLE examination in the&#xD;
      endoscopy center of Xijing Digestive Disease Hospital. Patients were divided into three&#xD;
      groups: Buscopan (BSP), Scopolamine (654-2) and physiological saline (NS) control group,&#xD;
      according to the ratio of 1:1:1. Operators were blind to random grouping,and patients were&#xD;
      unclear to accept Buscopan, 654-2 or NS drugs before operation. All endoscopy operation&#xD;
      should be completed by clinical experienced endoscopists (WKC or LSH) by using gastroscopy、&#xD;
      colonoscopy and enteroscopy, respectively GIF-H260、CF-H260、SIF-260 (Olympus Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating process: Preoperative preparation are basically the same to conventional&#xD;
      endoscopy.Patients ingested mucosal surface anesthesia and defoaming agent 30 minutes before&#xD;
      endoscopy,and accepted the fluorescein sodium allergy test intravenously (2%, 1 ml) 20&#xD;
      minutes before endoscopy, established venous pathway. Negative patients could accept pCLE&#xD;
      examination. First to use standard white light to observe, to record spasm score,to observe&#xD;
      the lesion. It is administered by endoscopic nurse which is respectively Buscopan (BSP,&#xD;
      20mg), Scopolamine (654-2,10mg), physiological saline (NS), recorded blindly. Then to inject&#xD;
      10% fluorescein sodium 5ml (Guangzhou Baiyun Shan Ming Xing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.)&#xD;
      intravenously,to start button to scan by pCLE. To scan in the order of the back of&#xD;
      endoscopy,to indicate each observation position by pCLE, to do targeted biopsy by pCLE if met&#xD;
      lesion. During the examination,spasm scores (2 minutes,20 minutes after administering drug)&#xD;
      and operation time were recorded. Visual analogue scale (visual field stability and patient&#xD;
      comfort) level was given after the examination. To record whether related complications&#xD;
      happen and positively process. To evaluate the quality of each imaging according to Kiesslich&#xD;
      pCLE image quality analysis method and diagnostic accuracy combining with the pathologic&#xD;
      diagnosis(through the target biopsy, pathological examination, comparative calculation).&#xD;
