  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was mainly aimed to evaluate the efficacy of local administration of enriched bone&#xD;
      marrow mononuclear cells, platelets and zoledronic acid for the clinical prevention of&#xD;
      collapse of the early-stage osteonecrotic femoral head.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common degenerative disease caused by a variety&#xD;
      of factors, such as trauma, alcoholism, use of corticosteroids, and systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus. In ONFH, the overall mechanical properties of the femoral head change over&#xD;
      time, and collapse of the femoral head results in severe pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are numerous strategies for treating ONFH, conservative treatments are often&#xD;
      ineffective. Once collapse of the femoral head occurs, hip replacement is the only option for&#xD;
      ONFH patients. Therefore, it is important to reduce osteonecrotic weakening of the femoral&#xD;
      head in the early stage of ONFH to prevent subsequent head collapse. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity, reduce bone resorption, retain bone trabeculae,&#xD;
      reduce apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and promote new bone formation. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators have chosen to use bisphosphonates for preventing collapse of the osteonecrotic&#xD;
      femoral head. Zoledronic acid is the most potent bisphosphonate for the treatment of ONFH. It&#xD;
      can reduce bone resorption and preserve the shape of the femoral head. In most cases,&#xD;
      bisphosphonates are given intravenously or orally. However, systemic administration is&#xD;
      associated with many complications, including osteonecrosis of the mandible and atypical&#xD;
      femur fractures. As previously reported, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) acts as a drug carrier&#xD;
      to facilitate the local release of zoledronic acid, and it has been found to promote bone&#xD;
      formation and help avoid the complications caused by systemic administration. Using this&#xD;
      method of administration, zoledronic acid can reach locally therapeutic levels, thereby&#xD;
      preventing femoral head collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONFH reduces the viability of bone marrow hematopoietic cells and bone cells to varying&#xD;
      degrees, and can even induce cell death. Adult red bone marrow has two distinct parts; a&#xD;
      hematopoietic section containing hematopoietic stem cells, and a mesenchymal section&#xD;
      containing mesenchymal stem cells that promote bone regeneration. Core decompression&#xD;
      technology can reduce intraosseous pressure, improve venous return, promote revascularization&#xD;
      of the femoral head, and effectively reduce the symptoms of osteonecrosis; however, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy is currently unsatisfactory, probably because of insufficient bone formation and&#xD;
      repair. In recent years, the use of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) has shown good&#xD;
      short-term clinical efficacy in the treatment of ONFH. However, the long-term outcome is&#xD;
      unknown, and it is not known whether combined therapy with platelet-rich plasma may be&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of femoral head collapse in the early stage of ONFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, investigators propose a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of local administration of enriched BMMCs, platelets and zoledronic acid for&#xD;
      preventing femoral head collapse in the early stage of ONFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment During the trial, inspectors will be responsible for monitoring adverse&#xD;
      reactions in the patients. If any adverse reaction is observed during the follow-up, the&#xD;
      patient will be urged to call their doctor for assistance. Predicted complications include&#xD;
      fever, joint pain, joint snapping, joint noise, joint swelling, limited mobility, and itchy&#xD;
      skin. Patients will be urged to inform their family members or close friends to observe for&#xD;
      these symptoms and that they are participating in a clinical trial. If a patient has&#xD;
      questions about participating in this trial, they will be informed how to contact their&#xD;
      doctor. All serious adverse events will be recorded in detail-including the date of&#xD;
      occurrence, duration, treatments, and possible relationships with the therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures-and reported to the research director and the ethics committee within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management All the data will be collected on a case report form,&#xD;
      including demographic information, disease diagnosis, and concomitant diseases. Data will be&#xD;
      recorded electronically using a double-data entry strategy. After the follow-up, all the data&#xD;
      will be checked and locked by the principal investigator. The locked data, which cannot be&#xD;
      modified, will be saved for subsequent analysis. All the data relevant to this clinical trial&#xD;
      will be saved by the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Then, the data will be statistically&#xD;
      analyzed by professional statisticians, and the statistical results will be reported to the&#xD;
      principle investigator who will be responsible for writing the research report. The Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be responsible for data monitoring and management throughout&#xD;
      the entire trial, to ensure scientific accuracy, authenticity, and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be statistically analyzed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY,&#xD;
      USA). Measurement data that are normally distributed will be expressed as mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, minimum value and maximum value. Data that are non-normally distributed will be&#xD;
      expressed as the lower quartile (q1), median and upper quartile (q3). Count data will be&#xD;
      expressed as a percentage (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where appropriate, two-tailed tests will be used, with statistical significance set at P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05. Baseline data will be compared between groups, and statistically analyzed using&#xD;
      two-tailed tests at Î± = 0.05. Count data will be compared between groups using chi-square&#xD;
      test or Fisher exact test. Measurement data will be compared between groups using t-tests,&#xD;
      and nonparametric variables will be compared between groups using the rank sum test.&#xD;
