      This research study is assessing the feasibility of reduced intensity allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a possible treatment for relapsed /&#xD;
      refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the central nervous system (CNS). HSCT is the&#xD;
      transplantation of stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood.&#xD;

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study intervention (allogeneic stem cell transplantation) for this population (patients&#xD;
      with CNS lymphoma), which is a type of stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL) have had high rates of disease relapse after initial therapy. Given these poor outcomes&#xD;
      with conventional chemotherapy, more intense treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been explored, yet relapse remains an issue.&#xD;
      For older patients, ASCT may not be feasible given the inability to tolerate high-doses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with systemic NHL who relapse after ASCT or cannot tolerate ASCT, yet are&#xD;
      responsive to chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplant is often considered. Allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation is thought to work by giving the recipient an entirely new blood system from&#xD;
      a donor. This new blood system includes a new immune system which can hopefully attack any&#xD;
      lymphoma much like it would attack a bacterial or viral infection. Currently, this is one&#xD;
      established standard of care for patients with lymphoma of the body who relapse after initial&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. The investigators are testing if this treatment can be extended to&#xD;
      patients with lymphoma of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following chemotherapy drugs included in this study which will be administered:&#xD;
      Fludarabine, Thiotepa, and Methotrexate. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has&#xD;
      approved these chemotherapy agents individually as a treatment option for your disease. The&#xD;
      combination has not been approved by the FDA. Thiotepa and Methotrexate have been shown to&#xD;
      pass through the blood-brain barrier, a highly selective barrier that restricts many&#xD;
      chemicals from entering the brain and spinal cord. Fludarabine is the backbone chemotherapy&#xD;
      in all reduced intensity conditioning regimens.&#xD;

                  documenting NHL, in conjunction with brain or spinal CT, PET/CT (positron&#xD;

                  monoclonal population by flow cytometry and/or molecular PCR (polymerase chain&#xD;
                  reaction) studies may be eligible if they have radiographic evidence of a CNS&#xD;
                  lymphoma or if they have symptoms clinically consistent with CNS lymphomatous&#xD;
                  involvement; for such cases, please contact the protocol chair, Dr. Yi Bin Chen,&#xD;

             the judgment of the treating physician. Discussion with the PI is encouraged for the&#xD;
             latter scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must demonstrate a partial or complete response (PR or CR) of their&#xD;
             CNS and systemic disease to pre-enrollment therapy and must be in PR or CR at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment. Acceptable therapies include systemic or intrathecal&#xD;
             chemo/immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy as well as corticosteroids.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky score ≥&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin within normal institutional limits (unless patient has&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome, where then direct serum bilirubin should be within normal&#xD;
                  institutional limits).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) / ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3× institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
                  --- OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine level&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40% measured either by echocardiogram or&#xD;
                  nuclear cardiac scan.&#xD;

             (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 by allele level).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 12 months after the date of stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility Criteria for Donors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Donors must be medically fit to donate peripheral blood stem cells through&#xD;
                  standard G-CSF mobilization as assessed by institutional or unrelated marrow&#xD;
                  registry standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Donors will not have to sign a study specific informed consent to participate&#xD;
                  given that donors will be undergoing standard G-CSF mobilization and&#xD;
                  leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the 1st&#xD;
             day of conditioning chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to fludarabine, thiotepa or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because they are routinely&#xD;
             ineligible to be treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
