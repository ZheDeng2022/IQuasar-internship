    <textblock>
      Insulin resistant subjects and type 2 diabetic patients are characterized by a decreased&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility: a reduced capability to switch from fat oxidation in the basal state&#xD;
      to carbohydrate oxidation in the insulin-stimulated state. This metabolic inflexibility is an&#xD;
      early hallmark in the development of diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that a low carnitine&#xD;
      availability may limit acetylcarnitine formation, thereby reducing metabolic flexibility.&#xD;
      Thus, when substrate flux in the muscle is high, acetyl-CoA concentrations increase, leading&#xD;
      to inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and thereby reducing glucose oxidation. The&#xD;
      conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetylcarnitine relieves this acetyl-CoA pressure on PDH. To&#xD;
      provide more direct insight into the effect of carnitine in preventing metabolic&#xD;
      inflexibility and insulin resistance and to further explore the mechanism of action is the&#xD;
      focus of this research. Here, we hypothesize that the capacity to form acetylcarnitine may&#xD;
      rescue lipid-induced insulin resistance. To this end, insulin resistance will be induced by&#xD;
      lipid infusion in healthy volunteers and it will be tested whether carnitine co-infusion can&#xD;
      alleviate insulin resistance.&#xD;

      Rationale: Insulin resistant subjects and type 2 diabetic patients are characterized by a&#xD;
      decreased metabolic flexibility: a reduced capability to switch from fat oxidation in the&#xD;
      basal state to carbohydrate oxidation in the insulin-stimulated state. This metabolic&#xD;
      inflexibility is an early hallmark in the development of diabetes. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that a low carnitine availability may limit acetylcarnitine formation, thereby reducing&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility. Thus, when substrate flux in the muscle is high, acetyl-CoA&#xD;
      concentrations increase, leading to inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and thereby&#xD;
      reducing glucose oxidation. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetylcarnitine relieves this&#xD;
      acetyl-CoA pressure on PDH. To provide more direct insight into the effect of carnitine in&#xD;
      preventing metabolic inflexibility and insulin resistance and to further explore the&#xD;
      mechanism of action is the focus of this research. Here, we hypothesize that the capacity to&#xD;
      form acetylcarnitine may rescue lipid-induced insulin resistance. To this end, insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be induced by lipid infusion in healthy volunteers and it will be tested&#xD;
      whether carnitine co-infusion can alleviate insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objectives are to investigate whether L-carnitine infusion may rescue&#xD;
      lipid-induced insulin resistance and whether L-carnitine infusion is improving metabolic&#xD;
      flexibility in the state of lipid-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, a secondary&#xD;
      objective is to examine the molecular pathways of carnitine and acetylcarnitine, responsible&#xD;
      for muscle insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The current study is an interventional randomized crossover trial in which each&#xD;
      subject serves as it owns control. Subjects will be blinded for the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: n=10, healthy young (18-40 years) male subjects will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Ten healthy subject will be subjected to the intervention of&#xD;
      L-carnitine infusion. To investigate whether L-Carnitine infusion may rescue lipid induced&#xD;
      insulin resistance and improve metabolic flexibility three intervention trials are included.&#xD;
      The first trial includes lipid infusion combined with L-Carnitine infusion (=LIPID + CAR). In&#xD;
      the second trial, L-carnitine infusion will be replaced by placebo infusion in the form of&#xD;
      saline (= LIPID + PLAC) in order to investigate the effect of L-Carnitine. During the third&#xD;
      trial, lipid infusion will be replaced by infusion of saline and will serve as a control for&#xD;
      the lipid infusion (=SALINE + PLAC) and is necessary to investigate to what extend&#xD;
      L-carnitine can rescue lipid induced insulin resistance. All three trials will be separated&#xD;
      by at least one week. Subjects will be blinded, so no information about the infused&#xD;
      substances will be provided to them. The three different trials will be allocated in a random&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study endpoint is whole body insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      maximal acetylcarnitine concentrations after exercise, metabolic compounds in the blood and&#xD;
      measurements regarding skeletal muscle metabolism in skeletal muscle tissue obtained by&#xD;
      needle biopsies.&#xD;
