  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design, pilot, and tweak a series of peer-led group nutrition&#xD;
      sessions for primary care patients aged 6 -12 years who are overweight or obese and who want&#xD;
      to eat healthier and be more active.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the group nutrition sessions, the investigators will give a Fitbit to each of&#xD;
      a parent and child dyad, which will be used to track and motivate their activity. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize an improvement pre-post in children's physical activity levels,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and intentions for physical activity, self-reported consumption of fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables, and child quality of life, and a decrease in consumption of sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages and fast and snack-food, and television (TV)/ videos screen time&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated their satisfaction with the group sessions using a 5 point scale with a score of 1 being complete dissatisfaction and 5 being the greatest satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data were not collected on any participants because we changed the study design based on qualitative participant feedback in pilot phases. Our asking participants about their habits, and showing them their data, was part of the intervention instead of an outcome to assess efficacy of the intervention.</description>

    <measure>PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure Description: PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) is a modular instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better Health-Related Quality of Life.</description>

    <measure>BMI Z-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>BMI Z-scores compares child to age and sex matched peers. A z-score of 0 is the same as a 50th percentile in the reference population, a z-score of ± 1.0 plots at the 15th or 85th percentiles, respectively, and a z-score of ± 2 plots at roughly the 3rd or 97th percentiles. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the reference population whereas positive numbers indicate values higher than the reference population.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self efficacy was assessed using a validated 14-item questionnaire using a 5-point Strongly Agree/ Strongly Disagree scale. The range of values is 1 to 5, with lower values indicating higher self-efficacy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Intention to be Active</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Child intention to be active was assessed with a 1-item questionnaire developed and validated by Saunders et al. This item uses a 5-point scale, with possible range of scores being 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate greater intention to be active.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of 6 nutrition group sessions co-led by parent and a professional from the community who will rotate at each session. Group nutrition sessions will consist of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. Three non-concurrent phases of the study will compare the efficacy of the group sessions when offered biweekly (Arm 1), monthly (Arm 2) and weekly (Arm 3).</description>

Group nutrition sessions consisted of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. This is the first of three non-concurrent phases of the study which sought to compare the feasibility and efficacy of the group sessions when offered biweekly (first phase).Parent and child dyads in each arm and phase received a Fitbit Flex wearable device at the second session.</description>

Group nutrition sessions consisted of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. This is the third of three non-concurrent phases of the study which sought to compare the feasibility of the group sessions when offered weekly (third phase). For phases one and two participants will participate in only one phase. Due to recruitment issues in the third phase, researchers obtained IRB approval to allow participants from previous phases to participate and instead evaluated feasibility outcomes. Parent and child dyads in each arm and phase received a Fitbit Flex wearable device at the second session.</description>

            <title>Biweekly Arm</title>
            <description>The intervention consisted of 6 nutrition group sessions co-led by parent and a professional from the community who rotated at each session. Group nutrition sessions consisted of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. This is the first of three non-concurrent phases of the study which sought to compare the feasibility and efficacy of the group sessions when offered biweekly (first phase).Parent and child dyads in each arm and phase received a Fitbit Flex wearable device at the second session.</description>

            <description>The intervention consisted of 6 nutrition group sessions co-led by parent and a professional from the community who rotated at each session. Group nutrition sessions consisted of a facilitated discussion of benefits and barriers to healthy eating, a short lesson led by the content expert, and a fun game or activity to reinforce the lesson. This is the third of three non-concurrent phases of the study which sought to compare the feasibility of the group sessions when offered weekly (third phase). For phases one and two participants will participate in only one phase. Due to recruitment issues in the third phase, researchers obtained IRB approval to allow participants from previous phases to participate and instead evaluated feasibility outcomes. Parent and child dyads in each arm and phase received a Fitbit Flex wearable device at the second session.</description>
