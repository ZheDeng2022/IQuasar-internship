      A computer-assisted solution for acromioplasty is presented. The software allows surgeons to&#xD;
      better plan the surgical procedure by visualizing dynamic simulation of the patient's&#xD;
      shoulder joint during everyday activities. Impingements are dynamically detected and the&#xD;
      exact location and amount of bone to be resected is precisely computed. As a result, the&#xD;
      success of the acromioplasty does not only rely on the surgeon's experience or previous&#xD;
      recommendations, but on quantitative data. Although the clinical validation of this 3D&#xD;
      planning support is currently under evaluation, it may allow to recover more effectively&#xD;
      postoperative joint mobility, to get a better relationship with pain and a better healing&#xD;
      rate of the rotator cuff tendons.&#xD;

      Introduction Subacromial impingement of the rotator cuff between the anterior [1] or lateral&#xD;
      acromion [2] and the superior humeral head is a common disorder. This condition arises when&#xD;
      the subacromial space height is too narrow during active elevation or scaption of the arm&#xD;
      above shoulder level due to an abnormal hooked shape or large lateral extension of the&#xD;
      acromion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In severe cases of impingement syndrome, an arthroscopic acromioplasty surgery is usually&#xD;
      performed to resect the different area of the acromion causing damage to the subacromial&#xD;
      structures. The exact location and the amount of bone to be resected is generally left to the&#xD;
      unique appreciation of the orthopedic surgeon during surgery. To improve the precision of&#xD;
      this resection, surgeons could greatly benefit from a surgical planning solution that aims at&#xD;
      providing precise information about the surgical procedure. Moreover, since subacromial&#xD;
      impingements are the result of a dynamic mechanism, an effective planning solution should&#xD;
      analyze both the morphological joint's structures and its dynamic behavior during shoulder&#xD;
      movements to fully apprehend the patient joint's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-assisted planning solution &quot;ArthroPlanner&quot; for acromioplasty is nowadays available.&#xD;
      The solution allows to perform standard morphological bony measurements, as well as 3D&#xD;
      simulations of the patient's joint during everyday shoulder activities. The software computes&#xD;
      the precise bone resection (location and amount) based on detected subacromial impingements&#xD;
      during motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study was thus to compare clinical and radiological results of superior&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair with or without computer-assisted planning. The hypothesis was that&#xD;
      preoperative planning of acromioplasty would allowed more accurate bone resection, would&#xD;
      decrease postoperative impingements and consequently improved postoperative range of motion&#xD;
      and tendon healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We reconstruct the bones of the patient's shoulder joint (scapula and humerus from the&#xD;
      humeral head to the mid-shaft) from a CT image using Mimics software (Materialise NV, Leuven,&#xD;
      Belgium). The bones are then imported into ArthroPlanner software and the following steps are&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, generic bone models are produced using a template fitting approach that deforms a bone&#xD;
      template with an optimized topology (one for the scapula and one for humerus) to the&#xD;
      reconstructed bone. This allows us in the next steps to exploit anatomical correspondences&#xD;
      and to automatize landmarks and points selection on the mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, biomechanical parameters are computed to permit motion description of the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint. The glenohumeral joint center is automatically calculated by a sphere&#xD;
      fitting technique [3] that fits a sphere to the humeral head using the points of the proximal&#xD;
      humerus model. Bone coordinate systems are established for the scapula and humerus. based on&#xD;
      the definitions suggested by the International Society of Biomechanics [4] using anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks defined on the bone models. Missing landmarks such as the lateral and medial&#xD;
      epicondyles are identified on the CT image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, morphological measurements are performed to analyze individual shoulder anatomy. The&#xD;
      Critical Shoulder Angle [5] and the β angle [6] are calculated, as they are criteria&#xD;
      associated with rotator cuff tears. The angles are computed in 3D based on bony landmarks and&#xD;
      can be, if necessary, interactively adjusted by the user by manipulating 3D handles in the&#xD;
      viewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth, motion is applied at each time step to the humerus model with real-time evaluation of&#xD;
      impingement. The minimum humero-acromial distance that is typically used for the evaluation&#xD;
      of subacromial impingement is measured [7]. This distance is calculated in millimeters based&#xD;
      on the simulated bones models positions. A color scale is also used to map the variations of&#xD;
      distance on the scapula surface (red color = minimum distance, other colors = areas of&#xD;
      increased distance). Given the thickness of the potential impinged tissues, subacromial&#xD;
      impingement is considered when the computed humero-acromial distance is &lt; 6 mm, as suggested&#xD;
      in the literature [7]. To test a wide variability of realistic movements, a motion database&#xD;
      of daily activities (e.g., cross arm, comb hair) is used in addition to standard kinematic&#xD;
      sequences (e.g., elevation, scaption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the acromial resection plan is defined based on the 3D simulation results. A color&#xD;
      map is used to represent areas where impingements occurred between the acromion and humerus&#xD;
      (Fig. 1D). The red color denotes the area with the smallest humero-acromial distance computed&#xD;
      over the different motion simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results at each step of the planning procedure are carefully validated by the user before&#xD;
      continuing to the next ones. At the end of the planning, a PDF report is generated that&#xD;
      contains patient's information and the measurements performed. The bones and the simulation&#xD;
      data are also exported to be used in a simple 3D viewer (Fig. 2) dedicated to the surgeon.&#xD;
      With this viewer, the surgeon is able to play all simulations, observe impingements&#xD;
      dynamically and review the resection plan.&#xD;
