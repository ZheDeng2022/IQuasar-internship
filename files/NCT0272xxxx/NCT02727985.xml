      The primary purpose of this study is to compare opioid use post-spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      implant at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month intervals in patients who were provided with a weaning&#xD;
      schedule by the Neuromodulation team (experimental group) versus those who wean on their own&#xD;
      or with their family doctor (control group; standard care) to determine if one strategy is&#xD;
      superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to further characterize change in opioid use as it relates&#xD;
      to pain scores, quality of life and disability from baseline to follow-up assessments. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine changes in opioid-related adverse events and medication costs to&#xD;
      help understand the impact of opioid weaning on the patient and the system. The investigators&#xD;
      will also compare worker's compensation patients with non-worker compensation patients to see&#xD;
      if they follow the same result pattern.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neuromodulation clinic in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region currently provides service&#xD;
      to 501 patients with 266 of those being spinal cord stimulation (SCS) cases. There is an&#xD;
      average of 30 new SCS cases per year with the majority of those being implanted for&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral leg pain with or without low back pain. All patients are done via a&#xD;
      two-step process consisting of an initial trial with an externalized electrode for a 1-2 week&#xD;
      trial period. At the end of the trial period, if successful, the patient undergoes the&#xD;
      internalization procedure. Our goal during the trial period is to achieve a pain reduction of&#xD;
      50% or more. Our mean success rates for trial to implant are approximately 80%. After the&#xD;
      internalization procedure, patients are instructed to slowly begin weaning their pain&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is scant data discussing the effect of SCS systems on medication use and particularly,&#xD;
      opioids. To date, pain medication weaning has been largely left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      patient with no formalized system for oversight. This has resulted in poor rates of reduction&#xD;
      of opioid consumption in spite of improved pain relief achieved with SCS. In addition, should&#xD;
      a patient have a successful SCS trial and move on to the permanent implant, how do we break&#xD;
      them of their dependence on opioids? Some patients have a good relationship with their family&#xD;
      physician and will rely on him/her to help wean them off the opioids. Others feel that they&#xD;
      can manage weaning on their own (self-management). As intensity of pain improves along with&#xD;
      quality of life, pain medication consumption should decrease in tandem without jeopardizing&#xD;
      pain control. However, a lack of adherence by the patient or family physician would interfere&#xD;
      with this process. The current standard of care is for the patient and their family physician&#xD;
      to decide the best weaning process. The investigators propose that having a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Neuromodulation team with a dedicated pharmacist who can draw up a patient specific weaning&#xD;
      schedule and follow the patient closely would more effectively reduce opioid consumption than&#xD;
      patient (self-management) or family physician-aided weaning alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of this Study Chronic pain is estimated to cost the Canadian health care system $6&#xD;
      billion per year according to the Canadian Pain Society with this number expected to continue&#xD;
      to rise. SCS systems have been proven to be more cost effective than conventional medical&#xD;
      management for chronic pain patients. Increased use of SCS systems would help to decrease the&#xD;
      burden on our health care dollars. In addition, the added risk of long term opioid use leads&#xD;
      to issues of tolerance, physical dependence and potential adverse effects including overdose.&#xD;
      Social concerns regarding opioid divergence and inappropriate use must also be taken into&#xD;
      account. The goal for this project is to further strengthen the support for the use of SCS&#xD;
      and provide information on the most effective way to decrease opioid use among the chronic&#xD;
      pain population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Purpose and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare opioid use post-SCS implant at 1, 3, 6, 9 and&#xD;
      12 month intervals in patients who were provided with a weaning schedule by the&#xD;
      Neuromodulation team (experimental group) versus those who wean on their own or with their&#xD;
      family doctor (control group; standard care) to determine if one strategy is superior to the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to further characterize change in opioid use as it relates&#xD;
      to pain scores, quality of life and disability from baseline to follow-up assessments. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine changes in opioid-related adverse events and medication costs to&#xD;
      help understand the impact of opioid weaning on the patient and the system. The investigators&#xD;
      will also compare worker's compensation patients with non-worker compensation patients to see&#xD;
      if they follow the same result pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that administration of a patient- specific opioid weaning schedule by&#xD;
      a pain-specific pharmacist will produce a greater reduction in opioid use in SCS patients&#xD;
      post-implant compared to self-management/ family physician-assisted weaning schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Population &amp; Setting The study has a prospective, randomized, partial-crossover&#xD;
      design. The estimated study recruitment duration will be a total of 2.5 years. Individual&#xD;
      patient follow up will continue for 12 months post SCS-implant, for a total duration of 3.5&#xD;
      years.The study will take place in one site at the Regina General Hospital in Regina, SK. The&#xD;
      study will initially enroll 150 patients who have been approved for and consented for SCS,&#xD;
      currently taking opioid medications for pain control, who are willing to undergo opioid&#xD;
      weaning. They also must be willing to be randomized to the Neuromodulation clinic weaning&#xD;
      schedule group or the Self/Family Physician managed weaning group. The Self/Family Physician&#xD;
      managed weaning group will experience standard care for the duration of the study. At the&#xD;
      6-month follow-up, participants in the control group will be allowed to cross over to the&#xD;
      experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility once they have been consented for an SCS procedure.&#xD;
      Screening will be done by the study coordinators (Neuromodulation clinic staff) during a&#xD;
      regular scheduled appointment at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study, they will be&#xD;
      approached by the study coordinator for informed consent. Once consent is provided, all&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete the baseline assessment of medication use, pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, disability and sleep patterns. (see section 6.0). A letter will be sent to&#xD;
      the patient's family physician informing him/her that their patient is participating in the&#xD;
      study. If they are in the experimental group, the physician will be informed that the patient&#xD;
      will be following an opioid weaning schedule developed and followed up by the Neuromodulation&#xD;
      clinic. For the control group, the physician will be informed about the study, but the&#xD;
      hypothesis and patient allocation group will be concealed so as not to bias standard of care&#xD;
      for weaning in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After consent is obtained and prior to SCS implantation, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the experimental or control group using a computerized random number&#xD;
      generator to allocate patients in a 1:1 ratio to the experimental group (Neuromodulation&#xD;
      clinic weaning schedule) or control group (Self/Family physician weaning schedule). The&#xD;
      randomization sequence table will be generated by a biostatistician in the Regina Qu'Appelle&#xD;
      Health Region (RQHR). The group allocation for each patient will be sent to the study&#xD;
      coordinator in sealed, opaque sequentially numbered envelopes to be opened after patients&#xD;
      have been enrolled in the study. At this time, it is not feasible to randomly assign patients&#xD;
      to a self-management weaning or to their family physician, therefore the investigators are&#xD;
      comparing the experimental group to standard care. If possible, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform a subgroup analysis to see if there are any differences between the self-management&#xD;
      or family physician weaning individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The surgeon and Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist will be blind to allocation of&#xD;
      patients to the experimental or control group. Any updates to the schedule that are required&#xD;
      for patients in the experimental group will be performed by the Neuromodulation clinic&#xD;
      pharmacist. As part of current routine care, the pharmacist will sometimes modify patient's&#xD;
      schedules. The patient won't be directly identified as a study participant. The patient will&#xD;
      not be blinded as they will have direct interaction with their weaning schedule and&#xD;
      physicians. The family physician for patients in the experimental group will not be blind,&#xD;
      but will be asked to allow the Neuromodulation clinic to handle the opioid weaning. The&#xD;
      physicians for the control group will not be told the patient's allocation but may guess the&#xD;
      group so there will not be true blinding. Participants will be asked not to disclose their&#xD;
      study group when interacting with the Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist. The statistician&#xD;
      analyzing the data will be blinded to the group allocation until after the initial analyses&#xD;
      are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation Clinic Weaning Schedule &amp; Amendments The Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist&#xD;
      will develop a weaning schedule for all patients enrolled in the study to ensure there is no&#xD;
      bias in the generation of the schedule for the experimental group. However, schedules will&#xD;
      not be given to the control participants. Schedules will be individualized taking into&#xD;
      account the amount of opioid, duration of opioid use, other adjunctive medications, and&#xD;
      specific variables related to the patient. Amendments to the schedules will occur on follow&#xD;
      up. Amendments will be written up and submitted to the Neuromodulation nurse who is not&#xD;
      blinded. Only patients in the experimental group will have their amendments forwarded to both&#xD;
      themselves and their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Approximately 50 patients per year are referred for either spinal cord or&#xD;
      peripheral SCS implant in the RQHR. The investigators plan to approach all patients that meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria for a period of 2.5 years to enroll 150 patients with an&#xD;
      expected attrition rate of 20% during the internalization period and 20% during the&#xD;
      follow-up, leaving a final sample of 100 patients for analysis.Based on minimally clinically&#xD;
      significant effects, to observe a reduction in number of opioid medications from baseline to&#xD;
      6-month follow-up, a sample size of 100 patients would be sufficient to detect a mean&#xD;
      difference of 2 medications with a standard deviation of 5 with 80% power. To detect a 20%&#xD;
      increase in the experimental group in the proportion of patients that reach a 30% reduction&#xD;
      in opioid dose from baseline to 6 month follow-up compared to the control group, at least 93&#xD;
      participants would be needed with 80% power.&#xD;
