  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized, and controlled phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial. The investigators hope to figure out the better chemotherapy regimen for the&#xD;
      post-EGFR-TKI failure setting. The primary objective of this trial is to compare&#xD;
      progression-free survival without grade 4 (G4PFS) toxicities between pemetrexed-cisplatin and&#xD;
      single-agent pemetrexed treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include stage IIIB/IV EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients who got disease&#xD;
      progression after front-line EGFR TKI treatment.Eligible patients will be randomized to 2&#xD;
      arms. Patients in arm A will receive 4 cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2, d1) and pemetrexed (500&#xD;
      mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks, those without disease progression (PD) and being tolerable judged&#xD;
      by investigator will continue single-agent pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks as&#xD;
      maintenance until progression or intolerable toxicities. Patients in arm B will receive&#xD;
      pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks until PD or intolerable toxicities.&#xD;

      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized, and controlled phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include stage IIIB/IV EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC patients who got&#xD;
      disease progression after frontline EGFR-TKI treatment. Clinical staging is determined&#xD;
      according to the routine protocol, which includes enhanced chest CT scans, abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasonography or CT scans, brain MRI or CT, and bone scintigraphy. Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/CT scan is optional. Measurement of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is&#xD;
      based on Jackman criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to 2 arms. Patients in arm A will receive 4 cycles of&#xD;
      cisplatin (75 mg/m2, d1) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks, those without disease&#xD;
      progression (PD) and being tolerable judged by investigator will continue single-agent&#xD;
      pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks as maintenance until progression or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicities. Patients in arm B will receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, d1) every 3 weeks until PD&#xD;
      or intolerable toxicities. All patients will be administrated with vitamin B12 and folic acid&#xD;
      supplement (vitamin B12 1mg intramuscular injection at least 7 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
      of pemetrexed and repeated approximately every 9 weeks during pemetrexed treatment till 22&#xD;
      days after the last dose of pemetrexed; folic acid 0.5 mg orally administered once daily from&#xD;
      at least 7 days prior to the first dose of pemetrexed till 22 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      pemetrexed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy data will be analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT) population using all randomized&#xD;
      patients, and safety data will be evaluated using CTCAE v4.0 criteria for patients who&#xD;
      received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment. If the criteria for drug administration (absolute&#xD;
      neutrophil count ≥1500/μl, platelets ≥100 000/μl, creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min, no grade&#xD;
      ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity [except for alopecia]) were not met, drug administration have to&#xD;
      be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. If a delay of more than 42 days due to&#xD;
      toxicity was necessary, the patient will be discontinued from the study. Dose adjustments&#xD;
      according to hematologic toxicity at the start of a subsequent cycle of the therapy will be&#xD;
      based on platelet and neutrophil nadir counts from the preceding cycle. Granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor is allowed to use for neutropenia event. Patients will be&#xD;
      discontinued from study treatment for the following reasons: disease progression;&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities; patient's refusal to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological examinations (according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria) at baseline will be repeated&#xD;
      for tumor response evaluation following every two cycles of chemotherapy. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up to 30 days after the last dose of study chemotherapy, and then every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples [8ml with ehylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant each time]&#xD;
      will be collected at the time of baseline, tumor response evaluation every 2 cycles, and&#xD;
      disease progression. Blood samples at baseline and disease progression are mandatory to be&#xD;
      provided. Tumor samples collection at the time of baseline and/or disease progression is&#xD;
      strongly recommended but not mandatory for this study.&#xD;
