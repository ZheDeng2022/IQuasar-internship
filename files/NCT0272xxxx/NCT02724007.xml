      Classification of Disease Injury Severity Score (ICISS) in adult trauma patients admitted to&#xD;
      four public university hospitals in urban India.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma causes 10% of the world's annual deaths. Trauma-related deaths are most common in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries, which accounts for over 90% of global trauma mortality. In 2013&#xD;
      over 1.2 million trauma deaths occurred in India alone. Hence, India accounted for 25% of&#xD;
      trauma-related deaths worldwide. Experiences from high income countries show that the&#xD;
      establishment of trauma registers have been of importance for the improvement of trauma care&#xD;
      and research, allowing for comparisons between different hospitals as well as over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be useful such comparisons should be risk-adjusted to account for differences in care and&#xD;
      patient case mix. In trauma one of the most important patient case mix characteristics to&#xD;
      adjust for is injury severity. Several different injury severity scores exist for this&#xD;
      purpose. One of these scores is the International Classification of Disease Injury Severity&#xD;
      Score (ICISS). In contrast to other established scores, such as the Injury Severity Score&#xD;
      (ISS), ICISS can be calculated based on injuries coded using ICD for administrative purposes,&#xD;
      making it cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of ICISS has primarily been studied in high-income countries ICISS requires an&#xD;
      empirically estimated Survival Risk Ratio (SRR) for each ICD code. Some studies from high&#xD;
      income countries has shown similar predictive performance of ICISS when using SRRs derived&#xD;
      from other high-income countries. However, the generalisability of such SRRs to low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries such as India has not been researched. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to validate an international version of ICISS in patients presenting with trauma to&#xD;
      four public university hospitals in urban India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from a multi-centre cohort study will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO) in India project will be used,&#xD;
      which was conducted at four public university hospitals in urban India. The four centres were&#xD;
      Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Mumbai, King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai,&#xD;
      Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center in Delhi, and the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical&#xD;
      Education and Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital in Kolkata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected between October 2013 and September 2015. Patient data was collected by one&#xD;
      project officer in every study center. The project officer worked eight hour shifts per day,&#xD;
      with a rotating schedule between day and night shifts. All project officers had at least a&#xD;
      health science master degree, and were continuously trained and supervised by project&#xD;
      management. Details on the data collection process has been published elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were identified by project officers through direct observation in the&#xD;
      emergency room and/or through extraction from patient records. Data from patients admitted&#xD;
      outside of the shifts was collected retrospectively within days. Patients were followed up&#xD;
      until discharge, death, or 30 days, whichever occurred first. Patients transferred to other&#xD;
      hospitals were considered as discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The explanatory variable will be ICISS. Other covariates include age, sex, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, mode of transportation and transfer status. These covariates will be used to&#xD;
      characterise the study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources/measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcomes was followed up at 30 days, death in hospital or discharge, whichever&#xD;
      occurred first. Patients discharged alive before 30 days were considered to be alive at 30&#xD;
      days after arrival to the hospital. ICISS will be assigned based on ICD-coding of the free&#xD;
      text injury descriptions, using the 10th revision of the World Health Organization's&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Survival Risk Ratios from two published&#xD;
      data sets will be used. One of the data sets had SRRs calculated from an Australian and New&#xD;
      Zealand population (14). The other had SRRs created by pooling data from Australia,&#xD;
      Argentina, Austria, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden (12). Final ICISS for patients&#xD;
      with multiple injuries will be calculated by multiplying the SRRs for all ICD codes assigned&#xD;
      to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients matching the selection criteria will be included in the study. All data was&#xD;
      collected from patient records and examinations done by hospital personnel with no&#xD;
      association to the study. The data collectors worked independently form the project managers.&#xD;
      The free text injury descriptions will be extracted from the data set and assigned ICD-codes&#xD;
      with no other data available, including data on patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required is calculated to give an 80% power to detect substantial differences&#xD;
      in model performance such as 1.5 times too high or low predicted survival probability. The&#xD;
      calculations were based on published recommendations on the sample size needed to detect such&#xD;
      differences in the external validity of prediction models with a binary outcome. Based on&#xD;
      these recommendations, the sample size needed to include 100 consecutive events, i.e.&#xD;
      in-hospital deaths within 24 hours and all non-events enrolled during the same period, was&#xD;
      calculated. In-hospital mortality within 24 hours was used for the sample size calculation to&#xD;
      power the study for secondary outcomes as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      All quantitative variables will be analysed as continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      R will be used for all statistical analyses. A confidence level of 95% and a significance&#xD;
      level of 5% will be used. For each patient one ICISS will be calculated for each of the two&#xD;
      sets of SRR referenced above. Henceforth, the ICISS based on SRR from Australia and New&#xD;
      Zealand will be denoted ICISS-ANZ, and the ICISS based on the international SRR derived by&#xD;
      Gedeborg et al. will be denoted ICISS-I. The performance of ICISS-ANZ and ICISS-I in&#xD;
      predicting death within 30 days and death within 24 hours will be estimated in terms of&#xD;
      discrimination and calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) will be used as a&#xD;
      measure of discrimination. Calibration will be assessed visually by plotting observed versus&#xD;
      predicted outcomes and will be quantified by calculating a calibration slope. The main&#xD;
      analysis will be a complete case analysis in which only patients with complete data on&#xD;
      outcomes and covariates will be included. Both ICISS-ANZ and ICISS-I will be based only on&#xD;
      SRR calculated from ICD-10 codes that occurred in at least 20 patients in respective&#xD;
      derivation dataset. Patients without any injury reported will be assigned an ICISS of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses Four sensitivity analyses will be conducted. The first sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis will include patients with missing data on covariates but with complete outcome&#xD;
      data. The second sensitivity analysis will exclude patients without any reported injury. The&#xD;
      third sensitivity analysis will include all SRR regardless of the number of occurrences in&#xD;
      the original derivation datasets. In the final sensitivity analysis the ICISS for each&#xD;
      patient will be based only on unique ICD-10 codes, in other words, each ICD-10 code was only&#xD;
      allowed to contribute one SRR to ICISS even if it occurred more than once in the same&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
