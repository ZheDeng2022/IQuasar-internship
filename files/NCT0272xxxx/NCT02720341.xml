      Consideration-of-Concept Trial (stage 1) on robotic therapy of the upper extremity with the&#xD;
      ARMin therapy robot in healthy subjects and patients with neurological disease (e.g. stroke,&#xD;
      spinal cord injury)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) need long-term neurorehabilitative therapy of the&#xD;
      arm with often limited, unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even&#xD;
      alternative for neurorehabilitative training. Investigators aim at developing a unique&#xD;
      intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training strategy of the arm. The exoskeleton&#xD;
      robot ARMin will be further developed to adapt software components accordingly. The goal is&#xD;
      to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is&#xD;
      meaningful for the individual patient. It can be intensified by different strategies that&#xD;
      will be evaluated alone and in combination. These strategies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      strength training an error-amplification strategy increased number of repetitions&#xD;
      multisensory feedback multiplayer approach&#xD;
