      Background Women with rare diseases resulting in motor disabilities wishing to become mother&#xD;
      face a major challenge. The investigators hypothesize that provided with adequate support,&#xD;
      they are able to achieve a successful pregnancy and to offer their child a safe family&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods To test this hypothesis, the investigators shall conduct a prospective observational&#xD;
      prospective survey of a consecutive series of volunteer pregnant women or mothers of children&#xD;
      less than 14 months, with motor impairment, participating in a program of parenting support&#xD;
      developed in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: social environment, child development, mother-infant attachment, mother-&#xD;
      infant interactions Secondary outcome: social and demographic characteristics, severity of&#xD;
      motor impairment, associated impairment, perinatal morbidity for the mother and the infant&#xD;
      (composite indicator), emotional status, and the needs expressed by women regarding the level&#xD;
      of medical or social care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The investigators shall describe the distribution of the primary outcome&#xD;
      measurements in the subgroup of women with motor impairment related to a rare disease. The&#xD;
      investigators shall compare this distribution to the expected distribution in the general&#xD;
      population, and to that observed in women with motor impairment unrelated to a rare disease.&#xD;
      The investigators shall also study primary outcome measurements as a function of the severity&#xD;
      of maternal disability, of the mother's social characteristics and emotional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall also describe the distribution the distribution of perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity globally, and as a function of the potential explanatory variables mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall also report on the opinion of women regarding the support they were&#xD;
      offered so far, and the support they declare they should benefit from.&#xD;

      Background Women with motor disabilities have the same well-founded desire to become a mother&#xD;
      as other women. Despite dedicated aids and adapted supportive measures, they face social&#xD;
      blame from persons who believe they are not apt to provide adequate care to their children.&#xD;
      When a rare disease caused the disability, planning to become a mother is even more critical,&#xD;
      since most perinatal care providers are unfamiliar with the condition, and specialists of the&#xD;
      disease are unfamiliar with pregnancy. Unsurprisingly, data on motherhood in women with rare&#xD;
      diseases resulting in motor impairment are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institutions of the investigators run a joint care program dedicated to future parents&#xD;
      and parents with disabilities, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hôpital Universitaire Pitié Salpêtrière- Charles Foix (assistance Publique Hôpitaux de&#xD;
           Paris and Université Paris 6), providing a gynecological and perinatal unit with care&#xD;
           programs adapted to women with disabilities, plus a number of reference centers for rare&#xD;
           neurologic and muscular diseases including research and clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Service d'Aide à la Parentalité des Personnes en Situation de Handicap (SAPPH, Fondation&#xD;
           Hospitalière Sainte Marie) providing training and support to parenthood to persons with&#xD;
           motor or sensory disabilities. This training program aims at recognizing parental&#xD;
           capacities, and if necessary enhancing them by information, training, adapting the&#xD;
           environment, or seeking extra human help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators felt the need to evaluate the outcome of our program, in terms of quality&#xD;
      of infant environment, development, attachment, and interactions with their disabled mother.&#xD;
      The investigators focused on parenthood in women with a rare disease resulting in motor&#xD;
      impairment, a research field remaining largely unexplored so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that when provided with a specific care program, mothers with&#xD;
      motor impairment due to a rare disease and their partners have the capacity to offer their&#xD;
      children appropriate social environment and care, resulting in child development,&#xD;
      mother-infant attachment, and mother- infant interactions being similar to what one would&#xD;
      expect in women without motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Primary objective To describe social environment, child development, mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment, mother- infant interactions, when the mother has motor impairment due du a rare&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe maternal and perinatal outcome when the mother has motor impairment due du a&#xD;
           rare disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore a potential relation between the outcome criteria of the primary goal with&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The severity of motor impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The causal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The personal history of the mother including her access to adapted care prior to&#xD;
                pregnancy during pregnancy and post-partum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The social status of the family&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The emotional status of the mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the distribution of primary goal outcome criteria in our study population to&#xD;
           what is expected in the general population, when appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the distribution of primary goal outcome criteria in our study population to&#xD;
           what we observed in women with motor impairment that does not result from a rare disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe the needs expressed by women regarding medical care, psychological, social,&#xD;
           and environmental support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria Please see specific box&#xD;
&#xD;

      of impairment and handicap Maternal emotional status Needs expressed by women regarding&#xD;
      medical care, psychological, social, and environmental support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Pre inclusion: written and verbal information on the study to all women with&#xD;

      required for all outcome criteria concerning the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research visits will take place during usual visits of our parenthood support and training&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
