    <textblock>
      Subjects aged 18-85 with lung disease will undergo hyperpolarized Xenon 129 (129-Xe) MRI and&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function testing for the development of tools to evaluate the Apparent Diffusion&#xD;
      Coefficient (ADC) and ventilation defect volume obtained by analysis of hyperpolarized 129-Xe&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Briefly, during a one to two hour visit, subjects will provide written informed consent and&#xD;
      then undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. brief medical history and vital signs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. full pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. proton MRI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. spin-density and/or diffusion weighted 129Xe MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full pulmonary function tests including spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Airwave Oscillometry (AO) will be&#xD;
      performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. MedGraphics Elite Series,&#xD;
      MedGraphics Corporation. St. Paul, Minnesota USA and/or nDD EasyOne Spirometer, nDD Medical&#xD;
      Technologies Inc. Andover, Massachusetts USA will be used. All measurements will be performed&#xD;
      in the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at Robarts Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be placed in the 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner with the 129Xe chest coil&#xD;
      fitted over their torso and chest. Hearing protection will be provided to each subject to&#xD;
      muffle the noise produced by the gradient radiofrequency (RF) coils. A pulse oximeter lead&#xD;
      will be attached to all of the subjects to monitor their heart rate and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      MRI will be performed for up to a period of 30 minutes. All subjects will have supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen available via nasal cannula at a flow-rate of 2 liters per minute as a precaution in&#xD;
      the event of oxygen desaturation.&#xD;

    <description>Hyperpolarized noble gas imaging using Xenon-129 has been used to explore structural and functional relationships in the lung in patients with lung disease and healthy controls. In contrast to proton-based MRI imaging, 129Xe gas is used as a contrast agent to directly visualize the airways, and thus ventilation. Whereas the normal density of gas is too low to produce an easily detectable signal, this is overcome by artificially increasing the amount of polarization per unit volume using optical pumping.</description>
