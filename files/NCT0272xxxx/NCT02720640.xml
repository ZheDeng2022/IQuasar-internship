    <textblock>
      The aim of this single-centre study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Retina&#xD;
      Implant Alpha AMS (Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany) in participants with severe visual&#xD;
      impairment secondary to outer retinal degeneration caused by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The&#xD;
      study is sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the National Institute for&#xD;
      Health Research (UK).&#xD;

      The specific research questions are, i) can the implant partially restore vision to an eye&#xD;
      with no light perception and ii) what are the safety implications for the ocular and&#xD;
      periorbital tissues of the implanted eye? In advanced RP the light detecting photoreceptor&#xD;
      cells of the retina degenerate slowly over time, and may eventually lead to blindness. The&#xD;
      subretinal implant replaces the degenerate photoreceptor layer and stimulates the residual&#xD;
      overlying healthy retinal layers in response to a light stimulus. These signals are then&#xD;
      carried on to the brain along the normal visual pathway. Investigators are seeking to recruit&#xD;
      six participants who fulfill the eligibility criteria, which include advanced RP with no&#xD;
      useful light perception vision in the eye to receive the implant. Participants must be aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 70 years old, be highly motivated, and be well enough for a general&#xD;
      anaesthetic. The eye must have also had cataract surgery. The project will be conducted at&#xD;
      the Oxford Eye Hospital. Those participants selected to receive the implant will be followed&#xD;
      for 12 months from the date of surgery. Between week 1 and month 12 there will be at least 7&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visits for a range of visual tests and eye assessments. After 12 months the&#xD;
      trial will officially end, however investigators will continue to review all research&#xD;
      participants in clinic as would be standard care for a patient with RP. The implant may be&#xD;
      removed at any stage e.g. when it ceases to function or at the participant's request.&#xD;
