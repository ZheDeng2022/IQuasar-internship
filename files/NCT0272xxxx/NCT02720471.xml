      Clinical study, comparative, prospective, interventional, randomized, single-center,&#xD;
      single-blind The fast resumption of the walking after surgery of total prosthesis of hip&#xD;
      (PTH) requires an effective analgesia from the immediate post-operative period. In France,&#xD;
      whatever is the peroperative anesthesia, the analgesic reference technique is a locoregional&#xD;
      anesthesia (ALR) ultrasound guidance by blocks of the femoral and cutaneous nerves side of&#xD;
      the thigh. In the Anglo-Saxon countries, in particular in Australia and in the United States,&#xD;
      the techniques of peroperative infiltration of local anesthetics (IAL) by the surgeon&#xD;
      supplanted the techniques of traditional ALR. However, no French study compares the IAL with&#xD;
      the conventional ALR with a rigorous methodology. Our occasional practice of IAL suggests us&#xD;
      that it is more effective in terms of post-operative analgesia with Analog Visual Scales&#xD;
      decreased (EVA) and a lesser consumption of morphine. Furthermore, the resumption of the&#xD;
      upright posture in bipedal support as well as the resumption of the walking would be earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to show that the post-operative analgesia by local peroperative&#xD;
      infiltration is superior to that obtained by locoregional anesthesia (ALR by femoral block&#xD;
      associated with a side cutaneous block of the thigh) after the surgery of total prosthesis of&#xD;
      hip, with decrease of the consumption of morphine within first 72 post-operative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the Analog Visual Scales of pain (EVA) with the rest&#xD;
      and with the mobilization during various times (in post-surgery care room, then at H4, H8,&#xD;
      H12, H24, H48, H72), the period between the end of intervention (out of the operating room)&#xD;
      and the first support by the upright posture in bipedal support), the period between the end&#xD;
      of intervention and the resumption of the walk, the satisfaction of the patients at the exit&#xD;
      of the hospital, the duration of hospitalization after the surgical operation and the&#xD;
      possible unwanted events (systematic toxicity of the local anesthetics, the infection of&#xD;
      prosthesis, disease thromboembolic venous) during the hospitalization.&#xD;
