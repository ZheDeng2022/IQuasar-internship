  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders includes in&#xD;
      its research appendix a potential new diagnosis-Internet gaming disorder. This condition&#xD;
      primarily affects adolescent boys and young adult men, who rarely seek treatment on their&#xD;
      own. More often, parents express concerns about their child's game playing behaviors. This&#xD;
      psychotherapy development study will evaluate feasibility and effect sizes of an intervention&#xD;
      designed to help parents reduce their child's gaming problems; the intervention allows for&#xD;
      child participation, but it is geared toward parents, regardless of whether or not their&#xD;
      child is willing to participate. A total of 40 parents concerned about their child's gaming&#xD;
      behaviors will complete self and parental report inventories and structured diagnostic&#xD;
      interviews regarding gaming, substance use and psychosocial functioning. Children who elect&#xD;
      to participate will complete parallel versions of the instruments. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to a control condition consisting of referral for mental health issues and family&#xD;
      support services or to a 6-week behavioral intervention designed to assist with better&#xD;
      monitoring and regulating the child's game playing behaviors. Gaming and other problems will&#xD;
      be assessed pre-treatment, at the end of treatment and at a 4-month follow-up. This study&#xD;
      will be the first to evaluate the reliability and validity of a parental version of the fifth&#xD;
      revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders criteria for internet&#xD;
      gaming disorder in a clinical sample, and it will assess associations of internet gaming&#xD;
      disorder with substance use, mental health conditions, and family functioning as well. This&#xD;
      study will be the first randomized trial of an intervention designed to assist parents in&#xD;
      reducing their child's gaming problems, and results will help guide future development of&#xD;
      interventions for Internet gaming disorder. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      this intervention, the proportion of parents assigned to the intervention who complete 6&#xD;
      sessions will be examined, as will the proportion of youth who attend the sessions. Parent&#xD;
      and child ratings of satisfaction with the intervention will be assessed. To examine the&#xD;
      effect size of the intervention on reducing gaming, parental reports of proportion of days on&#xD;
      which their child played games and durations of game playing will be compared between&#xD;
      conditions, controlling for baseline indices.&#xD;
