      An Open Label, Randomized, Two-Arm, Single-Dose, Two-Period, Crossover Study Relative&#xD;
      Bioavailability Study. The present study is intended to compare and evaluate the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of a single 11 gram dose of AR10 (acetylcysteine effervescent tablets for&#xD;
      oral solution (two 0.5 g and four 2.5 g]), and the reference Listed Drug (acetylcysteine&#xD;
      solution; oral 20% [200 mg/mL] of American Pharmaceutical Partners) in healthy adult, human&#xD;
      subjects under fasting conditions. A balanced block randomization schedule will be generated&#xD;
      before the start of dosing.&#xD;
