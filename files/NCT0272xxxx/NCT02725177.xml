  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with ACTHAR Gel will result in a reduction of ocular inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      active ocular sarcoidosis that requires systemic immunosuppressant therapy (hypothesis)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial treatment of ocular sarcoidosis usually relies on a combination of topical&#xD;
      glucocorticoids and oral glucocorticoids, both of which are associated with significant&#xD;
      ocular and systemic toxicities. Steroid-sparing therapies are limited by variable and&#xD;
      unpredictable efficacy, prolonged time until clinical response, medication intolerance, and&#xD;
      difficulties obtaining payor approval. As a result, it is not uncommon that treating&#xD;
      physicians must choose between excessive glucocorticoid toxicity versus poor control of&#xD;
      ocular inflammation. Ongoing ocular inflammation, in turn, leads to eventual visual loss and&#xD;
      occasionally blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for a more reliable, expeditious therapy that can be used as an alternative&#xD;
      to glucocorticoids in sarcoidosis uveitis. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, through activation of&#xD;
      melanocortin receptors on leukocytes, can dampen immune responses through non-glucocorticoid&#xD;
      dependent mechanisms. The proposed study will aim to define whether there is effectiveness&#xD;
      for ACTHAR gel in these patients, delineate an effect dosing regimen, and provide information&#xD;
      about the safety of this approach for moderate to severe ocular sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTHAR is a 39-amino acid peptide natural form of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that was&#xD;
      initially approved in 1952 by the FDA. It has since been approved for 19 indications&#xD;
      including respiratory sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and infantile spasms.&#xD;
