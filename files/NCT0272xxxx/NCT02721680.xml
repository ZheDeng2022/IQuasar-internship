  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to provide the Army with a brief, well-validated,&#xD;
      internet-based training program for enhancing Awareness Training and resilience skills. This&#xD;
      project will address the needs outlined for the Military Operational Medicine Research&#xD;
      Program, particularly with regard to enhancing Psychological Health and Resilience. The&#xD;
      fundamental approach of the project directly addresses the need to &quot;develop psychological&#xD;
      resilience among Service members and families to promote well-being and prevent behavioral&#xD;
      health outcomes.&quot; Addressing this need is crucial, as military personnel are often required&#xD;
      to serve under dangerous and emotionally stressful conditions. Prolonged stress or exposure&#xD;
      to very intense life threatening experiences, such as those encountered in combat or other&#xD;
      hazardous duty deployments can increase the risk of developing mental health problems&#xD;
      including depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One possible way to&#xD;
      minimize the effects of these stressful experiences on Service members is to strengthen their&#xD;
      emotional flexibility, adaptability, and capacity to cope with adversity before they find&#xD;
      themselves faced with such situations. To fill this need, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      provide the military with a web-based program that focuses on enhancing Awareness Training, a&#xD;
      core set of trainable awareness skills that collectively include the capacity to understand,&#xD;
      perceive, control, and use emotions effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the previous pilot program was successful in some ways, it needs further research&#xD;
      before it is ready for widespread use. The investigators therefore propose to build upon the&#xD;
      existing strengths already in the program and redesign the weaker modules to be more&#xD;
      effective. Over the course of a four-year study, the investigators propose to develop this&#xD;
      program. The proposed Awareness Training program is brief, web-based, easily accessible, and&#xD;
      sufficiently focused such that it could be completed by large numbers of military personnel&#xD;
      with minimal time burden, leading to rapid enhancement of awareness skills. Such a program&#xD;
      could have a significant effect in promoting resilience, interpersonal functioning, and brain&#xD;
      health among Service members and their families, while reducing the likelihood of mental&#xD;
      health problems among those returning from exposure to potentially traumatic experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that a set of well designed and targeted training modules&#xD;
      addressing core awareness ability domains will significantly enhance measured awareness&#xD;
      skills, will translate into improved performance on militarily relevant metrics, and will&#xD;
      lead to better mental and emotional health, as well as well being during stressful situations&#xD;
      and subsequent cognitive processing.&#xD;
