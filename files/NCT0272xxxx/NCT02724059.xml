    <textblock>
      The study will include 30 patients with hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes detected by thoracic CT&#xD;
      either there was a known lung malignancy (for staging purpose) or not (for diagnosing&#xD;
      purpose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo to EBUS-guided TBNA. Elastography will be performed on all lymph&#xD;
      nodes that will be candidates for EBUS TBNA. Mediastinoscopy or other invasive procedures&#xD;
      will be performed if EBUS-guided TBNA doesn't provide representative material.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be subjected to the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thorough history taking and full clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chest X-ray (postro-anterior and lateral views) before and after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recent Computed Tomography (CT chest) with contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Laboratory studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete liver functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood urea and serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood picture (including platelet count).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fasting and postprandial blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preoperative evaluation: Pulmonary function tests (PFT), Electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
           arterial blood gases (ABG) and coagulation profile (including bleeding &amp; clotting times,&#xD;
           prothrombin time&amp; activity and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)) and oral&#xD;
           anticoagulants should be stopped before the procedure for at least 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Color doppler ultrasound in suspected vascular lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Clinical and radiological follow up of patients over 1 week after the procedure to&#xD;
           detect the occurrence of any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The biopsy samples will be examined histopathologically. EBUS-guided TBNA examinations&#xD;
           will be performed in all cases at the pulmonary department of Tanta University&#xD;
           Educational Hospital as an outpatient procedure in a dedicated bronchoscopy suit with&#xD;
           Pantex EBUS probe and Hitachi ultrasound a 7.5 MHz, BF-UC160F (Olympus Optical Co.,&#xD;
           Tokyo, Japan, approved by FDA) convex probe bronchoscope and EU C2000 processor&#xD;
           (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by oral route and in the supine position under local anesthesia&#xD;
           with lidocaine and conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph nodes will be identified according to the Mountain's regional lymph node classification&#xD;
      system (5). The lymph node stations of 2, 4, 7, 10 and 11 will be evaluated systematically.&#xD;
      After the appearance of target lymph nodes, the diameter, shape, edge definition, internal&#xD;
      echo distribution, and location of the lymph nodes will be recorded in conventional B mode by&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography will be performed on all lymph nodes that will be candidates for EBUS TBNA. The&#xD;
      scan range will include the entire lymph node and the surrounding normal tissue.&#xD;
      Elastographic and B mode images will be simultaneously displayed side by side on the monitor.&#xD;
      Elastographic patterns will be described according to the dominant colors and their&#xD;
      distribution within the target lymph node. The strain ratio can be only measured when good&#xD;
      contact and appropriate compression of the transducer will be achieved, as indicated by the&#xD;
      elastography image on the ultrasound processor. The largest possible area of the node will be&#xD;
      outlined from the superimposed elastography image; the same procedure will be performed on a&#xD;
      similar-sized area that is surrounded by apparently normal tissue. The ultrasound processor&#xD;
      measured the strain of each area as a quantitative figure, and the strain ratio between the&#xD;
      two areas will be calculated. The strain ratio will be recorded a minimum of 3 times prior to&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA. The means of these recordings will also be calculated. (4) After elastography,&#xD;
      EBUS TBNA will be performed with a Cook 22 gauge needle (c976006, Cook Ireland Limited&#xD;
      Liability Company, Ireland). The number of passes per patient will be recorded. N3 nodes will&#xD;
      be sampled first and then N2 nodes to avoid contamination in lung cancer patients.&#xD;
      Histological and cytological specimens will be collected and sent to the laboratory for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis by pathologist who will be blinded to the elastography values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration specimen will be considered &quot;insufficient&quot; if there will not be an adequate number&#xD;
      of lymphocytes on the smear. A definitive diagnosis of malignancy from the EBUS TBNA&#xD;
      specimens will be considered a positive result. No clear evidence of malignancy or inadequate&#xD;
      specimen by EBUS TBNA will be deemed a negative result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients whose results are negative for malignancy, more invasive procedures such as&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy will be done to confirm the diagnosis or radiologic follow-up on the outcome&#xD;
      of the LNs for at least 6 months. On follow-up, LNs that persisted in size, diminished, or&#xD;
      resolved will be considered benign. A diagnosis of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis will be made&#xD;
      based on cytopathology that showed the presence of caseating or noncaseating granuloma, in&#xD;
      addition to clinical, radiological, and microbiological findings.&#xD;
