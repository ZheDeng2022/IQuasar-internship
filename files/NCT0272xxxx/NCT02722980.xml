      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic product on bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) in healthy early post-menopausal women, compared to placebo. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is to assess changes of BMD at lumbar spine after an intervention period of&#xD;
      12 months. Changes in BMD at the femoral neck (hip) will also be measured as well as changes&#xD;
      in bone turnover markers during the period of 12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Commitment not to use any products that may influence the study outcome in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

         22. Participation in any other clinical interventional study during the last three (3)&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
