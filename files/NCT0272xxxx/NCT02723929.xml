  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (TUS) on pain perception and&#xD;
      functional limitations in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when&#xD;
      compared to sham stimulation.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Pain Scale as Measured by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain were measured in order to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound is effective in reducing pain in subjects with Osteoarthritis of the Knee.&#xD;
The VAS scale goes from 0 up to 10, where 0 means no pain at all and 10 means the worst imaginable pain and is reported following the full course of therapy. Since we are using a difference, smaller values (negative) represent a better outcome</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measures the endogenous pain modulatory pathway. This study will evaluate DNIC in pain patients using pressure as the test stimulus, and cold water as the conditioning stimulus. DNIC will be induced approximately 1-min later by having subjects immerse their hand into a water bath maintained at 10-12ËšC for approximately 1 min. Parallel to the last 30s of DNIC conditioning (cold water immersion), the pressure test stimulus will be reapplied. DNIC response will be calculated as the difference between the average of pain ratings from the test stimulus minus the average of pain ratings during the conditioned stimulus. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Single Leg Standing Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will record the time (seconds) for which a subject is able to stand unsupported on one foot while looking straight ahead with hands on hips. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject was asked to stand unsupported with their feet parallel to each other in front of a step. We assessed the number of times the participant could place their foot up onto the step and return it to the floor over a 15-sec interval. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Functional Reach Test From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will be instructed to stand next to, but not touch the wall, and position the arm that is closer to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with a closed fist. Smoothness of wrist movement is assessed as the subject was asked to outstretch their arm in a maximal forward reach, while maintaining a fixed base of support. Smoothness is dimensionless and is calculated as mean speed divided by peak speed. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Changes in Pain Scale as Measured by VAS</title>
        <description>Changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain were measured in order to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound is effective in reducing pain in subjects with Osteoarthritis of the Knee.&#xD;
The VAS scale goes from 0 up to 10, where 0 means no pain at all and 10 means the worst imaginable pain and is reported following the full course of therapy. Since we are using a difference, smaller values (negative) represent a better outcome</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC) From Baseline</title>
        <description>This measures the endogenous pain modulatory pathway. This study will evaluate DNIC in pain patients using pressure as the test stimulus, and cold water as the conditioning stimulus. DNIC will be induced approximately 1-min later by having subjects immerse their hand into a water bath maintained at 10-12ËšC for approximately 1 min. Parallel to the last 30s of DNIC conditioning (cold water immersion), the pressure test stimulus will be reapplied. DNIC response will be calculated as the difference between the average of pain ratings from the test stimulus minus the average of pain ratings during the conditioned stimulus. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Functional Reach Test From Baseline</title>
        <description>Subject will be instructed to stand next to, but not touch the wall, and position the arm that is closer to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion with a closed fist. Smoothness of wrist movement is assessed as the subject was asked to outstretch their arm in a maximal forward reach, while maintaining a fixed base of support. Smoothness is dimensionless and is calculated as mean speed divided by peak speed. Larger percentage change means a better outcome.</description>
