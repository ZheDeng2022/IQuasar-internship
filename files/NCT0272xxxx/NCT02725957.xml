  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study&#xD;
      performed in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include up to four escalating dose cohorts with eight (8) subjects in each&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive single IV&#xD;
      administration of 9% trehalose (Treatment Arm 1) or placebo (Treatment Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects, regardless of their treatment arm assignment, will undergo the same evaluations&#xD;
      and will receive the study drug at the clinic. Each subject will continue to be followed for&#xD;
      one week post dosing.&#xD;

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study performed&#xD;
      in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include up to four escalating dose cohorts with eight (8) subjects in each&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive single IV&#xD;
      administration of 9% trehalose (Treatment Arm 1) or placebo (Treatment Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects, regardless of their treatment arm assignment, will undergo the same evaluations&#xD;
      and will receive the study drug at the clinic. Each subject will continue to be followed for&#xD;
      one week post dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 to 3 After all subjects in a given cohort complete their 1-week follow-up visit&#xD;
      (Visit 4), a Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the safety and PK data of that cohort.&#xD;
      If no safety concerns are identified, and the exposure data supports a higher dose is&#xD;
      acceptable, the SRC will approve continuation into the next cohort (dose level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4 Cohort 4 will be initiated based on review of the safety and exposure data from the&#xD;
      first 3 cohorts by the SRC. This cohort will only be performed if there is a suggestion that&#xD;
      exposure can be safely increased.&#xD;
