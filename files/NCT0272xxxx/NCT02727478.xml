      This effectiveness-implementation study is a part of the larger study BETA-PD (Balance,&#xD;
      Elderly, Training and Activity in Parkinson's Disease), which has the long-term goal to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of falling in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) by improving balance, gait&#xD;
      and physical activity level. The main hypothesis is that highly challenging balance training&#xD;
      will lead to greater gait and balance ability, increased levels of physical activity and an&#xD;
      improved health related quality of life. The main aims of the study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the HiBalance program in real-life clinical settings, while exploring&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers for program implementation on a wider scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical features of PD include progressive postural instability, hypokinesia, tremor and&#xD;
      rigidity. It is therefore common that people with PD experience reduced balance and gait&#xD;
      function, symptoms which can have far-reaching negative effects on their health and quality&#xD;
      of life. Injurious falls and fear of falling are especially prevalent among those with PD, a&#xD;
      factor which may partly explain why this group are less physically active than older people&#xD;
      of a similar age without the diagnosis. Balance and gait training, on the other hand, have&#xD;
      been shown effective in PD and also appear to have potential neuro-protective properties.&#xD;
      Research in the area of balance training in PD disease however is sparse and previous&#xD;
      interventions have been criticized for applying training stimuli which lacked intensity and&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HiBalance program is based on scientifically well-established principles of exercise&#xD;
      training and postural control as well as current research on training in PD. The program was&#xD;
      developed to affect symptom-specific balance impairments in PD by targeting four main&#xD;
      subsystems underlying balance control (stability limits, anticipatory postural adjustments,&#xD;
      sensory integration and motor agility). The intervention consists of a 10-week progressive&#xD;
      balance training program in group format (5-7 participants). Each training session is&#xD;
      conducted by a minimum of 2 physiotherapist trainers, during twice weekly 1-hour sessions (20&#xD;
      hours in total). Additionally, a home-exercise program is carried out by the participants&#xD;
      once a week during the trial period. The difficulty level of the group-based training is&#xD;
      increased in three consecutive blocks. To ensure highly challenging exercises, each task is&#xD;
      individually adjusted by altering the area of base of support, increasing movement&#xD;
      speed/amplitude and/or restricting vision and varying the grade of multitasking. The program&#xD;
      has previously been proven feasible [Conradsson, 2012] and effective [Conradsson, 2015] in&#xD;
      improving balance and gait impairments in a randomized controlled hospital setting. In&#xD;
      addition, favorable transfer effects were seen in relation to physical activity levels and&#xD;
      the performance of activities of everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research interventions to be adopted in real-life clinical settings however a level of&#xD;
      adaptation is required. Best practice then involves evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      efficacious programs in clinical settings, in order to verify whether or not the adaptation&#xD;
      has attenuated the effective core elements of the program itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study combines a clinical effectiveness trial together with implementation&#xD;
      research. Use of a type-1 hybrid design will allow the effects of the HiBalance program in&#xD;
      clinical settings to be tested while simultaneously gathering information on barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to the implementation process [Curran, 2012]. Use of the hybrid design also&#xD;
      allows for constant monitoring of the process by which the intervention is applied, and&#xD;
      therefore allow problems in early application to be identified and quickly altered so as to&#xD;
      ensure better outcomes. A participatory approach will be adhered to whereby 'users' of the&#xD;
      program (physiotherapist trainers) will be actively involved in all stages of the program&#xD;
      adaptation, process and outcome evaluation. This approach is recommended in order to increase&#xD;
      the relevance, acceptability and successful implementation of the program. The Consolidated&#xD;
      Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used in the current study to guide the&#xD;
      investigation of potential barriers to and facilitators of the implementation process&#xD;
      [Damschroder, 2009 ].&#xD;
