    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending&#xD;
      oral doses of ASP4345 in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending oral doses of ASP4345 in patients with&#xD;
