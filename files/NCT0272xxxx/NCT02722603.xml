  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of gabapentin relative to tramadol for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic, neuropathic or mixed pain in the paediatric population. Children from 3&#xD;
      months to less than 18 years of age experiencing moderate to severe chronic pain will receive&#xD;
      either gabapentin or tramadol for 15 weeks. The difference in average pain scores between&#xD;
      treatment arms at the end of the treatment period will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. In the&#xD;
      absence of specific paediatric studies, it is not approved for the same condition in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by a) the lack of a suitable paediatric&#xD;
      formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin pharmacokinetics profile and c)&#xD;
      efficacy and safety data in this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GABA-1 study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of gabapentin oral solution relative&#xD;
      to tramadol and to document the Pharmacokinetic and safety profile of gabapentin in this&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GABA-1 is a non-inferiority trial because gabapentin is expected to be equally effective but&#xD;
      better tolerated than tramadol, thus providing a clinical benefit to affected children.&#xD;
