    <description>The primary endpoint of cumulative irritation was the measurement of the combined &quot;Dermal response&quot; and &quot;Other Effect&quot; total irritation scores recorded during the 21 day continuous application period (i.e. the total irritation score for a specific subject was the sum of the irritation scores recorded on Days 2 through 22 for each patch type). Because the cumulative irritation scores did not display a normal distribution, the primary analysis was a comparison of the overall median of the observed total irritation score of the Test patch against the Reference patch. The Per Protocol Population for Irritation (PPPI) was used for the primary analysis</description>

    <description>The primary analysis of sensitization used the Per Protocol Population for Sensitization (PPPS) and compared the number and percentage (%) of reactions indicating potential sensitization (irritation score greater than or equal to 2 at 48 or 72 hours post-removal, along with the Investigator's assessment) observed with each patch type</description>
