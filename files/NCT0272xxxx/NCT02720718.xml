      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess weight and obesity is the fifth leading risk factor for global death. Bariatric&#xD;
      surgery is considered as the only effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the best surgical procedures, since it&#xD;
      achieves excellent long-term results with a low complication rate. Intestinal anastomosis is&#xD;
      a very complex and time-consuming procedure in laparoscopy, mainly due to the difficulties of&#xD;
      knotting the suture in a limited working area. Barbed sutures may enhance this procedure by&#xD;
      eliminating the need for knot tying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of knotless barbed&#xD;
      sutures (Stratafix) and continuous sutures (Vicryl) for closing the gastrojejunal and&#xD;
      jejunojejunal anastomosis in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups: traditional suture group or knotless suture group. Randomization will be realized by&#xD;
      sealed envelopes according to a computer-generated sequence of random numbers, which will be&#xD;
      opened for the surgeon just before starting the anastomosis. During the surgery the&#xD;
      gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomoses will be performed with a stapler (Echelon 45&#xD;
      Endopath) and closed with a traditional (Vicryl) or knotless (Stratafix Unidirectional)&#xD;
      suture. The same surgeon, experienced and specialized in laparoscopic gastric bypass&#xD;
      technique, will perform all procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the rate of anastomosis-related complications (leakage,&#xD;
      bleeding, gastric fistula, anastomotic stenosis) at 4 weeks and at 6 months post-op (safety).&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure will be the time spent on closing the gastrojejunal and&#xD;
      jejunojejunal anastomosis (efficacy).&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Excess weight and obesity is the fifth leading risk factor for global death (WHO 2011).&#xD;
           It has been demonstrated that conservative treatment of obesity, such as restricting&#xD;
           calorie intake, increasing physical activity, and medical treatment, did not succeed in&#xD;
           achieving significant long-lasting loss of weight (Flegal 2002). Therefore, bariatric&#xD;
           surgery is considered as the only effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity to&#xD;
           achieve substantial and sustainable weight loss (Fisher 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gastric bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gastric bypass has a two-way effect: it restricts how much food the stomach can hold&#xD;
           (restrictive) and it affects how food and calories are absorbed into the bloodstream&#xD;
           (malabsorptive). This combination surgery has the highest success rate for amount of&#xD;
           weight loss. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the best surgical&#xD;
           procedures, since it achieves excellent long-term results with a low complication rate&#xD;
           (Schauer 2003, Suter 2011, Fisher 2002). During this procedure two anastomoses -&#xD;
           gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal -are constructed. This can be achieved with handsewn&#xD;
           suturing or with mechanical stapling (Gonzalez 2003). If the anastomoses are stapled&#xD;
           with a linear technique, closing of the enterotomies with sutures is still required.&#xD;
           This is a very complex and time-consuming procedure in laparoscopy, mainly due to the&#xD;
           difficulties of knotting the suture in a limited working area (De Blasi 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Knotless sutures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Barbed sutures may enhance the suturing procedure by eliminating the need for knot tying&#xD;
           and by minimizing the help needed from an assistant. However, only a limited number of&#xD;
           studies have examined the use of barbed sutures during gastric bypass procedures (De&#xD;
           Blasi 2013, Facy 2013, Costantino 2013, Milone 2013). The aim of this study is to&#xD;
           compare the safety and efficacy of knotless barbed sutures and traditional continuous&#xD;
           sutures for closing the gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis after linear&#xD;
           stapling in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of knotless barbed sutures&#xD;
           (Stratafix Unidirectional) and traditional continuous sutures (Vicryl) for closing the&#xD;
           gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis in obese patients undergoing gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective randomized study. Patients will be included and enrolled in the&#xD;
           study after written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Traditional suture group (Vicryl, 2/0)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knotless suture group (Stratafix Unidirectional, 2/0) Randomization will be&#xD;
                realized by sealed envelopes according to a computer-generated sequence of random&#xD;
                numbers, which will be opened for the surgeon just before starting the anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surgical procedure will be a standardized laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with&#xD;
           the surgeon positioned between the patients legs. During the surgery the gastrojejunal&#xD;
           and jejunojejunal anastomoses will be performed with a linear stapler (Echelon 60&#xD;
           EndopathTM) and closed with a traditional (Vicryl) or knotless (Stratafix&#xD;
           Unidirectional) suture. The same surgeon, experienced and specialized in laparoscopic&#xD;
           gastric bypass technique, will perform all procedures, supported by 1 assistant and 1&#xD;
           research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Population (base) Two hundred patients undergoing a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
           bypass at the AZ St. Dimpna in Geel (Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Sample size We have chosen for a sample size of 200 patients (100 in each group).&#xD;
           Current literature shows that is a feasible amount of participants for this kind of&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the rate of anastomosis-related complications (leakage,&#xD;
      bleeding, gastric fistula, anastomotic stenosis) for each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 4 weeks post-op: short-term safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6 months post-op: long-term safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure will be the time spent on closing the anastomosis (efficacy),&#xD;
      measured from first needle in until last knot (Vicryl) or last stitch (Stratafix):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrojejunal anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jejunojejunal anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will register the following co-founders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total procedure time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary or secondary gastric bypass procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA score (American Society of Anaesthesiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation Then, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: traditional suture group or knotless suture group.&#xD;
      Randomization will be realized by sealed envelopes according to a computer-generated sequence&#xD;
      of random numbers, which will be opened for the surgeon just before starting the anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Study procedures Patients will be included and enrolled in the study after written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be a standardized laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using a&#xD;
      five-port-site technique (2 x 12 mm; 3 x 5 mm), with the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Division of the stomach:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Horizontally using a 60-mm regular linear stapler with a blue cartridge (Echelon 60&#xD;
                ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon, Endo-Surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Vertically using two 60-mm regular linear staplers with a blue cartridge (Echelon&#xD;
                60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon, Endo-Surgery) to reach the angle of His&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrojejunal anastomosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A 60-cm ileal loop is lifted up to the pouch and the anastomosis is performed using&#xD;
                20 mm of a 60-mm regular linear stapler with a blue cartridge (Echelon 60&#xD;
                ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon, Endo-Surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Single-layer continuous suture (Vicryl 2/0 or Stratafix) to close the anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jejunojejunal anastomosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The Roux limb is measured at 100 cm (if the patient has a BMI &lt; 50) or at 150 cm&#xD;
                (if the patient has a BMI &gt; 50). The anastomosis is performed using a 60-mm regular&#xD;
                linear stapler with a white cartridge (Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon,&#xD;
                Endo-Surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Single-layer continuous suture (Vicryl 2/0 or Stratafix) to close the anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of bowel division using a 60-mm regular linear stapler with a white cartridge&#xD;
           (Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon, Endo-Surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the mesentery defect and the Petersen's defect are closed using a monofilament&#xD;
      non-absorbable suture (Prolene 20). De port sites are not closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at 4 weeks and 6 months after the surgery to check for&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason&#xD;
      if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a&#xD;
      subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Descriptive statistics Subject characteristics (age, BMI, co-morbidities) will be&#xD;
      described as means ± standard error of the mean for each group. Gender will be described as&#xD;
      percentage women for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Statistical analysis All data will be analyzed using SPSS statistical software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be compared amongst the two groups by means of an independent&#xD;
      Student's t-test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrojejunal anastomosis time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jejunojejunal anastomosis time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total procedure time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be compared by means of a chi-squared test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complication rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary or secondary gastric bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
      A P-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
