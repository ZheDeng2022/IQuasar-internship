  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the scientific community understands quite well why muscles ache after prolonged&#xD;
      exercise, the origins of mental fatigue remain totally mysterious. Existing theories remain&#xD;
      at a psychological level, with scarce supporting evidence. Mental fatigue typically occurs&#xD;
      after long episodes during which humans exert control on motor or cognitive processes,&#xD;
      instead of executing routine or stimulus-driven behaviours. However, work organization&#xD;
      (especially in risky job like airplane control or medical profession) and pathologies due to&#xD;
      an overload of work (like burn-out) seems to be directly linked to neural fatigue. One of the&#xD;
      consequences of neural fatigue is to alter decision-making. As an example, the choice between&#xD;
      an immediate monetary reward and a larger but delayed monetary reward (the so called&#xD;
      intertemporal choices) are susceptible to fatigue state of its underpinning neural network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing an exploratory study of neural fatigue, induced either in a&#xD;
      natural way (by performing cognitive tasks for hours) or by transcranial stimulation, using&#xD;
      three main physiological measures (Electro-encephalography to measure neural activity,&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry to measure the metabolic cost of a cognitive effort, and pupillometry to&#xD;
      measure cognitive effort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should allow to better understand the consequences of neural fatigue on cognitive&#xD;
      functions like decision making as well as the associated physiological variables.&#xD;
