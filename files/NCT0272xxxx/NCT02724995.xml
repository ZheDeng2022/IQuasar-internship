      This study will help the investigator understand the pathogenesis of different rare genetic&#xD;
      conditions and to establish database of rare genetic databases. This would ultimately help to&#xD;
      provide more accurate diagnosis through advanced genomic diagnostic testing and databases&#xD;
      established from this study. This knowledge would in turn help in the clinical management of&#xD;
      other affected family members and other individuals affected with similar conditions.&#xD;
      Understanding of pathogenesis of the disease would also enable the investigator to develop&#xD;
      targeted therapies for rare genetic diseases, and also to collaborate on the targeted&#xD;
      therapy-related clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator plans to store the results of this study in databases. These results will be&#xD;
      shared with other researchers or doctors, who research, diagnose or treat the individuals&#xD;
      with similar diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will only share the data that is collected and not the biological samples.&#xD;

      This proposed study is designed identify for the genetic causes of rare diseases. This study&#xD;
      does not involve the use of investigational medication or devices. No randomization will take&#xD;
      place. Participants enrolled into the study will be asked to provide blood or saliva samples&#xD;
      for DNA testing. Samples will be collected by one of two methods;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant has had a clinical genetic test performed, the results/data will be&#xD;
           collected from the University of Kentucky (UK) clinical molecular pathology laboratory&#xD;
           or from the medical records. If the cause of the disease is not identified on clinical&#xD;
           genetic testing, the investigator will reanalyze the clinical genetic testing data or&#xD;
           use the blood or saliva sample leftover from the clinical genetic testing for additional&#xD;
           experiments using new methods to identify the cause of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no sample leftover from the clinical genetic testing is available, the investigator&#xD;
           plans to collect about 2 teaspoons of blood or saliva from the participant at their&#xD;
           first visit to the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll 1000 participants from the University of Kentucky Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator plans to store any blood or saliva DNA samples collected for future research&#xD;
      studies involving rare genetic diseases. The stored blood or saliva DNA samples will not be&#xD;
      released to anyone outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored samples will be labeled with a unique study identifier and will be maintained in the&#xD;
      investigator's research laboratory located at the University of Kentucky, Department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 800 Rose Street, Lexington, KY 40536.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no limit on the length of time that the samples will be stored. The investigator may&#xD;
      keep using the stored samples indefinitely unless the participant decide to withdraw from the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may withdraw or cancel their permission for the use for their stored samples at&#xD;
      any time. However, any samples and health information already obtained from their use will&#xD;
      not be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional costs or charges to the participant for allowing the investigator&#xD;
      to store and use their left over blood or saliva samples and there is no benefit to the&#xD;
      participant for allowing the investigator to store their samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be paid for donating their samples. The samples and information that&#xD;
      the participants are donating will no longer belong to them. The research may lead to new&#xD;
      medical knowledge, tests, treatments or products. These products could have some financial&#xD;
      value. There are no plans to provide financial payment to either the participant or their&#xD;
      relatives should this occur.&#xD;
