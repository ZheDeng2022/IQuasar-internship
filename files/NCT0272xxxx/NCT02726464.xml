      This is an observational study that evaluates the characteristics of Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      used in the therapy and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and degenerative joint&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of the PRP will be tested for platelet and microparticle content using dynamic light&#xD;
      scattering to determine if there is a relationship between the composition and the treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An observational study that evaluates the characteristics of Platelet Rich Plasma used in the&#xD;
      therapy and treatment of musculoskeletal and degenerative joint conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study have already been assessed by the Principal Investigator and&#xD;
      are schedule to receive treatment with Platelet Rich Plasma. Prior to the treatment patients&#xD;
      will be asked to consent in the study where the composition of the PRP is to be evaluated.&#xD;
      Consenting patients that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will complete a pain score&#xD;
      self-assessment prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An autologous preparation of PRP sample will be made from the subject's whole blood. The&#xD;
      subject will receive the PRP treatment and an excess portion of the PRP preparation will be&#xD;
      tested for composition and the relative concentration of the constituents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the PRP will be tested using Dynamic Light Scattering (ThromboLUX System) to&#xD;
      measure the constituents in PRP preparations prior to injection. PRP and whole blood (at&#xD;
      physician's discretion) will be analyzed on a hematology analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing work-flow does not alter the subject's standard of care. The physician will be&#xD;
      blinded to the analytical results during the enrolment, treatment and patient follow-up phase&#xD;
      of the study. Analytical results are not used in patient management decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's response to the PRP treatment will be assessed at 3 and 6 weeks post injection. At&#xD;
      these times, the clinical outcome of the treatment will be measured using a patient self&#xD;
      -assessment (post-treatment pain scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that PRP characteristics, such as platelet and&#xD;
      microparticle content and composition can be predictive clinical outcome for PRP treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical outcome will be evaluated by patient pre- and post-pain score assessment. This&#xD;
      study aims to review clinical outcomes and compare these results against ThromboLUX and other&#xD;
      test results. If the predictive value of platelet composition testing can be demonstrated,&#xD;
      additional studies may be considered.&#xD;
