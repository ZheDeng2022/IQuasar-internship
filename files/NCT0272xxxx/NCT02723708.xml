    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a non-medication intervention can increase motivation&#xD;
      in individuals with ADHD by observing brain activity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study involves a screening visit and 4 experimental task sessions.During the screening&#xD;
      visit subjects will undergo psychiatric screening to determine if they meet criteria for a&#xD;
      diagnosis of ADHD. Participants who meet criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD will also have the&#xD;
      following tests done at screening: breath alcohol test, urine drug screen and urine cotinine&#xD;
      (by product of tobacco) screening and intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will complete a battery of cognitive assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting study inclusion will then be scheduled for 4 fMRI sessions to assess and&#xD;
      manipulate the ability to self-stimulate VTA activation. Each session will contain the same&#xD;
      tasks and instructions. The experimental imaging task sessions will be done within a one&#xD;
      month window and will consist of two types of runs: Test Runs (one pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      each) and three Training Runs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Pre-Test is to establish a baseline level of self-generated VTA activation&#xD;
      prior to receiving RTFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post-Test is designed to assess whether participants are better able to self-induce VTA&#xD;
      BOLD signal in the absence of feedback (after receiving RTFF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will begin and end each scanning session with a 2-minute resting state scan.&#xD;
      Participants will rest and fixate at a cross hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the first run is to acquire data in functional space to facilitate&#xD;
      registration of the VTA probabilistic atlas (MNI space) to functional space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pre-Test and Post-Test runs will be identical and will have two trial types: Activate and&#xD;
      Count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Activate trials participants will be instructed to try to increase activity (BOLD&#xD;
      signal) within their VTA. Specifically, we will instruct participants to try to get&#xD;
      themselves into a heightened state of motivation using personally relevant thoughts and&#xD;
      imagery. Importantly, they will be encouraged to optimize strategies for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Count trials, participants will be instructed to count backwards. The purpose of&#xD;
      these trials is to: standardize the baseline period and to provide a distractor task to&#xD;
      prevent engagement in activation strategies. There will be 5 repetitions of both trial types,&#xD;
      separated by a jittered inter-trial-interval (ITI; total duration 4 minutes, 5 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the subsequent training runs (n=3/day on each of the 4 days) is to provide&#xD;
      participants with RTFF to assist them in increasing their VTA BOLD signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training runs will consist of three trial types: Activate, Count, and Rest. For both&#xD;
      Activate and Count Trials, participants will be given the same instructions as during the&#xD;
      test runs. During the Rest trials participants will be instructed to rest and not think of&#xD;
      anything in particular. The Activate and Rest trials will include a thermometer display, as&#xD;
      described below. Each trial type will be repeated 5 times per run, separated by a jittered&#xD;
      ITI (total duration 6 minutes, 18 seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Post-Test each day, the Cognitive Battery assessments will be repeated with the&#xD;
      subject out of the scanner.&#xD;
