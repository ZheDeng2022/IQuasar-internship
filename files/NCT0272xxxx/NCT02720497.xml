    <textblock>
      Objectives and Rationale: With up to 20% of U.S. service members returning from Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan with PTSD symptoms, a critical need exists for treatments that are both effective&#xD;
      and efficient, enabling the greatest number possible to be treated to remission. As a highly&#xD;
      efficacious treatment and the one with the most scientific support, Prolonged Exposure (PE)&#xD;
      is recommended by the Institute of Medicine and being rolled out by the Departments of&#xD;
      Defense and Veterans Affairs to help heal our war fighters' psychological wounds. A major&#xD;
      barrier to that roll-out, however, is that PE is typically delivered in 90-minute sessions.&#xD;
      This is difficult for military mental health providers, who because of large patient loads&#xD;
      and pressure to see as many patients per day as possible, limit therapy sessions to 60&#xD;
      minutes. The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether PE&#xD;
      sessions can be reduced to 60 minutes without compromising the treatment's high success rate.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that patients may greatly benefit from PE even when the time&#xD;
      spent recalling and recounting the trauma memories during sessions (a key procedure called&#xD;
      imaginal exposure) is shortened to fit into a 60-minute session. To test this hypothesis, the&#xD;
      trial will enroll 160 San Antonio-area active duty service members who will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive PE treatment with 60- or 90-minute sessions. In an additional effort to&#xD;
      learn more about how PE helps patients recover - and thereby gain insights to further enhance&#xD;
      treatment benefit - the study investigators will examine what causes reductions in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms during PE by examining self-reported and physiological markers (e.g., heart rate&#xD;
      reactivity) between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Applicability and Impact: If PE can be shown to maintain high success rates with&#xD;
      shorter sessions, more military clinicians could offer this powerful therapy, as it would fit&#xD;
      within time constraints of their heavy workload. This would potentially help thousands of our&#xD;
      nation's warriors recover from the devastating psychological effects of PTSD and maintain&#xD;
      their military careers, heal hurting relationships, and reengage in meaningful life&#xD;
      activities. This study would further benefit the military and the general public by enhancing&#xD;
      the readiness of our Armed Forces and reducing the public cost of service members' lost work&#xD;
      time or veterans' disability benefits. Overloaded VA providers and even civilian therapists,&#xD;
      who often limit sessions to 60 minutes due to insurance reimbursement requirements, may also&#xD;
      be more likely to utilize the shorter treatment format, increasing access to evidence-base&#xD;
      care for veterans and civilians. In addition, insights from the study's examination of&#xD;
      biomarkers and underlying mechanisms of PE could be used to enhance care for service members,&#xD;
      veterans, and the general public. Study risks are minimal, as a small proportion of patients&#xD;
      may see temporary symptom increases as they deal with traumatic memories, but this is part of&#xD;
      the recovery process. Patients receiving the shorter treatment sessions potentially may&#xD;
      realize a lower level of treatment benefits, but preliminary evidence suggests there is good&#xD;
      reason to believe their treatment will be equally as successful as those receiving&#xD;
      traditional PE.&#xD;
