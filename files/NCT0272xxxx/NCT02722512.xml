      Immunotherapy for Brain Tumors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is usually ineffective alone, it has long been recognized that the immune system&#xD;
      of tumor bearing hosts (human and animal models) does, indeed, mount an endogenous&#xD;
      immune-mediated response to tumor. Unfortunately, this immune response alone is not&#xD;
      sufficient in combating tumor. The balance of immune response and immune regulation often&#xD;
      mitigates this anti-tumor response. Several mechanisms within tumor-bearing hosts compromise&#xD;
      the efficacy of this anti-tumor immune response, including low levels of expression of&#xD;
      co-stimulatory molecules such as the B7 family of immune-regulatory ligands, the tumor's&#xD;
      local production of immunosuppressive factors and the tumor's ability to over-express&#xD;
      pro-survival factors thus escaping destruction by the host immune system. However, many have&#xD;
      hypothesized that if this immune response can be better harnessed and/or magnified, there is&#xD;
      potential for heightened tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of specific observations support the use of immunotherapy to treat brain tumors.&#xD;
      Data published supports a possible correlation between HIV mediated immunosuppression and the&#xD;
      development of intracranial glial tumors. Immunosuppression in transplant recipients has also&#xD;
      been implicated in the development of intracranial glioma. Further supporting this hypothesis&#xD;
      are documented rare cases of long-term remission of malignant brain tumors following&#xD;
      significant post-operative infection. These observations have fueled the idea that a&#xD;
      heightened immune system may confer some protection against intracranial tumors. With this in&#xD;
      mind, one hypothesis is that successful active immunotherapy for patients with brain tumors&#xD;
      will require development of a specific peptide or polyvalent vaccines in an effort to further&#xD;
      stimulate the host's immune system against specific tumor-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been well established that mice can be immunized against syngeneic tumors. Heat shock&#xD;
      protein-peptide complexes isolated from a specific tumor can been utilized to elicit both&#xD;
      prophylactic and therapeutic immunity against the specific cancer from which the preparations&#xD;
      have been isolated. Overexpression of heat shock protein-chaperone complexes (HSPPC) in brain&#xD;
      tumor cells suggests that HSPPC are a meaningful target antigen for a brain tumor vaccine.&#xD;
      Moreover, in addition to generating tumor-specific immunity, vaccination with heat shock&#xD;
      protein peptide complexes in animal models generates therapeutic responses. Since an immune&#xD;
      response has not been widely evaluated for pediatric brain tumors, this study will test the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of producing and administering a vaccine capable of generating an&#xD;
      autologous, anti-tumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSPPC-96:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat shock proteins are up-regulated along with tissue-specific chaperone peptides in the&#xD;
      setting of cellular stress to prevent damage and aggregation of the proteome. Therefore, heat&#xD;
      shock protein peptide complexes (HSPPC) provide a cytoprotective effect. Overexpression of&#xD;
      heat shock proteins has been described in malignant glioma and medulloblastoma cells.&#xD;
      HSPPC-96 is an autologous tumor-derived vaccine that has been under clinical investigation&#xD;
      for the treatment of a variety of cancer types, including adult high-grade glioma (HGG). It&#xD;
      is composed of the 96-kilodalton (KDa) heat shock protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), attached&#xD;
      to autologous tumor-derived peptides. The gp96 glycoprotein in HSPPC-96 is a highly&#xD;
      conserved, abundant, non-polymorphic stress protein found in every cell type of the body.&#xD;
      Gp96 isolated from normal or tumor tissues is found in complex with peptides that are&#xD;
      specific to the original tissue. Mouse models have shown that HSPPC-96 confers protective&#xD;
      immunity only to the tumor from which it is derived and not to genetically distinct tumors or&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When injected into the host, HSPPC-96 interacts with antigen presenting cells (APCs) via&#xD;
      specific receptors. Once internalized by the APCs, the peptides chaperoned by the HSP are&#xD;
      transferred to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules in&#xD;
      intracellular compartments and eventually expressed at the cell surface. T-cells then&#xD;
      recognize the MHC-peptide complexes and are stimulated. HSP-peptide complexes are unique in&#xD;
      their ability to elicit an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell response. Additionally, cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are also recruited adding&#xD;
      to the tumor-associated immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some advantages of heat shock protein-peptide vaccines for immunotherapy are that it elicits&#xD;
      a cluster of differentiation (CD8+) T cell response in spite of exogenous administration, it&#xD;
      circumvents the need for identification of T-cell epitopes of individual cancers, and it&#xD;
      minimizes the possibility of generating epitope variants. Furthermore, heat shock&#xD;
      protein-peptide complexes have elicited tumor rejection and CD8+ T cell response without&#xD;
      adjuvant therapies. Heat shock protein-peptide complexes, such as HSPPC-96, can be isolated&#xD;
      from human tumors, and when injected back into the patient from whom they were isolated, may&#xD;
      present a unique opportunity to deliver a vaccine specific to that patient.&#xD;
