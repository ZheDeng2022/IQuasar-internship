      TEPHRA investigates the effect of exercise on blood pressure and other cardiovascular factors&#xD;
      in young adults with different birth histories. TEPHRA will recruit 200 participants from&#xD;
      18-35 years old with elevated blood pressure (100 participants pre-term born and 100&#xD;
      full-term born). Half of the participants from each birth group will be randomised into a 16&#xD;
      week supervised aerobic exercise intervention trial and the other half will be controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 3 main study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Baseline visit conducted at beginning of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: 16 weeks into study (upon completion of structured exercise intervention for&#xD;
           the exercise group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: End of study (52 weeks) Each visit will repeat the same set of cardiovascular&#xD;
           measures including CPET, echo, blood pressure, vascular stiffness, and other measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           50 participants from each group will complete an MRI sub-study of the heart, brain, and&#xD;
           liver.&#xD;

      DESIGN TEPHRA is a randomized control trial investigating the cardiovascular effects (blood&#xD;
      pressure, structure, and function) of aerobic exercise intervention in young adults with&#xD;
      elevated blood pressure. The trial will compare outcomes in premature born participants vs&#xD;
      full-term born participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION 1 in 4 adults develop high blood pressure, a risk factor for heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke. Although high blood pressure is becoming more common in younger adults,&#xD;
      recent literature review shows that most research on exercise and blood pressure has focused&#xD;
      on older populations. The effect of exercise on the blood pressure of preterm born young&#xD;
      adults has not been well studied or reported. Most babies are born full term (between 37-42&#xD;
      weeks gestation) but 1 in 10 babies are born early (preterm). Evidence suggests that preterm&#xD;
      birth may be associated with higher blood pressures and differences in the size, shape and&#xD;
      function of the heart and blood vessels. These differences may alter how a person's blood&#xD;
      pressure and cardiovascular system respond to exercise. These factors contributed to the&#xD;
      investigators pursuing this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a vehicle to learn more about hypertension in young adults and how exercise&#xD;
      helps reduce blood pressure. It will investigate the structure and function of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system and how it responds to exercise. It will specifically seek to improve&#xD;
      understanding of how birth histories, such as being born premature may influence blood&#xD;
      pressure and response to exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial seeks to illuminate clinically relevant information for one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      diseases in the UK (hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 in 10 babies are born preterm and studies have identified preterm birth to be associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of high blood pressure and reduced exercise capacity. This trial aims to&#xD;
      advance the understanding of how aerobic exercise affects blood pressure and cardiovascular&#xD;
      structure and function in adults aged 18-35 with different birth backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 participants (100 preterm born &amp; 100 full term born) aged 18-35 with elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via four approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Outpatient Hypertension Clinic, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Open advertising targeting Oxford residents and students&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contacting those who gave consent to be contacted for research from previous ethically&#xD;
           approved studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Local GP surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each approach has been considered from the perspective of the participant and discussed with&#xD;
      our public and patient involvement group. Collaboration from the clinical team running the&#xD;
      hypertension service will mirror the process used in the YACHT2 study (NHS REC Form&#xD;

&#xD;
      i)Participant Consent The informed consent process is intended to facilitate participants'&#xD;
      understanding of the study. Full study information will be provided to participants in&#xD;
      advance of seeking consent, allowing time to interpret the information and ask related&#xD;
      questions. Trained study investigators will facilitate the informed consent process.&#xD;
      Participants lacking capacity to provide informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii)Participant Safety Prior to enrollment in the study participants will be given opportunity&#xD;
      to fully consider the study procedures. The study team places emphasis on participants&#xD;
      understanding that study procedures involve performing a maximal exercise tests and wearing&#xD;
      monitoring devices (blood pressure, and physical activity) in their home environments as part&#xD;
      of the study. The team will also emphasize that participants will be randomly placed into&#xD;
      either the exercise or control group and the exercise group in particular will require a&#xD;
      substantial commitment of time and physical effort to complete the 16 week intervention&#xD;
      goals. The intervention support team will provide individual guidance and support to the&#xD;
      exercise group to support participants in achieving their exercise goals in the safest manner&#xD;
      possible. The exercise intervention component is designed at an intensity level (60-80% of&#xD;
      max heart rate) and frequency (3 times per week) that is consistent with standard guidelines&#xD;
      for safely building aerobic fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will emphasize that the MRI sub-study involves undergoing magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging with strong magnetic fields and requires additional screening for contraindications.&#xD;
      All participants will be fully screened to ensure there are no contraindications to safely&#xD;
      participating in the study. The study procedures are safe and commonly used in both research&#xD;
      and clinical practice. Participation in the study does not pose significant risk or burden to&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY All information and documents collected will be stored securely and kept in&#xD;
      strict confidence in compliance with Caldicott Principles and the Data Protection Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v)Study samples, investigation results and incidental findings. The use of the participants'&#xD;
      study samples and investigations are clearly defined in the participant information leaflet&#xD;
      and will be explained during the informed consent process. The investigations used in the&#xD;
      study are purely for research purposes but standard operating procedures are in place in the&#xD;
      unlikely event of incidental findings that are significant to the participants' well-being.&#xD;
      It is possible that some samples will be used for genetic research. The genetic tests would&#xD;
      involve looking at common variations in genes that affect how blood vessels work. We do not&#xD;
      propose to test for inherited genetic diseases. There is no evidence to suggest that the&#xD;
      results of these genetic studies are likely to have significant implications for the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Completion of the Study The participant information leaflets and informed consent process&#xD;
      clearly explain the intended outcomes of the study and how participant information will be&#xD;
      stored. At the end of the study, the study team will coordinate dissemination of data from&#xD;
      this study via journal abstracts, articles, and oral/written presentations. Any scientific&#xD;
      publications arising from the study will be available on request to all participants as well&#xD;
      as a summary of the main findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSIDERATION OF NULL HYPOTHESES A null hypotheses that &quot;sustained aerobic exercise does not&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure in preterm born young adults&quot; was not selected. Rather, studies in&#xD;
      older cohorts (birth backgrounds not assessed) strongly suggests that regular aerobic&#xD;
      exercise has a blood pressure reducing effect. Previous research has identified differences&#xD;
      in the structure and function of the heart and blood vessels of preterm born young adults vs&#xD;
      full term born. Accordingly, the hypothesis that &quot;regular aerobic exercise will elicit&#xD;
      different blood pressure lowering effects in premature born young adults with elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure vs full-term born young adults with elevated blood pressure&quot; will be tested in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE SELECTION Recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials&#xD;
      identified an average decrease of 5.4mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) post-intervention&#xD;
      via supervised exercise in young adults with prehypertension (mean systolic blood pressure at&#xD;
      baseline 126 mmHg). The post intervention standard deviation of change was 8.7 mmHg. The&#xD;
      investigators' available cross-sectional pilot data suggests that change will be higher in&#xD;
      the preterm born participants and participants exposed to maternal hypertension during&#xD;
      pregnancy. To calculate the sample size, the investigators used an estimated change of 5 mmHg&#xD;
      following 4 months of intervention. The investigators used a SD of 11.3 from the pooled SD&#xD;
      for ambulatory systolic blood pressure from cross-sectional pilot data. To observe a&#xD;
      treatment effect on systolic blood pressure of 5mmHg, powered to 80% (p=0.05) requires a&#xD;
      total sample size of 164 participants. The SD deviation for the pooled 24 hour awake&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure is 8.3 mmHg. To observe a treatment effect on diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure of 5mmHg, powered to 80% (p=0.05) requires a total sample size of 114 participants.&#xD;
      The power calculations for systolic blood pressure are used to determine the final sample&#xD;
      size, with adjustment to 200 participants to allow for 18% attrition. To ensure primary&#xD;
      objectives for the study are answered the study team may recruit additional participants to&#xD;
      replace those who drop out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY THE DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY WAS SELECTED The TEPHRA design and methodology was selected to&#xD;
      build on two closely related ongoing studies, EXPRESSO and YACHT2 (summarised below).&#xD;
      EXPRESSO and YACHT2 collect data that provides significant insight into better characterizing&#xD;
      the activity norms and cardiovascular systems of young adults with various birth backgrounds.&#xD;
      TEPHRA advances these research themes by employing an intervention arm (aerobic exercise) to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of exercise on blood pressure and the structure and function of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING A CONTROL ARM Previous studies have identified anatomical and&#xD;
      functional differences in the cardiovascular systems of preterm born young adults compared to&#xD;
      full-term born controls. The investigators seek to understand the clinical significance of&#xD;
      these differences, the response to treatment (in this case exercise) can only be properly&#xD;
      assessed by comparing the preterm born cohort against controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINIMISATION OF RESEARCHER EFFECTS AND BIAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the intervention (supervised exercise sessions vs &quot;normal&quot; activity&#xD;
      levels), TEPHRA is an unblinded trial. However, numerous measures will be taken to minimize&#xD;
      investigator effects including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All MRI sub-study images will be assessed by investigators who are blinded to&#xD;
           participant details&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- All other images (ie. Ultrasound of heart and small blood vessel imaging) will be&#xD;
           assessed by investigators who are blinded to participant details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of all blood samples will be completed by laboratories or investigators who are&#xD;
           blinded to participant details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention support protocols are standardised for all participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention team field lead (conducts gym visits etc.) is blinded to participant&#xD;
           details and does not collect primary study measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING VISITS Screening Visit Procedures (Visit 0, total time 1 hour) Height, weight, body&#xD;
      composition, and blood pressure will be collected. The investigators will also ask candidates&#xD;
      to provide information about their medical history and physical activity, and birth history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) (20 Minutes) An ECG, will be accomplished to check basic heart&#xD;
           function by placing 12 sticky pads on the chest to record the electrical signals the&#xD;
           heart makes when it beats. If desired, the investigators will arrange for a candidate's&#xD;
           preference of a male or female investigator to set up the ECG. The ECG will take about&#xD;
           20 minutes and will be reviewed by a trained physician. Provided the candidate is happy&#xD;
           to continue and there are no exclusionary criteria met, an investigator would then fit&#xD;
           the candidate with a 24 hour blood pressure monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fitting of 24 hour monitoring equipment (5 minutes) If the screening indicates that the&#xD;
           candidate may be a good fit for the trial, the study team will also ask the candidate to&#xD;
           wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours. It consists of a blood pressure cuff worn on&#xD;
           the upper arm that easily fits under clothing. The cuff is attached by a lead to a small&#xD;
           box which is slightly larger than a deck of cards. This can be placed in a pocket or&#xD;
           attached to a belt provided by the research team. The cuff will inflate and deflates&#xD;
           every 30 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes at night to measure blood pressure.&#xD;
           It is unlikely that it will disturb sleep and participants are asked to power off the&#xD;
           monitor while driving (the research team will show them how to turn the device on and&#xD;
           off). A postage paid, addressed envelope will be provided to return the monitor. If all&#xD;
           the screening measures indicate that the candidate is a good, safe match for the trail&#xD;
           and would like to proceed, the investigators will arrange a convenient time for them to&#xD;
           meet for their main trial visits at the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility at the&#xD;
           John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN STUDY VISITS COMPLETION OF STUDY VISITS 1-3 (3 hours per visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main visits planned for each participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: conducted at the beginning of trial (baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: conducted ~16 weeks into trial (this visit coincides with completion of the&#xD;
           structured exercise intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: conducted after 52 weeks (at the end of the trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note - If Visit 1 is within 30 days of the screening and the participant has had no change in&#xD;
      medical or physical activity status, some basic physical measures (ie. 24 hour blood pressure&#xD;
      and body composition) will not be re-assessed. Apart from this noted exception, the same&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated at trial visits 1-3. Participants will be asked to have only&#xD;
      water for 4 hours before each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire (30 minutes) This will collect more detailed information about physical&#xD;
           activities and also lifestyle information such as daily routines and use of alcohol and&#xD;
           tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Measures (15 minutes) (as noted, if the baseline visit is within 30 days of&#xD;
           screening, some measures will not be repeated). THe investigators will measure blood&#xD;
           pressure and ask participants to walk on the flat for 10 meters while wearing a&#xD;
           belt-mounted sensor. The participant will be asked to give a urine sample to test for&#xD;
           the presence of protein as an indicator of cardiovascular and blood vessel function&#xD;
           related to blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular Measures (45 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Small vessel imaging The investigators will use a special camera to take a picture&#xD;
                of the blood vessels in the participants' retina. This is a simple, non-invasive&#xD;
                procedure which uses a special camera that looks through the pupil to observe the&#xD;
                blood vessels in the back of the eye. This is painless and does not require any&#xD;
                physical contact with the eye. The investigators may also use a special microscope&#xD;
                to take video images of the small blood vessels on the back of a finger. This is&#xD;
                also a painless, non-invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vascular stiffness measurement The investigators will measure stiffness of the&#xD;
                blood vessels by placing an inflatable cuff on one arm and also above one knee.&#xD;
                This is also a painless, non-invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Echocardiogram The investigators will perform an ultrasound (Echocardiogram or&#xD;
                &quot;ECHO&quot;) of the heart. Participants will be asked to disrobe down to the waist and&#xD;
                put on a hospital gown that is untied at the front to allow the study investigators&#xD;
                access to place the ultrasound probe on the chest. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
                padded treatment table on their left side. The probe is placed on chest and&#xD;
                lubricating jelly is used so the probe makes good contact with the skin. Ultrasound&#xD;
                waves then create images of the heart on the scanner monitor. The research team are&#xD;
                trained to perform echocardiograms, and will ensure that privacy is maintained&#xD;
                throughout the visit. Participants can request that a same gender echocardiographer&#xD;
                perform the echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (50 minutes) During the exercise testing, participants&#xD;
           will be asked to donate a total of up to 150mLs (8 to 9 tablespoons) of blood at each&#xD;
           trial visit. The blood samples will be stored and analysed for natural compounds and&#xD;
           genes involved in blood vessel function and cardiovascular disease development. To allow&#xD;
           for collection of blood samples, a cannula will be placed in a vein in the participants'&#xD;
           hand or arm. The cannula is a very small, flexible plastic tube that is inserted using a&#xD;
           needle and allows for collection of blood without the need for multiple needle pricks.&#xD;
           It is also possible to have conventional blood sampling, involving a number of needle&#xD;
           pricks, if preferred by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise testing will allow assessment of heart and lung function during exercise and is the&#xD;
      same test used on athletes to see how well they respond to exercise. The exercise test will&#xD;
      be performed on a stationary bike. We will ask participants to wear appropriate clothing to&#xD;
      exercise in such as shorts or loose fitting track trousers and a comfortable top (hospital&#xD;
      scrubs available if needed). Participants will breathe through an opening in a mask worn over&#xD;
      their mouth and nose whilst exercising which will allow the measurement of oxygen use and&#xD;
      fitness. Participants may stop the test at any time for any reason. As they cycle on the&#xD;
      bike, their body response such as heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded.&#xD;
      Participants will wear a blood pressure cuff on one arm which will be inflated occasionally&#xD;
      throughout the cycle test. The investigators will place three small sticky pads on&#xD;
      participants' back to record and ECG during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise testing lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and participants will pedal against&#xD;
      gradually increasing resistance. The test is designed to be increasingly difficult as it&#xD;
      progresses and will be very physically demanding for the last 3-4 minutes. This is likely to&#xD;
      make participants feel quite exhausted, breathe heavily and their leg muscles may ache&#xD;
      (particularly if they are not accustomed to exercise). After the test participants will pedal&#xD;
      against minimal resistance for a cool down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      --Blood Sampling Before, immediately following, and 20 minutes after the exercise test the&#xD;
      cannula in the back of the hand or arm will be used to take a sample of blood. This will&#xD;
      allow the study team to measure changes in blood associated with exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MONITORING An independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor and audit the research&#xD;
      project and data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS The analysis will be carried out on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT). This is,&#xD;
      after randomisation, participants will be analysed according to their allocated intervention&#xD;
      group irrespective of what they actually receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic characteristics and other baseline information will be summarised by&#xD;
      treatment group. Numbers (with percentages) for binary and categorical variables and mean&#xD;
      (standard deviation), or median (interquartile or full range) for continuous variables will&#xD;
      be presented. Normality of variables will be assessed by visual assessment of the normality&#xD;
      curves and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The analysis of the primary outcome will be assessed using&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline values and minimisation factors used&#xD;
      in the randomisation process. Results will be presented as adjusted mean difference in change&#xD;
      in ambulatory blood pressure between randomised groups at 4 months with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CI) and associated two-sided p value. The analysis of secondary outcomes will also&#xD;
      be done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to establish a co-variant model to examine the&#xD;
      effect of cardiac structure, vascular function and lifestyle behaviours on exercise capacity.&#xD;
      Outcomes measured on more than one occasion will be analysed using a mixed effects model. If&#xD;
      the model assumptions are not met and evidence of departure from Normality is observed,&#xD;
      transformations of the data will be employed or non-parametric tests will be carried out.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out using STATA or SPSS statistical software.&#xD;
