  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive lentigo maligna (LM) is characterized by an in situ proliferation of melanoma&#xD;
      cells, limited to the epidermis. It is found most commonly on the head and neck of elderly&#xD;
      persons, with a peak incidence in the seventh or eighth decade. If untreated, it may develop&#xD;
      into invasive melanoma. The gold standard treatment for LM is surgery using a 5-10 mm margin.&#xD;
      However, the lesions can be large, and conventional surgery can be difficult, particularly on&#xD;
      the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, there is a need for a topical non-surgical treatment of LM. Ingenol mebutate&#xD;
      (IM)/Picato® is able to induce cell apoptosis and an inflammatory reaction in the epidermis&#xD;
      and superficial dermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that the topical use of Picato® could induce the cure or&#xD;
      a prolonged remission of non-invasive LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the exploratory phase of this study (no case report and no clinical trial at the&#xD;
      early phase of designing this study, only one case report at the time of submission of this&#xD;
      form) the investigators will conduct an open label study limited to patients who are not&#xD;
      eligible to, or who refuse surgical treatment of their LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine the proportion of patients with complete&#xD;
      response (CR) obtained 2 months after one or two cycles (for patients who did not respond to&#xD;
      the first cycle) of topical treatment by IM 150 µg/g for non-invasive LM of the face (head&#xD;
      and neck).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lentigo maligna (LM) is a form of malignant melanoma in situ seen predominantly on&#xD;
      chronically sun-damaged skin. It is found most commonly on the head and neck of elderly&#xD;
      persons, with a peak incidence in the seventh or eighth decade. If untreated, it may develop&#xD;
      into invasive melanoma. The gold standard treatment for LM is surgery using a 5-10 mm margin.&#xD;
      However, the lesions can be large, and conventional surgery can be difficult, particularly on&#xD;
      the face. Furthermore, the extent of LM tends to be underestimated because the exact limits&#xD;
      of the lesion are not always easy to determine. Thus, relapses and repeated surgical&#xD;
      procedures are common. Moreover, LM appears in elderly people who often have anaesthetic&#xD;
      contraindications. When surgery is not or no more feasible, superficial radiotherapy or&#xD;
      destructive treatment by topical immunotherapy using imiquimod 5% cream may be used, but the&#xD;
      efficacy of these treatments remains to be clearly defined. Regarding the use of imiquimod it&#xD;
      has been reported in about 15 isolated cases and in 7 open studies (most of them prospective)&#xD;
      for a total of 189 patients. The modalities of use were variable but most of the time once a&#xD;
      day, 5 days per week for 3 months. The response rate varied from 53 % to 100%. The major&#xD;
      limitations to the use of imiquimod are: 1- a possible lower rate of remission than surgery;&#xD;
      2- the observance of a topical irritating treatment for an extended period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is a need for a topical non-surgical treatment of LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Picato® is a topical gel for cutaneous application that contains the active substance ingenol&#xD;
      mebutate, which is obtained from the aerial parts of the plant species Euphorbia peplus. by&#xD;
      extraction and purification. It is indicated for the cutaneous treatment of&#xD;
      non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratosis in adults. The mechanism of action of&#xD;
      ingenol mebutate in actinic keratosis is not fully understood. In vivo and in vitro models&#xD;
      have shown a dual mechanism of action: 1) induction of local lesion cell death and 2)&#xD;
      promotion of an inflammatory response characterised by infiltration of immunocompetent cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this effect on actinic keratoses, a recent study has shown that treatment of&#xD;
      superficial basal cell carcinomas with ingenol mebutate gel 500 µg/g under occlusion with an&#xD;
      aluminum disk, was efficacious, even when applied only for one day. On the contrary, the same&#xD;
      treatment for up to 3 consecutive days showed less clinical benefit in seborrheic keratoses,&#xD;
      suggesting a selectivity or penetration variations of ingenol mebutate for cancer cells vs&#xD;
      benign cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, it has been shown that ingenol mebutate is able to kill melanoma cells mainly by&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis which seems to be secondary to the activation of Protein Kinase C.&#xD;
      Based on these data and on previous studies with imiquimod, the investigators suggest that&#xD;
      ingenol mebutate might have a clinical effect on melanoma, particularly for superficial&#xD;
      intraepidermal lesions of LM. Because these lesions are mostly localised on the face, the&#xD;
      concentration of 150 µg/g should be tested first to avoid local skin secondary effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the topical use of Picato® will induce the cure or a&#xD;
      prolonged remission of non-invasive LM in patients that are not eligible to or refuse&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine the proportion of patients with complete&#xD;
      response (CR) obtained 2 months after one or two cycles (for patients who did not respond to&#xD;
      the first cycle) of topical treatment by IM 150 µg/g for non-invasive LM of the face (head&#xD;
      and neck).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the disease-free survival after 1 or 2 cycles of IM 150μg / g. for&#xD;
           non-invasive LM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM)&#xD;
           and High Definition Optical Coherence Tomography (HD-OCT) for diagnosis of treatment&#xD;
           failure and relapse of LM compared to the standard represented by pathological&#xD;
           examination, in monitoring of treatment response and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be included after providing informed consent if they have a biopsy-proven&#xD;
      non-invasive LM on the head (face or scalp) and if they are not eligible to, or if they&#xD;
      refuse surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will apply on and 1 cm around the lesion, 0.47 g of Picato® gel 150 µg/g, once a day on&#xD;
      3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short term efficacy will be evaluated at 2 months, clinically (with Wood's lamp and&#xD;
      dermoscopic examination) and histopathologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients being cured at 2 months, the long term efficacy will be evaluated every 6 months&#xD;
      for 36 months, using the same criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients having no or only partial remission at 2 months, the treatment will be applied&#xD;
      using the same protocol (0.47 g of Picato® gel 150 µg/g, once a day on 3 consecutive days on&#xD;
      and 1 cm around the lesion). They will be evaluated 2 months after the retreatment and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 36 months. The safety and local side effects will be evaluated at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For centers equipped with in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and high-definition&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), patients will have imaging of the lesion with these&#xD;
      techniques before and after treatment.&#xD;
