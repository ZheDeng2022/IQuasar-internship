      Preventive analgesia is when an administered analgesic drug provides reduction in pain beyond&#xD;
      its duration of action. This can be used to reduce acute postoperative pain and prevent&#xD;
      occurrence of chronic post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), chronic pain can be&#xD;
      defined as pain that persisted beyond the time of normal tissue healing (usually 3 months)&#xD;
      and that was not related to other causes. Mastectomy is associated with a high incidence of&#xD;
      chronic post-surgical pain. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting females&#xD;
      around the world. Many undergo mastectomy as part of curative treatment. However, a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients experience chronic post-surgical pain. This results in&#xD;
      significant negative impact on physical, psychological and social wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic drug with analgesic effects. It can be used to treat&#xD;
      both acute and chronic pain. A recent meta-analysis of different surgeries showed that&#xD;
      patients receiving ketamine had a modest but statistically significant reduction in incidence&#xD;
      of chronic post-surgical pain. In a small sample single dose pilot study, patients given low&#xD;
      dose intravenous ketamine intraoperatively had a statistically non-significant reduction in&#xD;
      incidence of pain around the surgical scar at three months after radical mastectomy.&#xD;
      Randomized control trials with larger sample sizes are needed to determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      and optimal dosing regime of ketamine for reduction of chronic post-mastectomy pain. It is&#xD;
      therefore hypothesized that intravenous ketamine given intraoperatively will reduce the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of chronic pain after modified radical mastectomy. A double blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing placebo group with two different doses of ketamine is&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of ketamine in reducing pain is complex and multiple. How ketamine&#xD;
      can prevent and reduce chronic pain is unknown. Ketamine has been shown to reduce immediate&#xD;
      gene expression at site of mechanical injury. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1&#xD;
      (TRPV1) and Transient Receptor Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) are receptors shown to mediate acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain. Ketamine, shown to affect gene expression, may alter the expression of TRPV1&#xD;
      and TRPA1 via epigenetic mechanisms.&#xD;

      Procedures Patients will be approached at the preadmission clinic or in the general ward&#xD;
      before operation. The analgesic methods will be explained and s/he will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study if s/he agrees. The patient will be randomized into one of three groups. The patients&#xD;
      in the first group (C) will receive intraoperative morphine, local wound infiltration with&#xD;
      local anaesthetic, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor post-operatively, and post operative&#xD;
      Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) morphine. Patients in the second (K1) and third groups&#xD;
      (K2) will receive different doses of intraoperative intravenous ketamine in addition to&#xD;
      intraoperative morphine, local wound infiltration with local anaesthetic, COX-2 inhibitor,&#xD;
      and PCA morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding Patients recruited for mastectomy will be stratified in&#xD;
      randomization. To ensure equal distribution of patients between each type of operation&#xD;
      (modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection and mastectomy with sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      without axillary dissection) block randomization will be used. There will be 9 blocks of 15&#xD;
      patients for each type of operation. The allocation order will be selected by a computer&#xD;
      generated random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind randomized control trial. Both the patients and the investigators will&#xD;
      be blinded to the allocated analgesic modalities: ie the administration of ketamine. Ketamine&#xD;
      or normal saline (placebo) will be prepared by clinical staff who will not participate in&#xD;
      observation and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected during the perioperative period:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Time to recovery of food intake (fluid, semisolid and solid diet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to ambulation (bed rest, sit up, sit out of bed, walk with aid, walk without aid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical and anaesthetic complications, if any (wound infection, urinary retention,&#xD;
           etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction upon discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data would be obtained at 3 and 6 months after surgery:&#xD;

           the ipsilateral arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any analgesic consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nature of pain: nociceptive, neuropathic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timing of pain occurrence: continuous, related to movement, intermittent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any abnormal sensation or loss of sensation over operated side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related quality of life (HRQOL) data obtained with the Chinese (Hong Kong)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  If, at certain time point after operation, patient cannot be managed according to the&#xD;
           protocol due to any reason such as development of complication, no further data will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taking for assessment of genetic, epigenetic factors and biomarkers Blood (10mls in&#xD;
      tubes with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as preservative) will be taken immediately&#xD;
      pre-surgery, immediately post-surgery, one day post-surgery, three days post-surgery, and at&#xD;
      3 and 6-months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Intention-to-treat will be used. Patients will remain in their initial&#xD;
      designated groups for data analysis even if there is a change in surgical or&#xD;
      anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they have had a laparoscopic incision during the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods used:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative vital signs, HRQOL, HADS: Repeated measures ANOVA (with Bonferroni&#xD;
           correction when appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects and postoperative complications: Chi Square test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between development&#xD;
           (or non-development) of chronic pain and DNA methylation status of TRPV1 and TRPA1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a significant result was obtained, t-test or Mann-Whitney test for numerical values&#xD;
           and Chi-square test for categorical data will be applied for post hoc pairwise&#xD;
           comparisons.&#xD;
