  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB), defined as simultaneous resistance to isoniazid&#xD;
      and rifampin, has been declared a global emergency. Treatment outcomes are poor, driven by&#xD;
      toxicity and limited efficacy of the 2nd-line anti-TB drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is evidence that both anti-TB activity and most of the toxicity of the key&#xD;
      drugs are related to drug exposure, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships&#xD;
      in patients with MDR-TB are poorly characterized. Moreover potential synergy of drug&#xD;
      combinations has not been identified in the context of MDR-TB, dosing has not taken into&#xD;
      account the concentrations needed to suppress resistance, and the role of minimum inhibitory&#xD;
      concentrations (MICs) in dosing is poorly studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are therefore opportunities to optimize drug doses and combinations to improve&#xD;
      efficacy, and reduce toxicity. Based on this observational study of patients on standard&#xD;
      treatment for MDR-TB, our proposal builds on novel methodologies we have developed, largely&#xD;
      for drug sensitive TB:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The application of computational analytical techniques to tease out the individual&#xD;
           contributions of anti-TB drugs used in combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The development of a treatment response biomarker model based on time-to-positivity in&#xD;
           liquid culture of serial sputum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The in vitro determination of PK targets for anti-TB activity and the suppression of&#xD;
           resistance using the hollow fiber models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) (HFM-TB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the research will enhance our understanding of current modalities of TB treatment, while&#xD;
      contributing research approaches for future regimen optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes the clinical research component (points 1&amp;2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To characterize the effects of 2nd-line drug exposures on treatment response in MDR-TB&#xD;
      patients. The 2nd-line drugs to be examined are those comprising the standardized regimen&#xD;
      used in South Africa: kanamycin, pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin, ethionamide and terizidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Amongst patients on standard MDR-TB treatment, variation in drug exposure has a&#xD;
      quantifiable impact on the rates at which viable Mtb are cleared from the sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify drug exposures associated with the risk of treatment-related toxicities in&#xD;
      patients on a standard 2nd-line regimen for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The risks of specific toxicities associated with kanamycin, pyrazinamide,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin, ethionamide and terizidone are linked to drug concentrations.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To characterize the effects of 2nd-line drug exposures on treatment response in MDR-TB&#xD;
      patients. The 2nd-line drugs to be examined are those comprising the standardized regimen&#xD;
      used in South Africa: kanamycin, pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin, ethionamide and terizidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Amongst patients on standard MDR-TB treatment, variation in drug exposure has a&#xD;
      quantifiable impact on the rates at which viable Mtb are cleared from the sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: There is substantial variability in the PK parameters of the 2nd-line drugs&#xD;
      between patients, and in the susceptibility of individual Mtb isolates to those drugs.&#xD;
      Concentration-dependent activity has been demonstrated for moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide and&#xD;
      aminoglycosides, and higher doses of moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide have been proposed.&#xD;
      Studies are needed to identify the most important determinants of treatment response and to&#xD;
      describe the optimal drug exposures in MDR-TB, taking MICs into account. We will describe the&#xD;
      exponential decline of viable Mtb in the sputum of MDR-TB patients in a treatment response&#xD;
      model based on time-to-positivity in liquid culture, thus furthering the field of TB&#xD;
      biomarker research. We will then define the relationship between PK and the rates of&#xD;
      eradication of viable Mtb from the sputum of patients on the standard MDR-TB regimen to&#xD;
      identify the more potent drugs driving treatment response, and to identify synergism or&#xD;
      antagonism between individual drugs. Examples of specific questions that will be addressed&#xD;
      include: What is the impact of pyrazinamide resistance on treatment response?; What is the&#xD;
      impact of inhA mutations on the effect of ethionamide?; and, Should a higher doses of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide be considered?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify drug exposures associated with the risk of treatment-related toxicities in&#xD;
      patients on a standard 2nd-line regimen for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The risks of specific toxicities associated with kanamycin, pyrazinamide,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin, ethionamide and terizidone are linked to drug concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Treatment limiting adverse drug effects are common in patients on MDR-TB treatment&#xD;
      regimens. Although several common toxicities are linked to specific drugs and are thought to&#xD;
      be dose-related, the relationship between PK and toxicity has not been adequately studied.&#xD;
      Overlapping toxicity of antiretroviral drugs in HIV-infected patients, amongst other risk&#xD;
      factors, may be contributory. Minimum drug concentration thresholds associated with increased&#xD;
      toxicity would allow optimization of doses by targeting concentrations below which toxicity&#xD;
      is common, but above which there is optimal efficacy.&#xD;
