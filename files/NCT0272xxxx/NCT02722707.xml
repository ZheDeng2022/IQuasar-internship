  <brief_summary>

      This registration is for clinical use of the FENIX, a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) for fecal&#xD;
      incontinence. This device is indicated for the treatment of fecal incontinence in patients&#xD;
      who are not candidates for or have previously failed conservative treatment and less invasive&#xD;
      therapy options (e.g. bulking agents, radiofrequency ablation, sacral nerve stimulation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FENIX is surgically placed. This surgery could be an outpatient procedure or at most an&#xD;
      overnight stay in the hospital. The design of the device allows it to be effective&#xD;
      immediately. The device is similar to the LINX device used for esophageal reflux. It is a&#xD;
      circular set of magnets which surrounds the ano-rectal support. The size of the device is&#xD;
      determined at the time of surgery so that the ano-rectum is closed. When the patient strains&#xD;
      at stool, this pressure separates the magnets and allows passage of stool. The magnets are&#xD;
      held together by an independent malleable titanium wire. Once straining at stool stops, the&#xD;
      magnets are able to re-connect or close the rectum. We will monitor patients for&#xD;
      postoperative complications related to surgery.&#xD;
