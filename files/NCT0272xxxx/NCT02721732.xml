  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with rare&#xD;
      tumors that cannot be removed by surgery or have spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block specific proteins found on white&#xD;
      blood cells which may strengthen the immune system and control tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain early indication of efficacy by evaluation of non-progression rate (NPR) at 27&#xD;
      weeks as defined as the percentage of patients who are alive and progression-free at 27 weeks&#xD;
      as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 or&#xD;
      immune-related(ir)RECIST or method of tumor evaluation criteria best suitable and accepted&#xD;
      for the tumor type evaluated in patients with advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate efficacy by evaluation of tumor size to programmed cell death 1 ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) status among patients with advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the percentage of patients with objective response (complete response [CR]&#xD;
      or partial response [PR]), clinical benefit (CR, PR, or stable disease [SD] &gt;= 4 months),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response (DOR) as&#xD;
      assessed by RECIST v1.1 in patients with advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the percentage of patients with objective response (CR or PR), clinical&#xD;
      benefit (CR, PR, or SD &gt;= 4 months), PFS, and DOR as assessed by irRECIST in patients with&#xD;
      advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate the NPR at 27 weeks (9 cycles), objective response (CR or PR), clinical&#xD;
      benefit CR, PR, or SD &gt;= 4 months), PFS, OS, and DOR to PD-L1 status among patients with&#xD;
      advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the potential role of tumor-associated immune biomarkers for prediction of&#xD;
      therapy effectiveness in patients with advanced tumor types receiving pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the potential role of tumor-associated immune biomarkers for prediction of&#xD;
      therapy effectiveness to PD-L1 status among patients with advanced tumor types receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify imaging characteristics associated with immunological changes in tumor&#xD;
      following treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare tumor mutation burden and serial assessment of mutation status in biopsies&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and progression in patients with advanced tumor types receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) utilizing the National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      with clinical response or disease stabilization may continue treatment for up to an&#xD;
      additional 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
