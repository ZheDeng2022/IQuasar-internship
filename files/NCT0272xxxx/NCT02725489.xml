  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about Vigil and durvalumab in advanced&#xD;
      women's cancers: 1) how much of Vigil in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) can be given&#xD;
      with an acceptable level of side effects, 2) the effects of Vigil and durvalumab in&#xD;
      combination (good and bad), 3) if Vigil will cause changes in cancer cells that may help&#xD;
      durvalumab attack the cancer, and 4) whether or not Vigil and durvalumab will slow your&#xD;
      cancer or stop your cancer from getting worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining Vigil with durvalumab will allow the former to induce (or increase) the&#xD;
      infiltration of activated T cells into tumors, and in addition, to enhance PD-L1 (programmed&#xD;
      cell death ligand 1) expression. Consequently, the response rate of historically low or&#xD;
      un-responsive cancer will be increased with the combination of Vigil and anti PD-L1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of Vigil autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and durvalumab PD-L1 inhibitor in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic women's cancers, inclusive, but not limited to&#xD;
      breast, ovarian, cervical, uterine, fallopian, primary peritoneal, and endometrial regardless&#xD;
      of the number of prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 2-part study. The first part will be a safety run-in comprised of 2 cohorts&#xD;
      that will use a 3 + 3 design to determine the Vigil dose in Part 2. Patients in Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      receive a low dose of Vigil (1x10^6 cells/intradermal (ID) injection) in combination with&#xD;
      durvalumab (1500 mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. Patients in Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      receive Vigil at 1x10^7 cells/ID injection and durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes) every 4 weeks. If needed, patients in Cohort -1 will receive Vigil at 1x10^5&#xD;
      cells/ID injection and durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      enrollment of the first two patients in each Cohort of Part 1 will be staggered by 2 weeks.&#xD;
      In Part 2 of the study, patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive Vigil at the&#xD;
      dose determined in Part 1 and durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4&#xD;
      weeks. As of March 13, 2018, Part 2 of the study will not be initiated due to limited&#xD;
      enrollment. Currently only patients who have Vigil immunotherapy available from Gradalis&#xD;
      protocol CL-PTL-119 may be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological assessment of tumor response or alternative assessments of disease status should&#xD;
      be performed at screening, Cycle 3 and every 2 cycle thereafter, and end of treatment (EOT)&#xD;
      using RECIST 1.1 and investigator assessment as applicable. Tumor biopsy for correlative&#xD;
      studies including but not limited to scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1&#xD;
      / PD-L1 expression analysis should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 3, and&#xD;
      optional biopsies thereafter if the patient has accessible tissue. Peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained at pre-procurement if&#xD;
      applicable, and prior to study regimen administration at Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5 and EOT.&#xD;
      Patient survival will be followed for 1 year after last dose of either Vigil or durvalumab.&#xD;
