    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete&#xD;
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP [Blood Pressure], PR&#xD;
             [Pulse Rate]), 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 45 to 65 years (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;
             accordance with GCP and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 4 months after&#xD;
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at least&#xD;
             2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants, injectables,&#xD;
             combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms plus intrauterine device or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms plus partner of non-childbearing potential (including homosexual men) Subjects&#xD;
             are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the partner to the study&#xD;
             drug via seminal fluid. Male and female condoms must not be used together.&#xD;
             Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the subject's&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually active but becomes&#xD;
             active, with their partner, they must comply with the contraceptive requirements&#xD;
             detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from&#xD;
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory (including but&#xD;
             not limited to interstitial lung disease), cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or&#xD;
             hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with&#xD;
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia&#xD;
             repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial&#xD;
             medication or its excipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10&#xD;
             half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/heart&#xD;
             rate-corrected QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoker (more than 5 cigarettes or 1 cigar or 1 pipe per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average intake of more than 24 units of alcohol per week (1 unit of alcohol equals&#xD;
             approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/heart rate-corrected QT interval (such as heart&#xD;
             rate-corrected QT intervals following the formula of Fridericia that are repeatedly&#xD;
             greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a&#xD;
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background&#xD;
             radiation but including diagnostic x-rays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5 mSv&#xD;
             in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 10 years. No occupationally exposed&#xD;
             worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Irregular defecation pattern (less than a mean of one bowel movement a day)&#xD;
&#xD;
