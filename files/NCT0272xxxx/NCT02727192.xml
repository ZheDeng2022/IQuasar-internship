  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance in adults, with&#xD;
      prevalence expected to rise significantly the coming decades. The occurrence of AF is&#xD;
      associated with significantly increased mortality as well as morbidity of which&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accidents is the most important. Unfortunately treatment options remain&#xD;
      limited. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are widely used but have limited efficacy and the potential&#xD;
      for toxicity and adverse events are recognized. Recent year's catheter ablation of AF&#xD;
      continues to gain acceptance for symptomatic treatment, but recurrence rate are high with&#xD;
      need for continuous medication. Thus there is a need to better understand what causes&#xD;
      development and triggers episodes of AF as well to introduce new treatment options.&#xD;
      Cardiometabolic factors such as obesity, inactivity and sleep apnea (SA) have therefore&#xD;
      gained interest. Many patients with AF have chronic sleep apnea, and in the present study the&#xD;
      investigators want to explore the interaction between SA and AF. The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      present study is that SA may trigger AF and that treatment of SA will reduce the overall&#xD;
      burden of AF as well as reduce the recurrence of AF after pulmonary vein ablation. To test&#xD;
      the hypothesis the investigators will implant a Reveal device that continuously records the&#xD;
      hearts rhythm of 100 patients with paroxysmal AF and concomitant SA. Initially the influence&#xD;
      of SA on onset of AF will be examined, and the patients will then be randomized to treatment&#xD;
      of SA or not and the influence on total AF burden recorded both before and after ablation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the present project the investigators have established a research team from 2 different&#xD;
      university hospitals. This team, including high ranked, internationally renowned scientist&#xD;
      from both clinical and basic sciences, will make a framework for PhD candidates and will&#xD;
      ensure the patient cohort. Patients with paroxysmal AF and SA will be examined with an&#xD;
      extensive diagnostic battery including advanced cardiac imaging tools allowing a proper&#xD;
      description of the heart. Then a Reveal that continuously monitor the rhythm of the heart&#xD;
      will be inserted, allowing the influence of SA, physical activity, inflammatory parameters,&#xD;
      and other external variables on total AF burden to be examined. The patients will then be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment of SA with a CPAP or not, and the AF burden recorded 6 months before&#xD;
      ablation and 6 months after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present investigations carried out, are expected to results in better understanding of&#xD;
      the interaction between AF and SA and may lay the scientific basis for better diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches for patients with AF. In addition, given the advantage of continuous&#xD;
      Reveal® recording of the patient's heart rhythm, the present study will examine possible&#xD;
      triggers of AF such as activity level and inflammatory substances, and examine the role of&#xD;
      structural abnormalities in the heart as assessed by echocardiography for the triggering of&#xD;
      AF episodes. An overall aim is therefore a better phenotyping of the patient which could aid&#xD;
      in a more person-specific treatment approach, with direct consequences both for the&#xD;
      individual patient and for the society.&#xD;

    <description>Change in AF symptoms between CPAP treatment and usual care. The questionnaire quantifies three domains of AF: event frequency (score 1-10), duration (score 1-10), and global episode severity (score 1-10). The total AF burden is calculated from the modified sum of the frequency, duration, and severity of AF (score 3-30, with higher scores indicating greater AF burden ). In addition, the AFSS assesses a symptom score based on seven items asking how bothered patients are by specified symptoms (score 0-35). Global well-being is a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10 (10 indicating the best possible life).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>109 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and moderate to severe sleep apnea were included in the study and randomized to PAP-therapy or control. One patient refused further participation and was not included in the analysis. 108 patients were therefore included in the full set analysis.&#xD;
21 patients without sleep apnea or mild sleep apnea (AHI&lt;15) were included as a reference group.&#xD;
Therefore, 130 patients were included in the study, but only 109 were included for randomization.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Before inclusion patients were invited to a CPAP mask tolerance test. Patients who complied with the treatment were invited to be included in the study.&#xD;
All patients were randomized to CPAP. In the CPAP group, one patient had CPAP treatment-emergent central SA shortly after randomization and was therefore switched to ASV.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Change in AF symptoms between CPAP treatment and usual care. The questionnaire quantifies three domains of AF: event frequency (score 1-10), duration (score 1-10), and global episode severity (score 1-10). The total AF burden is calculated from the modified sum of the frequency, duration, and severity of AF (score 3-30, with higher scores indicating greater AF burden ). In addition, the AFSS assesses a symptom score based on seven items asking how bothered patients are by specified symptoms (score 0-35). Global well-being is a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10 (10 indicating the best possible life).</description>
