      The purpose of this study is to directly compare the effectiveness of two interventions for&#xD;
      insomnia: Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) vs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for&#xD;
      Insomnia (CBTI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) is the evidence-based first line treatment&#xD;
      for chronic insomnia. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have established that&#xD;
      CBTI is efficacious and effective. Despite the strong evidence for CBTI, chronic insomnia&#xD;
      remains under-treated among Veterans because of several barriers that limit access to&#xD;
      behavioral treatments. In recent years, the VA has taken substantial measures to train more&#xD;
      clinicians to provide insomnia treatment; however, a deficit in treatment availability&#xD;
      remains. In 2011, the VA began to train clinicians in CBTI as part of the VA's Evidence Based&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (EBP) training program, with a goal to train 1000 clinicians. Even with 1000 VA&#xD;
      clinicians trained in CBTI, a shortage of clinicians will likely remain due to the high&#xD;
      prevalence of insomnia. High prevalence and a shortage of clinicians prevent the VA from&#xD;
      meeting the care demand of Veterans with insomnia. While the CBTI roll-out is a significant&#xD;
      investment from the VA, additional mechanisms, such as dissemination and implementation of&#xD;
      other evidence-based treatments for insomnia with fewer implementation barriers, must be&#xD;
      considered to address the high prevalence of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-person delivery and length of treatment for CBTI may be one of barriers to accessing&#xD;
      care. Briefer protocols that use multiple delivery modalities have recently been developed&#xD;
      and may help to increase session attendance and treatment completion. These shorter insomnia&#xD;
      treatments are often referred to as Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) and&#xD;
      consist of â‰¤4 sessions. Besides fewer and briefer sessions, and utilizing both in-person and&#xD;
      phone delivery of treatment, BBTI also emphasizes the behavioral components of CBTI (i.e.,&#xD;
      stimulus control and sleep restriction) rather than a combined approach focusing on both&#xD;
      behavioral and cognitive components. BBTI is efficacious in adults-studies with older adults&#xD;
      and Veterans found BBTI resulted in a significant decrease in insomnia severity with Cohen's&#xD;
      d effect sizes in the moderate to large range. Like CBTI, BBTI significantly improves&#xD;
      insomnia severity and may also help to improve secondary outcomes like depression and&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of newer insomnia treatments, like BBTI, will first depend on establishing its&#xD;
      evidence directly compared to CBTI. Effectiveness trials of BBTI, especially those conducted&#xD;
      with military Veterans in typical VA settings, have yet to be conducted. Before BBTI can be&#xD;
      broadly implemented and integrated into the VA, it needs to be established as a clinically&#xD;
      effective treatment for insomnia among Veterans and a statistically non-inferior treatment&#xD;
      (not necessarily better or worse) for Veterans compared to CBTI.&#xD;

The intervention was delivered within 5 weeks, which included individual face-to-face visits on Weeks 1 and 3 (option for telephone) and telephone appointments on Weeks 2 and 4. The intervention was delivered at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. The duration of the first treatment visit was approximately 45-minutes, and the follow-up visit on Week 3 was approximately 30 minutes. Brief (&lt;20 minutes) telephone sessions were conducted on Weeks 2 and 4.</description>
