  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer who are in active surveillance. Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells. Hormone therapy using androgen receptor antagonist apalutamide may fight prostate&#xD;
      cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 90 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 180, 365, 545, and 730&#xD;
      days; and at years 3, 4 and 5 by medical record review.&#xD;
