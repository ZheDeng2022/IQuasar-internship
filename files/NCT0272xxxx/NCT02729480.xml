  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of craniofacial nerve stimulation&#xD;
      for the treatment of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized at enrollment into either a delayed or immediate continuation&#xD;
      group. The immediate continuation group will immediately continue with the stimulation after&#xD;
      a 30-day trial period and will be monitored for a total of 12 months. The delayed activation&#xD;
      group will have their device turned off after the 30-day trial period for the next 3-months.&#xD;
      At the 3-month visit, both groups be evaluated and the delayed activation group will have&#xD;
      their devices reactivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have neuropathic pain of various etiologies, including trauma, surgery or&#xD;
      post-herpetic infections. Stimulators will be placed at the site target of the painful area,&#xD;
      including the epifascial plane under the skin but above the muscles in the vicinity of the&#xD;
      targeted branches of; A. Branches of Trigeminal Nerves in the Ophthalmic, Maxillary, or&#xD;
      Mandibular B. Sensory branches of Facial Nerves C. Branches of the Occipital Nerves (Greater&#xD;
      and/or Lesser) D. Branches of the Cervical Plexus (Superficial and/or Deep)&#xD;

    <description>The Halo Craniofacial Nerve Stimulator System is a wirelessly powered neurostimulator for pain in the face or head (not for headaches or migraine). This technology includes an implanted stimulator with an embedded receiver. The energy source is a small, external, rechargeable transmitter, which is worn by the patient. The transmitter sends the therapy program and power through the skin to the receiver.</description>
