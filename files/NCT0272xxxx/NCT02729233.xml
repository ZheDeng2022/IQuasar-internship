  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC is an&#xD;
      ongoing disease of the colon or large intestine. Studies have shown that leakiness of the gut&#xD;
      plays a major role in the development of UC. Leakiness of the gut is a condition that is a&#xD;
      result of damage to the intestinal lining, making it less able to protect its internal&#xD;
      environment as well as to filter needed nutrients and other substances. Some bacteria,&#xD;
      toxins, and waste not normally absorbed may get into the blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Golimumab is an FDA approved medication used for the treatment of moderate to severe&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis. The investigators have evidence to suggest that measuring the leakiness&#xD;
      of the gut using a tool called a confocal laser endomicroscope may be able to predict how&#xD;
      well a patient's body will respond to treatment of UC with golimumab. Confocal laser&#xD;
      endomicroscopy (CLE) is an FDA approved technique that can look at the cells of a patient's&#xD;
      gut during colonoscopy to assess the leakiness of gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine how the leakiness of the gut in patients with UC&#xD;
      can predict response to golimumab therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the predictive value of mucosal barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction for a therapeutic response to golimumab in UC patients. This objective is based&#xD;
      on the investigator's hypothesis that barrier dysfunction is a potent predictor of response&#xD;
      to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. This hypothesis is based on the following&#xD;
      observations: (1) IBD patients with higher gap densities have higher mucosal pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine levels; (2) the highest rates of response to biologic therapy for Ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      are seen in post-operative patients, with over 90% endoscopic remission rate at one year; and&#xD;
      (3) prominent barrier dysfunction is observed at the anastomotic site in animal models of&#xD;
      ileal resection. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that barrier dysfunction is a&#xD;
      potent predictor of therapeutic response to golimumab in UC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 30 UC patients who will be started on golimumab for treatment of UC (moderate to severe&#xD;
      flare, steroid dependence, or failure of other therapies), epithelial barrier function will&#xD;
      be characterized using probe-based CLE (pCLE). Six mucosal biopsies will be collected from&#xD;
      each site (terminal ileum and rectum) for histologic verification of pCLE findings at&#xD;
      baseline, and again at month 12 for a total of 12 research samples per colonoscopy, or 24&#xD;
      research biopsy samples during the course of the study. The study subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for a total of 1 year after initial colonoscopy with pCLE. The primary study end-point is&#xD;
      clinical response at 3 months following initiation of golimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints are: (1) The rate of clinical remission at 3 months following&#xD;
      initiation of golimumab. (2) The rate of clinical remission at 12 months following initiation&#xD;
      of golimumab. (3) Endoscopic and histological evidence of mucosal healing at one-year&#xD;
      follow-up colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Response &amp; Remission definitions are: (1) Clinical Remission: partial Mayo score of&#xD;
      2 points, without any sub-score &gt;1. (2) Clinical Response: reduction of partial Mayo UC score&#xD;
      by ≥ 30% and ≥ 2 points, with a rectal bleeding sub-score of ≤ 1 or a decrease in the&#xD;
      bleeding sub-score of ≥ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic and histologic mucosal healing definitions: (1) Endoscopic: Mayo endoscopic score&#xD;
      of 0 or 1. (2) Histologic: Riley's histological score ≤ 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators proposal is based on clinical, translational and basic evidence of barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction in the pathogenesis of UC. With the development of a robust prediction model for&#xD;
      therapeutic response, UC patients can be treated more effectively with golimumab. Using a&#xD;
      stratified approach, higher therapeutic response rate may eventually yield a new &quot;intelligent&#xD;
      step-up&quot; treatment strategy in this personalized medicine era.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Subjects who test negative for all HBV screening tests (ie, HBsAg-, anti-HBc-,&#xD;
                  and anti HBs-) are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects who test positive for surface antigen (HBsAg+) are not eligible for this&#xD;

                  DNA test is positive, the subject is not eligible for this study. If the HBV DNA&#xD;
                  test is negative, the subject is eligible for this study. In the event the HBV&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Subjects with a positive HBV DNA test will be counselled per the clinical Hepatitis B&#xD;
        Positive Screen Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). If the HBV DNA test cannot be&#xD;
