      A randomized controlled, multicenter trial comparing qigong and exercise therapy concerning&#xD;
      pain intensity, treatment expectations, disability, neck movements and quality of life in&#xD;
      subjects with non-specific, long-term NP. A comparison will be performed between the two&#xD;
      randomized treatment groups in these variables before and after three and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited via an advertisement in a local newspaper. Inclusion: Men and&#xD;
      women between 18-65 years of age with nonspecific, long term neck pain (&lt;3 months).Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were chronic tension-type headache, migrain, traumatic neck injuries, neurologic&#xD;
      signs or symptoms. rheumatic diseases, fibromyalgia or other severe physiologic or physical&#xD;
      diserases and difficulties in understand the Swedish language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment of participants, the randomization procedure and the performance of&#xD;
      measurements were conducted by four independent physiotherapists. Randomization was done in&#xD;
      blocks of 30 according to a sealed envelope technique. Assessments were made before treatment&#xD;
      (baseline), immediately after treatment and at six and 12-month follow-ups. All participants&#xD;
      answered questionnaires about demographic data, pain (duration and intensity) and disability.&#xD;
      Pain intensity was rated as current NP and average NP during the week before the assessment,&#xD;
      measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS - measured in millimeters with the end points 0 =&#xD;
      no pain and 100 = unbearable pain) (Carlsson, 1983). Neck Movements was measured with cervico&#xD;
      Thorac Ratio (CTR) (Norlander 2995), Disability was measured with the Neck Disability Index&#xD;
      (NDI) (Vernon, 1991), which consists of a ten-item, scaled questionnaire where the total&#xD;
      scores are recalculated into percent (0%, no disability; 100%, maximum disability). The items&#xD;
      assess NP according to intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headache, concentration,&#xD;
      work, driving, sleeping and recreation. Quality of Life was measured with the SF-36&#xD;
      questionnaire (Sullivan1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants One hundred and twenty-two subjects with long-term, non-specific NP were&#xD;
      randomized to the interventions of qigong (n=60) and exercise therapy (n=62). Eighty-six&#xD;
      (70%) were women and 36 (30%) men, with a mean age of 44 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were allocated randomly to receive qigong or exercise therapy. In each&#xD;
      group, the participants received ten to 12 treatments over a period of three months, and each&#xD;
      treatment session lasted one hour. A treatment-specific guideline was developed for each&#xD;
      treatment. Treatments were provided by experienced physiotherapists; the physiotherapist&#xD;
      responsible for qigong had nothing to do with exercise therapy and vice versa. An attendance&#xD;
      list was kept during the intervention period, and all participants were informed that they&#xD;
      had to attend at least eight of the 12 sessions to be included for analysis in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qigong was done according to medical qigong, which is a modality of traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine and is a way of affecting and directing qi (energy) for medical benefit. There are&#xD;
      several medical qigong techniques, one being the Biyun method . Each qigong practice included&#xD;
      body posture adjustment and gentle movement, meditation (concentration) and purposeful&#xD;
      relaxation, breathing regulation practices and self-administered massage. In this study,&#xD;
      qigong was practiced in groups of ten to 15 participants. Each qigong session started with&#xD;
      information about the philosophy of medical qigong, which was followed by a general warm-up&#xD;
      with soft movements for the whole body and then 14 selected qigong exercises according to the&#xD;
      Biyun method. The participants were recommended to practice different qigong exercises at&#xD;
      home every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy was carried out individually, and the training program was adjusted for each&#xD;
      participant. A physiotherapist instructed the participant throughout the training program,&#xD;
      which focused mainly on the cervical and shoulder/thoracic regions. Each training session&#xD;
      started with a warm-up on a stationary bicycle for about ten minutes, followed by 40 minutes&#xD;
      of dynamic exercises. These exercises consisted of active movements aimed to cover the full&#xD;
      range of motion in all neck directions and muscle exercises aimed to maintain/increase&#xD;
      circulation, endurance and strength. The muscle exercises were carried out against gravity or&#xD;
      with added resistance (for example with weights, rubber expander, dumbbells and pulley&#xD;
      apparatus) and ended with stretching the muscles in the neck, shoulders and upper limbs. The&#xD;
      amount of load was individualized and kept within pain tolerance (aimed not to increase&#xD;
      pain). The load at the muscle exercises was to achieve between 30 and 70% of maximum muscle&#xD;
      capacity and was gradually increased as endurance and strength were gained.&#xD;
