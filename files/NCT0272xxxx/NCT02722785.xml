      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients diagnosed with operable cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), the&#xD;
      perioperative course of therapy is associated with severe deconditioning which includes&#xD;
      weight loss and poor physical function, which are strong predictor of post-surgical&#xD;
      complication and survival . A strong rationale exists to explore how to develop supportive&#xD;
      interventions aimed at maintaining/improving muscle function (lean body mass and muscle&#xD;
      strength) during the pre-surgical phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the safety, feasibility and efficacy of structured pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative exercise training in patient undergoing surgery for cancer of the&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients with histologically verified, resectable adenocarcinoma of the GEJ&#xD;
      scheduled for treatment af Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a case-control design, patients will be allocated to either an exercise training&#xD;
      intervention group, or a usual-care observational group, based on geographical location.&#xD;
      Forty patients will be included in this case-control study and allocated by geographical&#xD;
      region as follows; 20 training intervention-cases living in the greater Copenhagen area, and&#xD;
      20 observational control subjects living outside the greater Copenhagen area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a total of 5 assessments during the perioperative trajectory; twice&#xD;
      prior to surgery (baseline and pre-surgery test), three post-surgery (2 week post- and 15&#xD;
      weeks post-surgery, and at 1-year follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include measures of body composition by DXA scan and bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis: systemic inflammation in fasting blood sample; quality of life by self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires; physical function by handgrip strength and sit-to-stand test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As optional procedures, we will collect biological tissue from tumor, muscle and fat biopsies&#xD;
      and a 10 ml blood sample at baseline and pre-surgery test only. Also, we will collect blood&#xD;
      samples before, during and after an acute exercise bout exercise in order to explore the&#xD;
      acute systemic changes in exercise-regulated biomarkers.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Patients diagnosed with operable cancer in upper gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tract undergo serious therapeutic procedures including invasive surgery combined with&#xD;
      chemo- or chemo-radio therapy before (neo-adjuvant) and/or after (adjuvant) surgery. Despite&#xD;
      recent advances, especially in surgical techniques and patient care follow-up, the population&#xD;
      is faced with one of the worst prognosis for patients with operable staged disease, with a&#xD;
      5-year relative survival of 35-40%. The only possibility of long-term survival is positive&#xD;
      surgical outcome, which includes the surgical principle of performing wide clearance,&#xD;
      achieving a negative margin (R0 resection), and performing a radical lymphadenectomy. To this&#xD;
      end, considerable efforts have been made in recent years optimizing the perioperative period&#xD;
      in order to provide the patients and the surgeons with the best possible chances of achieving&#xD;
      this surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) has increased in incidence over the&#xD;
      last quarter century. For patients presenting with localized disease, advances in standards&#xD;
      of care have emerged in recent years which have improved disease management. Firstly,&#xD;
      comprehensive staging with Computed Tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound, diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy and fluoro deoxy glucose position emission tomography (18FDG-PET) permits&#xD;
      exclusion of patients for curative therapy who might previously have been scheduled for&#xD;
      resection. Secondly, evidence supports that esophagectomy is performed in high-volume&#xD;
      hospitals by high-volume surgeons. Finally, standard neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are&#xD;
      performed in most centers for patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma which has&#xD;
      improved both short- and long-term cancer outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic role of Muscle Function in upper GI cancer For all upper GI cancers, including&#xD;
      GEJ, the perioperative course of therapy is associated with severe deconditioning which&#xD;
      includes weight loss and poor physical function. Over the last decade, strong observational&#xD;
      evidence has emerged supporting that poor pre-surgical muscle function, defined as either low&#xD;
      muscle mass/area (sarcopenia) or low functional strength, is a strong independent predictor&#xD;
      of post-surgical outcomes including mortality, surgical complications and chemotherapy&#xD;
      dose-reduction. Importantly, strong evidence across different malignancies has shown that the&#xD;
      prognostic value of muscle function is independent from body mass, and may actually be&#xD;
      under-reported due to sarcopenic obesity. Thus, current available therapeutic countermeasures&#xD;
      in clinical practice, which exclusively involve nutritional interventions, may have limited&#xD;
      potential for ameliorating the progressive muscle dysfunction during perioperative treatment&#xD;
      for GEJ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise-Oncology and Upper GI cancer Epidemiological evidence across both heterogeneous and&#xD;
      homogeneous groups of cancer patients have shown that low physical activity level after&#xD;
      diagnosis is associated with poor disease-specific and overall survival. Despite a general&#xD;
      emerging interest, limited attention has been dedicated to the exploration of safety,&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of structured exercise interventions in patients with upper GI&#xD;
      cancer. However, data from recent studies suggests an unmet potential of physical exercise in&#xD;
      these patients, with particular emphasis on the pre-surgical period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To explore safety and feasibility of structured exercise in the pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      phases among patients undergoing treatment for operable GEJ cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the effect of perioperative exercise training on clinical (e.g. clindo-davien&#xD;
           score, pneumonia, anastomotic leakage) physiological (e.g. muscle strength, physical&#xD;
           function) and psycho-social (e.g. fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) endpoints&#xD;
           relative to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the prognostic role of pathophysiological profile (physical function,&#xD;
           pulmonary function, and body-composition) on post-surgical complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explorative objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore molecular adaptations of metabolism and physiology in tumor, muscle and fat&#xD;
           samples taken before and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the pre-operative phase in&#xD;
           (a sub-group of) patients allocated to exercise training or usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the acute response in immune cells, hormones and cytokines in blood samples&#xD;
           taken before, during and after a single exercise session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood and tissue samples for storage in bio-bank for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This prospective, regional-based case-controlled feasibility trial will include&#xD;
      in a minimum of 40 patients, including 20 training intervention-cases who are residents in&#xD;
      greater Copenhagen Area, and 20 usual care controls living outside the greater Copenhagen&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from the department of surgical gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, following multidisciplinary medical conference. The responsible physicians&#xD;
      will provide oral information and present patients with the written information of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are willing to participate will sign informed consent, before any study related&#xD;
      procedures are performed. After signing informed consent, patients are scheduled for baseline&#xD;
      assessment and will be allocated based on geographical location (home-town municipality), to&#xD;
      one of two experimental arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Patient residing OUTSIDE the Copenhagen area, will be allocated to a usual care&#xD;
      observation group, which includes nurse-based follow up procedures and information on life&#xD;
      style factors (diet, smoking cessation, alcohol, and physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Patients residing WITHIN the Copenhagen area, will be allocated to usual care plus&#xD;
      hospital-based aerobic and resistance training at Centre for Physical Activity Research,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures will involve assessment-measures conducted a total of 5 times during the study&#xD;
      period: twice prior to surgery (baseline and pre-surgery test), twice post-surgery (3 week&#xD;
      post- and 15 weeks post-surgery) and at 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body composition by Bioelectrical Impedance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting blood sample for analyses of plasma biochemistry (cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
           inflammatory markers, HbA1C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health related Quality of Life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical function: Handgrip strength and sit-to-stand test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Forced Expiration Volume in 1 second (FEV1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biological tissue sampling (OPTIONAL): tumor, muscle and fat biopsies and blood samples&#xD;
           - only baseline and pre-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Acute Exercise Response (OPTIONAL); blood samples taken before and after a single&#xD;
           exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYTIC PLAN As a feasibility study, this trial is explorative in nature and performed&#xD;
      primarily in order to determine whether it is appropriate to advance with a larger scaled&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and feasibility of perioperative exercise training in patients with operable GEJ&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the pre- and post-surgical exercise in&#xD;
      patients with operable cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction, incidence of serious adverse&#xD;
      events in both groups will be determined, and adherence to exercise, assessed by number of&#xD;
      training sessions completed in the training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of perioperative exercise training to improve clinical, physiological and&#xD;
      psycho-social outcomes in patients operable GEJ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether exercise training has the capacity to improve study outcomes&#xD;
      intragroup changes, and inter-group differences for study outcomes will be calculated. For&#xD;
      this purpose a random effect analysis will be performed with repeated measures and study&#xD;
      outcomes as dependent variables, with the covariates &quot;group&quot;, &quot;time&quot; and their interaction as&#xD;
      fixed effects, and a random effect of &quot;patient&quot;, adjusted for baseline-score, chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen, and surgical procedure (conventional vs laparoscopic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic role of pathophysiological profile in patients with operable GEJ cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore the prognostic role of the study assessment outcomes on key clinical&#xD;
      endpoints: post-surgical complications, hospital stay duration and disease free and overall&#xD;
      mortality risk over the first years after surgery, by a general linear regression models with&#xD;
      clinical endpoints being the dependent variable, and study assessment outcomes as the&#xD;
      independent variables adjusted for baseline-score, chemotherapy regimen, and surgical&#xD;
      procedure (conventional vs laparoscopic). For each variable (physical function, pulmonary&#xD;
      function, and body-composition), the predictive value of: I) the diagnostic level (prior to&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant therapy), II) the pre-surgical level (after neo-adjuvant treatment) and III) the&#xD;
      change score from diagnostic to pre-surgical level (during neo-adjuvant therapy) will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts and Missing Observations Patients who wish to drop-out of the study during the&#xD;
      intervention-periods will be offered to remain in the study with regard to test-assessments.&#xD;
      Patients who drop out prior to 'visit 2' will be replaced. For between-group analyses, all&#xD;
      drop-outs and missing observations will be handled by the &quot;missing at random&quot; principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study will be conducted in accordance with the regional ethical&#xD;
      committee and the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) with its subsequent revisions. The protocol&#xD;
      and any substantial amendments, the study patient information and consent form, as well as&#xD;
      other relevant or requested material have been approved by the local ethics committee&#xD;
      (Videnskabsetisk Komite) for the Capital Region of Denmark (Protocol number: H-15014904) and&#xD;
      is reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet: RH-2016-33, I-Suite nr.:&#xD;
      04396) through Rigshospitalet/Capital Region of Denmark (j.nr. 2012-58-0004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is expected to cause limited risks, side effects and discomfort. All procedures&#xD;
      will be performed by experienced physicians, therapists and physiologists with relevant&#xD;
      safety, and patients will not experience any kind of delays or complications related to&#xD;
      treatment or control process due to participation in the project. Patients may at any time,&#xD;
      and without justification, retract their consent.&#xD;

    <description>Body fat percentage is assessed measuring bioelectrical impedance in the body using a state-of-the-art Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer (Tanita MC-780 MA, Tokyo, Japan). The degree of difficulty with which electricity passes through a substance is known as the electrical resistance, and the percentage of fat and other body constituents can be inferred from measurements of this resistance. The analyzer measures body composition using a constant current source with a high frequency current (50kHz, 90ÂµA) with 8 electrodes positioned so that electric current is supplied from the electrodes on the tips of the toes of both feet, and voltage is measured on the heel of both feet. The current flows into the upper limbs or lower limbs, depending on the body part(s) to be measured. Patients with pacemakers or other electrical implants will not undergo this measure due to safety specifications.</description>

A gastroscopy will be performed and endoluminal tumor biopsies will be collected under full anesthesia in patients who have given informed consent, after the diagnostic laparoscopy is completed. Muscle biopsies of approx. 200 mg per biopsy, will be collected from m. vastus lateralis using the Bergstrom-technique, and fat biopsies of approx. 200 mg per biopsy will be collected from the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the abdomen. Standard procedure requires the resection specimen to be dissected and cut open to determine lymph node classification and resection margins.</description>

    <description>Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise program consisting of 2 weekly sessions of approximately 60 minutes. Patients will perform a test of maximum cardio-respiratory (Watt-max test) and muscle strength (1 repetition maximum [1-RM] test) capacity. Using the patient's individual capacity score (Watt-max and 1RM), a personalized exercise program will be prescribed. After a light warm-up, patients will perform 20-30 min of aerobic interval training of stationary bicycle. Resistance training comprises 4 exercises for the major muscle groups: chest press, leg press, lateral pull, and knee extension with 3-4 sets of 8 to 15 repetitions. Each session will be supervised by trained instructors to ensure proper technique, and progression in training load.</description>
