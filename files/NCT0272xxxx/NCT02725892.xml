      National, prospective, multicentric, non-interventional registry-based study, conducted among&#xD;
      oncologists, pulmonologists in community and university hospitals, from the public sector in&#xD;
      Algeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect information on the characteristics, and lung carcinomas patterns of&#xD;
      patients whose lung cancer diagnosis was confirmed by a pathologist during the study period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria presenting to their&#xD;
           oncologists/pulmonologists for a routine visit during recruitment period will be&#xD;
           sequentially asked to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients who do not consent will only be reported as new case of lung cancer for the&#xD;
           incidence study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who consent to participate to the study will perform four in-hospital visits&#xD;
      (Inclusion visit, visit at 3, 6 and 12 months). In addition to the 4 visits, a phone contact&#xD;
      with the patients every 6 months at years 2,3, 4 and 5 will be done by the investigator or&#xD;
      one of his/her authorised representative or the CRO or during a routine visit to the&#xD;
      investigator, to check the patient's survival status.&#xD;
