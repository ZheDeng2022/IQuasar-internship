  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent among Veterans, and is associated with&#xD;
      significant mortality and multiple morbidities. Available treatments have had limited&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating OSA and alleviating associated morbidity. The investigators'&#xD;
      previous research found a reduction in OSA severity of approximately 25% following modest&#xD;
      exercise training. That this effect occurred independent of weight loss raises the exciting&#xD;
      possibility that exercise combined with weight loss could reduce OSA by at least 50% and have&#xD;
      unique health benefits for OSA patients. Following screening and baseline assessments, 90&#xD;
      overweight Veterans ages 18-60 years with OSA will be randomized to one of three 16-week&#xD;
      treatments: (1) exercise training; (2) 10 % weight loss; and 3) exercise + weight loss.&#xD;
      Changes in OSA and related morbidity will be compared between treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Approximately 15-20% of adults have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and evidence&#xD;
      indicates that the prevalence of OSA is perhaps twice as high among Veterans. OSA has been&#xD;
      clearly linked to increased mortality and multiple morbidities, and undoubtedly contributes&#xD;
      to the high prevalence of health problems among Veterans. Current treatments for OSA are not&#xD;
      well tolerated, often have limited efficacy, and often do not result in improvements in&#xD;
      health. The investigators' recent research demonstrated that 12 weeks of moderate exercise&#xD;
      training elicited a reduction of OSA of ~25%, as well as significant improvement in mood,&#xD;
      fatigue, quality of life, and cardiovascular health. Interestingly, as with other health&#xD;
      benefits of exercise, the investigators' research is consistent with other research showing&#xD;
      that exercise can reduce OSA independent of changes in body weight. These studies raise the&#xD;
      exciting possibility that exercise training combined with modest weight loss could elicit a&#xD;
      chronic reduction in OSA of 50% or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators' Objective is to compare the effects of 16 weeks of exercise&#xD;
      training alone, weight loss alone, and exercise + weight loss on OSA severity and associated&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Following extensive screening and baseline assessment, N=90 overweight/obese&#xD;
      Veterans (ages 18-60 years) with mild to severe OSA will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      16-week treatments. (1) Exercise Alone (n=30) will involve training 4 days per week under&#xD;
      supervision of a clinical exercise physiologist. It will include aerobic exercise (treadmill,&#xD;
      cycling, elliptical) that will gradually increase to 30-45 min on 4 days/wk, as well as&#xD;
      resistance exercise (15 min) on 2 days/week. (2) Weight Loss Alone (n=30) will involve a&#xD;
      structured meal plan (including some meal replacement with shakes or bars), and weekly&#xD;
      counseling designed to elicit a reduction in body weight of 10%. (3) Exercise + Weight Loss&#xD;
      (n=30) will involve the same exercise and weight loss interventions as in the other&#xD;
      treatments. Outside of the interventions, participants will be asked to maintain their usual&#xD;
      exercise and diet habits, as verified, respectively, with actigraphic recording and a 24-hr&#xD;
      food recall. Before and after the treatments, participants will undergo 5 days/nights of&#xD;
      home-based actigraphic and diary-assessed sleep, and one night of laboratory polysomnographic&#xD;
      recording of sleep, including OSA severity. Comorbidity measures will include pre- to&#xD;
      post-treatment changes in blood pressure, glucose, insulin, lipids, hemoglobin a1c, body&#xD;
      weight/composition, and inflammation (e.g., CRP, IL-6). Also measured will be monthly changes&#xD;
      in self-reports of sleep quality, functional outcomes of sleepiness (FOSQ), and snoring&#xD;
      symptoms. A 3-month follow-up will include home assessment of OSA, as well as sleep quality,&#xD;
      FOSQ, and snoring. Mediation analysis will explore whether improvements in OSA are mediated&#xD;
      by changes in percent of deep sleep, body weight, trunk body fat percent, trunk total mass,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, and upper airway obstruction assessed in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications for Future Research. Demonstration of a reduction of OSA by 50% would result in&#xD;
      extensive subsequent studies. These would likely include studies of dose-response effects;&#xD;
      comparisons of different modes of exercise; studies of the feasibility of telemedicine&#xD;
      approaches to the interventions; comparative efficacy studies vs. PAP; further mechanistic&#xD;
      studies, for example, of upper airway collapsibility and composition (e.g, via MRI); and&#xD;
      studies of other positive health outcomes, such as extensive heart imaging.&#xD;
