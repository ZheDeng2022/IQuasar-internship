      A two-part, phase I open label, dose escalation and expansion study to assess safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of NUC-3373, a nucleotide analogue, in participants&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase I dose escalation study of NUC-3373 as a single agent, administered&#xD;
      weekly or fortnightly as an I.V. infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts participants will undergo evaluations of the safety, PK, PD and anti-tumour&#xD;
      efficacy of NUC-3373&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants may continue to receive NUC-3373 until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Establish the RP2D and assess the safety and tolerability for single agent NUC-3373&#xD;
      administered as an I.V. infusion on day 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle. Participants can&#xD;
      remain on study and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs. The RP2D will be determined by dose escalation with sequential participants receiving&#xD;
      increasing doses of NUC-3373 in a standard '3 + 3' cohort design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Establish the RP2D and assess the safety and tolerability for single agent NUC-3373&#xD;
      administered as a fortnightly I.V. infusion on day 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Participants&#xD;
      can remain on study and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs. The RP2D will be determined by dose escalation with sequential participants receiving&#xD;
      increasing doses of NUC-3373 in a standard '3 + 3' cohort design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to assess preliminary efficacy signals and further characterise the safety profile,&#xD;
      expansion cohorts of up to 20 additional participants per cohort will receive the RP2D of&#xD;
      NUC-3373 as determined in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Participants can remain on study&#xD;
      and receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To establish the recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NUC-3373 that will optimise the risk/benefit reward for the participants, administered weekly (Part 1) and when administered fortnightly (Part 2), as a single I.V. infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>To decide if the next cohort can be opened at a higher dose level, the Trial Management Group (TMG) will review available data (e.g. safety profile) once all participants in the preceding cohort have completed the first cycle through to Day 28.</time_frame>
    <description>The RP2D is the most appropriate dose that will optimise the risk/benefit reward for the participants. RP2D determination will take into consideration the plasma PK, PD assessments, the nature of the PK/PD relationship, any efficacy signals or any adverse events observed during the conduct of the dose-escalation and the available non clinical data.&#xD;
The RP2D will be determined by dose escalation with sequential participants receiving increasing doses of NUC-3373 in a standard '3 + 3' cohort design. Dose escalation will stop when the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/RP2D have been defined for that Part or a decision is made by the Trial Management Group to halt enrolment.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) to assess the tolerability of NUC-3373</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment starts at first IMP administration (Cycle 1 Day 1) until the first cycle completion (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined, following case causality assessment of 'Definite', 'Probable', or 'Possible' and as such may be related to the IMP:&#xD;
Greater than or equal to Grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (e.g. mucositis, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome) (excluding nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea or rash that responds to standard medical treatment or as allowed by eligibility criteria e.g. elevated LFTs in participants with liver metastases).&#xD;
Greater than or equal to Grade 3 nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea or rash that occurs despite standard medical treatment for such AEs (see 3.6.1).&#xD;
Grade 4 neutropaenia.&#xD;
Febrile neutropaenia.&#xD;
Grade 4 thrombocytopaenia.&#xD;
Inability to begin next dose of treatment within 14 days of the scheduled dosing due to unresolved toxicity related to NUC-3373.&#xD;
Either isolated or recurrent (i.e., cardiac, renal, neurologic) toxicity that is judged by the CI and/or TMG to be a DLT.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) and SAEs/AEs to assess the safety of NUC-3373</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse event monitoring starts at IMP administration (Day 1) until 28 days after the final dose of IMP has been administered.</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events using NCI-CTCAE v4.0 will be listed and summarised by descriptive statistics for all patients grouped by each dose level for each part. During treatment participants will be reviewed on a weekly basis during the first cycle and on the day of treatment. Additional visits may be arranged at the investigator's discretion. The categories will be AE, AE with CTCAE grade &gt;3 and serious adverse events (SAE) related or not related to NUC-3373. Data presented throughout study completion, SAEs reviewed in real-time, TMG review all data (monthly meeting on average).</description>
