  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of financial incentives augmented&#xD;
      telephone-delivered diabetes education and skills training intervention in improving HbA1c&#xD;
      levels in African Americans (AA) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans with T2DM have higher prevalence of diabetes, poorer metabolic control, and&#xD;
      greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. HbA1c is the primary&#xD;
      marker for glycemic control and is a strong independent predictor of development of&#xD;
      complications and increased mortality in T2DM. Key self-care behaviors that influence&#xD;
      glycemic control (and HbA1c) include diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood&#xD;
      glucose and medication adherence. Systematic review of multiple RCTs show that self-care&#xD;
      interventions that include diabetes education and skills training are effective in improving&#xD;
      metabolic control in diabetes. Recent findings indicate that patients with diabetes,&#xD;
      especially ethnic minority patients, prefer telephone-delivered diabetes education to group&#xD;
      visits or internet-based education. Multiple RCTs have documented the effectiveness of&#xD;
      telephone-delivered self-care interventions in T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this proposal is test the efficacy of three financial incentive&#xD;
      structures in combination with technology intensified diabetes education and skills training&#xD;
      intervention on blood pressure and quality of life in AAs with T2DM. 60 AAs with T2DM will be&#xD;
      randomized to three groups with varying frequency of financial incentives: 1) High Frequency:&#xD;
      financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose, incentives for weekly&#xD;
      attendance to educational sessions, and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c&#xD;
      goals 2) Moderate Frequency: financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose,&#xD;
      and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals, and 3) Low Frequency:&#xD;
      financial incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals.&#xD;

    <description>Diabetes Education/Skills Component. Subjects will receive weekly telephone-delivered diabetes/skills training for 12 weeks with home telemonitoring.&#xD;
High Frequency Financial Incentive: the high frequency incentive structure will receive a reward for uploading glucose measurements, attending educational sessions, and absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from baseline at 3-month follow-up, up to $300. Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week. If they upload measurements every day of the week and their average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below they will receive an additional $3. Participants can also earn $5 each week if they attend the educational session. After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $130, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $65.</description>

High Frequency Financial Incentive: 1. Diabetes Education/Skills Component. Subjects will receive weekly telephone-delivered diabetes/skills training for 12 weeks with home telemonitoring.&#xD;
2. High Frequency Financial Incentive: the high frequency incentive structure will receive a reward for uploading glucose measurements, attending educational sessions, and absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from baseline at 3-month follow-up, up to $300. Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week. If they upload measurements every day of the week and their average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below they will receive an additional $3. Participants can also earn $5 each week if they attend the educational session. After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $130, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $65.</description>

          <title>High Frequency Financial Incentive</title>
          <description>This arm will receive telephone delivered diabetes education and skills training in combination with the high frequency incentive structure&#xD;
High Frequency Financial Incentive: 1. Diabetes Education/Skills Component. Subjects will receive weekly telephone-delivered diabetes/skills training for 12 weeks with home telemonitoring.&#xD;
2. High Frequency Financial Incentive: the high frequency incentive structure will receive a reward for uploading glucose measurements, attending educational sessions, and absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from baseline at 3-month follow-up, up to $300. Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week. If they upload measurements every day of the week and their average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below they will receive an additional $3. Participants can also earn $5 each week if they attend the educational session. After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $130, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $65.</description>

          <description>This arm will receive telephone delivered diabetes education and skills training in combination with the moderate frequency incentive structure&#xD;
Moderate Frequency Financial Incentive: 1. Diabetes Education/Skills Component. Subjects will receive weekly telephone-delivered diabetes/skills training for 12 weeks with home telemonitoring.&#xD;
2. Moderate Frequency Financial: the moderate frequency incentive structure will receive a reward for uploading glucose measurements, and absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from baseline at 3-month follow-up, up to $300. Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and having good glucose control throughout the week. For each day they upload at least one glucose measurement, they will receive $1 (up to $7 at the end of the week). If they upload measurements every day of the week and their average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below they will receive an additional $3. After 3 months, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute HbA1c is 7%, they will receive a reward of $170, for a 1% drop, or an absolute HbA1c between 7 and 8 they will receive a reward of $85</description>
