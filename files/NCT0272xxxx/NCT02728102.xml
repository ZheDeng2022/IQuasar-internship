  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multicenter trial of vaccination with Dendritic&#xD;
      cell/myeloma fusions with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) adjuvant&#xD;
      plus lenalidomide maintenance therapy versus maintenance therapy alone or with GM-CSF&#xD;
      following autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the dendritic cell myeloma vaccine will result in improved response in&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma after autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three-arm, phase II randomized, open-labeled clinical trial that randomizes&#xD;
      patients to vaccination with Dendritic Cell (DC)/myeloma fusions/GM-CSF plus lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance therapy or lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF following&#xD;
      autologous transplant as part of upfront treatment for patients diagnosed with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. Patients are randomized approximately 2 months post transplant and will begin&#xD;
      maintenance lenalidomide between day 90 and 100. The primary objective of this randomized&#xD;
      trial is to compare the proportion of patients alive and in complete response (defined as CR&#xD;
      or sCR) at one year post transplant between patients receiving DC/myeloma vaccine/GM-CSF with&#xD;
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy to those receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or&#xD;
      without GM-CSF.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare the proportion of patients alive and in complete response (CR or sCR) at one year post transplant between patients receiving DC/myeloma vaccine/GM-CSF with lenalidomide maintenance therapy to those receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF. Complete Response (CR) is defined to require all the followings: Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by routine electrophoresis and by immunofixation; Less than 5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and also on trephine bone biopsy, if biopsy is performed; No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions on radiological investigations; Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas. Stringent Complete Response (sCR) is defined to require all the followings in addition to CR: Normal free light chain ratio (FLC); Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study opened to accrual on July 25, 2016 and closed to accrual on October 12, 2018 with 203 participants enrolled from 18 participating centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sixty-three participants dropped out of the study prior to randomization and 140 participants received a transplant and proceeded to randomization. The reasons for dropout include insufficient tumor cells collected (n=13), withdrew consent from study (n=12), ineligible to be randomized (n=8), disease progression prior to randomization (n=6), refused or did not make it to transplantation (n=10), physician decision (n=7), manufacturing failure (n=4), lost to follow up (n=2), and insurance (n=1).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Lenalidomide, Vaccine, and GM-CSF</title>
          <description>Patients will undergo tumor cell collection and autologous stem cell transplant with melphalan. Patients will undergo leukapheresis and then will receive maintenance lenalidomide with myeloma vaccine and GM-CSF.&#xD;
Tumor Cell Collection: Patients will undergo aspiration of 30 mL of bone marrow from which myeloma cell will be isolated and frozen for subsequent vaccine generation.&#xD;
Autologous Stem Cell Transplant: Patients will receive an autologous graft of a minimum cell dose of 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg patient actual body weight per transplantation with high-dose melphalan of 200mg/m^2 at the schedule and timing according to institutional practices.&#xD;
Leukapheresis: Blood samples will be collected through a catheter in the neck or chest and leukapheresis will be performed using standard clinical procedures.&#xD;
Lenalidomide: Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide will begin between 90 and 100 days after stem cell infusion. Lenalidomide will be administered initially at a dose of 10 mg per day continuously. Cycle duration during maintenance therapy is 28 days. Patients will continue lenalidomide for two years from initiation of therapy.&#xD;
Myeloma vaccine: The target dose is 3 x 10^6 fusion cells per vaccine. A minimum of 3 x 10^6 total fusion cells will be required to proceed with vaccine administration. Patients will receive the DC/MM fusion vaccine on day 1 of cycles 2, 3, and 4 of lenalidomide maintenance.&#xD;
GM-CSF: 100 ug GM-CSF will be given for a total of 4 days of each cycle.</description>

        <title>1-year Response Rate of CR/sCR</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare the proportion of patients alive and in complete response (CR or sCR) at one year post transplant between patients receiving DC/myeloma vaccine/GM-CSF with lenalidomide maintenance therapy to those receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy with or without GM-CSF. Complete Response (CR) is defined to require all the followings: Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by routine electrophoresis and by immunofixation; Less than 5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and also on trephine bone biopsy, if biopsy is performed; No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions on radiological investigations; Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas. Stringent Complete Response (sCR) is defined to require all the followings in addition to CR: Normal free light chain ratio (FLC); Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.</description>
        <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
        <population>The primary analysis population includes all the randomized participants. Protocol defines primary analysis is to compare participants receiving vaccine vs those without vaccine. So no vaccine arms with or without GM-CSF are combined. Four participants withdrew consent to all study procedures before 1-year post-transplant. Of these, 2 cases on the Lenalidomide/GM-CSF arm and 2 cases on the Lenalidomide Alone arm. These participants were not evaluable for the primary endpoint and ERC confirmed.</population>

            <title>Lenalidomide, Vaccine, and GM-CSF</title>
            <description>Patients will undergo tumor cell collection and autologous stem cell transplant with melphalan. Patients will undergo leukapheresis and then will receive maintenance lenalidomide with myeloma vaccine and GM-CSF.&#xD;
Tumor Cell Collection: Patients will undergo aspiration of 30 mL of bone marrow from which myeloma cell will be isolated and frozen for subsequent vaccine generation.&#xD;
Autologous Stem Cell Transplant: Patients will receive an autologous graft of a minimum cell dose of 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg patient actual body weight per transplantation with high-dose melphalan of 200mg/m^2 at the schedule and timing according to institutional practices.&#xD;
Leukapheresis: Blood samples will be collected through a catheter in the neck or chest and leukapheresis will be performed using standard clinical procedures.&#xD;
Lenalidomide: Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide will begin between 90 and 100 days after stem cell infusion. Lenalidomide will be administered initially at a dose of 10 mg per day continuously. Cycle duration during maintenance therapy is 28 days. Patients will continue lenalidomide for two years from initiation of therapy.&#xD;
Myeloma vaccine: The target dose is 3 x 10^6 fusion cells per vaccine. A minimum of 3 x 10^6 total fusion cells will be required to proceed with vaccine administration. Patients will receive the DC/MM fusion vaccine on day 1 of cycles 2, 3, and 4 of lenalidomide maintenance.&#xD;
GM-CSF: 100 ug GM-CSF will be given for a total of 4 days of each cycle.</description>
