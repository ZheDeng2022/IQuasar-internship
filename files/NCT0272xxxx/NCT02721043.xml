  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Personalized Genomic Vaccine 001 (PGV001) in subjects with advanced non-hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. PGV001 is a peptide vaccine that is based on a patient's own tumor sequence.&#xD;
      Each patient's tumor is sequenced and peptides that correspond to the tumors are made. These&#xD;
      peptides combined with the adjuvant Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®, Oncovir) make PGV001. The adjuvant&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC is added to boost the immune response to the peptides and together will expand&#xD;
      immune cells to target cancer.&#xD;
