      PHASE I PART: Dose escalation and Recommended Dose (Volume) The purpose of the Phase I part&#xD;
      of the study is to determine the Recommended Dose (volume), the safety profile and the&#xD;
      feasibility of the treatment of NBTXR3 administered either by intrahepatic lesion injection&#xD;
      or super selective transcatheter arterial injection and activated by stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT), in patients with liver cancers. Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the Recommended Dose(s) (volume(s)) and the early Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      of NBTXR3 administered either by intralesional injection or by super selective transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial injection and activated by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients&#xD;
      with liver cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II PART: Safety and Efficacy evaluation Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the Phase II part are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and characterize the safety profile, including liver function evaluation using&#xD;
           MELD/MELD-Na and Child-Pugh scores, of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT, at the Recommended&#xD;
           Dose(s)(Volume(s)) as determined previously in the Phase I part, in patients with liver&#xD;
           cancers Clinical Investigation Plan - NBTXR3/103&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the antitumor activity in terms of Complete Response Rate (CRR) of target&#xD;
           lesions, as per mRECIST for HCC and RECIST version 1.1 for liver metastases at 12 weeks'&#xD;
           post radiotherapy, of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT, at the Recommended Dose(s) (Volume(s))&#xD;
           as determined previously in the Phase I part, in patients with liver cancer.&#xD;
