  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly associated with obesity, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD, in patients with type 2 diabetes, has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with lipid abnormalities (such as hypertriglyceridemia and decreased&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol) and increased cardiovascular risk. Such lipid abnormalities&#xD;
      (hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-cholesterol) are very frequent in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. Moreover, NAFLD is a risk for further development of cirrhosis (estimated between&#xD;
      3 and 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have shown that liraglutide is able to decrease liver fat content, but the&#xD;
      effect of liraglutide on liver fat content in patients with diabetes remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, human studies with liraglutide have shown significant modification of plasma&#xD;
      lipids, such as reduction of plasma triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol. However, the&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for these liraglutide induced lipid modifications are not yet known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because increased in liver fat content and hypertriglyceridemia are associated in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, it seems interesting to study the effect of liraglutide on both liver&#xD;
      fat content and lipid metabolism using gold-standard methods (proton-spectroscopy for liver&#xD;
      fat content assessment and kinetic study with stable isotope to study lipoprotein&#xD;
      metabolism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric study. Fatty liver content will be performed by proton-spectroscopy in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes (n=120) before and after a 6 month period of liraglutide&#xD;
      therapy (1.2 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, an in vivo kinetic study will be performed with stable isotopes (13C leucine) in 10&#xD;
      patients among the 120 patients with type 2 diabetes (n=10) before and after a 6-month period&#xD;
      of liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) therapy. Each kinetic study will be performed during a 2-day&#xD;
      hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the main study, 3 visits will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a first visit at T0, before starting the treatment with liraglutide, including clinical&#xD;
           and biological measurements and liver fat content assessment by proton-spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a visit at 3 months including clinical and biological measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and a visit at 6 months including clinical and biological measurements and liver fat&#xD;
           content assessment by proton-spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the kinetic substudy, performed in 10 patients, a kinetic study with stable isotope will&#xD;
      been performs during a 48h-hospitalization before starting the treatment with liraglutide and&#xD;
      after 6 month-treatment with liraglutide&#xD;
