      The study will assess the effectiveness, safety and clinical outcomes of the Thoraflex™&#xD;
      Hybrid Device in the treatment of aortic disease affecting the aortic arch and the descending&#xD;
      thoracic aorta, with or without involvement of ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess safety and early clinical outcomes in patients who receive an&#xD;
      extension procedure within 1 year of Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly the study will assess the safety and clinical outcomes of patients who receive a&#xD;
      Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device for treatment of a ruptured aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Endpoint will be freedom from defined Major Adverse Events (MAE) occurring ≤ 1&#xD;
      year post-procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascutek Ltd has developed the Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device (Plexus™ 4 and Ante-Flo™) for the&#xD;
      open surgical repair or replacement of damaged or diseased vessels of the aortic arch and&#xD;
      descending aorta, with or without involvement of the ascending aorta, in cases of aneurysm&#xD;
      and/or dissection. The Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device may be considered a development of the&#xD;
      Elephant Trunk (ET) grafts with the addition of a stented distal section. In some cases this&#xD;
      will allow for a single stage procedure to be carried out, dependent on the length of&#xD;
      affected vessel. As the device is fully sealed and has a collar to aid anastomosis, it&#xD;
      removes the requirement for in situ sealing and the suturing together of two devices, thereby&#xD;
      reducing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and overall procedure time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By reducing the procedure time and negating the need for as many subsequent procedures, this&#xD;
      method could greatly improve the success of this procedure and may improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to treat complex anatomies in addition to reducing procedure and CPB time,&#xD;
      justify the investigation of the Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device. Safety and effectiveness data for&#xD;
      subjects treated with the Thoraflex™ Hybrid Device will be compared to historical data from&#xD;
      subjects treated using standard ET surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 83 patients will be recruited over a 14 month period&#xD;
      (approximately). Patients will be evaluated at the following time points: Pre-procedure,&#xD;
      Implant, Discharge/30 days, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months. An additional visit&#xD;
      may be performed for patients who undergo an extension procedure within 1 year of Thoraflex™&#xD;
      Hybrid Device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      65 patients will be recruited to the primary study group (maximum 19 per site). An additional&#xD;
      group of patients with a ruptured aorta may also be recruited (up to approximately 18&#xD;
      patients across all sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A historical control population has been derived from a comparable patient population who&#xD;
      received treatment for thoracic aortic disease using the current standard of care, which is&#xD;
      the conventional (2-stage) elephant trunk technique. Using data from the comparator&#xD;
      population a Performance Goal Target has been set at 57.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be deemed a success if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval,&#xD;
      associated with the proportion of study patients who are free from the defined composite&#xD;
      Major Adverse Events (permanent stroke, permanent paraplegia/paraparesis, unanticipated&#xD;
      aortic related re-operation and all-cause mortality) at 1 year post procedure, is greater&#xD;
      than 57.4%. Only patients included in the main study group will be included in the&#xD;
      Performance Goal Analysis; patients recruited into the additional Aortic Rupture group will&#xD;
      not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. All patients in the main study group will&#xD;
      be included in the analysis regardless of whether or not an extension procedure has been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
