  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-ascending-dose,&#xD;
      inpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TP-271 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects aged 18 to 50 years who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to seven cohorts of eight subjects each (up to a total of 56 subjects) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      The eight subjects within each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive a single intravenous&#xD;
      dose of TP-271 or placebo. The planned doses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: 0.15 mg/kg Cohort B: 0.45 mg/kg Cohort C: 1.0 mg/kg Cohort D: 2.0 mg/kg Cohort E:&#xD;
      3.0 mg/kg Cohort F: 4.0 mg/kg Cohort G: 5.0 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses of IMP will be administered intravenously on the morning of Day 1 following an&#xD;
      overnight fast (minimum 8 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening Period (within the 28 days prior to the subject receiving TP-271 or&#xD;
      placebo) each subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date an&#xD;
      ICF prior to undergoing any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohorts will follow the same study design (Figure 1). On Day -1, subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the study unit so their eligibility can be confirmed. Subjects will be required&#xD;
      to stay overnight at the study unit on Day -1. On Day 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomized to receive either TP-271 or placebo. Subjects will be required to stay at the&#xD;
      study unit from Day 1 through Day 5 to assess safety and obtain required PK samples. On Day&#xD;
      5, subjects will be discharged from the study unit. A final safety assessment will be&#xD;
      performed once between Day 7 and Day 10 following the subject's dose of IMP.&#xD;
