      The purpose of this research is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the normal or existing dynamic biomechanics of college athletes and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. test the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative medicine in the treatment of athletic&#xD;
           injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion capture using Vicon systems allows researchers to quantify characteristics of a body&#xD;
      such as the range of motion of the hip or shoulder during an athletic technique such as&#xD;
      kicking or shooting a basketball into the basket. The quantified information has been used&#xD;
      before to better understand human mobility and performance. Osteopathic manipulative medicine&#xD;
      (OMM) is manual medicine applied to joints, muscles, and connective tissue with a goal of&#xD;
      improved body functions. Research demonstrating effectiveness of OMM on the musculoskeletal&#xD;
      and associated connective tissue systems health includes, among others, prospective clinical&#xD;
      trials of OMM for treatment of neck pain, low back pain, and acute first- and second-degree&#xD;
      ankle sprains.&#xD;

      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through their Athletic director, coach, or&#xD;
      physician by an announcement made verbally or via email. The motion capture will be performed&#xD;
      under Matthew Cornelius, MS using the Vicon Bonita Motion Capture system in the Fine Arts&#xD;
      Department of NYIT. Following the motion capture, body biomechanics will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine the range of motion of each joint in sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes as&#xD;
      well as the timing and sequence of the movements. The motion analysis will be compared to the&#xD;
      Sports Physical exam, including the general, structural/neuromusculoskeletal, and central&#xD;
      neurological (ImPACT) exams. The comparison will add validity to the physical exam. In&#xD;
      addition, determining if the quantitative, 3-dimensional motion analysis can be correlated&#xD;
      with information from the physical exam with regards to restrictions to motion may be useful&#xD;
      for athletes to optimize their abilities in the future. If during the course of the athlete's&#xD;
      training and competition season s/he sustains an injury, s/he will be evaluated by the NYIT&#xD;
      athletics physician, who will randomly assign the injured athletes to either the 'standard of&#xD;
      care without OMM' or 'standard of care with OMM' cohorts when medically appropriate. OMM will&#xD;
      be performed by an NYITCOM physician specializing in family medicine and OMT or&#xD;
      neuromusculoskeletal systems and OMM. &quot;Return to play' time and&#xD;
      post-intervention/post-control quantitative motion analysis of biomechanics during the&#xD;
      athletes demonstration of the same athletic maneuvers as before the injury.&#xD;
