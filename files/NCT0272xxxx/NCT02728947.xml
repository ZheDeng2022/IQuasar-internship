&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient who has atypical Parkinson's syndrome(s) due to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,&#xD;
             flunarizine), metabolic neurogenetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's Disease), encephalitis,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disease, or degenerative disease (e.g., progressive Supranuclear&#xD;
             Palsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who has a history of pallidotomy, thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, or&#xD;
             fetal tissue transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient who has dementia, active psychosis or hallucinations, or clinically&#xD;
             significant depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient who has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an active attempt,&#xD;

             months as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5&#xD;
             of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient who has a history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of&#xD;
             less than or equal to 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or great than or equal&#xD;
             to 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure when changing from supine to standing position&#xD;
             after having been at supine position for at least 5 minutes within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             the Screening Visit, or SBP less than 105 mmHg at study entry, or reports clinical&#xD;
             signs of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient who is receiving therapy with a dopamine agonist either concurrently or has&#xD;
             done so within 28 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient who is receiving therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to screening: MAO-B inhibitors, DA releasing agents, DA&#xD;
             modulating agent, DA antagonists, neuroleptics, or other medications that may interact&#xD;
             with DA function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient who is currently receiving central nervous system active therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
             sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the dose has been stable&#xD;
             for at least 28 days prior to Screening Visit and is likely to remain stable for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. Patients should not take those medications within 8 hours prior&#xD;
             to clinical visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient who has a current diagnosis of epilepsy, has a history of seizures as an&#xD;
