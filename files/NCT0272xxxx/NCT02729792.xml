    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging treatment for medically&#xD;
      refractory major depressive disorder (MDD). rTMS involves direct stimulation of cortical&#xD;
      neurons using externally applied, powerful, focused magnetic field pulses. Dozens of studies&#xD;
      and several meta-analyses over the last 15 years have shown that rTMS of the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) produces statistically significant improvements in MDD, even when&#xD;
      medications have failed. However, other possible targets may also yield improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of current interventions for TRD, attention&#xD;
      has turned to identifying domain-specific biomarkers in hopes of ultimately individualizing&#xD;
      and predicting treatment response. Unfortunately, the precise nature of this relationship is&#xD;
      less than clear, as reflected by the fact that even now there are no established biomarkers&#xD;
      that are used routinely in clinical practice to aid in diagnosis. This study also seeks to&#xD;
      examine a comprehensive suite of biomarker measurements (MRI, neurophysiology, and&#xD;
      genomics/proteomics) before and after rTMS treatment.&#xD;

      rTMS is a Health-Canada- and FDA-approved treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD),&#xD;
      using focused magnetic field pulses to stimulate brain regions involved in emotion&#xD;
      regulation, safely and non-invasively. Though rTMS is often effective where medications or&#xD;
      therapy fail, it requires a series of lengthy (~30-40 min) treatment sessions. A new form of&#xD;
      rTMS called theta burst stimulation (TBS) has been shown to have greater effects on neural&#xD;
      activity than conventional stimulation, despite requiring as little as 40 s of stimulation.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of an accelerated TBS&#xD;
      protocol, administered 2 times a day in patients with TRD. In addition, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to identify candidate biomarkers from a multimodal suite of neuroimaging, neurophysiologic&#xD;
      and molecular measures that are predictors and correlates of response to rTMS treatment.&#xD;
