  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug cisplatin treats certain cancers when given with other chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
      Researchers think combining cisplatin with 2 other drugs could block proteins that support&#xD;
      cancer cell growth. The other drugs are ABT-888 (veliparib) and VX-970. They want to test if&#xD;
      this drug combination slows the growth of cancer and is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and tolerability of VX-970 and veliparib combined with cisplatin in people&#xD;
      with advanced refractory solid tumors. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of these&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solid tumors that have progressed after treatment or for which no treatment exists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs in 3-week cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin in a vein on 1 or 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VX-970 in a vein on 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Veliparib by mouth twice a day on 6 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cycle, participants will have 5 physical exams and blood tests 5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cycles, participants will have CT scans or MRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cycle 1, participants may have 2 tumor biopsies. A small piece of tissue is removed by&#xD;
      needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a study diary. They will write when they take the drugs and if they&#xD;
      have side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the study as long as they tolerate the drugs and their tumors are&#xD;
      not getting worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a phone call about a month after their last dose.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ataxia-telangiectasia-related (ATR) protein kinase is central to the DNA damage response&#xD;
           and homologous recombination, activating a series of phosphorylation cascades,&#xD;
           culminating in cell cycle arrest to allow time for DNA repair. ATR additionally&#xD;
           facilitates homologous recombination repair through modulation of the p53-replication&#xD;
           protein A (p53-RPA) complex bound to ssDNA during the DNA repair process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) plays a pivotal role in base-excision repair of&#xD;
           single strand breaks formed either due to direct genotoxic stress or during the&#xD;
           processing of double strand breaks. PARP also plays a role in alternative end joining,&#xD;
           which may contribute to combination activity. PARP-1 binding to sites of DNA damage&#xD;
           results in activation of its catalytic activity and generation of chains of poly&#xD;
           (ADP-ribosyl)ated polymers, which serve as docking sites for recruitment of DNA repair&#xD;
           proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent PARP 1/2 inhibitor with clinical evidence of&#xD;
           potentiation of antitumor activity in combination with cisplatin in BRCA mutation&#xD;
           carriers and patients with sporadic triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M6620 (VX-970) is a potent ATR inhibitor, with IC(50) of 20 nM and antitumor activity&#xD;
           across a broad range of cell lines in combination with DNA damaging agents. Preclinical&#xD;
           studies show M6620 (VX-970) synergizes with cisplatin to induce DNA damage and antitumor&#xD;
           activity. The addition of PARP inhibitor veliparib with ATR inhibitor M6620 (VX-970)&#xD;
           allows for impairment of DNA repair, the induction of a BRCA null phenotype, and&#xD;
           potentiation of the antitumor activity of cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To establish the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination of M6620 (VX-970) and veliparib in combination with cisplatin in patients with&#xD;
      advanced refractory solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of the combination of M6620 (VX-970), veliparib, and cisplatin on&#xD;
           markers of DNA damage and apoptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess antitumor activity of the combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To investigate tumor genomic alterations potentially associated with acquired resistance to&#xD;
      the combination of M6620 (VX-970), veliparib, and cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which all standard therapy&#xD;
           known to prolong survival has failed in the metastatic setting, or for which standard&#xD;
           therapies do not exist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have had no major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior&#xD;
           to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially, M6620 (VX-970) will be administered intravenously on Days 2 and 9 of each&#xD;
           21-day cycle. Veliparib will be administered orally twice a day (q12 hours +/- 1 hour)&#xD;
           for Days 1-3 and 8-10 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin will be administered at 40 mg/m2&#xD;
           intravenously on Day 1 (and Day 8 from DL3 onwards) of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As of Amendment I (12/7/2017), patients who have been on study for at least 6 cycles may&#xD;
           have cisplatin administration held or discontinued at the discretion of the PI, Dr.&#xD;
           Chen, in recognition of the cumulative neurotoxicity seen with cisplatin treatment. If&#xD;
           cisplatin is not administered during a cycle M6620 (VX-970) will be administered on Days&#xD;
           1 and 8 of that cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design, whereby patients&#xD;
           will be dose escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD is established, up to 15 additional patients will be enrolled to an&#xD;
           expansion phase at the MTD. Mandatory tumor biopsies will be obtained in the expansion&#xD;
           phase to assess PD endpoints&#xD;

                  in the past 28 days to receive Veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained&#xD;
             stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases&#xD;
             are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             untreated infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients required to be on any of the concomitant medications are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             the effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior platinum-based therapy who have &gt; Grade 1 neurotoxicity or&#xD;
             ototoxicity at the time of enrollment will not be permitted on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a seizure history will not be permitted on protocol due to association&#xD;
             of veliparib with seizure activity in animal toxicology studies at higher doses.&#xD;
             Patients on anticonvulsant medications will not be permitted on study due to the&#xD;
             potential to lower plasma levels of anticonvulsants and risk for seizure activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treatment-related AML (t-AML)/MDS, or with features suggestive of&#xD;
             AML/MDS, or who have had prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical&#xD;
             cord blood transplantation, should not receive Veliparib due to reports of MDS and&#xD;
             leukemia secondary to oncology therapy on CTEP-sponsored studies utilizing Veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
