  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the regulation of the veins of the abdomen&#xD;
      by the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system, and how this may affect high blood pressure.&#xD;
      Normally, the autonomic nervous system controls how much blood flows in the veins. In people&#xD;
      with high blood pressure, however, the autonomic nervous system is changed. This change may&#xD;
      affect the way blood flows in the veins of the abdomen which may play a role in their high&#xD;
      blood pressure. About 32 participants will be screened for the study. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate 16 will be eligible to participate in all of the study days.&#xD;

      The investigators will study male and female subjects, age 40-80 years with possible or&#xD;
      probable Multiple System Atrophy, as defined by Consensus Criteria who suffer from supine&#xD;
      hypertension defined as SBP≥150, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, defined as a&#xD;
      ≥30-mmHg decrease in systolic BP within 3 minutes of standing associated with impaired&#xD;
      autonomic reflexes determined by autonomic testing in the absence of other identifiable&#xD;
      causes. All participants will be able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures. Potential participants will be studied in the Vanderbilt Autonomic&#xD;
      Dysfunction Center (ADC). Medications affecting BP, blood volume and the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system such as antihypertensives, pressor medications and fludrocortisone will be withdrawn&#xD;
      for at least 5 half-lives before studies. Screening procedures can be performed in one or&#xD;
      more days depending on the patient's and investigator's availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo a complete history and physical examination, ECG, routine clinical&#xD;
           laboratory analysis and a blood pregnancy test for women with childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomic testing including sinus arrhythmia, Valsalva maneuver and a posture study with&#xD;
           plasma catecholamines is then performed to determine if they meet the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria. During these tests, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate&#xD;
           (HR) will be obtained using an automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer, finger&#xD;
           photoplethysmography, and continuous ECG. During the orthostatic test, blood samples&#xD;
           will be obtained for hormones that regulate BP, such as catecholamines, while patients&#xD;
           are supine and upright.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history information and results from any of the screening procedures obtained within&#xD;
      the previous 6 months for other studies within this research group may be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Study Day 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Multiple System Atrophy patients with supine hypertension will be studied twice in a&#xD;
      randomized, single blind, crossover design, once with trimethaphan and once with placebo. The&#xD;
      order of administration is randomized. The placebo day will have identical interventions, but&#xD;
      saline will be infused instead of trimethaphan to provide a time control. Studies will be&#xD;
      conducted in a postvoid state and ≥2 hours after meals. Each study day will last 2-3 hours.&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instrumented to measure blood pressure continuously with&#xD;
      photoplethysmography, and intermittently with an automated oscillometric device. Heart rate&#xD;
      will be monitored continuously with ECG. Electrodes will be placed on thorax and abdomen to&#xD;
      measure segmental impedance. Skin blood flow will be measured in the forearm with a laser&#xD;
      Doppler. Cardiac output will be measured by the inert gas rebreathing technique and/or by&#xD;
      impedance cardiography. An IV will be placed in one arm for drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instrumentation baseline measurements will be recorded, including cardiac output and&#xD;
      splanchnic venous capacitance. Venous capacitance will be estimated using an adaptation of&#xD;
      the method of Schmitt et al. In this technique, segmental impedance is monitored, while&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is applied sequentially at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 cm&#xD;
      water (H20) for 1-2 minute each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then receive either placebo (time control) or trimethaphan, to induce complete&#xD;
      withdrawal of residual sympathetic tone. Intravenous infusion of trimethaphan camsylate&#xD;
      (Cambridge Labs) will be started at 0.5-1 mg/min and increased by 1.0 mg/min in 2-6 minute&#xD;
      intervals to one of the following endpoints: presyncopal symptoms, no further decrease in&#xD;
      blood pressure with increased infusion rates, or an infusion rate of 4 mg/min. Once a stable&#xD;
      decrease in blood pressure is obtained, outcome measurements will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal compression will be applied to a sustained 40 mm Hg pressure while supine with an&#xD;
      inflatable binder. Outcome measurements will be repeated 5-15 minutes later. The investigator&#xD;
      may decide not to perform this procedure (due to a longer than anticipated study day duration&#xD;
      / drug infusion). In this case, the study will include only the outcome measurements during&#xD;
      the drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion of trimethaphan is then stopped and patient monitored until blood pressure is&#xD;
      restored to baseline values.&#xD;
