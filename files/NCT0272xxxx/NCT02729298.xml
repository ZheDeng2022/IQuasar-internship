  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase and reverses the mesenchymal&#xD;
      phenotype associated with advanced cancers. Preclinical studies have shown promising&#xD;
      antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types in both in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first-in-human Phase 1a study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors and to identify the&#xD;
      safety profile and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TP-0903. Once the MTD has been&#xD;
      established, additional patients with specific tumor types (advanced solid tumors that have&#xD;
      progressed after achieving a best documented response of at least stable disease (ie, SD, PR,&#xD;
      or CR documented per iRECIST following at least 2 cycles (8 weeks) of immunotherapy, EGFR+&#xD;
      Non Small Cell Lung Cancer [NSCLC] and have demonstrated recent progression following a best&#xD;
      documented response of at least stable disease (ie, SD, PR, or CR documented per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      on ≤2 lines of oral TKIs (Prior chemotherapy ± immunotherapy is allowed as long as the&#xD;
      patient is clearly demonstrating current progression on an EGFR TKI.), BRAF-, KRAS-, or&#xD;
      NRAS-mutated Colorectal Carcinoma [CRC] for whom there is no standard therapy remaining,&#xD;
      persistent/recurrent Ovarian Cancer who would be platinum refractory/ resistant and have had&#xD;
      any number of lines of prior therapy, and BRAF-mutated Melanoma that has not responded to&#xD;
      immunotherapy or a combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor) will be enrolled at the MTD in the Phase&#xD;
      1b study. Data collected from patients enrolled in each of these additional cohorts will be&#xD;
      used for to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of&#xD;
      activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or&#xD;
      given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity profiles.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1a / 1b, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first&#xD;
      21 out of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 phases in this study. In Phase 1a (dose escalation), sequential cohorts of three&#xD;
      (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the&#xD;
      absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified&#xD;
      Fibonacci dose escalation scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been established, dosing will change from BSA-dependent to a flat dose based&#xD;
      on the average of the dose administered in the MTD expansion safety cohort. Once the MTD has&#xD;
      been established, in Ph 1b (expansion), 5 additional cohorts of up to 20 patients each with&#xD;
      specific tumor types (up to 100 additional patients total) may be enrolled at the MTD dose&#xD;
      level to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of&#xD;
      activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or&#xD;
      given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Ten patients in&#xD;
      each of these 5 Expansion Cohorts will be required to consent to undergo pre- and post-dose&#xD;
      tumor biopsies. All patients who undergo these biopsies will comprise the 'Biopsy Cohorts'&#xD;
      (Phase 1b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.&#xD;
