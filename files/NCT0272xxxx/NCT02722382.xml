      Objective: The investigators will change the health system to improve care patients receive&#xD;
      as they transition through earlier stages of kidney disease toward kidney failure. They will&#xD;
      study whether these changes lead to patients' improved health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will conduct this study in Geisinger Health System kidney&#xD;
      specialty clinics. The study will implement 'Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care' which&#xD;
      will (1) give doctors tools to help them recognize when patients should prepare for kidney&#xD;
      failure and help them support patients' early and informed treatment decisions; and (2) add a&#xD;
      'Kidney Transitions Specialist' to the health care team to help patients learn about kidney&#xD;
      disease, learn self-care skills, make informed decisions, get psychosocial support, and&#xD;
      coordinate their care. Four (4) clinics will be randomly assigned to provide Patient Centered&#xD;
      Kidney Transitions Care, and four (4) to provide their usual care. The investigators will&#xD;
      study differences in patients' outcomes among those treated in clinics providing Patient&#xD;
      Centered Kidney Transitions Care compared to those treated in clinics providing usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Outcomes: Patients have told us they want to have 'control' over their disease&#xD;
      transitions and to have the best quality of life possible. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      patients' empowerment, confidence with their self-care, their decisions to start self-care&#xD;
      treatments for kidney failure, and their hospitalizations. They will also measure whether&#xD;
      doctors record patients' treatment preferences in the medical record before patients develop&#xD;
      kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and Stakeholder Engagement: This study responds to reports from hundreds of patients&#xD;
      and caregivers who want better care. Patients and caregivers from around the US are part of&#xD;
      our investigative team, and they will participate in all aspects of our study. The&#xD;
      investigators are also engaging key stakeholders in the kidney community, including patients,&#xD;
      providers, payers, and regulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Impact: If effective, Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care will provide a&#xD;
      model of care can improve the lives of patients and families with kidney disease across the&#xD;
      US.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease affects 20 million US adults who experience multifold excess morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality compared to the general public. Over 115,000 patients develop kidney failure&#xD;
      each year. For these patients, disease is often accompanied by unpredictable rapid rates of&#xD;
      kidney function decline in its later stages. Unpredictable declines in kidney function&#xD;
      commonly result in poorly planned transitions from seemingly stable chronic disease&#xD;
      management to urgent or emergent needs for kidney failure treatments. These sudden&#xD;
      transitions are often medically and psychologically traumatic for patients. Without advance&#xD;
      planning and support, most patients initiate dialysis emergently, and they are unprepared to&#xD;
      undergo substantial life changes and disability associated with treatments such as&#xD;
      thrice-weekly hemodialysis. They also miss important early opportunities to select treatments&#xD;
      (e.g., self care dialysis at home or kidney transplants) that could align with their values&#xD;
      and improve their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is difficult to predict who will suddenly develop kidney failure, all patients with&#xD;
      later stage CKD should (a) be equipped to manage risks for disease progression and (b) learn&#xD;
      about treatment options for kidney failure with enough time to understand and plan for&#xD;
      possible treatments. Plans for some treatments, such as kidney transplant, are complex,&#xD;
      requiring multiple referrals, diagnostic tests, and medical visits. The loss of kidney&#xD;
      function is also, in some cases, accompanied by cognitive decline or by emotional&#xD;
      disturbances (including denial, fear, or depression). As a result, patients need time to&#xD;
      assimilate information and support to help them make informed decisions, coordinate their&#xD;
      care, and obtain psychosocial help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health system support for patients' kidney disease transitions is often inadequate. As a&#xD;
      result, patients have poor understanding of kidney disease treatments, feel care is not&#xD;
      patient centered, and are 'blind-sided' by the seemingly catastrophic initiation of&#xD;
      dialysis-- causing suffering and receipt of treatments they don't want. Efficacious&#xD;
      educational, psychosocial, and care management interventions exist, but they are implemented&#xD;
      in piecemeal fashion and are not readily accessible. Health system infrastructure and&#xD;
      resources enabling integrated delivery of efficacious interventions may be the crucial&#xD;
      missing link to ensuring patients' are supported through their to kidney failure and to&#xD;
      improving their health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to improve health systems' capacities to provide comprehensive care&#xD;
      for patients as they transition from chronic kidney disease to kidney failure. Specifically,&#xD;
      they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care infrastructure that (a) prioritizes&#xD;
           kidney patients' informed self-care and treatment decisions and (b) supports patients&#xD;
           through their transitions across kidney disease stages by providing education,&#xD;
           psychosocial support, and biomedical preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the effectiveness of the new Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care&#xD;
           infrastructure to improve patients' values-aligned kidney care, empowerment, and&#xD;
           well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a cluster randomized controlled trial among 8 nephrology&#xD;
      clinics in Geisinger Health System. Clinics provide nephrology care for over 2.6 million&#xD;
      patients in 44 rural and suburban counties in eastern Pennsylvania. The study will target&#xD;
      adults (age &gt;18 years) with estimated glomerular filtration rates of &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2 or&#xD;
      increased risk of disease progression. Practice populations are substantially rural with&#xD;
      moderate to low education and advanced age. Practices serve 997 patients, and we anticipate&#xD;
      498 patients in each arm (each arm comprised of 4 practices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In four clinics, the investigators will implement 'Patient Centered Kidney Transitions Care'.&#xD;
      This intervention will implement two major health system changes, including (1) new&#xD;
      electronic health information tools to alert providers when patients need kidney transitions&#xD;
      care and to help them establish patients' preference aligned care; and (2) add a 'Kidney&#xD;
      Transitions Specialist' to the health care team plus resources to support patients'&#xD;
      transitions. Electronic health information tools will include (a) a disease registry and&#xD;
      personalized risk prediction tools to prompt physicians when patients need transitions&#xD;
      support and prepare patients for kidney failure when the time is right, and (b) a modular&#xD;
      computer application which will help patients enter their values and treatment preferences&#xD;
      into their own health records and help providers track their care. The Kidney Transitions&#xD;
      Specialist will (1) facilitate patients' education and engage in shared decision-making with&#xD;
      patients and caregivers; (2) empower patients to improve self-care through behavioral&#xD;
      training; (3) engage peer and professional social and emotional support; (4) navigate&#xD;
      patients through multi-step biomedical plans; and (5) advocate for aligning patients' care&#xD;
      with their values. We will compare outcomes in clinics implementing Patient Centered Kidney&#xD;
      Transitions Care to outcomes in four clinics that will proceed with routine nephrology care,&#xD;
      which does not include health information tools or changes to the health care team or&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will measure patients' empowerment, self-efficacy with self-care, decisions&#xD;
      to start self-care treatments, and hospitalizations. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      documentation of patients' preferences in the electronic health record. These outcomes were&#xD;
      chosen because patients have told us they want to feel they have 'control' over their disease&#xD;
      and they want the best quality of life possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term, these findings will provide important information on how to improve the health and&#xD;
      well being of patients as they transition from chronic kidney disease to kidney failure. If&#xD;
      effective, this work will provide a model that can be replicated by health systems across the&#xD;
      US.&#xD;
