      Salt fluids are used extensively for acutely ill patients who are admitted to hospital. Two&#xD;
      salt fluids commonly used are Normal Saline and Ringer's Lactate. Both are used to rehydrate&#xD;
      patients, restore fluid volume and help stabilize blood pressure and failing organs. Both&#xD;
      salt fluids have been used for several decades. Until recently, it was thought the fluids are&#xD;
      essentially equivalent other than some minor differences related to the concentration of salt&#xD;
      components (sodium and chloride) and buffers (Ringer's Lactate has lactate as a buffer).&#xD;
      Recent data suggest that salt fluids containing less chloride like the Ringer's Lactate,&#xD;
      cause less acid in the blood, less kidney failure, and less death. However, the studies to&#xD;
      date are small and weak in their design and it is possible that there are no important&#xD;
      differences that affect patients. Hence, the research team will conduct a robust pragmatic&#xD;
      clinical trial where several academic and community hospitals will be randomized to use&#xD;
      either Ringer's Lactate only or Normal Saline only for a period of three months. The trial&#xD;
      will yield high quality and robust data to determine if Ringers Lactate reduces death and&#xD;
      re-admissions to hospital. Before embarking on this large-scale trial, it is important to&#xD;
      conduct a smaller (pilot) trial to evaluate if the larger trial will be feasible and not too&#xD;
      costly. In this small trial involving no less than 4 hospitals, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine how well the fluid interventions are adhered to in each hospital, record how long&#xD;
      it takes to receive approval from research ethics boards and be ready to start the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will also record challenges and develop solutions related to the operations of&#xD;
      the trial, and describe important clinical and outcome data essential for the design and&#xD;
      planning of the large trial.&#xD;

      Other than the administration of oxygen, crystalloid resuscitation fluids are the most common&#xD;
      intervention administered to the majority of hospitalized patients. These fluids may be used&#xD;
      as a life saving measure to re-establish hemodynamic stability, for rehydration, and to&#xD;
      replace losses and maintain intravascular volume in the surgical setting. In the province of&#xD;
      Ontario alone, approximately 1 million patients per year will receive one or both of these&#xD;
      resuscitation fluids during their hospital admission. The two most common usual care&#xD;
      resuscitation crystalloid fluids are Normal Saline and Ringer's Lactate and until recently&#xD;
      there was no evidence to suggest that one crystalloid fluid was clinically superior to the&#xD;
      other. However, the safety of Normal Saline is now being questioned due to its high chloride&#xD;
      content and its association with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.&#xD;
      Studies in healthy volunteers and observational studies in the critically ill and surgical&#xD;
      patient populations have associated saline with an increased risk of acute renal injury and&#xD;
      requirement for dialysis, post-operative infections, death and increased resource and blood&#xD;
      transfusion use. The evidence base is currently weak given that the majority of studies are&#xD;
      observational and suffer from methodological weaknesses including confounding by indication,&#xD;
      selection bias, and inability to disentangle the effects of a specific fluid due to&#xD;
      interaction of co-interventions administered. As such, several authors and editorials have&#xD;
      called for adequately powered randomized controlled trials with clinically relevant outcomes&#xD;
      to determine if Ringer's Lactate is indeed superior to Normal Saline for resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given their widespread use, small differences in clinical outcomes between crystalloid&#xD;
      resuscitation fluids are highly relevant. Furthermore, small absolute differences in&#xD;
      important clinical outcomes translate into significant savings to hospitals and the health&#xD;
      care system. To illustrate, if death and hospital re-admissions were each reduced by an&#xD;
      absolute 0.5%, this would translate to approximately 2500 lives saved and savings of 10&#xD;
      million dollars to the Ontario health care system. Hence, in collaboration with the Canadian&#xD;
      Critical Care Trials Group, the Crystalloid FLUID Choices for Hospitalized Patients (FLUID)&#xD;
      trial will examine whether Ringer's Lactate as compared to Normal Saline reduces clinically&#xD;
      important outcomes such as death, and hospital re-admissions - outcomes that are particularly&#xD;
      relevant to hospitals and the health care system. This proposal is a large pragmatic cluster&#xD;
      cross-over comparative effectiveness trial that will be conducted in both academic and&#xD;
      community centres in Ontario. It will involve waivers of consent and a novel design making&#xD;
      use of provincially available health administrative data through the Institute of Clinical&#xD;
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES) to facilitate all data collected in the trial. The trial will&#xD;
      answer this fundamental fluid resuscitation question with much less cost in comparison to an&#xD;
      individual patient randomized controlled trial. It will help build expertise and capacity for&#xD;
      future trials of similar design in the province of Ontario and throughout Canada. However,&#xD;
      prior to embarking on a large-scale trial, it is imperative to conduct a pilot trial to&#xD;
      determine feasibility and optimize the trial design.&#xD;
