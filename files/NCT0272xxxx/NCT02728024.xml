      The study is undertaken at three German neurosurgical centers (Ulm, Mainz, Stuttgart) between&#xD;
      March 2014 and March 2015. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80, diagnosis of glioma&#xD;
      WHO° II-IV, absence of aphasia impairing communication or consent. In an outpatient setting&#xD;
      all eligible patients with gliomas were screened for distress (Distress Thermometer (DT)) and&#xD;
      their need for psychosocial support (Supportive Care Needs Survey-SF34-G (SCNS)).&#xD;
      Simultaneously their HRQoL was assessed (EORTC QLQ-C30+BN-20 Vers. 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at different disease stages were asked to fill out the questionnaires. At two study&#xD;
      centers patients were asked to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment with&#xD;
      personal instructions in randomly selected cases. At the third study center, they completed&#xD;
      the questionnaires after their outpatient appointment with personal aid and instructions. At&#xD;
      the time of investigation, patients were at different stages of treatment (chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiation, re-chemotherapy, re-radiation, none, etc.).&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three neuro-oncological outpatient departments of the three study centers (two of them are&#xD;
      university medical centers, one a teaching hospital), glioma patients were assessed between&#xD;
      March 2014 and March 2015 using three questionnaires. Due to the infrastructure of the&#xD;
      outpatient departments, assessing ment of supportive care needs, HRQoL, and distress, by the&#xD;
      questionnaires was performed either with the opportunity of personal support by the study&#xD;
      members (group A) or by patients alone (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A, a member of the study group (no caregivers) offered help and stayed with the&#xD;
      patient the whole time while the patient was filling in the questionnaires. Every patient&#xD;
      received an explanation and was offered additional support. If questions occurred or the&#xD;
      patient was not able to fill in the questionnaires by him-/herself, the study member helped&#xD;
      by answering questions, assisting or describing the questionnaires in detail or even reading&#xD;
      out the questions to the patient and filling in the answers which were chosen by the patient.&#xD;
      The extent of the assistance by the study members varied depending on the impairment of the&#xD;
      patient. Occurrence and details of difficulties in completion were assessed by a feedback&#xD;
      form especially developed for this study which was filled in by the member of the study group&#xD;
      after completing the instruments. If patients were unable to complete the questionnaires by&#xD;
      themselves, the reason for this was documented by the interviewer (e.g. neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment, physical disability, decreased attention span, etc. based and categorized on&#xD;
      clinical judgement of the interviewer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B, patients completed the questionnaires on their own. In one study center,&#xD;
      Allocation to study groups was randomized in one study center (block randomization&#xD;
      independently provided by Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Mainz). Patients in the other&#xD;
      two centers were either always group A or always group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, socio-demographic data, tumor stage, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), pre-and&#xD;
      postsurgical clinical characteristics (e.g. postoperative tumor remnant, localization of the&#xD;
      tumor), and adjuvant therapies were documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was undertaken in concordance with national law, institutional ethical standards&#xD;
      and the Helsinki Declaration, and the ethic commissions of all three study centers approved&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria for this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a glial cerebral tumor (astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma),&#xD;
           as diagnosed by the local neuro- pathologist in the study center;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patient is affiliated with the neuro-oncological outpatient center in one of the three&#xD;
           study centers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patient is able to understand and respond to the questions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. informed consent of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRO Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first assessment, the SCNS-SF34-G, Distress Thermometer (DT), EORTC -QLQ- C30 + EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-BN20 and were used, for the second assessment after 3-5 months the SCNS-ST9, DT, and&#xD;
      EORTC-QLQ-C30 + EORTC QLQ-BN-20 were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCNS-SF34, a short-form version of the SCNS long-form, is a self-reporting instrument&#xD;
      measuring patients' needs of supportive care. It consists of five domains: health system and&#xD;
      information, psychological, physical and daily living, patient care and support, and&#xD;
      sexuality needs. Lehmann et al. demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in the German&#xD;
      version. On a 5-point Likert scale, patients indicate if they are in need of support and, if&#xD;
      so, the extent of their need (1 = no need, not applicable; 2 = no need, satisfied; 3 = low&#xD;
      need; 4 = moderate need; 5 = high need).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCNS-SF9 is an ultrashort screening instrument developed of the SCNS-SF34 consisting of&#xD;
      nine questions. The structure of the screening instruments is similar to the SCNS-SF34-G with&#xD;
      the same 5-point Likert scale as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a frequently used questionnaire including 30 items to assess quality of&#xD;
      life in oncological patients and includes five functional scores (physical, role, emotional,&#xD;
      social, and cognitive function). The reliability and validity of the instrument have been&#xD;
      approved in many clinical trials, and it has been translated into 85 languages. The brain&#xD;
      module (QLQ-BN20) comprises 20 questions developed for brain tumor patients and includes four&#xD;
      functional scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Distress Thermometer (DT), a self-reporting instrument, evaluates psychological distress&#xD;
      using a visual analogue scale along with 40 items assessing financial, physical, emotional&#xD;
      and spiritual concerns (problem list). Developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      (NCCN), the German version was adapted in 2007. A score of six or above on the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale is recommended as a cut-off for a clinically significant level of distress for&#xD;
      brain tumor patients. The DT is well accepted for in oncological patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary evaluation of feasibility of the questionnaires in clinical routine was analyzed&#xD;
      by analyzing the occurrence of missing values and the occurrence of errors in the SCNS-SF34-G&#xD;
      and SCNS-ST9. Missing values were assessed in the categories single missing items (at least&#xD;
      one item per questionnaire missing) and missing questionnaire (complete questionnaire was not&#xD;
      filled in). An error was defined as multiple responses for an item where only one response&#xD;
      per patient would have been correct. For both outcomes comparisons were made to the EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C30+BN20 and DT as well as between groups A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study members providing support for the patients of group A gave feasibility feedback&#xD;
      regarding the difficulties occurred during the assessment after each patient using a 10-item&#xD;
      feedback form developed for this study with the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of difficulties (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time needed for assessment (10-20min, 21-30min, 31-40min, 41-50 min, &gt;51min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impairment of the patients (none, cognitive, psychological, physical)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If problems during the assessment occurred (none/rare/moderate/severe; defined by the&#xD;
           frequency of questions asked by the patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which difficulties occurred (understanding questionnaire/complexity of&#xD;
           questionnaire/extend of questions/physical problems e.g. paresis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which questionnaire caused problems (EORTC/DT/SCNS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which questionnaires were filled in with/without assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aid intensity level provided by the study members (assistance in one, two or all three&#xD;
           questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where possible these items were also analyzed in comparison to the other PRO instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties occurred in the SCNS were compared to the EORTC QLQ-C30+BN20 and DT whenever&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
