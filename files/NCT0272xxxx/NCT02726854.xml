      The main research purpose Evaluation of objective response Apatinib second-line treatment of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer (ORR) and the rate of progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective to study the objective and exploratory secondary research To observe the Apatinib&#xD;
      in second line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer disease control rate (DCR), patients&#xD;
      with overall survival (OS) benefit, treatment effects on quality of life (QOL) score and drug&#xD;
      safety evaluation, To investigate the relationship of apatinib as second-line treatment of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor(VEGFR) in the serum&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer patients after failure of first-line chemotherapy cannot tolerate second-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy or unwilling to receive second-line chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients.To investigate the relationship between apatinib as second-line treatment of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor(VEGFR) in the serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study choose the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an JiaoTong University were unable to&#xD;
      tolerate the failure of first-line chemotherapy for second-line chemotherapy or unwilling to&#xD;
      receive second-line chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer patients as the research object, the&#xD;
      clinical data of clinical subjects age and sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group （ECOG）&#xD;
      score, tumor stage, pathological type, pathological grading, giving apatinib treatment,&#xD;
      during the treatment of blood monitoring in patients with CA199 levels, imaging findings,&#xD;
      assessment of tumor related symptoms and adverse events, and the expression of VEGFR in blood&#xD;
      was measured by ELISA method, the curative effect evaluation of the end of the 2 cycle of&#xD;
      treatment, patients with effective evaluation to oral apatinib, through the statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the data of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), the rate of&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) expression of CA199 content in serum and serum VEGFR levels&#xD;
      of the relevant indicators,. Explore Apatinib for the curative effect and safety of the&#xD;
      second-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, and to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      the serum VEGF expression level.&#xD;
