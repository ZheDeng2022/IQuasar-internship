      The purpose of this study is to examine if glucocorticoids will change neural activation in&#xD;
      regions of the corticolimbic-striatal system that regulate feeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis tested in this study will be to determine if that in response to food&#xD;
      cues, glucocorticoids will change neural activation in regions of the corticolimbic-striatal&#xD;
      system that regulate feeding. It is anticipate that these changes will correlate with hunger&#xD;
      ratings and food intake. Further, this research will also examine if glucocorticoids will&#xD;
      increase the basal metabolic rate and alter multiple systemic appetite-regulating hormones&#xD;
      compared to saline. It is expected that these changes will correlate positively with hunger&#xD;
      ratings and food intake as well.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Brain Response to Food Imagery</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Brain response to images of food either during hydrocortisone infusion or saline infusion will be measured through fMRI. Brain response is operationally defined as the change in functional MRI-measured blood oxygen levels in specific regions of the brain between the resting state and intervention state. The fMRI sequences last anywhere from 1-5 min. Total scan time will be approximately 90 minutes. The slices taken with each sequences equal 25-75.&#xD;
The outcome is a comparison between the resting oxygen levels and oxygen levels during the interventions. BioImage Suite software is used to categorize if there is a significance between the two levels at a p &lt; 0.05.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Hunger Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Average hunger rating will be captured using the Visual Food Cue Task. This standardized method presents a series of images consisting of high calorie food, low calorie food, and non-food pictures presented randomly across four runs during the fMRI session. Each picture will be presented only once in a randomized order for each participant.&#xD;
Participants will be instructed to rate their &quot;hunger&quot;, &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;wanting&quot; of the item on a 9-point Likert scale utilizing a 4-key button box. The hunger, wanting, and liking scales are all rated on a scale of 1-9, 1 being the least and 9 being the most. These scores are presented as an average across measurement points during the fMRI. Every time a food image is shown, the rater provides a rating of hunger, wanting and liking of it- people will be shown approximately 40-60 photos.</description>
