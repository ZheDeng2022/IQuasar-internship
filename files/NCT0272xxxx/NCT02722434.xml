      This randomized clinical trial studies how well MC5-A scrambler therapy or transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy work in treating patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness,&#xD;
      tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body). MC5-A scrambler&#xD;
      therapy is a type of treatment for nerve pain that uses electrodes placed on the skin, where&#xD;
      electricity is carried from the electrodes through the skin and blocks the pain. TENS is a&#xD;
      procedure in which mild electric currents are applied to some areas of the skin. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether TENS therapy is more effective than MC5-A scrambler therapy in treating&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the efficacy of scrambler therapy (MC5-A scrambler therapy) compared to TENS&#xD;
      therapy for pain and/or tingling related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      (CIPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the tolerability of scrambler therapy and compare it to TENS therapy, in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate whether scrambler therapy, compared to TENS therapy, can decrease the use of&#xD;
      pain medication for CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore whether messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression before and after&#xD;
      scrambler therapy shows similar findings to what Starkweather et al observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Utilizing high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to define alterations in functional&#xD;
      differences (using resting state blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] measures to measure&#xD;
      differences in functional connectivity) in treated with the scrambler device in the setting&#xD;
      of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Explore whether scrambler therapy will alter sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo MC5-A scrambler therapy over 30 minutes for 10 consecutive weekdays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo TENS therapy over 30 minutes daily for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both Arms, may crossover to the opposite Arm for an additional 2 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment if they elect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 8 weeks.&#xD;
