  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      in breast cancer survivors. In this pilot study, the investigators want to learn if it is&#xD;
      feasible to use this device in memory rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>We will collect: 1) self-reported demographic information (~5 min) 2) cognitive functioning data (PAOFI) at session 1 and session 4 (~10min) [60]; 3) behavioral data and EEG data from the tDCS stimulation task for each session (downloaded by investigators); 4) patient feedback on their experience with tDCS (tDCS Patient Experience Questionnaire (tPEQ)) for each session (~5 min); 5) tDCS accrual and session completion rates at the completion of treatment and 6) Brunoni Adverse Events Questionnaire (~5 min)</description>
