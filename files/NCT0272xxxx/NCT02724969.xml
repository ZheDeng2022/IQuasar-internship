  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility,&#xD;
      and acceptability of a mobile, semi-automated text message-based intervention (MILK) to&#xD;
      prevent perceived low or insufficient milk supply (PIM) among mothers without prior&#xD;
      breastfeeding experience. PIM is the leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation, and&#xD;
      prior work shows that it is often rooted in low breastfeeding self-efficacy and&#xD;
      misconceptions about lactation physiology and trajectory. The MILK intervention is designed&#xD;
      to address PIM, as well as other common breastfeeding problems via semi-automated text&#xD;
      messages of prenatal and postpartum breastfeeding education and support. Messages are&#xD;
      time-sensitive (e.g., specific to gestational age, time since delivery) and based on the&#xD;
      Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy (Social Cognitive) Theory; they are also modeled from pilot work&#xD;
      that investigated how first-time mothers view, manage and describe breastfeeding problems.&#xD;
      Messages were vetted with clinical lactation experts, as well as pregnant and postpartum&#xD;
      women with no other children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MILK intervention will be trialed against a control intervention group, who will receive&#xD;
      general perinatal education through the national Text4Baby system. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit approximately 186 healthy, pregnant women at 13-25 weeks gestation from Magee Women's&#xD;
      Hospital clinics and outpatient sites. Women will be randomized via computer-generated simple&#xD;
      randomization to the experimental or control intervention. Both groups will receive text&#xD;
      messages 3-5 times per week from week 25 of pregnancy through week 8 postpartum. Measured&#xD;
      outcomes of interest will include perceived breast milk supply, breastfeeding confidence,&#xD;
      maternal anxiety, breastfeeding exclusivity, and breastfeeding duration. Data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (13-25 gestational weeks), 34-36 gestational weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, and&#xD;
      8 weeks postpartum via online survey or telephone call. To assess the potential longer-term&#xD;
      impact of the intervention, breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity will be reassessed via&#xD;
      telephone at 6 months postpartum. Between group and group x time differences in outcome&#xD;
      measures will be examined graphically and via linear mixed modeling. To inform modifications&#xD;
      to MILK, telephone interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants in each group&#xD;
      to assess and compare intervention use, burdens and challenges, and suggested alterations (8&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the MILK Trial is to examine and compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability of a semi-automated, text-based, theory-driven intervention (&quot;MILK&quot;&#xD;
      intervention) to prevent perceived insufficient milk and its potential inter-related&#xD;
      sequelae, including maternal anxiety and early breastfeeding cessation, among mothers without&#xD;
      breastfeeding experience who intend to exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeed.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of the MILK intervention on perceived insufficient milk supply&#xD;
           (PIM) and related maternal psychological and behavioral sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compared to the control intervention group (&quot;Text4Baby&quot;), the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that MILK participants will have a perception of greater breast milk volume/supply,&#xD;
           higher self-reported breastfeeding confidence, lower anxiety scores, and longer duration&#xD;
           of exclusive breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the feasibility of a semi-automated text-based PIM intervention (MILK) for&#xD;
           mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare characteristics of women who are and who are not eligible for,&#xD;
      chose to participate in, and complete this randomized pilot intervention study. The&#xD;
      investigators will also conduct post-study individual interviews with mothers to determine&#xD;
      how the interventions were used and perceived (e.g., burden, challenges).&#xD;
