  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of a fixed dose of tanezumab 5&#xD;
      mg and 10 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) seven times at 8 week intervals. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long term safety of tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg&#xD;
      administrated SC every 8 weeks (7 administrations). In addition, the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      long term analgesic efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg SC administered every 8 weeks (7&#xD;
      administrations).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3&#xD;
      study of the safety and efficacy of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for up to 56&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with chronic low back pain. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment groups will include: 1) Placebo SC matching tanezumab&#xD;
      administered at an 8-week interval (total of 7 times) plus celecoxib 100 mg twice a day (BID)&#xD;
      to be administered orally for 56 weeks; 2) Tanezumab 5 mg SC administered at an 8-week&#xD;
      interval (total of 7 times) plus placebo matching celecoxib to be administered orally BID for&#xD;
      56 weeks; 3) Tanezumab 10 mg SC administered at an 8-week interval (total of 7 times) plus&#xD;
      placebo matching celecoxib to be administered orally BID for 56 weeks. The study is designed&#xD;
      with a total duration (post-randomization) of up to 80 weeks and will consist of three&#xD;
      periods: Screening (up to 37 days; includes a Washout Period and an Initial Pain Assessment&#xD;
      Period [IPAP]), a Double-blind Treatment Period (56 weeks) and a Follow-up Period (24 weeks).&#xD;
      The Screening Period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout&#xD;
      Period (lasting 2 to 32 days), if required, and an IPAP (the 5 days prior to&#xD;
      Randomization/Baseline). Prior to entering the study, subjects must be experiencing some&#xD;
      benefit (eg, analgesic effect) from their current stable dose regimen of oral NSAID&#xD;
      (celecoxib, loxoprofen or meloxicam) treatment, be tolerating their NSAID regimen, be taking&#xD;
      this medication regularly (defined as an average of at least 5 days per week) during the 30&#xD;
      day period prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;

    <description>SAS is a participant rated 12 items questionnaire for males and 11 items questionnaire for females. SAS measures autonomic symptoms of neuropathy and their impact on participants' well-being, during the past 6 months. Each item was related to a symptom/health problem. At scheduled time points, participants were asked to answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for each of symptoms/health problems experienced during past 6 months. If a participant answered &quot;Yes&quot; for a symptom, then impact of that symptom was rated on a 5 point scale, ranged from 1 (least sever impact) to 5 (most severe impact), where higher scores signified more severe impact of symptoms. The total symptom impact score was calculated as the sum of impact of all symptoms. Overall possible range for the total symptom impact score was 0 (no impact) to 60 (extreme impact) for males and 0 (no impact) to 55 (extreme impact) for females, higher scores indicated more severe impact of symptoms on participants' well-being.</description>

Each of 24 items related to cranial nerves and muscle weakness, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis); higher scores indicated higher abnormality/impairment. Each of 13 items related to reflexes and sensation, scored as 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent); higher scores indicated lesser reflexes and sensation. For NIS possible overall score (combined of both left and right sides of each domain), ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased/more neuropathic deficits.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses from each of the 5 domains were used to calculate overall health state/a single utility index value. Example: if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined single index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. Japan value sets (with all possible health states) was used in the study, overall health utility score ranged from -0.111 (minimum score) to 1 (maximum score). Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 56</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM v.II: participant rated 11 items questionnaire. Items 1, 2, 7 to 11 were scored as: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= dissatisfied, 4= somewhat satisfied, 5= satisfied, 6= very satisfied, 7= extremely satisfied. Items 4 to 6 were scored as: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= somewhat dissatisfied, 4= slightly dissatisfied, 5= not at all dissatisfied. Item 3 was scored as: 0= No, 1= Yes. Four parameters with respect to study medication were evaluated: Effectiveness = ([Item 1+Item 2] - 2 )/12 *100; Side effects = ([Item 4 + Item 5 + Item 6] - 3)/12 *100, if one item is missing then: ([Sum of two completed items]-2]/8 *100; Convenience = ([Item 7 + Item 8 + Item 9] - 3)/18 *100, if one item is missing then: ([Sum of two completed items]-2)/12 *100; Global satisfaction = ([Item 10+Item 11] - 2 ]/12 *100. Each of the 4 parameters had a scale of 0 (no satisfaction) to 100 (best level of satisfaction), higher score = greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 24 weeks after last dose of study drug (up to Week 80) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

        <title>Change From Screening in Mean Total Symptom Impact Score as Per Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS) at Week 24</title>
        <description>SAS is a participant rated 12 items questionnaire for males and 11 items questionnaire for females. SAS measures autonomic symptoms of neuropathy and their impact on participants' well-being, during the past 6 months. Each item was related to a symptom/health problem. At scheduled time points, participants were asked to answer &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for each of symptoms/health problems experienced during past 6 months. If a participant answered &quot;Yes&quot; for a symptom, then impact of that symptom was rated on a 5 point scale, ranged from 1 (least sever impact) to 5 (most severe impact), where higher scores signified more severe impact of symptoms. The total symptom impact score was calculated as the sum of impact of all symptoms. Overall possible range for the total symptom impact score was 0 (no impact) to 60 (extreme impact) for males and 0 (no impact) to 55 (extreme impact) for females, higher scores indicated more severe impact of symptoms on participants' well-being.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening in Mean Total Symptom Impact Scores as Per Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS) at Early Termination Follow-up Visit 3</title>
        <description>SAS: participant rated 12 items questionnaire for males; 11 items questionnaire for females. SAS measures autonomic symptoms of neuropathy and their impact on participants' well-being, during past 6 months. Each item was related to a symptom/health problem. At scheduled time points, participants answered &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for each of symptoms/health problems experienced during past 6 months. If participant answered &quot;Yes&quot; for a symptom, then impact of that symptom was rated on 5 point scale (1 [least sever impact] to 5 [most severe impact]); higher scores = more severe impact of symptoms. Total impact score = sum of impact of all symptoms; range for males =0 (no impact) to 60 (extreme impact); females =0 (no impact) to 55 (extreme impact); higher scores = more severe impact of symptoms on participants' well-being. Participants discontinuing from study treatment before Week 56, had early termination follow-up visit 3 at 24 weeks after last dose of tanezumab or placebo matched to tanezumab.</description>

Rapidly progressive (RP) OA type 1 events were those that the adjudication committee considered to have significant loss of joint space width &gt;= 2 millimeter within approximately 1 year without gross structural failure. RP OA type 2 events were those considered to have destruction of bone including limited or total collapse of at least 1 subchondral surface that is not normally present in conventional end-stage osteoarthritis. Subchondral insufficiency fractures are a type of stress fractures which occur below the cartilage on the weight bearing surface of a bone.</description>

Observation time was defined as the start day of first SC study medication until either the (i) date of completion of or withdrawal from study, if a participant did not have the event, or (ii) date of the event (earliest event within each participant in the case of multiple events). Event rate for any individual adjudicated joint safety outcome/event = the number of events per 1000 participant-years at risk.</description>

          <title>Observation Time-Adjusted Event Rate for an Individual Adjudicated Joint Safety Outcome/Event</title>
          <description>Individual adjudicated joint safety outcomes/event: rapidly progressive OA (type-1,type-2), primary osteonecrosis, pathological fracture and subchondral insufficiency fracture. Observation time was defined as the start day of first SC study medication until either the (i) date of completion of or withdrawal from study, if a participant did not have the event, or (ii) date of the event (earliest event within each participant in the case of multiple events). Event rate for any individual adjudicated joint safety outcome/event = the number of events per 1000 participant-years at risk.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Week 2</title>
        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate signs of peripheral neuropathy in participants. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side of following 4 domains: cranial nerves (5 items), muscle weakness (19 items), reflexes (5 items) and sensation (8 items). Each of 24 items related to cranial nerves and muscle weakness, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis); higher scores indicated higher abnormality/impairment. Each of 13 items related to reflexes and sensation, scored as 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent); higher scores indicated lesser reflexes and sensation. For NIS possible overall score (combined of both left and right sides of each domain), ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased/more neuropathic deficits.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Week 4</title>
          <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate signs of peripheral neuropathy in participants. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side of following 4 domains: cranial nerves (5 items), muscle weakness (19 items), reflexes (5 items) and sensation (8 items). Each of 24 items related to cranial nerves and muscle weakness, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis); higher scores indicated higher abnormality/impairment. Each of 13 items related to reflexes and sensation, scored as 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent); higher scores indicated lesser reflexes and sensation. For NIS possible overall score (combined of both left and right sides of each domain), ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased/more neuropathic deficits.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Week 40</title>
        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate signs of peripheral neuropathy in participants. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side of following 4 domains: cranial nerves (5 items), muscle weakness (19 items), reflexes (5 items) and sensation (8 items). Each of 24 items related to cranial nerves and muscle weakness, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis); higher scores indicated higher abnormality/impairment. Each of 13 items related to reflexes and sensation, scored as 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent); higher scores indicated lesser reflexes and sensation. For NIS possible overall score (combined of both left and right sides of each domain), ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased/more neuropathic deficits.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Week 80</title>
          <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate signs of peripheral neuropathy in participants. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side of following 4 domains: cranial nerves (5 items), muscle weakness (19 items), reflexes (5 items) and sensation (8 items). Each of 24 items related to cranial nerves and muscle weakness, scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis); higher scores indicated higher abnormality/impairment. Each of 13 items related to reflexes and sensation, scored as 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent); higher scores indicated lesser reflexes and sensation. For NIS possible overall score (combined of both left and right sides of each domain), ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased/more neuropathic deficits.</description>

        <description>The RMDQ is a self-administered, widely used health status measure index of how well participants with low back pain (LBP) are able to function with regard to daily activities. It measures pain and function, using 24 items describing limitations to everyday life that can be caused by LBP. Participants were asked to check/select only those items out of 24 items, which described them at each specified time point. The total number of items checked in questionnaire was equal to RMDQ total score, overall possible score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability), where higher scores indicated greater/more disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) Total Score at Week 64: Observed Data</title>
        <description>The RMDQ is a self-administered, widely used health status measure index of how well participants with low back pain (LBP) are able to function with regard to daily activities. It measures pain and function, using 24 items describing limitations to everyday life that can be caused by LBP. Participants were asked to check/select only those items out of 24 items, which described them at each specified time point. The total number of items checked in questionnaire was equal to RMDQ total score, overall possible score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability), where higher scores indicated greater/more disability.</description>

        <description>Average LBPI was assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants described their average LBPI during the past 24 hours (at each specified/scheduled time point) on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated worse pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent change) (greater than [&gt;] 0%; &gt;= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and equals to [=] 100%) in average LBPI from baseline to weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported.

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified time points. BPI-sf scores for worst pain: participants were asked to rate their pain by circling any 1 number from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) that best describes their pain at its worst in the last 24 hours; higher scores indicated worse pain.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. BPI-sf scores for average pain: participants were asked to rate their pain by circling any 1 number from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) that best describes their pain on average in the last 24 hours; higher scores indicated worse pain.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. Pain interference index was calculated as the mean of the 7 BPI-sf pain interference items: pain interference with general activity; mood; walking ability; normal work (outside home and housework); relations with other people; sleep and enjoyment of life. Each of the 7 items had score range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes), higher scores indicated more interference in daily activities due to pain. Overall score range for pain interference index was 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference), higher score = higher interference.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. BPI-sf scores for pain interference with general activity: participants were asked to circle from any 1 number from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference) that described how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with their general activity; higher scores indicated higher interference.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. BPI-sf scores for pain interference with walking ability: participants were asked to circle from any 1 number from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) that described how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with their walking ability; higher scores indicated higher interference.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. BPI-sf scores for pain interference with sleep: participants were asked to circle from any 1 number from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) that described how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with their sleep; higher scores indicated higher interference.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and pain interference on daily functions during 24 hours prior to evaluation at specified/scheduled time points. BPI-sf scores for pain interference with normal work: participants were asked to circle from any 1 number from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) that described how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with their normal work; higher scores indicated higher interference.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Chronic Low Back Pain Responders Index at Weeks 16, 24, 40 and 56</title>
        <description>Chronic low back pain responder index analysis is a composite endpoint of average low back pain intensity (aLBPI) score, PGA of low back pain, and RMDQ total score. aLBPI: evaluate average pain during the past 24 hours, range 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), higher scores = higher worse pain. PGA of low back pain: evaluated participants' well-being due to low back pain on day of assessment, range 1 (very good) to 5 (very poor), higher scores = worse condition. RMDQ total score: assessed ability to perform daily activities, range 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability), higher scores = more disability. Participants were successful responders if they had: &gt;=30 percent reduction in aLBPI from baseline to particular week; decrease of &gt;=30 percent in PGA of low back pain from baseline to particular week and no worsening (increase) in RMDQ total score from baseline to particular week.</description>

        <description>PGA of low back pain assessed by asking question to participants: &quot;Considering all ways your low back pain affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; They responded on 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, using IRT, where 1= very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities); 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities); 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities); 5= very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worsening of condition. Percentage of participants with positive change of at least 2 points from baseline in PGA of low back pain were reported.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Dimensions Scores at Baseline, Weeks 16 and 56</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Overall Health Utility Score/ Index Value</title>
        <description>EQ-5D health state profile has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses from each of the 5 domains were used to calculate overall health state/a single utility index value. Example: if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined single index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. Japan value sets (with all possible health states) was used in the study, overall health utility score ranged from -0.111 (minimum score) to 1 (maximum score). Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Low Back Pain (WPAI:LBP)- Percent Work Time Missed Due to Chronic Low Back Pain at Weeks 16, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>WPAI:LBP is a participant rated questionnaire that measures the effect of participant's chronic low back pain (CLBP) on general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. Percentage of work time missed by participants due to CLBP was recorded on a score range of 0 (no impact on work time) to 100 (extreme impact on work time), higher scores indicated greater work time missed and lesser productivity.</description>

        <title>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU): Number of Visits of Services Received Directly Related to Low Back Pain</title>
        <description>Low back pain HCRU assessed utilization of healthcare resources usage during last 3 months (last 3 months before Baseline [Day 1] visit, weeks 64 and 80 visit, via IRT). Visits of services directly related to low back pain evaluated were: visits to primary care physician, neurologist, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, pain specialist, orthopedist, physical therapist, chiropractor, alternative medicine or therapy, nutritionist/dietician, radiologist and other practitioner. Participants might have been counted more than once under various rows. Only those rows have been reported which had at least 1 participant evaluable for any reporting arm.</description>

        <title>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU): Number of Participants Who Used Any Aids/Devices for Doing Things</title>
        <description>Low back pain HCRU assessed utilization of healthcare resources during the last 3 months (last 3 months before Baseline [Day 1] visit, weeks 64 and 80 visit, via IRT). Number of participants who used any aids/devices for doing things were evaluated. Aids included walking aid, wheelchair, device or utensil for dress/bathe/eat and any other aids/devices.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 64 and 80</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or placebo matched to tanezumab). Here, 'Number Analyzed' = Participants who were evaluable for usage of any aids/devices for doing things at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM v II) Scores at Weeks 16 and 56</title>
        <description>TSQM v.II: participant rated 11 items questionnaire. Items 1, 2, 7 to 11 were scored as: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= dissatisfied, 4= somewhat satisfied, 5= satisfied, 6= very satisfied, 7= extremely satisfied. Items 4 to 6 were scored as: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= somewhat dissatisfied, 4= slightly dissatisfied, 5= not at all dissatisfied. Item 3 was scored as: 0= No, 1= Yes. Four parameters with respect to study medication were evaluated: Effectiveness = ([Item 1+Item 2] - 2 )/12 *100; Side effects = ([Item 4 + Item 5 + Item 6] - 3)/12 *100, if one item is missing then: ([Sum of two completed items]-2]/8 *100; Convenience = ([Item 7 + Item 8 + Item 9] - 3)/18 *100, if one item is missing then: ([Sum of two completed items]-2)/12 *100; Global satisfaction = ([Item 10+Item 11] - 2 ]/12 *100. Each of the 4 parameters had a scale of 0 (no satisfaction) to 100 (best level of satisfaction), higher score = greater satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Responding to Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) at Weeks 16 and 56 for Willingness to Use Study Drug Again</title>
        <description>The mPRTI was a self-administered questionnaire containing 4 items to assess participant satisfaction, previous treatment, preference and willingness to continue using the study medication. To assess participants willingness to use study drug again, participants responded using IRT on 5 point Likert scale ranged from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I would definitely want to use the same drug again, 2= I might want to use the same drug again, 3= I am not sure, 4= I might not want to use the same drug again, 5= no, I definitely would not want to use the same drug again. Higher scores indicated lesser willingness to use the study drug.</description>
