  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)&#xD;
      before a lumpectomy is performed. By administering the APBI before the lumpectomy, a smaller&#xD;
      volume of breast tissue may be exposed to radiation. The APBI method used in this study is 3D&#xD;
      (three dimensional) conformal external beam irradiation. 3D-conformal external beam&#xD;
      irradiation uses an X-ray beam to deliver the radiation dose. Traditionally, CT imaging is&#xD;
      used to plan treatment. In this study, an MRI will be used. Approximately five to eight weeks&#xD;
      after completion of the APBI, the cancer will be surgically removed.&#xD;

      This study will examine the feasibility, complication rates, cosmetic results and local&#xD;
      control rate of 3D conformal radiation therapy (CRT) confined to the region of the lumpectomy&#xD;
      cavity for patients with Stage I and IIa (less than or equal to 3 cm) carcinoma of the breast&#xD;
      (non-lobular histology) treated with APBI using 3D-CRT before lumpectomy. This study also&#xD;
      will test the feasibility of MRI-based treatment planning for preoperative accelerated&#xD;
      partial breast irradiation and compare dosimetric data from treatment planning with patients&#xD;
      treated on a previous institutional post-op APBI protocol. It will also look at overall&#xD;
      survival rates. Correlative studies include measuring the changes in tumor gene expression&#xD;
      and immune response to radiation therapy and correlate this with pathologic response.&#xD;

    <description>Selected patients will undergo a radiation planning procedure utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Once this is completed, patients will receive five radiation treatments given every other day. After 28 days (four weeks), patients will have another MRI scan to compare tumor response to the radiation therapy. Following the MRI scan, roughly five to eight weeks later, patients will have a lumpectomy and possibly a sentinel lymph node biopsy. After surgery, tests will be performed on the tumor tissue to determine if genes expressed in the sample have changed. Following surgery, patients will receive chemotherapy and/or antihormone therapy at the discretion of the patient and physician.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Prior breast augmentation, including breast implants, is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of contralateral breast cancer will be considered&#xD;
             eligible if they completed all treatment (including anti-endocrine therapy) more than&#xD;
             five years prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a prior treatment of malignancy diagnosed or treated within the&#xD;

          -  Interested patients must meet with a medical oncologist prior to study entry to&#xD;
             determine if Oncotype testing is recommended. If recommended and patient is amenable&#xD;
             to the possibility of receiving chemotherapy, there must be adequate biopsy tissue for&#xD;
             testing. If adequate tissue is not available for the Oncotype testing, patients who&#xD;
             are very interested in participation may undergo additional biopsies. If a patient&#xD;
             plans to refuse chemotherapy regardless of a high Oncotype results and elects to forgo&#xD;
             the test, they will still be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;

             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multifocal breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients having received or having planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent&#xD;
             chemotherapy. A recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy will not preclude&#xD;
             eligibility. However, if a patient has an Oncotype score that would lead to a&#xD;
             recommendation for systemic chemotherapy, and chemotherapy is planned to be given in&#xD;
             the neoadjuvant setting, the patient would then be ineligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This could&#xD;
             include patients with a severe allergy to gadolinium contrast or patients with renal&#xD;
             function insufficient to receive contrast (GFR less than 30). Patients who have a&#xD;
             minor allergy (for example, skin rash or hives) to gadolinium contrast may still be&#xD;
             considered for enrollment. These patients would have to receive prophylactic&#xD;
             prednisone and diphenhydramine per Medical College of Wisconsin Department of&#xD;
             Radiology protocol. Such cases should be reviewed with the principal investigator and&#xD;
             radiology co-chair prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of connective tissue disorder, including lupus, dermatomyositis and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical, psychiatric or other condition that would prevent the patient from receiving&#xD;
             the protocol therapy or providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who under the best estimates of the treating radiation oncologist, have a&#xD;
             life expectancy of 10 years or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within&#xD;
                  the last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time&#xD;
                  of registration;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects;&#xD;
