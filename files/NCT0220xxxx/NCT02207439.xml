    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) given with the protease&#xD;
      inhibitor,Nelfinavir (NFV), in patients with locally advanced head and neck. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive a &quot;lead-in&quot; period of Nelfinavir (1250 mg po bid) for 7-14 days prior&#xD;
      to initiation of CTRT. Nelfinavir will then be given concurrently with platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (planned total dose of 70 Gy over 7 weeks).&#xD;

             oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx stages III, IVa, or IVb, p16-negative on&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determined by the treating physician to be a candidate for organ preserving,&#xD;
             concurrent standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the head and neck with&#xD;
             definitive intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign an informed consent document that indicates they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of the treatment in this protocol as well as the potential&#xD;
             risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of EF5 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, during study, until 1 month&#xD;
             after completion of the final FMISO PET/CT scan. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Serum pregnancy testing will be required for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
