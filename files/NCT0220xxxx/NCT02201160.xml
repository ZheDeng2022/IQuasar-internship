  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis (NASH) is defined as the amount greater than 5% of the total&#xD;
      liver volume fat. Commonly known as NASH, it includes 4 stages histological ranging from the&#xD;
      mere presence of fat to the existence of fibrosis and degeneration of hepatocytes, and&#xD;
      finally a progression to cirrhosis, sometimes accompanied by complications of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. It is a common condition associated with a combination of disorders, namely&#xD;
      obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The link with the metabolic syndrome (MetS)&#xD;
      was mainly studied in the adult population and very little in the paediatric population,&#xD;
      while 15 and 25% of obese children are affectés. The severity of histological disease appears&#xD;
      to be associated with the degree of obesity in children and particularly in the MetS. in&#xD;
      addition, epidemiological data indicate that the incidence of this disease is increasing in&#xD;
      children and positioning as the first NASH liver disease in North America. the revelation of&#xD;
      the factors associated with the occurrence of NASH is a first necessary step to understanding&#xD;
      this disorder worrying for the future of children and adolescents. In addition, clarification&#xD;
      of the mechanisms responsible for its development is essential if the investigators want to&#xD;
      consider targeted and effective treatments to slow the rat race of NASH, which stands out as&#xD;
      the supreme chronic liver accompanying the obesity and MetS. Finally, in view of growth and&#xD;
      puberty of children, it would be extremely beneficial to find nutritional avenues that would&#xD;
      avoid the side effects of chemical agents.&#xD;

      The aims of the investigators studies are to determine the plasma FA composition and to&#xD;
      assess changes in the latter in response to n-3 supplementation in French-Canadian youth&#xD;
      since (i) none of the available pharmacological agents could be recommended for treatment of&#xD;
      children with NAFLD; (ii) n-3 PUFA are quite safe diet supplements that showed efficacy in&#xD;
      the prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome;&#xD;
      (iii) loss of n-3 PUFA dietary intake was found in pediatric NAFLD and (iii) no attention has&#xD;
      been given to French-Canadian population, which is primarily and historically located in the&#xD;
      province of Quebec, has the highest prevalence worldwide of lipoprotein lipase deficiency,&#xD;
      includes a large pool of individuals at risk for atherosclerosis and other lipid-related&#xD;
      diseases, and exhibits a founder effect among the 8,000 ancestors of present-day&#xD;
      French-Canadians, who have had relatively little cross-breeding with individuals from other&#xD;
      national origin groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects The present randomized clinical trial was performed on 30 NAFLD children followed as&#xD;
      outpatients at the Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Nutrition clinic of MCHU Ste-Justine and&#xD;
      the Gastroenterology division of the Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children have between 8 years and 18 years of age, with obesity and a diagnostic of NAFLD&#xD;
      based on the results of a clinical evaluation, liver echography, and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging-proton density fat fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria The children are eligible for the study if they are boys&#xD;
      (according to the literature review on NAFLD prevalence), with a body weight ≥ 95th&#xD;
      percentile (based on the CDC Chart), aged &lt;18 years, have a diffusely hyperechogenic liver at&#xD;
      ultrasonography (consistent with NAFLD diagnostic), and have normal or high transaminases (&gt;&#xD;
      2N). Moreover, the exclusion criteria is based on subjects having pin or cochlear implants&#xD;
      may affect the magnetic resonance imaging examination; subjects who consumed natural medicine&#xD;
      products have an increased risk of haemorrhage, and those in whom a surgical procedure was&#xD;
      planned, and the child who founded to consume fish, flaxseed oil and foods enriched with n-3&#xD;
      PUFA (eggs, or milk containing n-3 PUFA supplements), probiotics, vitamin E or use of drugs&#xD;
      known to induce fatty liver during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The present study is a 6-month, double-blind, one-way, crossover randomized&#xD;
      study. The treatment consisting of n-3 PUFA supplement (NutriSanté Inc./Ponroy, Canada),&#xD;
      administered in two phases, each of 3-month duration. In the first phase, an NAFLD group will&#xD;
      receive an active n-3 PUFA supplement and another will receive equivalent quantities of&#xD;
      sunflower oil as a placebo. During the second phase (after the first 3 months), all NAFLD&#xD;
      subjects will receive an active n-3 PUFA. The study is approved by the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of MUCH Ste-Justine (Montreal, Quebec. Informed consent was obtained from&#xD;
      all subjects before starting experimental procedures, and the study followed the Helsinki&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing The dose supplementation considered for this study is 2.0 g of fish oil per day,&#xD;
      providing a total of 1.2 g of n-3 PUFA. This dose is chosen according to official&#xD;
      recommendations, based on our previous studies and pediatric clinical trials. Compliance to&#xD;
      the study treatment will be evaluated by pill count at every visit, review of medication&#xD;
      records, and direct interview of patients by the physician.&#xD;
