  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this extension study was to obtain long-term safety data for BIRB&#xD;
      796 BS in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease after 26 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives were the evaluation of efficacy of BIRB 796 BS to induce clinical&#xD;
      remission and response over 26 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
