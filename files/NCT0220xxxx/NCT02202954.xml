  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the situation of motor limitations that people often experience after stroke, current&#xD;
      health systems cannot provide for the daily amount and duration of high intensity muscle&#xD;
      stretch and motor training that would be required over protracted periods to involve muscle&#xD;
      and brain plasticity. For patients with sufficient cognitive abilities, Guided&#xD;
      Self-rehabilitation Contracts allow implementing stretch and training at high intensity and&#xD;
      may result in meaningful functional improvement in chronic stages, as long as discipline&#xD;
      persists over at least a year span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single blind control protocol will evaluate Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts as&#xD;
      against conventional therapy in the community, for a one year duration in persons with&#xD;
      chronic hemiparesis after stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single blind controlled multicentre protocol will compare the evolution after a one-year&#xD;
      treatment, either using a Guided Self-rehabilitation Contract or conventional therapy in the&#xD;
      community. Patients with chronic stroke-induced hemiparesis (over a year post stroke) will be&#xD;
      selected to be randomized between the two groups, Conventional or in Guided&#xD;
      Self-rehabilitation Contracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Guided Self-rehabilitation Contracts, the therapist acts as a coach, in the sports' sense,&#xD;
      providing double guidance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical, selecting and teaching the required exercises to the patient using infrequent&#xD;
           thorough visits, for example every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological, binding with the patient on the contract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient agrees to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform the prescribed daily stretch postures and rapid alternating movements over the&#xD;
           long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document this work in a written diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate such contracts, a manual for guided self-rehabilitation in spastic paresis has&#xD;
      been developed and will be provided to patients randomized to that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      124 patients will be enrolled from 6 centers in France: Creteil, Paris Fernand-Widal,&#xD;
      Toulouse, Reims, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux. The duration of patient participation will be 2&#xD;
      years: 6 months follow-up, 1 year intervention and another 6-month follow-up after the study&#xD;
      intervention. Only functional assessments will be used, using in particular ambulation speed&#xD;
      for the lower limb and the Modified FRENCHAY Scale for the upper limb.&#xD;
