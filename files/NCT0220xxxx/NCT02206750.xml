      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to understand how social factors such as psychosocial stress&#xD;
      may modify how people respond to air pollution. Ultimately this will help us understand&#xD;
      health disparities from poor air quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 healthy adults,18-33 years old with different perception of stress will participate&#xD;
      and complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be exposed to clean air and to ozone ( 300ppb) for 2 hours in a controlled&#xD;
      environment chamber. Cardiac, vascular, pulmonary and cognitive function will be evaluated&#xD;
      pre, immediately post and 18 hr post exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be Heart Rate Variability . Secondary endpoints will include&#xD;
      pulmonary function, analysis of blood clotting/coagulation factors, biomarkers of stress,&#xD;
      cognitive function, radial artery pulse wave measurements and analysis of soluble factors&#xD;
      present in plasma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decades, air quality in the U.S. has improved significantly. Even so, millions&#xD;
      of people in the U.S. still live in counties that do not meet air quality standards for one&#xD;
      or more pollutants. Ozone is a major component of photochemical smog and is one of the most&#xD;
      thoroughly studied gaseous pollutants. Controlled human exposure studies have been critical&#xD;
      in demonstrating that it can cause airway inflammation 1-3, including increases in neutrophil&#xD;
      infiltration into the lung and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators 4,5[, and&#xD;
      ultimately decrements in lung function [reviewed in 6]. More recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      ozone can also increase vascular inflammation, as well as alter autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      control of heart rate and cardiac repolarization 7. Numerous epidemiological studies have&#xD;
      also demonstrated an association between acute and chronic exposure to ambient levels of&#xD;
      ozone and various health effects most notably asthma 6. These studies have also highlighted a&#xD;
      need to incorporate social and nonchemical factors into risk assessments 8. Similarly, social&#xD;
      factors such as psychological stress are now regarded as important contributors to asthma&#xD;
      outcomes 9,10. This protocol is aimed at investigating how stress impacts health responses to&#xD;
      air pollutants. Since psychosocial stress-related susceptibility has been proposed to explain&#xD;
      social disparities, this will help us understand which populations and individuals are at&#xD;
      increased risk from air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to determine whether nonchemical stressors exacerbate ozone&#xD;
      effects. In particular we will focus on elevated psychosocial stress as it has been shown to&#xD;
      contribute to several adverse health outcomes, most notably, to cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
      physiological mechanism by which psychosocial stress leads to health effects is due, at least&#xD;
      in part, to elevated circulating glucocorticoids, or stress hormones, which are regulated by&#xD;
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA). In the last 30 years the concept of allostasis has&#xD;
      evolved. Allostasis is the process whereby an organism adapts to the demands of the&#xD;
      environment. An allostatic load model applies this concept to chronic stress11. In this model&#xD;
      the perception of threat over long time intervals (perceived stress) can cause&#xD;
      over-activation of the HPA-axis resulting in changes in physiological systems as chemical&#xD;
      imbalances in autonomic nervous system, central nervous system, neuroendocrine, and immune&#xD;
      system activity. Factors such as genetics, behavior, life events and diet can impact this&#xD;
      model. To our knowledge no clinical study has investigated the link between air pollution&#xD;
      effects on cardiovascular disease and psychosocial stress. However, several studies have now&#xD;
      shown an association between stress and respiratory outcomes to air pollution. Claugherty and&#xD;
      colleagues (2007) found an association between traffic-related air pollution and asthma&#xD;
      solely among children exposed to violence 12. Shankardass and colleagues demonstrated that&#xD;
      children from stressful households are more susceptible to the effects of traffic-related&#xD;
      pollution on the development of asthma 13. In that study, stress was evaluated using the&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) developed by Dr. Sheldon Cohen of Carnegie Mellon University.&#xD;
      This is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress&#xD;
      and has been validated in multiple studies. We will use this scale to evaluate the degree to&#xD;
      which subjects appraise situations in their life as stressful. Heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      is considered to be a reliable biomarker of stress. Chronic stress has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with decreases in HRV 14. Since acute ozone exposure can also cause changes in&#xD;
      HRV, we have chosen HRV as our primary endpoint. We hypothesize that the imbalance between&#xD;
      the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system caused by chronic stress will result&#xD;
      in altered responses to ozone exposure that will be reflected by HRV.&#xD;
