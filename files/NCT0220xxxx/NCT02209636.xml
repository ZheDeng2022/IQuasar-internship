      The proposed research is a randomized-controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      reducing serum phosphorus using a phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate, for improving the&#xD;
      function of arteries in adults with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). [COMIRB&#xD;
      13-0328] Additionally, it will determine phosphorus balance among adults with CKD and whether&#xD;
      there is a difference in phosphorus balance after three months of treatment with lanthanum&#xD;
      carbonate. [COMIRB 15-0384]&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health concern both in the general and Veteran&#xD;
      populations. Indeed, the prevalence of CKD in a large Veteran population is 20%.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly increased in CKD and is an important cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. As much as 80% of all CVD is associated with vascular dysfunction,&#xD;
      particularly impaired endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), measured by brachial artery&#xD;
      flow-mediate dilation (FMD), and stiffening of the large elastic arteries, measured by aortic&#xD;
      pulse-wave velocity (aPWV). Not surprisingly, patients with CKD demonstrate these&#xD;
      dysfunctional vascular phenotypes. Even in early stages of CKD, there is an increase in&#xD;
      oxidative stress resulting in structural and functional vascular changes, which, in turn,&#xD;
      contributes to vascular dysfunction (impaired EDD and large elastic artery stiffening). In&#xD;
      CKD, phosphorus remains within the normal range (2.5-4.5 mg/dL) until late in the disease.&#xD;
      However, elevated serum phosphorus, even within the normal range, is associated with impaired&#xD;
      EDD and with indirect measures of arterial stiffness. Whether lowering serum phosphorus in&#xD;
      patients with CKD will improve EDD and arterial stiffness is unknown. This study is a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial of lanthanum carbonate, a non-calcium based phosphate binder, to&#xD;
      treat vascular dysfunction. The efficacy of phosphate binding with lanthanum carbonate for&#xD;
      treating vascular endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffness in patients with&#xD;
      stage IIIb and IV CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-45 mL/min/1.73m2) with&#xD;
      baseline serum phosphorus of 2.8-5.5 mg/dL will be assessed. The study will also determine if&#xD;
      lowering serum phosphorus with lanthanum carbonate also reduces circulating and endothelial&#xD;
      cell markers of oxidative stress. This study could shift clinical practice guidelines by&#xD;
      establishing a novel therapy for reducing CVD risk in CKD patients not requiring chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis. [COMIRB 13-0328]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about phosphorus balance in CKD. It is assumed that CKD patients remain in&#xD;
      neutral phosphorus balance despite decreases in kidney function. Serum phosphorus remains in&#xD;
      the normal range until late in CKD thus making it difficult to recognize perturbations in&#xD;
      phosphorus balance. Indeed, among CKD patients treated with the non-calcium containing&#xD;
      phosphate binder, sevelamer, serum phosphorus did not change after six weeks of treatment but&#xD;
      urinary phosphate excretion, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor-23 changed&#xD;
      significantly, suggesting a shift in phosphorus homeostasis. However, two other studies found&#xD;
      that patients with CKD III-IV treated with calcium-containing phosphate binders remained in&#xD;
      neutral phosphorus balance. There are no studies evaluating the effects of non-calcium based&#xD;
      phosphate binders on phosphorus balance among patients with CKD nor other studies examining&#xD;
      the effect of changing phosphorus balance on vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extension of the above-described 12-week prospective randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double-blind trial (COMIRB 13-0328) will be conducted in a subset of subjects. A total of 24&#xD;
      subjects from COMIRB 13-0328 will be recruited to participate in the Phosphorus Balance&#xD;
      sub-investigation (12 subjects treated with lanthanum carbonate and 12 subjects treated with&#xD;
      placebo). [15-0384] They will consume a diet with a fixed phosphorus content (1000 +/- 50 mg)&#xD;
      for seven days. They will then be admitted to the inpatient Center for Translational Clinical&#xD;
      Research at the University of Colorado Denver for 48 hours to accurately collect urine and&#xD;
      stool samples. The goal of the Phosphorus Balance sub-investigation (COMIRB 15-0384) is to&#xD;
      determine whether lowering serum phosphorus, accomplished during the parent phosphorus&#xD;
      lowering randomized-controlled trial (COMIRB 13-0328), affects phosphorus balance compared to&#xD;
      those subjects treated with placebo. A key secondary goal is to determine if differences in&#xD;
      phosphorus balance affect vascular function as measured by FMD. [15-0384]&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure adequate enrollment in the Phosphorus Balance Study (COMIRB 15-0384), an amendment&#xD;
      was approved to recruit patients with stage IIIb and IV CKD with normal or modestly elevated&#xD;
      serum phosphorus (2.8-5.5 mg/dL) who are not currently participating in the parent Phosphorus&#xD;
      Lowering RCT (COMIRB 13-0328). Similar to the Phosphorus Lowering RCT, these patients will&#xD;
      follow a low phosphorus diet and will be randomized to lanthanum carbonate or placebo for 12&#xD;
      weeks (run-in period) prior to beginning the current Phosphorus Balance protocol.&#xD;
