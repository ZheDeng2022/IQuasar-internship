  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU and cisplatin, higher tumor TS levels were&#xD;
      associated with a less favorable response (29% vs. 68%; p=0.024). Similarly, in a study in&#xD;
      which patients were treated with high dose 5-FU, patients with high TS expression had a&#xD;
      response rate of only 12.5%. Conversely a response rate of 92.9% was observed in patients&#xD;
      with low tumor TS expression. A longer but not statistically significant survival advantage&#xD;
      was observed in patients with the TSER*2 allele compared with the TSER*3/*3 patients.&#xD;
      Additionally, a review by Patel et al. identified approximately 20 gastric cancer studies&#xD;
      that have found a positive association between TSER genotype and clinical response (in either&#xD;
      direction). Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to prospectively genotype&#xD;
      patients, select patients with &quot;good risk&quot; TSER genotypes (TSER*2*/*2 or *2/*3) and treat&#xD;
      them with a standard 5-FU containing regimen (FOLFOX) in order to improve clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      while randomize patients with the &quot;poor risk&quot; TSER genotype (*3/*3) to either the standard&#xD;
      5-FU containing regimen or another non-5-FU-based regimen (docetaxel/cisplatin).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
             of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20&#xD;
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 9.2 for&#xD;
             the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior therapy for metastatic disease. Prior neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy is&#xD;
             permitted if the disease free interval has been longer than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age between 18 and 70 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of these regimens in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 x ULN if not liver metastases &lt; 5 x ULN if known liver&#xD;
                  metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &lt;1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Not pregnant. Not breast feeding. If the patient or partner is of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, the couple will use adequate birth control in accordance with local IRB&#xD;
             policies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             For woman of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patient must have negative blood pregnancy test. If sexually active, woman must either&#xD;
             be post-menopausal (over age 50 and have not had a menstrual period for one year or&#xD;
             more, or blood FSH level in the post-menopausal range) OR agree to use appropriate&#xD;
             contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and for 21 days after stopping&#xD;
             study treatment. The only birth control methods for women that are acceptable for this&#xD;
             study are: (1) surgical sterilization (previous removal of the uterus or both ovaries&#xD;
             or a tubal ligation) OR (2) an intrauterine device (IUD), (3) double barrier methods,&#xD;
             (4) oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For men:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization, or (2) a&#xD;
             condom used with a spermicide. If the female partner becomes pregnant while patient is&#xD;
             on treatment or within 21 days after stopping treatment, the study physician must be&#xD;
             informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients may not be receiving any other chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known active brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases&#xD;
             are permitted if stable off steroids for at least 30 days. A screening head CT/MRI is&#xD;
             not required in asymptomatic patients for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic reactions to 5-FU, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, or cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with the chemotherapies.&#xD;
