        -  Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pediatric patients with PWS confirmed by methylation PCR genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Prepubertal pediatric patients (Tanner's Pubertal stage I) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pediatric patients who have never been treated with hGH prior to screening, or&#xD;
                  who had been treated with hGH for less than 6 months if they had a treatment&#xD;
                  history, and whose last administration was made 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Pediatric patients with normal thyroid function at screening (Those with normal&#xD;
                  function through a hormonal therapy were allowable.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pediatric patients whose parents or LARs signed the informed consent form in&#xD;
                  writing after receiving the explanation about the purpose, method, effects, etc.&#xD;
                  of the clinical study, and who also signed the informed consent form in writing&#xD;
                  if they are capable of reading and understanding writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pediatric patients who are accompanied by other causes for growth retardation as&#xD;
                  follows except for PWS at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
                  : Chronic renal failure (including the case in which renal transplantation has&#xD;
                  been undergone), Silver-Russell syndrome, Turner's syndrome, Seckel syndrome,&#xD;
                  Down's syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, congenital infections,&#xD;
                  psychiatric disorders, chronic debilitating diseases, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Pediatric patients with malignancy or a history of malignancy at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pediatric patients with severe respiratory disturbance, or sleep apnoea or a&#xD;
                  history of respiratory infections with an unknown cause at screening. However,&#xD;
                  those whose condition had been confirmed to be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
                  clinical study on investigator's judgment were allowed to participae in the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Pediatric patients with impaired fasting glucose, diabetes, and diabetic&#xD;
                  retinopathy at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pediatric patients whose epiphyses are closed with a growth rate of ≤1 cm/year at&#xD;
                  screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Pediatric patients who are being administered any drug that may have an effect on&#xD;
                  the secretion and actions of hGH (estrogen, androgen, anabolic steroids,&#xD;
                  corticosteroids, GnRH analogs, thyroxine, aromatase inhibitors, etc.) or&#xD;
                  anticonvulsants and cyclosporin at screening, and have been administered any of&#xD;
                  them for a long period of time within 6 months prior to screening (However, those&#xD;
                  who have been administered a thyroxine preparation for ≥4 weeks on a stable dose&#xD;
                  [allowable in case the investigator determines the dose is stable even though it&#xD;
                  is changeable based upon the weight of the pediatric patient] were allowed to&#xD;
                  participate in the clinical study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Pediatric patients who are being administered any drug (e.g. methylphenidate) for&#xD;
                  treatment of hyperactivity disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
                  disorder (ADHD) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Pediatric patients who are hypersensitive to somatropin or any excipient of the&#xD;
                  investigational product (cresol or glycerol) or who have a relevant history of&#xD;
                  hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Pediatric patients who have participated in any other clinical studies after&#xD;

&#xD;
              10. Pediatric patients in whom this clinical study is considered to be difficult to&#xD;
                  be conducted for any other reasons on investigator's judgment&#xD;
