  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease and is the most common form of arthritis.&#xD;
      Pain reduction and functional recovery are the key elements of the clinical management of OA.&#xD;
      Current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments. However, these are not always effective, with nearly 20% of&#xD;
      patients not responding to any standard therapy, including joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of pain relief are not well understood and are complicated by the remarkably&#xD;
      large placebo effect, and inter-individual variation. There is no objective criteria for&#xD;
      predicting whether a patient will respond to a given treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duloxetine, an antidepressant drug, has proven effectiveness in various chronic pain&#xD;
      syndromes including knee OA. The effect is however limited and only clinically relevant in&#xD;
      around half of the trial patients. Importantly, it is currently unclear how and in whom&#xD;
      duloxetine alleviates chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced MRI techniques use strong magnetic fields and radio frequency signals to generate&#xD;
      metabolic, anatomical and functional brain images (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remifentanil is a potent analgesic agent whose analgesic effect has been well characterised&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers, including fMRI studies showing modulation of activation of regions in&#xD;
      the brain related to pain processing. Nevertheless, the neural correlates of remifentanil&#xD;
      effects have not yet been investigated in chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to use a combination of multimodal MRI, genetic and psychometric&#xD;
      assessments to identify the mechanisms of pain relief in knee OA patients, following&#xD;
      treatments with duloxetine and remifentanil, in a placebo controlled condition. With this we&#xD;
      also aim to identify genetic, anatomical and brain activity predictors of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic response to duloxetine treatment can be predicted using a range of baseline&#xD;
           brain imaging markers and QST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic response to duloxetine is mediated by modulation of neural networks&#xD;
           underpinning emotional control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duloxetine-induced changes in brain activation differ between responders and&#xD;
           non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to last for two years. It is funded by Arthritis Research United&#xD;
      Kingdom and forms part of a wider scientific investigation, using translational&#xD;
      methodologies, to enhance the understanding of arthritis pain and to improve its treatment.&#xD;
