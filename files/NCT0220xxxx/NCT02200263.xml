      The LUVIA study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on macular pigment and visual function in ocular or&#xD;
      oculocutaneous albinism. Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation will be compared to a placebo&#xD;
      (no treatment) gel pill over the period of 12 months, with study visits approximately every 3&#xD;
      months for the first year and a final visit 18 months after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular and oculocutaneous albinism represent a spectrum of disorders with absent or&#xD;
      significantly diminished amount of melanin either across different body tissues - skin, hair,&#xD;
      eye (Oculocutaneous Albinism 1 and 2), or exclusively in eye tissues only (Ocular Albinism 1)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functionality and the clinical findings are diverse (the phenotype), and no direct&#xD;
      correlation has been established to the underlying mutations (genotype).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common ocular phenotype includes iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia, nystagmus,&#xD;
      reduced visual acuity, refractive error, photosensitivity and abnormal development of the&#xD;
      visual pathways with characteristic abnormal routing of ganglion cell axons in the chiasma,&#xD;
      resulting in abnormal visually evoked potentials. Current treatment options are limited to&#xD;
      optical methods and low vision aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of melanin pigment formation in the RPE cells and its role in the visual&#xD;
      pathways and structures development is not completely understood, but a correlation was found&#xD;
      between the amount of fundus pigmentation and visual function in albino patients. The absent&#xD;
      pigmentation within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may thus contribute to visual&#xD;
      performance deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The macular pigment (MP) consists of two main carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which are&#xD;
      concentrated in the macular region of the retina. MP is hypothesized to function via a&#xD;
      protective mechanism by absorbing blue light incident on the retina thereby reducing&#xD;
      oxidative damage to the underlying photoreceptors. It is also thought to improve visual&#xD;
      function via reduction of chromatic aberration and glare. It is currently unclear as to how&#xD;
      the variability in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) affects congenital retinal&#xD;
      conditions. The MP would, however, be a hypothetical and good candidate to improve visual&#xD;
      performance - simply by increasing pigmentation, reducing light scatter and thus glare&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this pigment is not produced in the retina, but is absorbed via diet, it can be&#xD;
      manipulated by alteration in diet and supplementation thereby providing potential therapy for&#xD;
      retinal diseases. It is however necessary first to see if MPOD levels are measurable in this&#xD;
      disorder before dietary advice can be provided after completion of the LUVIA study. Further&#xD;
      to this, evaluation of both the structural and functional properties of the retina will&#xD;
      provide greater insight into the possible function of MP in this retinal disease including&#xD;
      whether supplementation would be of benefit.&#xD;
