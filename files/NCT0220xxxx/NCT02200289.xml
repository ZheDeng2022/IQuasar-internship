    <textblock>
      Household air pollution from cook stoves using solid fuels dominates total population air&#xD;
      pollution exposures. Females and young children are disproportionately affected as they&#xD;
      either perform or are present for the majority of cooking activities. Worldwide, household&#xD;
      air pollution is responsible for 1.6 million premature deaths annually, largely secondary to&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections, and 2.7% of worldwide disability-adjusted life years. Children&#xD;
      that survive childhood are not free from disease; the WHO estimates that 35% of COPD cases&#xD;
      worldwide are secondary to household air pollution. Reducing female and infant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality related to household air pollution secondary to biomass smoke exposure is a&#xD;
      top-priority public health goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that in utero biomass smoke exposure results in a fetal oxidant imbalance,&#xD;
      which negatively impacts lung development. We will leverage the success of the Ghana&#xD;
      Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study, a randomized cook stove intervention trial of&#xD;
      1,415 mother-infant pairs, to examine the impact of maternal household air pollution exposure&#xD;
      on cord blood oxidant imbalance and infant pulmonary function. We aim to enroll at least 150&#xD;
      infants, analyze cord blood samples for markers of oxidant imbalance and perform infant&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing. Cord blood will also be prepared for future immune, hormonal and&#xD;
      epigenetic testing. This study will allow us to consider interventions, such as maternal&#xD;
      antioxidant dietary supplementation during pregnancy, to compliment existing cook stove&#xD;
      interventions and reduce household air pollution-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be nested within the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study&#xD;
      (GRAPHS) to investigate oxidant imbalance and pulmonary function in infants exposed to in&#xD;
      utero household air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRAPHS is a birth cohort study examining the impact of reduced maternal household air&#xD;
      pollution exposure on birth outcomes and incident infant pneumonia. Mother-infant pairs are&#xD;
      recruited from the Kintampo Health Research Centre (KHRC) catchment area in rural Ghana,&#xD;
      which comprises a population of 146,000 people. 1,415 nonsmoking women who primarily deliver&#xD;
      at one of four KHRC birth facilities and are pregnant with a singleton fetus of gestational&#xD;
      age less than 24 weeks are eligible for participation. After enrollment, women are randomized&#xD;
      to a no-emission liquid petroleum gas (LPG) stove, a low-emission BioLite cook stove or&#xD;
      control (high-emission) arms and undergo four 72-hour carbon monoxide (CO) and/or particulate&#xD;
      matter (PM) prenatal exposure monitoring sessions. Birth weights and outcomes are recorded&#xD;
      and a placenta sample is stored in formalin for future analyses. The infants are followed&#xD;
      with CO and PM exposure monitoring sessions at 1, 3 and 9 months of age and weekly&#xD;
      surveillance for incident respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed study, we will recruit and consent GRAPHS mother-infant pairs. Venous cord&#xD;
      blood and placenta samples will be collected following placenta delivery. Cord blood will be&#xD;
      placed on IsoRack cool packs designed to maintain samples at 0°C for up to 6 hours. Cord&#xD;
      blood samples will be processed for biomarkers of oxidant imbalance and for future study,&#xD;
      including but not limited to immune function, hormonal balance and epigenetic analyses. After&#xD;
      initial processing, samples will be frozen at -80°C until oxidant analyses are performed&#xD;
      using commercially available reagent kits and protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the infant is one month old or younger, trained study personnel will perform noninvasive&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing (PFT) using the Medispirit Whistler Lung Function Measurement&#xD;
      Instrument (LFMI) in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines. The Medispirit Whistler LFMI is a&#xD;
      lightweight and portable device that allows non-invasive PFTs to be performed in the infant's&#xD;
      home. The Whistler LFMI flow measurement is ultrasonic and therefore does not need to be&#xD;
      calibrated. The infant will be held with his/her head in a stable position until s/he is&#xD;
      breathing quietly or asleep. A sterile, single-use, transparent facemask that does not&#xD;
      interfere with normal breathing will be placed over the infant's mouth and nose. Tidal flow&#xD;
      volume loops will be recorded and single occlusion test will be used to determine the ratio&#xD;
      of time to reach peak expiratory flow to total expiratory time, compliance and resistance.&#xD;
