  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open label, expanded treatment protocol of panobinostat,&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      Panobinostat will be administered at a starting dose of 20mg orally three times a week (every&#xD;
      other day) for two weeks on and one week off, with dose adjustments permitted based on&#xD;
      observed toxicity. Bortezomib will be administered either intravenously or sub-cutaneously,&#xD;
      twice a week on days 1 and 4, two weeks on 1 week off. After 8 cycles of treatment, patients&#xD;
      who have achieved stable disease or better by modified EBMT 1998 criteria may continue&#xD;
      combination therapy with bortezomib dosing changed to days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle for up&#xD;
      to 48 weeks of therapy. At the end of the treatment period, (48 weeks) patients with stable&#xD;
      disease or better may continue on therapy at the discretion of their investigator until&#xD;
      September 2015 or until drug is commercially available, whichever comes first. Patients who&#xD;
      have not achieved at least stable disease by 8 cycles must discontinue from study treatment.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will be administered on the day of and the day immediately following bortezomib&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will not receive any study treatment during the third week of each cycle.&#xD;
      Cycles will be defined as 21 days of treatment. Investigators may not add any other&#xD;
      anti-myeloma agents (with the exception of bisphosphonates) while patients remain on study&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will remain on study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      end of the study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This study is intended for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma,&#xD;
             who have received at least one prior line of therapy. Patients must require&#xD;
             retreatment as per IMWG definitions (Kyle et al 2003). Approximately 50-100 patients&#xD;
             are expected to be enrolled into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a previous diagnosis of multiple myeloma, based on IMWG 2003 definitions&#xD;
             all three of the following criteria had been met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Monoclonal immunoglobulin (M component) on electrophoresis, and on immunofixation on&#xD;
             serum or on total 24 hour urine (or demonstration of M protein in cytoplasm of plasma&#xD;
             cell for non secretory myeloma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow (clonal) plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy proven plasmacytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Related organ or tissue impairment (CRAB symptoms: anemia, hypercalcemia, lytic bone&#xD;
             lesions, renal insufficiency, hyperviscosity, amyloidosis or recurrent infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received allogeneic stem cell transplant and do not have active&#xD;
             graft vs host disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with multiple myeloma (per IMWG 2003 definition) that is relapsed and/or&#xD;
             refractory to at least one prior line of therapy and requires retreatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed-and-refractory to a therapy, provided that the patient meets any of the&#xD;
             following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed, defined by disease that recurred in a patient that responded under a prior&#xD;
             therapy, by reaching a MR or better, and had not progressed under this therapy nor up&#xD;
             to 60 days of last dose of this therapy. Patients who previously responded to&#xD;
             treatment with BTZ are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has relapsed to at least one prior line and patient was refractory to at least&#xD;
             one prior line by either not reaching a MR, or progressed while under this therapy, or&#xD;
             within 60 days of its last dose. Patients previously refractory to BTZ are also&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with primary refractory disease are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

             transplant are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received allogeneic stem cell transplant and do not have active&#xD;
             graft vs host disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has shown intolerance to bortezomib, dexamethasone or panobinostat or has any&#xD;
