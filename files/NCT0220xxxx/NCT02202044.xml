  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the bladder cancer recurrence free rate,&#xD;
      according to a phase II pilot study, of intravesical instillation of sequential BCG and&#xD;
      EMDA/MMC after TUR. The study is designed as a one-sample investigation: the outcome measure&#xD;
      is disease recurrence rate. Follow up will continue up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sample size determination, disease recurrence rate will be compared with literature data&#xD;
      of recurrence rate obtained in standard BCG alone administration (Lamm's protocol).&#xD;

      TURBT (TransUrethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolment, all patients must sign a consent form and will have a Complete Blood&#xD;
      Count (CBC), Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) and a Urinalysis (UA) performed. The patients White&#xD;
      Blood Count (WBC) must be greater than 4.0 10^9/L and platelet count greater than 150 10^9/L&#xD;
      to receive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8: BCG instillation: 50 mg wet weight (10•2±9•0x108 colony-forming&#xD;
      units) BCG Connaught substrain. Lyophilised (ie, freeze-dried) BCG are suspended in 50 ml&#xD;
      bacteriostatic-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) solution. After bladder draining, the&#xD;
      suspension is infused intravesically through a 14 Fr Foley catheter and retained in the&#xD;
      bladder for 60-90 min; bladder emptying is followed by catheter removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 3, 6 and 9: A Foley catheter is inserted and the bladder is carefully drained. 40 mg MMC&#xD;
      dissolved in 100 ml NaCl 0.9% solution are instilled intravesically through the electrode&#xD;
      catheter by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min, while 23 mA for 30 min pulsed&#xD;
      electric current is given externally. Two dispersive cathode electrodes are placed on lower&#xD;
      abdominal skin after degreasing with alcohol. The bladder is then emptied and the catheter&#xD;
      removed. Patients are assigned one course of treatment per week for 6 weeks with sequential&#xD;
      BCG and EMDA/MMC. Two BCG instillations and one EMDA/MMC instillation constitute one cycle&#xD;
      for a total of two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CBC and basic metabolic panel (BMP) will be performed weekly and at the beginning of each&#xD;
      cycle. Prior to dosing with mitomycin C at week 3, a CBC will be performed and also at weeks&#xD;
      4 and 5 if the CBC has changed. A UA will be performed prior to each intravesicular&#xD;
      instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment of eMMC will be given at month 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 (after last dose of&#xD;
      BCG of the initial treatment). Maintenance of BCG will be given around month 5, 8, and 11.&#xD;
      CBC, BMP, UA, and a history/physical (H&amp;P) will be performed before each EMDA/MMC procedure.&#xD;
      UA and a H&amp;P will be performed before each BCG.&#xD;
