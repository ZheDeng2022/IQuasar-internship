  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the group of patients who will carry out the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program associated with respiratory therapy will have higher benefits in&#xD;
      physical function, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life compared to the group that&#xD;
      will only perform chest physiotherapy. Additionally, there will be a negative correlation&#xD;
      between inflammatory mediators and measures of physical ability as well as the magnitude of&#xD;
      improvement is lower after treatment in patients with higher baseline levels of inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will have their dyspnea rated according to the Medical Research Council (MRC)&#xD;
      scale. The Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment test (CAT) will&#xD;
      also be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry will be performed according to recommendations of the American Thoracic&#xD;
      Society/European Respiratory Society. The forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      values in the first second will be compared with those predicted for the Brazilian&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal incremental cycle ergometer test will be carried out on an electromagnetically&#xD;
      braked cycle ergometer with gas exchange and ventilatory variables analyzed breath-by-breath.&#xD;
      After 2 min at rest and then 2 min pedaling in freewheel, the power (W) will continuously&#xD;
      increase in a linear &quot;ramp&quot; pattern (1 to 20 W/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incremental treadmill test will be performed to determine aerobic training load. The&#xD;
      modified Balke protocol, according to the basal level of physical fitness (a total time&#xD;
      increment between eight and 12 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incremental shuttle walking test will be conducted according to the description of Singh&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily physical activity (DPA) will be assessed with an accelerometer for three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample for inflammatory markers measurements will be collected to analyze of IL-1 beta,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, using Duo Set ELISA kits from R &amp; D Systems according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength with one repetition maximum (1RM) will be performed at middle deltoid (MD),&#xD;
      biceps brachial (BB) and quadriceps femoris (QF). The following movements will also be&#xD;
      evaluated: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and knee extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are going to be randomized to pulmonary rehabilitation or conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      program as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation: 8 week, twice weekly exercise program with aerobic treadmill and&#xD;
      lower limb strength training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional program: 8 week, twice weekly conventional program with: L'Expiration Lente&#xD;
      Totale Glotte Ouverte en decubitus Latéral (Eltgol), autogenous drainage (AD) and shaker with&#xD;
      duration of 30 minutes each.&#xD;
