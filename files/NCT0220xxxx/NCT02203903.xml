      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of administering&#xD;
      rapidly -generated tumor multi-antigen associated -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to HSCT&#xD;
      recipients (Arm A) or future HSCT recipients (Arm B) for the treatment of high-risk or&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory hematopoietic malignancies. In addition to safety, this study will&#xD;
      also evaluate if event-free survival (EFS) is improved with TAA-T administration at six&#xD;
      months after HSCT for patients with high risk AML and MDS (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with evidence of high-risk or relapsed or persistent hematopoietic malignancies (for&#xD;
      example but not limited to: acute leukemia, lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) will be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Patients will be enrolled at two time points (for differing indications) in three arms&#xD;
      (Arm A - post HSCT, Arm B- pre HSCT and Arm C for patients with AML or MDS to prevent relapse&#xD;
      post HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because patients with persistent malignancy prior to transplantation have an extremely poor&#xD;
      prognosis, these patients will be eligible to receive TAA-T before and/or after allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Arm B patients will receive autologous TAA-T&#xD;
      following a cycle of conventional chemotherapy in an effort to decrease the burden of disease&#xD;
      prior to HSCT. Patients with persistent disease or high risk for relapse will be eligible to&#xD;
      receive planned infusion of allogeneic TAA-T after HSCT (given the very high likelihood of&#xD;
      relapse and poor outcome) on Arm A. Patients with high risk AML and MDS who have undergone&#xD;
      allo-HSCT and are in a hematologic remission will enroll under Arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all populations, we will utilize our established protocol for the manufacture of tumor&#xD;
      multi-antigen associated specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      will be exposed to antigen presenting cells pulsed with peptides to tumor antigens (PRAME,&#xD;
      WT1, Survivin) in a cytokine milieu favorable to T cell expansion/activation, inducing&#xD;
      selective expansion of T cells targeted to kill tumor cells. Patients would be monitored for&#xD;
      the development of toxicity. In patients with disease at the time of TAA-T infusion, efficacy&#xD;
      would be evaluated as a secondary endpoint using standard criteria. Exploratory&#xD;
      investigational analyses would include monitoring of cytokine and cellular milieu pre- and&#xD;
      post- TAA-T infusion and in vitro characterization of the host tumor, donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      product, and TAA-T product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm A Patients (post-HSCT): TAA-T will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment&#xD;
      post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm B Patients (pre-HSCT): TAA-T will be infused any time &gt; 7 days after previous therapy&#xD;
      for relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm C Patients (post-HSCT): TAA-T will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment&#xD;
      post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first at dose level 4 . Infusions will be within first 5&#xD;
      months post-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five different dosing levels will be evaluated. Two to four patients will be evaluated on&#xD;
      each dosing schedule (see below). This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled to one of the following dosing levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level One: 5 x 106 cells/m2 Dose Level Two: 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three: 2 x 107&#xD;
      cells/m2 Dose Level Four: 4 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Five: 1 x 108 cells/m2 (ONLY applicable&#xD;
      to Arm A patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C patients will ONLY be enrolled at: Dose Level Four (4 x 107 cells/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive at least one infusion according to the enrolled dose level, where&#xD;
      the expected volume of infusion is 1 to 10 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive cells either because: of prior refractory disease and/or high risk for&#xD;
      relapse and/or detectable disease at the time of infusion. Arm A and Arm B patients will use&#xD;
      the dose escalation strategy described above. Ideally, patients should not receive other&#xD;
      systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 45 days after infusion of TAA-T (for purposes of&#xD;
      evaluation), although such treatment may be added if deemed critical for patient care by the&#xD;
      attending physician and not under IND. Pediatric patients will be enrolled only after the&#xD;
      safety analysis has been completed and is acceptable for 2 adult patients in Arm A and B. Arm&#xD;
      C will enroll pediatric and adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C patients (post HSCT): T cells will be infused any time after neutrophil engraftment&#xD;
      post-HSCT or day 30, whichever comes first, but within first 5 months after HSCT on Dose&#xD;
      level 4 (4x10e7/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients with active disease (defined as hematologic relapse or minimal residual disease&#xD;
      positive (MRD+) any time after allo-HSCT for Arm A and defined as hematologic relapse or MRD+&#xD;
      at the time of TAA-T infusion for Arm B and defined as MRD+ at the time of TAA-T infusion for&#xD;
      Arm C) do not have â‰¥ grade 3 toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to&#xD;
      TAA-T infusion and fail to rapidly progress with disease requiring urgent therapy, patients&#xD;
      may receive a subsequent TAA-T cell dose (infusion #2). A subsequent dose (infusion #2) will&#xD;
      also be available for those patients who have stable disease or a mixed, partial, or complete&#xD;
      response (including continued complete response) by the International Working Group (IWG)&#xD;
      criteria (see section 4.2.1) at the evaluation after the first TAA-T infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received at least 2 infusions of TAA-T are eligible to receive up to 6&#xD;
      additional doses (infusion #3 to #8) of TAA-T at monthly intervals each of which will consist&#xD;
      of the same cell number as their enrolled dose level. Patients will not be able to receive&#xD;
      additional doses until the initial safety profile is completed at 28 days following the&#xD;
      second infusion. Notably, these doses will be identical to the treated dose for this patient&#xD;
      (i.e. no subsequent dose escalation). Patients would then receive additional doses starting&#xD;
      greater than 28 days from second infusion and be treated at the same dose level as he/she has&#xD;
      previously received.&#xD;

    <description>TAA-T may be generated from donors or recipients and will be tested for specificity to 3 tumor antigens commonly found in hematological malignancies (WT1, PRAME, and SURVIVIN,). The goal of this cell infusion will be to initiate an immune response to residual leukemia or lymphoma that includes multiple antigens and may prevent tumor evasion (through decreased expression of a single antigen).</description>
