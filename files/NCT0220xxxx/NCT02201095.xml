    <textblock>
      During anaesthesia for caesarean section it is common to lose heat and become hypothermic,&#xD;
      (&lt;36 degrees C). In order to try and avoid this all women are given warmed intravenous fluid&#xD;
      and insulated from cold surfaces. There are also 2 types of machine available to actively&#xD;
      warm women;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Forced Air Warming - that uses a disposable sheet the woman lies upon with lots of air&#xD;
           pockets that have warm air blown into them continuously by a fan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduction Warming Mattress - a thin mattress which covers the operating table and the&#xD;
           woman lies on top. The padded mattress has strips of material that heat up when&#xD;
           electricity passes through it, similar to a normal electric blanket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to carry out a randomised controlled trial to compare these 2 methods with the&#xD;
      current practice of no active warming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that active warming women during elective caesarean section&#xD;
      prevents women's temperature from dropping and keeps them more comfortable than if active&#xD;
      warming were not used.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When a baby is delivered by a surgical procedure (a caesarean section) the woman will usually&#xD;
      have a &quot;spinal&quot; anaesthetic. With a &quot;spinal&quot;, local anaesthetic is injected into the spinal&#xD;
      fluid to make the woman numb from her chest to her feet, allowing her to be comfortable but&#xD;
      awake during the birth. During this type of anaesthetic it is common to lose heat and become&#xD;
      cold or &quot;hypothermic&quot; measured as less than 36 degrees Celsius. Becoming this cold can be&#xD;
      uncomfortable for the woman but also causes other problems. It can make blood clotting less&#xD;
      effective, alter the way wounds heal afterwards and make the woman more likely to develop&#xD;
      infections or problems related to her heart and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help keep their temperature stable, the investigators give all women fluid into the veins&#xD;
      that is already warm and ensure that they are well insulated from any cold surfaces. There&#xD;
      are two machines that the investigators can also use to actively warm patients but these are&#xD;
      not yet used in every case. The first method is called &quot;Forced Air Warming&quot; and uses a&#xD;
      special disposable sheet the woman lies upon with lots of air pockets that have warm air&#xD;
      blown into them continuously by a fan. The woman is surrounded by these pockets of warm air,&#xD;
      which help to warm her and also insulate against heat loss. The second method is called a&#xD;
      &quot;Conduction Warming Mattress&quot; and uses a thin mattress which covers the operating table and&#xD;
      the woman lies on top. The padded mattress has strips of material that heat up when&#xD;
      electricity passes through it, similar to a normal electric blanket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already looked at the records of some women having caesarean sections&#xD;
      in our hospital and found that both forced air warming and conduction mattress warming seem&#xD;
      to help them stay warm. However, the investigators would like to study this in more detail&#xD;
      and prove scientifically whether these methods are effective. Our aim in this study is to see&#xD;
      if warming machines can help prevent women getting too cold, and prove scientifically whether&#xD;
      one is more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that active warming women during elective caesarean section&#xD;
      prevents women's temperature from dropping and keeps them more comfortable than if active&#xD;
      warming were not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will have exactly the same anaesthetic as they would have had if they were not in&#xD;
      the study. If a woman agrees to be in the study she will be chosen randomly to receive&#xD;
      either, normal care (including warmed fluids but no warming machines), additional warming&#xD;
      with forced air or additional warming by conduction mattress. Her temperature will be&#xD;
      measured at regular intervals before, during and after the caesarean section, at the same&#xD;
      time she will be asked to score herself on a thermal comfort scale. The results will be&#xD;
      analysed to compare the temperature changes in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that the active warming machines will keep body temperature stable and&#xD;
      prevent hypothermia. If the investigators find out that these machines prevent women getting&#xD;
      cold, they can ensure that the most effective methods of warming during caesarean section&#xD;
      operations are used and minimise problems due to becoming cold.&#xD;
