      The proposed work is part of a multidisciplinary approach to continuity of care in the&#xD;
      particular context of the palliative phase of cancer. In conducting this study, we would like&#xD;
      to characterize, at the regional level, satisfaction with the care of patients and their&#xD;
      families in their care home situations palliative cancer. This evaluation will be based on&#xD;
      questionnaires adapted versions in French language satisfaction questionnaires recently&#xD;
      validated for patients in palliative situation and supported home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also identify the challenges faced by both patients, caregivers attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of these elements is a prerequisite to propose ways of improving at a hospital&#xD;
      palliative care for output relay and anticipate the coordination of care for optimal care of&#xD;
      the patient at home, to meet the expectations of different stakeholders, or even prevent&#xD;
      certain readmissions &quot;avoidable&quot;.&#xD;

      - Background and rationale of the research project Palliative care is defined, according to&#xD;
      the French Society for Support and Palliative Care as acute care delivered in a comprehensive&#xD;
      approach to the person with a serious illness, progressive or terminal. Their goal is to&#xD;
      relieve physical pain and other symptoms, but also take into account the psychological,&#xD;
      social and spiritual suffering. According to this definition, palliative care is&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, cater to the patient as a person and his family, at home or in an&#xD;
      institution and strive to preserve the best possible quality of life until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies on the quality of life for patients at end of life were conducted in France.&#xD;
      Among them, the TRAPADO study is a prospective study to evaluate the quality of care, quality&#xD;
      of life and impact on the environment in three parallel cohorts of cancer patients in&#xD;
      palliative phase according to their choice of inpatient traditional in palliative care or&#xD;
      home. The interim analysis of this study, was published in 2006 in the journal Bulletin of&#xD;
      cancer: patients expressed a priority choice for the home; there was a marked alteration of&#xD;
      the overall quality of life, as measured by the EORTC-QLQC30, no statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between home and hospital; anxiety level was higher in the hospital. Relatives&#xD;
      were satisfied with the care of the patient with a good perception of the family fabric and&#xD;
      expressed a lower level of psychosocial distress at home. Nevertheless, the terminal&#xD;
      readmissions were common with a large majority of hospital deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Régis Aubry, in the framework of the National Observatory on End of Life&#xD;
      (ONFV), has conducted an extensive field survey, published in March 2013, up to the&#xD;
      caregivers who meet together near home but also health professionals involved in supporting&#xD;
      patients at end of life. The report of this work highlights the importance of developing&#xD;
      palliative care in the home including the intervention of specialized teams and coordination&#xD;
      of teams working at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, in France, while 81% of the French would &quot;spend their last moments at home&quot; (FIFG,&#xD;
      2010), only 25.5% of deaths occur at home (ONFV, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this reality, we were asked to know what elements can explain this discrepancy&#xD;
      between this reality and the desire of patients. This issue was the subject of a preliminary&#xD;
      study, conducted in 2013 in Lower Normandy region. We chose to study the management of&#xD;
      patients with cancer in palliative home situation by their GP after hospitalization&#xD;
      Identified beds Palliative Care (LISP) Centre François Baclesse Caen: 19 of the 23 patients&#xD;
      assessed, have expressed their willingness on the place of death to their GP, wanted to die&#xD;
      at home. Nearly half (48%) of patients in our study died in the hospital. GPs interviewed&#xD;
      reported that maintaining the homes of these patients had been facilitated by the relief of&#xD;
      distressing symptoms and the establishment of aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding demonstrates that the GP can often not only coordinate the sometimes complex&#xD;
      palliative situations, at home and that the intervention of specialized teams,&#xD;
      interdisciplinary, is fundamental to maintaining a home in the best possible conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But what about the patient felt about his quality of life at home? After collecting feedback&#xD;
      from GPs Lower Normandy, we would like to continue this work. In this context, we propose a&#xD;
      pilot study, single-center, to assess the satisfaction of patients and their families in home&#xD;
      support palliative phase of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Emerging nature of research topics covered: The proposed work is part of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach to continuity of care in the particular context of the palliative&#xD;
      phase of cancer. In conducting this study, we would like to characterize, at the regional&#xD;
      level, satisfaction with the care of patients and their families in their care home&#xD;
      situations palliative cancer. This evaluation will be based on questionnaires adapted&#xD;
      versions in French language satisfaction questionnaires recently validated for patients in&#xD;
      palliative situation and supported home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also identify the challenges faced by both patients, caregivers attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of these elements is a prerequisite to propose ways of improving at a hospital&#xD;
      palliative care for output relay and anticipate the coordination of care for optimal care of&#xD;
      the patient at home, to meet the expectations of different stakeholders, or even prevent&#xD;
      certain readmissions &quot;avoidable&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Degree of risk-taking and innovative scientific approach: The situation at the end of life&#xD;
      patient palliative situation of cancer remains a research context underdeveloped. This study&#xD;
      is based on the involvement of patients and their caregivers, at this stage of the disease to&#xD;
      assess their satisfaction with care when returning home after a hospital palliative care. It&#xD;
      proposes indeed used for this self-administered to patients and their caregivers&#xD;
      questionnaires adapted questionnaires in French version of the research team CANHELP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Impact and potential consequences of the project: The proposed pilot study should document&#xD;
      the satisfaction What patients in palliative situation of their cancer during their care at&#xD;
      home, as well as those around them, at the regional level. The implementation of this project&#xD;
      will also be used to validate the feasibility of involving these actors in the difficult&#xD;
      context of the end of life, to understand their needs, difficulties and feelings regarding&#xD;
      the effective care . Thereafter, it may be considered a larger study to complete these first&#xD;
      results, before proposing ways to improve whose impact on satisfaction with care remain to be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
