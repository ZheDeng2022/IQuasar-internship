  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a marked and long-lasting improvement in glucose homeostasis that follows Roux-en-y&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) in humans. This improvement has been attributed in large part&#xD;
      to an intestinal hormone, called GLP-1, that is released into the circulation immediately&#xD;
      after eating. The purpose of this study is to determine if GLP-1 mediates the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of RYGB surgery on glucose homeostasis in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct this study, we will enroll humans who previously underwent Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery, who are medically and weight stable and with no signs of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      either before or after surgery. Potential subjects will first be screened for eligibility and&#xD;
      also to verify that they can safely participate in the study. Each study subject will be&#xD;
      administered a meal tolerance test (MTT) on 3 separate occasions. For the MTT, a liquid meal&#xD;
      (Boost Plus) will be ingested following an overnight fast. A primed-continuous infusion of&#xD;
      vehicle alone (human albumin) or xenin-25 alone (at a dose of 4 or 12 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1)&#xD;
      will be initiated 15 minutes before the meal is ingested. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      before and during the MTT for the measurement of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a&#xD;
      host of other hormones. A comparison of the results will tell us if the effects of xenin-25&#xD;
      on insulin release are mediated by GLP-1 in humans.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lacks cognitive ability to sign the consent &amp;/or follow the study directions for&#xD;
