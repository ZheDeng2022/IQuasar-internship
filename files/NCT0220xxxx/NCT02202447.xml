    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of EC1169 and the best dose to use in&#xD;
      humans in future studies. This study will also determine how EC1169 is distributed, broken&#xD;
      down, passed and absorbed through your body and how quickly it is eliminated (leaves the&#xD;
      body). All patients will receive EC1169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective in Part A: To explore the relationships between baseline PSMA&#xD;
      expression (tumor and patient level) as measured by 99mTc-EC0652 scans and the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of EC1169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory objective in Part B: To assess EC0652 as a predictive biomarker for the&#xD;
      efficacy of EC1169 by comparing PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative lesions for response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, oncology study to conducted in 2&#xD;
      parts. Part A is a dose-escalation phase to determine the Recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose and&#xD;
      the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the administration of EC1169 QW on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of EC1169 and EC0652&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess preliminary efficacy results in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant&#xD;
           prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and&#xD;
           previously treated with a taxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part B is to identify the radiographic progression-free survival&#xD;
      (rPFS) in taxane-naïve and taxane-exposed PSMA-positive mCRPC patients receiving treatment&#xD;
      with EC1169.&#xD;
