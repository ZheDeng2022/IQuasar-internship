      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to different&#xD;
      combinations of two experimental HIV vaccines-the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine and the AIDSVAX® B/E&#xD;
      vaccine-in healthy adults who are not infected with HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      combination of two different experimental HIV vaccines-the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine and the&#xD;
      AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine-administered in different sequences or simultaneously, in healthy adults&#xD;
      who are not infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to four groups. Depending on which group participants&#xD;
      are in, they will receive different combinations of the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, the AIDSVAX®&#xD;
      B/E vaccine, a placebo for DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, and/or a placebo for AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine.&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at study entry, Week 2, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12.&#xD;
      All participants will receive their assigned combinations of vaccines at study entry and&#xD;
      Months 1, 3, and 6. At each vaccination visit, participants will receive one injection in&#xD;
      each upper arm. Following each vaccination, participants will remain in the clinic for 30&#xD;
      minutes for monitoring. All study visits will include a physical examination, HIV risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling, and questionnaires and assessments. Select study visits will also&#xD;
      include a urine collection, a blood collection, a pregnancy test for participants who were&#xD;
      born female, and HIV testing and counseling.&#xD;
