      The objective of this prospective cohort study in patients with a known thoracic aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm is to test the hypothesis that yearly aneurysm progression rate is higher in&#xD;
      patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) compared to patients without OSA, and that the&#xD;
      need for aortic operation or proven or presumed death from aortic rupture or dissection&#xD;
      happens more often in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and OSA compared to patients&#xD;
      without OSA.&#xD;

      Thoracic aortic aneurysm An aortic aneurysm is defined as a localised dilatation of the&#xD;
      aorta, which includes all three layers of the vessel, intima, media and adventitia. The&#xD;
      incidence of thoracic aortic aneurysm is estimated to be six to ten cases per 100,000 patient&#xD;
      years, most commonly occurring in the sixth and seventh decade of life. Thoracic aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms are two to four times more commonly found in males than in females. Sixty percent&#xD;
      of thoracic aortic aneurysms involve the ascending aorta, 40% the descending aorta, and 10%&#xD;
      involve the thoraco-abdominal aorta. The pathogenesis and natural history as well as the&#xD;
      therapy of thoracic aortic aneurysms differ for each of these segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic aneurysms of the ascending aorta are considered to result from cystic degeneration&#xD;
      of the media layer, a process associated with weakening of the aortic wall. Cystic medial&#xD;
      degeneration occurs with aging, but seems to be increased in some families and with arterial&#xD;
      hypertension. Other risk factors which have been suggested to be associated primarily with&#xD;
      thoracic aneurysm formation of the descending aorta are the same as those for atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (e.g. hypertension, smoking and hypercholesterolemia). Whether atherosclerosis itself is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for aortic aneurysm development is a matter of debate. A multifactorial,&#xD;
      non-atherosclerotic cause such as a defect in vascular structural proteins and breakdown of&#xD;
      extracellular matrix proteins in combination with increased mechanical stress has been&#xD;
      postulated as the most likely mechanism for thoracic aneurysm formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography or MR angiography are recommended for&#xD;
      serial re-evaluation of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural history data on thoracic aortic aneurysms is scarce; however, aneurysm diameter has&#xD;
      been shown to increase by 1 to 10 mm per year. The rate of expansion is related to the&#xD;
      diameter of the aneurysm with larger aneurysms expanding faster; the findings of an early&#xD;
      cohort study on the natural course of thoracic aortic aneurysms found a yearly expansion of&#xD;
      7.9mm in aneurysms &gt;50mm, compared to 1.7mm in aneurysms ≤50mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several series of patients, aneurysm rupture occurred in 32% to 68% of medically treated&#xD;
      patients. The most important identified risk factor for rupture seems to be the size of the&#xD;
      aneurysm; the yearly rate of dissection or rupture ranges from 2%, to 3%, to 7%, for thoracic&#xD;
      aortic aneurysms less than 50 mm, 50-59 mm, and ≥60 mm in diameter, respectively. Expansion&#xD;
      rate per year, male gender, hypertension, systemic steroid therapy and inflammation are other&#xD;
      factors associated with increased risk of aneurysm rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic patients with a thoracic aortic aneurysm are usually managed medically with&#xD;
      blood pressure control using a beta blocker and serial evaluation of aneurysmal size&#xD;
      progression. Surgery is reserved for symptomatic patients, and for asymptomatic patients with&#xD;
      rapid aneurysm expansion (usually defined as &gt;10mm per year), or an aneurysm diameter &gt;50 to&#xD;
      60mm, depending on the affected aortic segment, body size and other clinical factors.&#xD;
      However, thoracic aneurysm repair is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates&#xD;
      between 3% and 12% in more recent retrospective series. In cases of emergency surgery for&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal aneurysm the 30 day mortality has even been reported to be as high as 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, any modifiable factors influencing the onset of a thoracic aneurysm and its&#xD;
      progressive expansion are of major interest, hopefully leading to new therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      to improve morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by a repetitive collapse of the pharynx&#xD;
      during sleep, which results in apnoea or hypopnoea associated with oxygen desaturations and&#xD;
      arousals from sleep, often many hundred times per night. OSA, defined as apnoea-hypopnoea&#xD;
      index (AHI) of 5/h or higher, is a common but underdiagnosed sleep-related breathing disorder&#xD;
      affecting up to 25% of the middle-aged male population twenty years ago, that now is&#xD;
      substantially increased due to higher prevalence of obesity. It is estimated that 80-90% of&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA are not diagnosed. The gold-standard diagnostic test for OSA is&#xD;
      in-laboratory polysomnography. Alternatively, OSA can be diagnosed with high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity - in subjects with high probability for OSA based on clinical symptoms - by&#xD;
      in-hospital respiratory polygraphy or portable monitor devices at home (cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      sleep study). The usual and most effective treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) therapy. A device delivers a continuous level of positive airway pressure&#xD;
      with fixed or auto-titrating pressure keeping airway patency and thereby preventing apnoeas&#xD;
      and hypopnoeas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from observational and non-randomised studies indicate an association&#xD;
      between OSA and cardiovascular events. There is also evidence that severe symptomatic sleep&#xD;
      apnoea is associated with hypertension, stroke and myocardial infarction. The proposed&#xD;
      mechanisms underpinning the association between OSA and vascular dysfunction leading to&#xD;
      cardio- and cerebrovascular disease are increasingly large intrathoracic pressure changes&#xD;
      leading to mechanical stress on the heart and large artery walls, arousal-induced reflex&#xD;
      sympathetic activation with resultant repetitive blood pressure rises, sometimes to over&#xD;
      200mmHg, and intermittent hypoxia leading to increased oxidative stress and sympathetic&#xD;
      activity. The rises in blood pressure induce extensive shear stresses on blood vessel walls -&#xD;
      forces that are thought to cause vascular wall damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent findings from observational studies suggest a possible link between OSA, thoracic&#xD;
      aortic dilatation and aortic events in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Marfan's syndrome is&#xD;
      an inherited disorder of the connective tissue and aortic root dilatation with subsequent&#xD;
      rupture is the commonest life-threatening manifestation. In a cross-sectional study including&#xD;
      patients with Marfan's syndrome, the severity of OSA was positively correlated with the&#xD;
      diameter of the aortic root. In a recent prospective Marfan cohort study, the rate of aortic&#xD;
      events (defined as operation because of rapid progressive aortic dilatation, and death&#xD;
      because of aortic rupture) was compared between patients with and without OSA. Aortic-event&#xD;
      free survival was significantly shorter in patients with Marfan's syndrome and OSA compared&#xD;
      to patients without OSA, suggesting that OSA may be an important risk factor for aortic&#xD;
      events in Marfan's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanisms through which OSA may promote aortic dilatation are not clear. OSA&#xD;
      has been shown to be associated with increased diurnal blood pressure as well as with large&#xD;
      and recurrent surges in blood pressure during apnoeic events, which is the main identified&#xD;
      risk factor for aortic dilatation and dissection. In addition, obstructive apnoeas are&#xD;
      associated with repeated inspiratory effort against the collapsed upper airway causing&#xD;
      recurrent large negative intrathoracic pressures (sometimes as low as -80 mmHg) and thereby&#xD;
      producing outward radial forces on intrathoracic structures including the aorta. This&#xD;
      hypothesis is supported by the findings of Peters et al. who reported increased aortic&#xD;
      diameters during obstructive apnoeas in an animal model. In healthy humans, experimentally&#xD;
      simulated obstructive apnoea/hypopnoea has also been shown to lead to an acute increase in&#xD;
      proximal aortic diameter and transmural pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published cohort study of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, it was&#xD;
      shown that severe OSA may be associated with an accelerated expansion of abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms. Because there is only limited cross-sectional and inconclusive data on the&#xD;
      possible association between OSA and thoracic aortic aneurysm from non-Marfan study&#xD;
      populations a prospective large cohort study of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms is&#xD;
      needed to investigate whether OSA is associated with faster progression of aortic dilatation,&#xD;
      and aortic events, in a high risk population. Should OSA appear to be a factor associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk for rapid aortic dilatation and aortic events, then a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial in those with OSA would be appropriate, looking at the effect of continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (the definitive treatment for OSA) on thoracic aortic dilatation.&#xD;
