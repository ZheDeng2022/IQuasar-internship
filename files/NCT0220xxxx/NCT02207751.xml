  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to understand the best way to place Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) catheters, and&#xD;
      the best way to collect data regarding their function in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: We will carry out a detailed examination of existing returned pilot data with&#xD;
      emphasis on data fields with poor data completeness and perform root cause analysis, and&#xD;
      assess deficiencies in data field definition to identify improvements to be implemented. We&#xD;
      will construct and disseminate electronic survey material to all study centres with targeted&#xD;
      visits by the Principle Investigator undertaken. These visits will facilitate insight into&#xD;
      local organization of data collection including interaction with designated individuals&#xD;
      responsible for data returns. PD training days will be organized with emphasis on clinical&#xD;
      practice feedback utilizing data acquired in the initial phases. Hospital Episode Statistics&#xD;
      will be linked to existing acquired PD patient information to ensure the accuracy of&#xD;
      collected data. An online data acquisition system will be developed to allow direct data&#xD;
      entry from centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: On-going and sustained data acquisition performed on a prospective basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Primary data analysis including clinical practice variation in England, Wales and&#xD;
      Northern Ireland to identify site specific PD catheter functionality variation. Additionally,&#xD;
      patient and site specific characteristics that predict clinical outcomes in PD will be&#xD;
      identified and characterised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Clinical guidelines will be developed.&#xD;
