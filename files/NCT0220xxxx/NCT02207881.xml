  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent herpes labialis are usually a minor malady of limited duration, although they are&#xD;
      often painful and are uniformly discomforting for patients. Oral antivirals represent an&#xD;
      advance in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis, but the clinical implications are&#xD;
      modest. Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown that oral antivirals decrease the&#xD;
      duration of lesion episodes and pain by approximately one day. In recurrent HSV infections&#xD;
      including herpes labialis, many instances of viral re-activation occur without symptoms, and&#xD;
      can only be identified by detection of virus on the lips of infected individuals. In these&#xD;
      cases, the virus is cleared from the local site without the development of a classical&#xD;
      ulcerative herpes lesion. In the other cases, the triggered specific immune response rapidly&#xD;
      stops viral replication in the skin and also causes the development of the herpes lesion&#xD;
      prodrome and a considerable part of the symptoms associated with a classical ulcerative&#xD;
      herpes lesion. One could therefore predict that treatment with an antiviral drug alone would&#xD;
      help the immune system in shortening the virus replication, but may not substantially reduce&#xD;
      the disfiguring symptoms caused by the immune reaction. In dermatology, the principle of&#xD;
      using an anti-inflammatory drug improve clinical outcomes by reducing inflammation-related&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the infection has been well established. We have found that a&#xD;
      topical formulation of VDO is useful for alleviating pain and inflammation associated with&#xD;
      infection caused by herpes virus.&#xD;

      In the treatment of oral herpes labialis, it is desirable to have local absorption of the&#xD;
      drug to provide pain relief directly at the lesion sites while minimizing overall exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to elucidate the effects of VDO ( on recurrent herpes simplex&#xD;
      labialis.&#xD;

The subject will be asked the following question exactly as follows：「On a scale 1 to 10 where 0 means on pain/itching, and 10 means the worst possible pain/itching, rate the worst pain/itching that you have since last assessment」</description>
