    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cells go through cycles which allow them to divide. In normal cells, Chk1 and Chk2&#xD;
           (Chk1/2) stop cell division at various points to allow any damage to DNA to be repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When Chk1/2 are not present, cells stop dividing and eventually die. LY2606368 blocks&#xD;
           the Chk1/2 proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers hope that by blocking Chk1/2, it will cause tumor cells to die, thereby&#xD;
           shrinking tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if LY2606368 helps shrink tumors in patients with certain breast, ovarian or&#xD;
      prostate cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants at least 18 years old with breast or ovarian cancer. They must have a mutation&#xD;
      in BRCA1/2 genes for group 1, high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for&#xD;
      group 2, or triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 3, or prostate&#xD;
      cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have&#xD;
           blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test, scans, and X-rays. They will have a&#xD;
           piece of their tumor removed at entry (CT-assisted biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Day 1: Participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They may have a CT&#xD;
           scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle: Participants will receive the study drug through&#xD;
           an IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be checked before and after. An ECG will be done within 1 hour after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15 and Day 28: Participants will have a physical exam, blood drawn, and a 12 lead&#xD;
           ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1: Participants will have weekly phone calls and blood draws. Participants may&#xD;
           have another CT-assisted biopsy at the end of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2 and beyond, blood will be drawn every other week for routine blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an after-study visit with a physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;
           Participants may have another biopsy when they progressed on treatment. They will have&#xD;
           scans of the chest, pelvis, and abdomen and a 12 lead ECG.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1/2) are major regulators of the cell cycle and are&#xD;
           intimately associated with the cellular response to DNA damage and repair. Chk1/2 also&#xD;
           function as the primary mediators of cell cycle arrest in tumors with p53 dysfunction,&#xD;
           such as high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), and triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
           (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have inherent defects in DNA damage&#xD;
           repair pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chk1/2 inhibition alone yielded DNA damage and mitotic catastrophe preclinically, even&#xD;
           in the absence of DNA damage by external agents in tumors with underlying DNA repair&#xD;
           dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second-generation Chk1/2 inhibitor, LY2606368, yielded safety and preliminary single&#xD;
           agent activity in advanced cancer participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that LY2606368 will result in clinical benefit in participants with&#xD;
           gBRCAm-associated breast or ovarian cancers, and HGSOC and TNBC with low genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective response rate (CR+PR) of single agent LY2606368 in patients&#xD;
           with gBRCAm-associated breast or ovarian cancer, HGSOC and TNBC with low genetic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and toxicity, and progression-free interval (PFI) of LY2606368&#xD;
           in pretreated participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine biochemical changes in the DNA damage repair and cell cycle check point&#xD;
           pathways in tumor and blood samples in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine potential resistance mechanisms to LY2606368 treatment in HGSOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with recurrent/refractory BRCA mutant breast or ovarian cancer, HGSOC, and&#xD;
           TNBC, for whom there remains no standard curative measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A documented deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutation for breast or ovarian cancer&#xD;
           participants enrolling in Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative BRCA mutation testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer syndrome for HGSOC (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative BRCA mutation testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer syndrome for TNBC (Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effective with amendment I (version date 4/24/2017), mCRPC, Cohort 4 was closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative BRCA mutation testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer syndrome for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC with measurable and&#xD;
           biopsiable disease (Cohort 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative BRCA mutation testing or negative family history of hereditary breast and&#xD;
           ovarian cancer syndrome for recurrent platinum-resistant HGSOC with measurable but&#xD;
           without biopsiable disease (Cohort 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or&#xD;
           biological therapy for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label, single arm phase II trial to examine activity of LY2606368 in&#xD;
           participants in the 6 independent cohorts (Cohorts 1-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY2606368 will be dosed at the RP2D of 105 mg/m2 IV once every 14 days of a 28&#xD;
           day-cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research samples including whole blood, CTCs, and tumor biopsies will be obtained for PD&#xD;
           endpoints at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15 (6-24hr post-2nd dose), and/or at progression in&#xD;
           all participants. Tumor biopsies will not be performed in Cohort 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants (Cohorts 1-3, 5 and 6) will be evaluated every two cycles for response&#xD;
           using RECIST v1.1 and every cycle for safety using CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;

          7. Lack of recovery of prior adverse events due to prior cancer therapy to Grade less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1 (NCI CTCAE; except alopecia). Electrolyte abnormalities that are&#xD;
             corrected with supplementation will be eligible. Participants with platinum-related&#xD;
             grade 2 or greater hypomagnesemia (on replacement) will be eligible. Stable persistent&#xD;
             grade 2 peripheral neuropathy may be allowed as determined on a case-by-case basis at&#xD;
             the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
