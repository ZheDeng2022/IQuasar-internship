  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of patients with neuroendocrine cancers present with metastasis, a vast&#xD;
      majority to the liver. In such patients, one treatment option for liver-directed therapy is&#xD;
      surgical resection. However, a significant proportion of patients are not eligible for&#xD;
      resection because of patient factors (age, comorbidities) or tumor-related factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been scant data on the utility of EBRT (external-beam radiotherapy) and SABR&#xD;
      (stereotactic ablative radiotherapy) for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the liver. This&#xD;
      study will measure the effects of concurrent everolimus with external-beam radiotherapy to&#xD;
      the liver for metastatic neuroendocrine New methods of tumor assessment are needed in NETs.&#xD;
      Three new techniques are being developed at the Sunnybrook Research Institute to assess&#xD;
      tumour response to treatment: (1) contrast enhanced ultrasound; (2) perfusion CT; and (3)&#xD;
      perfusion MRI. These methods are devised to measure tumour perfusion and blood flow as&#xD;
      response indicators and can measure cell death non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Concurrent everolimus given with external-beam radiotherapy to the liver for metastatic&#xD;
           neuroendocrine tumors of the liver will enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and add&#xD;
           little, if any, toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. New radiological measures of CEUS and DCE-CT are effective measure to delineate tumor&#xD;
           response in NETs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-centre, pilot study for Radiosensitization of Everolimus with&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy to the liver for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors The study will&#xD;
      have 2 safety run-in dose levels: 2.5mg and 5mg Everolimus PO daily. Two patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the 2.5mg dose level and 2 patients enrolled into the 5mg dose level. However,&#xD;
      only one patient can start the safety run-in doses at a time. For the safety run-in dose&#xD;
      levels, if no serious adverse events related to Everolimus occur within 30 days of the first&#xD;
      dose of radiation therapy (in combination with Everolimus) in one patient, then the next&#xD;
      patient can start study drug. The same criteria applies for the first 4 patients (2 patients&#xD;
      on 2.5mg PO daily and 2 patients on 5 mg PO daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no serious adverse events related to Everolimus occur in the fourth patient at 5mg PO&#xD;
      daily within 30 days of the first dose of radiation therapy (in combination with Everolimus),&#xD;
      more than one patient can then be enrolled at one time at the target dose of 7.5mg PO daily.&#xD;
      Ten patients will be enrolled at 7.5mg PO daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, Everolimus starts 30 days prior to radiation and continues throughout&#xD;
      radiation and for 14 days post radiation. Patients will receive Everolimus for 14 days post&#xD;
      treatment only; as this pilot is designed to assess the combined effect of radiation and&#xD;
      Everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive external-beam radiotherapy (30Gy in 10 fractions) or SBRT (up to&#xD;
      60Gy in 3-5 fractions given on alternating weekdays over 1-2 weeks). The decision to treat&#xD;
      with either external-beam radiotherapy or SBRT will be based on whether the lesions are&#xD;
      amenable to SBRT (preferred treatment), which is determined by the size of the target lesion,&#xD;
      liver sparing and organs-at-risk dose constraints. The prescription dose of external-beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy and SBRT will similarly be determined by these factors.&#xD;
