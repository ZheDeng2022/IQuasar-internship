      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether patients with T1/2N0-2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the oropharynx,&#xD;
      hypopharynx or larynx can tolerate treatment with cisplatin chemoradiation in three weeks&#xD;
      using reduced volume IMRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the adverse events associated with hypofractionated, reduced volume cisplatin&#xD;
      chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate response rates and progression-free survival rates of hypofractionated, reduced&#xD;
      volume cisplatin chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine HRQOL following hypofractionated, reduced volume cisplatin chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients can safely be treated in three weeks rather than six weeks, such a schedule would&#xD;
      provide a much more convenient alternative for patients and result in a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the health care resources currently expended on cure of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are frequently occurring tumors with more than&#xD;
      500,000 new cases worldwide and 45,000 in the USA yearly . Most patients present with&#xD;
      local-regionally advanced diseases. Chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation is an&#xD;
      integrated treatment component in the management of these patients. Concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      can be given in unresectable diseases, in organ preservation to avoid surgery and preserve&#xD;
      functions, and in high risk patients after surgery . Randomized clinical trials and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have shown that concurrent chemoradiation are superior to radiation alone in&#xD;
      these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way of reducing overall treatment time and toxicity is to reduce the number of fractions&#xD;
      by increasing the daily radiotherapy dose. The consequence of increased daily dose is both an&#xD;
      increase in acute side effects as well as an increase in late toxicity. A widely accepted&#xD;
      model of these radiobiologic effects over the range of typical 2-4 Gy daily fractions is the&#xD;
      alpha-beta model that distinguishes acute responses and late responses based on a&#xD;
      linear-quadratic fitting of extrapolated clonogenic survival curves. A time factor can be&#xD;
      incorporated to account for the effect of repopulation. Equivalent biologically effective&#xD;
      dose schedules using a reduced number of fractions may be calculated for any conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated course. Because 70Gy/35/6 weeks with chemoradiation has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      tolerable, and because 66Gy/30/6 weeks has been shown with IMRT to produce 90% control for&#xD;
      T1/2 oropharyngeal primary tumors, we will take the biological equivalent of 66Gy/33&#xD;
      fractions over six weeks as the biologic equivalent standard we wish to maintain in&#xD;
      hypofractionated courses of radiation. Because 54Gy/30 over six weeks is a well-known&#xD;
      elective radiation dose schedule producing 95% control of occult nodal disease, we will take&#xD;
      this as the biologically equivalent standard we wish to maintain in our hypofractionated&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
