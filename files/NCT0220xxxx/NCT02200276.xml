      The immune system is the part of the body that protects against infection. The immune system&#xD;
      often doesn't work as effectively as people get older. This research is being done to find&#xD;
      out how the immune systems in older people who are over age 75 respond to influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (flu shot). We also want to find out if chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a common&#xD;
      virus infection in older persons affects the immune response in people older than 75 years of&#xD;
      age who receive a flu shot. The Flu Shot is a vaccine approved for the prevention of&#xD;
      influenza (&quot;Flu&quot;) infections and is recommended every year for all persons 50 years and&#xD;
      older. People who are older than 75 years of age are considered healthy or frail may join. A&#xD;
      total of 525 persons will be participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine if you are qualified for the study, we would ask you to answer a few&#xD;
      questions over the phone that will take approximately 5 minutes. If you qualify and agree to&#xD;
      proceed, you will be asked to come to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center or, if you are&#xD;
      unable to come to Bayview, one of our staff can visit you at your home. During that visit we&#xD;
      obtain consent, review your medical history, and measure your vital signs, walking speed and&#xD;
      grip strength. We will also administer a few brief questionnaires and collect urine and blood&#xD;
      samples. We will then give you the Flu shot for free. Three to four weeks after you receive&#xD;
      the Flu shot, you will have another visit at Johns Hopkins Bayview or your home where we will&#xD;
      repeat some of the questionnaires, vital signs, and collect a second blood sample. Throughout&#xD;
      the study, we will call you once a week to ask about your general health and any Flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms. These calls will be made throughout the Flu season which typically lasts through&#xD;
      the end of May. If you begin to have any influenza like symptoms at any time during the&#xD;
      study, we ask that you call our office to report these symptoms so that we may perform a&#xD;
      nasal swab to confirm influenza, and a third blood draw to look at the immune response and&#xD;
      protection of influenza vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality and is the fourth leading cause&#xD;
      of death for older Americans. Annual immunization with a trivalent inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine (TIV) is recommended for all adults 50 years and older. However, despite improved&#xD;
      vaccination coverage in older adults over time, influenza-related mortality has actually&#xD;
      increased. While many TIV studies indicate its benefit for older adults as a whole, these&#xD;
      studies lacked representation of the older and frail subset of the elderly who suffer over&#xD;
      three-quarters of influenza-related mortality. Our pilot study funded by a Beeson K23 award&#xD;
      showed significant vaccine failures in both antibody response to TIV and clinical protection&#xD;
      in the frail elderly. Our preliminary data also suggest that chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      infection as defined by the presence of CMV viral DNA in peripheral monocytes using a highly&#xD;
      sensitive and specific nested PCR-based assay developed in our laboratory, rather than&#xD;
      anti-CMV IgG serology, is associated with poor antibody and T-cell responses to TIV&#xD;
      immunization as well as poor clinical protection. This is likely because anti-CMV IgG&#xD;
      serology, the conventional diagnostic measure for chronic CMV infection, is a crude measure&#xD;
      that merely indicates prior exposure to CMV and does not distinguish chronic (persistent)&#xD;
      from past (resolved) infections. Mechanistically, precipitous immune functional decline has&#xD;
      been observed in those over 75 and chronic CMV infection may contribute significantly to&#xD;
      age-related immune senescent remodeling, termed immunosenescence. In order to improve our&#xD;
      assessment of the effectiveness of TIV immunization and understanding of risk factors and&#xD;
      underlying immune mechanisms that determine vaccine failure in adults over age 75, the frail,&#xD;
      oldest old adult subset, this study is designed to conduct prospective, 4-year TIV&#xD;
      immunization and post-vaccination influenza surveillance in adults over 75 years. We will&#xD;
      first assess chronic CMV infection defined by detectable CMV DNA in peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytes and frailty status of the study participants and administer the Fluzone High-Dose&#xD;
      TIV vaccine. Influenza-like illness (ILI) cases will be identified through post-vaccination&#xD;
      influenza surveillance as previously done in the Beeson project and respiratory specimens&#xD;
      obtained from ILI cases will be tested using the cutting edge PCR-based IBIS assay which can&#xD;
      accurately subtype influenza and other respiratory viruses in the laboratory of Dr. Charlotte&#xD;
      Gaydos in Division of Infectious Disease, a co-investigator of this project. Strain-specific&#xD;
      antibody responses to TIV immunization will be measured by the standard hemogglutination&#xD;
      inhibition (HI) assay. We will also evaluate T-cell responses to influenza viruses at&#xD;
      baseline and after TIV immunization. Taken together, these studies will provide more accurate&#xD;
      assessment of the clinical effectiveness of TIV immunization in real world geriatric&#xD;
      population over age 75 and its underlying humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms.&#xD;
      Moreover, we investigate the role of chronic CMV infection as defined by the presence of CMV&#xD;
      viral DNA in peripheral monocytes as a risk factor for vaccine failure in the elderly over&#xD;
      age 75. Because this oldest old subset is growing most rapidly in numbers and is at greatest&#xD;
      risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality. The long-term goal of this research is to&#xD;
      strengthen immune protection against influenza for vulnerable older Americans through more&#xD;
      effective and targeted immunization strategies as well as possibly through prevention and&#xD;
      mitigation of chronic CMV infection.&#xD;
