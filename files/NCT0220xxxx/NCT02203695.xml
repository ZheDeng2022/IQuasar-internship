  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that outcomes for patients with biochemically&#xD;
      recurrent prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy will be improved by the addition of&#xD;
      enzalutamide for 6-months compared to standard-of-care salvage radiation therapy to allow for&#xD;
      further study in the definitive phase III setting. This study builds on the prior success of&#xD;
      high-dose bicalutamide (for 24 months) when combined with salvage external radiation therapy&#xD;
      (XRT), while using a newer more potent anti-androgen for a shorter duration of time (6&#xD;
      months) in an effort to minimize adverse effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor that significantly&#xD;
      prolongs survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have&#xD;
      received prior docetaxel chemotherapy 35,36. Enzalutamide has demonstrated activity in cells&#xD;
      that overexpress the androgen receptor. Unlike previous androgen receptor blocker (ARB)&#xD;
      agents, Enzalutamide does not display any agonist properties and blocks translocation of the&#xD;
      ligand-receptor complex into the nucleus preventing DNA binding 33. Enzalutamide is an oral&#xD;
      agent that is generally well tolerated and does not require concurrent steroid&#xD;
      administration, which makes it an ideal candidate for combination with salvage radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, provocative preliminary Phase II data presented at the American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology (ASCO) 2013 by M. Smith and colleagues assessed the efficacy and safety of 25-weeks&#xD;
      (~6-mos) of enzalutamide alone in prostate cancer of all stages who had never received&#xD;
      hormone therapy; presenting with non-castrate testosterone levels ( 230 ng/dL). Enzalutamide&#xD;
      alone for 6-mos achieved a high PSA response rate with efficacy similar to castration, but&#xD;
      .in contrast to castration, bone mineral density (BMD) remained stable and metabolic&#xD;
      variables were not substantially impacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial described here differs from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 96-01, RTOG&#xD;
      05-34 and RADICALS in several ways. First, the eligibility criteria are stricter; less&#xD;
      favorable patients have been selected. Second, short-term ARB is being tested, while in RTOG&#xD;
      96-01 and RADICALS long-term ARB of 2-years was examined. Finally, and most importantly, we&#xD;
      are testing the second generation ARB agent, enzalutamide, alone in combination with SRT as&#xD;
      opposed to RTOG 05-34 and RADICALS which use androgen deprivation (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is not intended to address the efficacy of SRT alone over observation. The&#xD;
      complete response rate (a drop in PSA to undetectable levels) after SRT is 70%-80% and&#xD;
      durable responses are observed in 30%-40% of patients. For these reasons, it is not feasible&#xD;
      or appropriate to randomize men between observation and SRT. The more important issue is&#xD;
      whether the proportion of durable responses is increased by altering the therapeutic&#xD;
      approach, such as the use of enhanced ARB using enzalutamide.&#xD;
