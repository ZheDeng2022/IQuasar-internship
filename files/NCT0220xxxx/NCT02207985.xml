      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the antitumour effect of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) with allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after radical&#xD;
      resection of the tumour and adjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If investigators can accomplish an anti-tumour effect using RIC with HSCT as adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it might increase the survival or even&#xD;
      cure patients in this group with very poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary scientific question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can investigators demonstrate an anti-tumour effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma using&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with HSCT?&#xD;

      Background Cancer of the pancreas is one of the most common cancer forms in Sweden.&#xD;
      Nine-hundred persons receive this diagnosis every year. The 5-year survival is very low,&#xD;
      between 5 and 15%, even in the cases where radical resection of the tumor can be performed.&#xD;
      This is probably due to minimal residual disease that cannot be diagnosed at the time of&#xD;
      surgery. It has recently been shown that micrometastases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be&#xD;
      detected in tissue samples from lymph nodes and bone marrow, using new sensitive&#xD;
      immunohistological methods. When radical resection of the tumour is performed, no&#xD;
      microscopically visible tumour is left, but even in this situation, local recurrence of the&#xD;
      disease is the most common cause of death in these patients. None of the so far studied&#xD;
      adjuvant treatments, irradiation or chemotherapy, has substantially improved the survival in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established curative&#xD;
      treatment for malignant blood diseases, mainly leukemia. Using the conventional form of HSCT,&#xD;
      where the patient undergoes a myeloablative conditioning with chemotherapy and irradiation,&#xD;
      will diminish the amount of malignant cells, but also create space in the bone marrow for the&#xD;
      donated stem cells. The myeloablative conditioning induces severe toxic effects, but the&#xD;
      patient is rescued by the transplantation of the donated hematopoietic stem cells. The new&#xD;
      stem cells will mature into an immune system that will react with the patient's cells, an&#xD;
      effect called graft-versus-host reaction (GVHD). It has been shown that the graft-versus-host&#xD;
      reaction correlates well with the curative anti-tumor effect. A mild GVH reaction will&#xD;
      diminish the risk of relapse, while a severe GVH reaction might be mortal. This anti-tumour&#xD;
      effect is mediated by white blood cells of the T-cell type. From this knowledge, the HSCT&#xD;
      technique has been developed and nowadays it is possible to use reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC). With reduced intensity conditioning using milder forms of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      the toxic effects can be reduced, but the immunosuppressive effect is enough to make sure&#xD;
      that the hematopoietic stem cells will engraft. Using RIC has lead to treatment of older&#xD;
      patients and the anti-tumor effect is just as efficient as with the myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, RIC with HSCT has been used as adjuvant treatment against solid tumours, mainly&#xD;
      kidney cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer. An important part of the treatment consists of&#xD;
      additional infusion of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) after the transplantation to maintain&#xD;
      or increase the anti-tumour effect. At our clinic, we have treated about 50 patients with&#xD;
      solid tumours using RIC with HSCT. Most of our patients had kidney or colon cancer (19 and 16&#xD;
      patients, respectively), but also two patients with prostate cancer have been treated. About&#xD;
      ten patients with primary liver cancers have been treated with liver transplantation combined&#xD;
      with RIC with HSCT. The transplantation-related mortality in these patients is about 10-15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the antitumour effect of RIC with HSCT in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      after radical resection of the tumour and adjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If investigators can accomplish an anti-tumour effect using RIC with HSCT as adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it might increase the survival or even&#xD;
      cure patients in this group with very poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary scientific question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can investigators demonstrate an anti-tumour effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma using&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with HSCT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary scientific questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What side-effects will the patient suffer? Can survival be improved compared to standard&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma? Is it possible to improve the results by using&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-cells against specific pancreatic adenocarcinoma antigens? Are there methods to&#xD;
      identify the patients that will have the best results from the treatment? How will quality of&#xD;
      life be affected?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-tumour effect of treatment with RIC with HSCT in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All patients will undergo curative surgery with&#xD;
      radical resection of the tumour and adjuvant standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine. HSCT&#xD;
      will be offered to patients with an HLA-identical sibling, a kind of biological&#xD;
      randomisation. The control group will consist of patients without an HLA-identical sibling,&#xD;
      or those declining HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with radically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma that have received adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment with standard chemotherapy after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastases or non-radical resection of the tumour. Relapse&#xD;
      during standard chemotherapy. Age above 70 years. Severe heart conditions, liver disease,&#xD;
      impaired kidney function or other organ dysfunction that will result in severe toxic effects&#xD;
      of the HSCT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will undergo radical resection of the tumour and standard chemotherapy. About eight&#xD;
      months after surgery, they will undergo conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine&#xD;
      before transplantation of donated hematopoietic stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling&#xD;
      donors. The immunosuppressive treatment, which is given to diminish GVHD, will be tapered&#xD;
      quickly to make sure that the anti-tumour effect is as efficient and as fast as possible.&#xD;
      Further infusion of DLI will be given to increase or maintain anti-tumour effect in the cases&#xD;
      where the graft-versus-host reaction is missing or is very mild. The first DLI will be given&#xD;
      intravenously and the second one will be given in A. hepatica to induce a better local&#xD;
      effect, since metastases to the liver is a very common event. Conditioning and HSCT will be&#xD;
      performed at Centre for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and that is also&#xD;
      where the follow-up of the patients will be performed. The surgical follow-up will be at the&#xD;
      surgical department. Group B will be treated with standard chemotherapy according to current&#xD;
      protocols at the department of oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and laboratory parameters that will be registered are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to relapse, will be controled with CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that have the ability to react with pancreactic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma from the patient as well as cell lines in vitro&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of micrometastases in bone marrow.&#xD;
