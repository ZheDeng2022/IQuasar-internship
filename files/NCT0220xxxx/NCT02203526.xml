  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcome for patients with this diagnosis is significantly worse than for that of&#xD;
           systemic DLBCL. Most treatment approaches in the past have included high dose&#xD;
           methotrexate and radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most PCNSLs appear to be of activated B-cell (ABC) origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and effective for systemic&#xD;
           DLBCL of ABC origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose doing a study in which ibrutinib is combined with a novel chemotherapy&#xD;
           platform called dose adjusted temozolomide, etoposide, doxil, dexamethasone, ibrutinib,&#xD;
           rituximab (TEDDI-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib or the dose that achieves adequate&#xD;
      CSF concentrations, whichever comes first, when ibrutinib is given with TEDDI-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed/refractory PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function (defined in protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase 1 study of 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will have two components.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib&#xD;
                achieves a concentration of less than or equal to 100 nM in the CSF, when given in&#xD;
                combination with TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory or&#xD;
                previously untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib&#xD;
                dose with TEDDI-R in 10 patients. Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.&#xD;

           (TEDDI-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the dose of ibrutinib (not to exceed 840 mg per dose) with voriconazole&#xD;
           anti-fungal prophylaxis that can be safely administered to achieve an ibrutinib median&#xD;
           CSF CMAX of 1.98 nM (Range 0.69 to 11.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Revised in Amendment M (version date: 11/03/2020): To assess the safety, feasibility,&#xD;
           and complete response (CR) rate of the TEDDI-R in untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The study will have three components.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase 1: MTD of ibrutinib will be identified or the dose at which ibrutinib&#xD;
                achieves a concentration of &gt;= 100 nM in the CSF, when given in combination with&#xD;
                TEDDI-R immuno-chemotherapy, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expansion cohort: Safety and tolerability of the regimen in relapsed/refractory&#xD;
                PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at the final ibrutinib dose with TEDDI-R in 10&#xD;
                patients. Secondary objectives will be PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohorts Revised Study DesignA, B and C: Effective with Amendment G (version date:&#xD;
                7/31/2017), 3 new cohorts ibrutinib dose levels (A, B and C) are being added to&#xD;
                provide together with anti-fungal prophylaxis and to determine the dose of&#xD;
                ibrutinib that will be given with voriconazole at steady-state concentrationsmay be&#xD;
                safely given with the chemotherapy platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effective with Amendment M (version date: 11/03/2020), a second expansion cohort of&#xD;
                untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be added: Safety, feasibility, and complete&#xD;
                response rate of the regimen in untreated PCNSL (DLBCL type) will be assessed at&#xD;
                the final ibrutinib dose with TEDDI-R in 15 patients. Secondary objectives will be&#xD;
                PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effective with Amendment 06/04/2021, a new dosing schedule will be tested in up to&#xD;
                10 relapsed or refractory patients and 15 patients with untreated PCNSL. Secondary&#xD;
                objectives will be PFS and OS.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed primary central nervous&#xD;
             system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
             disease are eligible. Patients with PCNSL that is only extracranial will not be&#xD;

             exceptions: patients with ECOG PS = 4 where neurologic deficits are unlikely to&#xD;
             resolve with tumor resolution and may cause clinical management problems are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below, independent of&#xD;
             growth factor or transfusion support. Patients should not receive growth factors or&#xD;
             transfusions for at least 7 days prior to first dose of study drug with the exception&#xD;
             of pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) and darbopoeitin which require at least 14 days&#xD;
             prior to screening and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 750 cells/mcL (0.75 x 10(9)/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000 cells/mcL (50 X 10(9)/L)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to1.5 times ULN (unless Gilbert s syndrome or&#xD;
                  disease infiltration of the liver is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 40 ml/min/1.73m(2) unless lymphoma related.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time/INR (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be&#xD;
             less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN); except if,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, the aPTT is elevated because of a positive Lupus&#xD;
             Anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40% as assessed by echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this trial may be teratogenic, women of non-reproductive potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by&#xD;
             history - no menses for greater than or equal to 1 year; OR history of hysterectomy;&#xD;
             OR history of bilateral tubal ligation; OR history of bilateral oophorectomy). Female&#xD;
             patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients must agree to use highly effective methods of birth control.&#xD;
             A &quot;highly effective method of birth control&quot; is defined as a method that has a low&#xD;
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and&#xD;
             includes implants, injectables, birth control pills with two hormones, some&#xD;
             intrauterine devices (IUDs). Male subject cannot use highly effective methods and are&#xD;
             required to use barrier. The specific guidelines are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women: If you can have children, you must use a highly effective method of birth&#xD;
                  control and a barrier method, or sexual abstinence (which is defined as&#xD;
                  refraining from all aspects of sexual activity), while taking study treatment, as&#xD;
                  well as for 12 months after the last dose of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men: You must use a barrier method while on treatment with ibrutinib and for 3&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of treatment to prevent pregnancy of your partner. You&#xD;
                  should not donate sperm while you are taking the study drug and for 12 months&#xD;
                  after you stop taking the last dose of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or appointed surrogate decision-maker or legally authorized representative&#xD;
             must have ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and willingness to&#xD;
             provide a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) and authorization to use&#xD;
             protected health information (in accordance with national and local subject privacy&#xD;
             regulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to a BTK inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ibrutinib or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are allergic to isavuconazole or any of its ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor or inducer within 7&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of protocol anti-fungal prophylaxis, or patients who&#xD;
             require continuous treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor/inducer (i.e., with the&#xD;
             exception of any medication to be specifically studied in this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients will be excluded because of their increased susceptibility to&#xD;
             fungal infections which outweighs the potential benefit of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or an infection requiring systemic antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Recent infections&#xD;
             requiring systemic treatment need to have completed therapy greater than 14 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Pregnant women are&#xD;
             excluded in this study because ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia or ITP resulting in (or as evidenced by)&#xD;
             declining platelet or Hgb levels within the 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no evidence of active disease&#xD;
                  present for more than 3 years prior to Screening and felt to be at low risk for&#xD;
                  recurrence by treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna melanoma&#xD;
                  without current evidence of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without current evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as&#xD;
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, or history of&#xD;
             myocardial infarction unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;
             function or resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. Those with a negative PCR for&#xD;
             hepatitis B will be treated with antivirals designed to prevent hepatitis B&#xD;
             reactivation (e.g., entecavir) and have monitoring for hepatitis B reactivation with&#xD;
             PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction that, in&#xD;
             the Investigator s opinion, could compromise the patient s safety, or put the study at&#xD;
             undue risk. Patients with suspicious radiologic evidence of aspergillosis infection&#xD;
             (i.e., Chest CT and/or Brain MRI) will not be eligible unless confirmatory laboratory&#xD;
             testing of Beta-D glucan and aspergillus antigen are negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists within the last 7 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy, defined as having not resolved&#xD;
             to grade less than or equal to1, or to the levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
             criteria with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand s disease) or hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 7 days of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
