      Our preclinical studies suggest the capacity of the positron emission tomography imaging&#xD;
      agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium (FBnTP) to detects early-stage small breast&#xD;
      tumors (e.g., DCIS), and differentiates benign from malignant masses with better accuracy&#xD;
      than that obtained by existing breast imaging tools.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most widespread type of cancer among women in the USA, and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of death. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2013, in the USA,&#xD;
      226,870 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,510 women will die of breast&#xD;
      cancer, most of them of progressive metastatic disease. Early detection and treatment of the&#xD;
      disease, when the tumor is still localized and at a high curability state, is the outmost&#xD;
      important determinant of disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Survival rate of&#xD;
      women first diagnosed with pure early-stage noninvasive tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ-&#xD;
      DCIS) is nearly 98%, which drops to 48% in patients with advanced disease.Yet, early&#xD;
      detection of breast cancer is relatively poor. This is best exemplify by the astonishing&#xD;
      percentage of benign biopsies; 80% of 1.7 million biopsies in the USA, at a cost of $3&#xD;
      billion; whereas, only small fraction (~20%) of newly diagnosed women are found to have pure&#xD;
      DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preclinical studies suggest the capacity of the positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      imaging agent 18F-fluorobenzyl triphenyl phosphonium (FBnTP) to detects early-stage small&#xD;
      breast tumors (e.g., DCIS), and differentiates benign from malignant masses with better&#xD;
      accuracy than that obtained by existing breast imaging tools. Accordingly, the present&#xD;
      protocol is designed to extend the preclinical findings into clinical studies in breast&#xD;
      cancer women, and to assess the effectiveness of 18F-FBnTP in detecting breast malignant&#xD;
      lesions, in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigators, would make&#xD;
