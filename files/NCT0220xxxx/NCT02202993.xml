  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study that will assess the safety and determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of mibefradil dihydrochloride, a partially selective T-type calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker, combined with hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) in subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive mibefradil dihydrochloride, which will be dose escalated from 150mg/day&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, or until a dose of 350 mg/day is&#xD;
      reached using a standard 3 + 3 design. Mibefradil dihydrochloride will be dosed orally in 4&#xD;
      divided doses per day for 17 consecutive days to the MTD. The MTD will be determined&#xD;
      according to dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events version 4.0. Radiation therapy (RT) consists of 5 fractions of 600 centigray&#xD;
      (cGy) each, delivered over 2 consecutive weeks for a total dose of 3,000 cGy, using&#xD;
      stereotactic, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the MTD of mibefradil dihydrochloride when&#xD;
      given with concurrent hypofractionated RT. Secondary and tertiary endpoints include&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of mibefradil dihydrochloride and RT in terms of progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to perform translational research on resected&#xD;
      tumor tissue.&#xD;
