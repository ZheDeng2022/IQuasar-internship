      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most important infectious disease in the world. Keys to&#xD;
      successful control of TB is rapid diagnosis, prompt treatment, as well as effective&#xD;
      preventive therapy for contacts with latent TB infection (LTBI). Current methods for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of LTBI are tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA).&#xD;
      For preventive therapy, the recommended regimens include daily isoniazid for 9 months and&#xD;
      daily rifampicin for 4 months. By incorporating long-acting rifapentine, a new regimen&#xD;
      combining weekly rifapentine and high-dose isoniazid for a total of 12 doses has been proven&#xD;
      of equal potency and toxicity. However, the treatment completion rate is much higher in&#xD;
      weekly treatment for 3 months than daily treatment for 9 months. It is reasonable that using&#xD;
      rifapentine-based preventive therapy can markedly increase the completion rate. However,&#xD;
      study is lacking, especially in Asia, the high endemic area of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the effort of all health care workers and public health personnel, the incidence of TB&#xD;
      in Taiwan has gradually declined in recent 10 years. In order to maintain the trend of&#xD;
      decreasing in incidence, preventive therapy for LTBI become more and more important. However,&#xD;
      which is the best preventive regimen for LTBI is still unknown. Therefore, we conduct the&#xD;
      prospective randomized multicenter studies to compare the treatment completion rate of two&#xD;
      regimens in Taiwan. The first regimen is daily isoniazid for 9 months. The second is weekly&#xD;
      rifapentine plus high-dose isoniazid for 3 months.&#xD;

      regimens in Taiwan. The first regimen is daily isoniazid for 9 months. The second is weekly&#xD;
      rifapentine plus high-dose isoniazid for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understanding which of the two preventive regimens has the highest completion rate under&#xD;
           supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understanding the reasons of interruption in preventive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparing the side effect profile of the two preventive regimens in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective multicenter study, we will enroll close contacts aged &gt;=12 with positive&#xD;
      TST. Chest radiography and sputum studies, if necessary, will be performed to exclude active&#xD;
      pulmonary TB. After performing baseline IGRA, participants will be randomized into 2 groups&#xD;
      with different preventive regimens. The first regimen is daily isoniazid for 9 months. The&#xD;
      second is weekly rifapentine plus high-dose isoniazid for 3 months. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      treatment completion rate of the two preventive regimens. The secondary outcome is toxicity.&#xD;
      All participant will be followed for 2 years and screen for the development of active&#xD;
      pulmonary TB by chest radiography and sputum studies if necessary. The reasons for treatment&#xD;
      incompletion will be recorded.&#xD;
