      The investigators aim to test the safety and feasibility of prostate gland stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) plus best systemic therapy in newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators and other investigators have previously documented the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of definitive intent stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the treatment of localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the metastatic setting for multiple malignancies, improved survival rates and disease&#xD;
      outcomes have been shown with definitive treatment of the primary disease site. This concept&#xD;
      of &quot;cytoreductive&quot; surgery or decreasing the primary tumor burden is now considered the&#xD;
      standard of care for metastatic colon, ovarian, renal cell, and some breast carcinomas (plus&#xD;
      post-surgery irradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With new guidelines and declining rates of PSA screening, the incidence of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer is expected to increase. A recent population-based study has&#xD;
      concluded significant improvements in the definitive treatment of the local prostate cancer&#xD;
      in the stage IV setting with either radical prostatectomy or conventional prostate radiation&#xD;
      treatments/brachytherapy. To our knowledge, one prospective phase II trial is currently&#xD;
      accruing patients to best systemic therapy or best systemic therapy (BST) plus definitive&#xD;
      treatment with either radical prostatectomy or conventionally fractionated radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of primary disease SBRT to best systemic&#xD;
      therapy for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer would be associated with an acceptable&#xD;
      safety profile, quality of life, disease progression, and overall survival. The addition of&#xD;
      SBRT to best systemic therapy is also expected to be better-received for stage IV patients&#xD;
      (with relatively limited prognosis), vs. fully fractionated radiation therapy, brachytherapy,&#xD;
      or radical prostatectomy. The above endpoints would initially be tested in a prospective&#xD;
      phase II multi-institutional trial and in comparison with historical controls.&#xD;
