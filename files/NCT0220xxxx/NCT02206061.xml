  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the widespread implementation of a developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate preventive asthma care intervention for urban teens. The School Based Asthma Care&#xD;
      for Teens (SB-ACT) program includes two core components: 1) a trial of directly observed&#xD;
      therapy (DOT) to allow the teen to experience the potential benefits from adhering to&#xD;
      guideline-based asthma treatment, and 2) a developmentally appropriate Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) Counseling Intervention to help the teen transition to independent&#xD;
      long-term medication adherence. The investigators hypothesize that teens receiving the SB-ACT&#xD;
      program will 1) experience less asthma-related morbidity than an asthma education (AE)&#xD;
      attention-control comparison group, and 2) have improved adherence, less urgent healthcare&#xD;
      use, less absenteeism, improved quality of life, and reduced FeNO compared to AE. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that participants receiving DOT-only will have improved&#xD;
      asthma-related outcomes immediately following their DOT trial vs. teens receiving AE, but&#xD;
      will not have sustained, clinically significant improvement in outcomes once the DOT phase is&#xD;
      complete. This represents a unique opportunity to build upon existing community relationships&#xD;
      with an innovative and developmentally focused program to improve asthma outcomes for urban&#xD;
      teens.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is asthma morbidity between groups. The investigators will measure asthma morbidity by looking at the average number of days without asthma symptoms (symptom free days) over 2 weeks, during the post-intervention follow-up assessments (3, 5 and 7 months post baseline).&#xD;
Symptom free days are defined as 24 hour periods of no asthma symptoms including, coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest or shortness of breath.&#xD;
Reported data reflects the number of symptom free days over 2 weeks averaged across 3, 5, and 7 month post-intervention follow-up assessments.</description>

    <description>SB-ACT consists of 2 components: Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) For the first 6-8 weeks, the teen will visit the school nurse to receive a daily dose of preventive asthma medication as directly observed therapy (DOT). The purpose of DOT is to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience potential benefits of consistent preventive therapy.&#xD;
The second component, Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling , will start 4-6 weeks after the start of DOT. A counselor will conduct 3 in-person MI sessions with the teen at school to enhance the teen's motivation to adhere to their asthma treatment plan. The 3 sessions consist of an initial 40 minute counseling session (4-6 weeks after start of DOT), and two 30 minute follow-up sessions 2 and 6 weeks later. This component consists of an evidence-based self-management program to help the teen begin to transition to independence with preventive medication use.</description>

        <title>Average Number of Days Without Asthma Symptoms (Symptom Free Days) During Post-intervention Follow-up Interviews (3, 5 and 7 Months)</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is asthma morbidity between groups. The investigators will measure asthma morbidity by looking at the average number of days without asthma symptoms (symptom free days) over 2 weeks, during the post-intervention follow-up assessments (3, 5 and 7 months post baseline).&#xD;
Symptom free days are defined as 24 hour periods of no asthma symptoms including, coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest or shortness of breath.&#xD;
Reported data reflects the number of symptom free days over 2 weeks averaged across 3, 5, and 7 month post-intervention follow-up assessments.</description>

            <description>SB-ACT consists of 2 components: Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) For the first 6-8 weeks, the teen will visit the school nurse to receive a daily dose of preventive asthma medication as directly observed therapy (DOT). The purpose of DOT is to establish a relationship with the nurse, learn proper medication technique, and experience potential benefits of consistent preventive therapy.&#xD;
The second component, Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling , will start 4-6 weeks after the start of DOT. A counselor will conduct 3 in-person MI sessions with the teen at school to enhance the teen's motivation to adhere to their asthma treatment plan. The 3 sessions consist of an initial 40 minute counseling session (4-6 weeks after start of DOT), and two 30 minute follow-up sessions 2 and 6 weeks later. This component consists of an evidence-based self-management program to help the teen begin to transition to independence with preventive medication use.&#xD;
