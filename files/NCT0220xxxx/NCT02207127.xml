  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a fundamental gap in the investigators ability to design effective surgical&#xD;
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for the 30-40% of patients who cannot tolerate&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment. OSA surgery outcomes vary widely, with the chances of a successful&#xD;
      outcome ranging from 5% to 65% for individual or combination procedures. To predict - and&#xD;
      thereby to improve - outcomes, the investigators must determine what predicts surgical&#xD;
      success. This project will compare findings from two evaluations: drug-induced sleep&#xD;
      endoscopy (DISE) and upper airway magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DISE has demonstrated&#xD;
      important benefits, but it has important limitations. Upper airway MRI is the most complete&#xD;
      evaluation performed during wakefulness, making it conducive to broad application and less&#xD;
      expensive than DISE, but there are no studies utilizing MRI as a surgical evaluation. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a cross-sectional analysis of 40 adult subjects with moderate to severe&#xD;
      OSA. In addition to history, physical examination, and polysomnogram (sleep study), all&#xD;
      subjects will undergo DISE and MRI to characterize the pattern of obstruction. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine the association between DISE and MRI, focusing on specific DISE&#xD;
      findings that have been associated with surgical outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team has substantial expertise and experience in OSA investigation, DISE,&#xD;
      and upper airway MRI.&#xD;
