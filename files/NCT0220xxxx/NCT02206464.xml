      Background:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Flu virus that causes disease in birds can sometimes spread to people. It can cause severe&#xD;
      illness, even death. Vaccines are used to try to create resistance to such infections.&#xD;
      Researchers want to test a new vaccination strategy, combining two different vaccine types,&#xD;
      the H7 DNA Vaccine (DNA vaccine) and H7N9 Monovalent Inactivated Vaccine (MIV), to see if one&#xD;
      of two combinations offer better protection against a certain type of bird flu in humans when&#xD;
      compared to vaccination using two doses of MIV alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if 2 vaccines for bird flu, are safe and tolerable for humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study immune responses to these vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults 18 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened through a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Each group will get a different&#xD;
           combination of vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have about 8 clinic visits. Each visit takes 2 4 hours. Blood will be&#xD;
           drawn at some visits. Urine samples may be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive vaccinations at 2 of the visits, 16 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The H7N9 MIV will be injected in the upper arm using a needle and syringe. The DNA&#xD;
           vaccine will be injected in the upper arm using a device that delivers the vaccine&#xD;
           through the skin by pressure instead of a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soon after each vaccination, participants will get 1 2 phone calls, come to clinic for&#xD;
           evaluation, and complete a diary at home for 1 week. They will record their temperature&#xD;
           and symptoms and look at the injection site daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up blood tests.&#xD;

      VRC 315 STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I Open-Label, Randomized Study of H7 Influenza Prime-Boost Regimens in Healthy&#xD;
      Adults: Recombinant H7 DNA Plasmid Vaccine, VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP, Administered Alone or with&#xD;
      Monovalent Influenza Subunit Virion H7N9 Vaccine (MIV) as Prime with MIV Boost Compared to&#xD;
      MIV Prime with MIV Boost&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccination regimens against H7N9 Influenza. A vaccination&#xD;
      regimen with the VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP (H7 DNA) vaccine administered alone or concurrently in&#xD;
      different arms with A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) (MIV) as prime followed by inactivated MIV boost&#xD;
      will be compared to MIV-MIV prime-boost with a 16 week boost interval. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      is that all the H7 DNA prime-MIV boost, DNA+MIV prime-MIV boost, and MIV-MIV study regimens&#xD;
      will be safe for human administration. A secondary hypothesis is that the H7 DNAMIV regimen&#xD;
      will elicit a greater frequency and/or magnitude of antibody against H7 than the MIV-MIV&#xD;
      regimen. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy adults&#xD;
      of the investigational vaccine regimens. Secondary objectives are related to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the vaccination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP vaccine was developed by VRC, NIAID and is composed&#xD;
      of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid that encodes the H7 hemagglutinin (HA) protein of&#xD;
      A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza, and is supplied in single dose vials at a concentration of 4&#xD;
      mg/mL. H7 DNA vaccinations will be 4 mg administered as a 1 mL intramuscularly (IM) using the&#xD;
      Biojector o 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System (Biojector). The inactivated H7N9&#xD;
      vaccine is monovalent subunit virion vaccine, A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) MIV, manufactured by&#xD;
      Sanofi Pasteur, Inc (Swiftwater, PA), and supplied at 30 mcg/0.5 mL per vial. The H7N9 MIV&#xD;
      vaccinations will be 45 mcg administered as a 0.75 mL IM injection using needle and syringe.&#xD;
      All injections will be in the deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 36 healthy adults, ages 18-60 years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized equally into the three study groups and will receive two&#xD;
      vaccinations as shown in the schema. The protocol requires 7 clinic visits and a telephone&#xD;
      follow-up contact after each study injection. Durability of immune response will be followed&#xD;
      through Study Week 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune responses throughout the study for 12 weeks&#xD;
      following the boost. Duration of time on study will be 28 weeks.&#xD;
