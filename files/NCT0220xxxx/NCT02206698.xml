  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The submitted proposal is designed to reduce morbidity and mortality to injured children.&#xD;
      Significant variability in the initial trauma assessment exists among institutions. The&#xD;
      proposed project is a prospective, observational, multi-institutional study of children&#xD;
      following blunt abdominal trauma. The specific goals of the project are to: 1) Document&#xD;
      history, physical exam findings, imaging, and laboratory values, which are available to&#xD;
      physicians during the initial trauma resuscitation prior to a decision on whether to order an&#xD;
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate for potential intra-abdominal injury; and 2)&#xD;
      Derive and validate a multi-variable clinical prediction rule based on data variables readily&#xD;
      available during the pediatric trauma resuscitation to identify patients at low risk for&#xD;
      intra-abdominal injury, in which unnecessary CT might safely be avoided. Information from&#xD;
      this study could be used to develop a more standardized approach to the evaluation for&#xD;
      intra-abdominal injury following blunt trauma in children. This information could lead to&#xD;
      significant improvement in the early recognition of injury and to improved resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed research project is a prospective, observational study. Data will be collected&#xD;
      from each institution and entered into a secure REDCap database. Two phases of data&#xD;
      collection will occur: 1) patient demographics and specific clinical variables which may be&#xD;
      associated with IAI which are available and recorded during the initial trauma evaluation 2)&#xD;
      laboratory and imaging results available after the initial assessment, identified injuries,&#xD;
      patient disposition, interventions and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variables: 1) Intra-abdominal injury (IAI) (presence of solid or hollow organ&#xD;
      injury (spleen, liver, kidney, GI tract, adrenal, pancreas, intra-abdominal vascular&#xD;
      structure, bladder, ureter, gallbladder, abdominal wall fascia)) 2) IAI requiring&#xD;
      intervention (abdominal operation, angio-embolization, blood transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Course: The initial data collection period will extend for one year. Data will be&#xD;
      recorded in a password protected redcap database which is readily available online to all&#xD;
      participating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: Eleven Level One Pediatric Trauma Centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection points: demographics (age, mechanism, alert level), physical exam, labs (AST,&#xD;
      HCT, amylase, UA, base deficit), FAST, imaging results, injuries, outcomes (admission, ICU&#xD;
      admit, need for intervention, missed injuries, ISS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: De-identified data will be used during the data analysis phase to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of loss of confidentiality to the patients. Data analysis with development of a clinical&#xD;
      prediction rule (CPM) will be performed as follows. A logistic regression will be used to fit&#xD;
      a predictive model for both IAI and IAI requiring interventions. SAS 9.3 will be used for the&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Validation (including sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the&#xD;
      derived CPM would then be performed in a subsequent study using a second population of&#xD;
      patients. Internal validation of the prediction model was assessed by creating a split sample&#xD;
      using a random selection process; half of the sample was used as the initial cohort to&#xD;
      develop the prediction model for estimates of all covariates, and the remaining half was used&#xD;
      as the validation cohort to compare the true to the predicted outcomes. A receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve is created by plotting sensitivity against (1- specificity) for&#xD;
      different cut-off points of the predicted outcome. A bootstrap study of 1000 replications was&#xD;
      performed on the level of sensitivity, specificity and TP/FP/FN/TN validation. Validation&#xD;
      (including sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the derived CPM would then be&#xD;
      performed in a subsequent study using a second population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan: Data quality will be evaluated bi-monthly by a team consisting of the&#xD;
      PI, an expert in clinical prediction models and a statistician. This panel will be able to&#xD;
      review de-identified data from all institutions but will not have access to make any changes&#xD;
      in the data entered in the centralized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or&#xD;
      consistency: Data checks to compare entered registry data against predefined rules for range&#xD;
      and consistency will be performed bi-monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification: Source data collection is the responsibility of each individual&#xD;
      institution. A data analysis team consisting of a statistician and an expert in clinical&#xD;
      prediction models will evaluate the data bi-monthly to look for wide outliers (beyond&#xD;
      pre-defined range) and impossible data values (not clinically possible) and request&#xD;
      clarification from the individual institutions when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable: The vast majority of&#xD;
      the data collection points are discrete variables with no opportunity for &quot;free text&quot; data&#xD;
      entry. Many of these variables are specifically described on the data collection tools. Data&#xD;
      definitions and question from the individual sites are addressed in a frequently updated&#xD;
      Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document which is sent out to the sites bi-monthly following&#xD;
      data verification review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities: The&#xD;
      database is established through a secure Vanderbilt Redcap web-based site. Individual site&#xD;
      data collection will be analyzed and reviewed bi-monthly with feedback to each of the sites&#xD;
      if data inconsistencies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,&#xD;
      unavailable, &quot;non-reported,&quot; cannot be interpreted, or considered missing because of data&#xD;
      inconsistency or out-of-range results: Critical data which are missing, unavailable or not&#xD;
      reported will not be utilized for the development of the blunt abdominal trauma clinical&#xD;
      prediction model (BAT CPM). The investigators will attempt clarification for out of range&#xD;
      results prior to data analysis. Variables which are available and reported in less than 50%&#xD;
      of the patients will likely be excluded from the CPM because they will not form the basis of&#xD;
      a practicable risk stratification model. The developed CPM will require validation in a&#xD;
      second un-related population prior to widespread application of the CPM.&#xD;
