      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of bortezomib, in association with&#xD;
      steroids, plasma exchange, and polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins, in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic antibody mediated rejection due to donor specific anti-HLA antibodies, in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is considered as a main cause of late&#xD;
      allograft losses in kidney transplant recipients. It is due to the occurrence of de novo&#xD;
      donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA), i.e. antibodies synthetized by the recipient after&#xD;
      transplantation against its transplant. There is currently to efficient treatment. The&#xD;
      purpose of our study is to determine the efficacy of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic active antibody-mediated rejection, in association with steroids,&#xD;
      plasma exchanges, and polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins. Patients are recipients of a&#xD;
      first or a second kidney transplant for more than 3 months. They display de novo DSA i.e. DSA&#xD;
      not detected the day of transplantation and in pre-transplant sera.. They display signs of&#xD;
      chronic active AMR on kidney biopsy i.e. a glomerulitis (g) + peritubular capillaritis (ptc)&#xD;
      Banff score g+ptc ≥ 2, with or without severe chronic glomerulopathy (Banff score cg&lt;3).&#xD;
      Kidney biopsy may have been performed systematically or because of: :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. detection of de novo DSA ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. and /or proteinuria (&gt; 0.5 g/24h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. and /or slow graft dysfunction protocol biopsy Primary endpoint is a combined endpoint&#xD;
           one year after inclusion, consisting of the stabilization of histological lesions on a&#xD;
           new kidney biopsy (delta g+ptc ≤1 and delta cg &lt; 1) and a decrease in DSA mean&#xD;
           fluorescence intensity &gt; 50%.&#xD;
