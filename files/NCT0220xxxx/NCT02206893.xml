      Introduction Chronic disease is prevalent and costly in the U.S. (Tu &amp; Cohen, 2009). Poor&#xD;
      eating habit is one factor that account for risk of chronic disease (Arsand, Varmedal, &amp;&#xD;
      Hartvigsen, 2007). Smartphone technology has been promising to improve preventive health&#xD;
      outcomes. However, its great potential has not been widely applied to people's eating&#xD;
      behaviors and its impact is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional and peer supports can improve health status (Elkjaer et al., 2010; Lorig et al.,&#xD;
      1999; Perri, Sears, &amp; Clark, 1993). However, the former is usually delivered didactically or&#xD;
      passively with limited use of smartphones. There is also little evidence of the effect of&#xD;
      peer support delivered by smartphones in the domain of healthy eating. This research aims to&#xD;
      study what smartphone technology can do to upgrade professional and peer supports, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of these mobile-app enabled supports on people's behavior of healthy&#xD;
      eating and user engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Social Cognitive Theory, we hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mobile-enabled self-monitoring approach improves users' healthy eating behaviors through&#xD;
           improved self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Professional support improves users' healthy eating behaviors through improved&#xD;
           self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peer support improves users' healthy eating behaviors through improved self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The amount of support is positively correlated with the change in behaviors and their&#xD;
           determinants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment Design The hypotheses will be examined bya 4-month randomized field experiment.&#xD;
      375 subjects will be recruited and assigned to one of the five arms to receive the&#xD;
      corresponding tool for diet management at no cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: a mobile App with both professional and peer support Arm 2: a mobile App with peer&#xD;
      support only Arm 3: a mobile App with professional support only Arm 4: a mobile App without&#xD;
      any support Arm 5: a non-mobile web App In addition to the App usage data, five surveys are&#xD;
      conducted at baseline and the end of each month. Respondents will be compensated by $8 and a&#xD;
      chance to win $200 for each completed survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All subjects receive the following interventions: an education package includes the&#xD;
           importance of healthy eating, concept of MyPlate, personalized daily food plans;&#xD;
           reminders throughout the study; goal setting capabilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-monitoring provided by an Android App: a heuristic approach inspired by MyPlate to&#xD;
           record their food consumption which allows users to record their meals by images and&#xD;
           doesn't require estimations in cups and ounces; daily reports and trend reports&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-monitoring provided by the web App: a traditional approach to record their food&#xD;
           consumption which requires estimations in cups and ounces, and no images are allowed; no&#xD;
           daily reports and trend reports are provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Professional support provided by a registered dietitian via the Android App: the&#xD;
           supports include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Reply to users' messages regarding healthy eating&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Provide meal-specific comments on subjects' meal consumptions: one meal per week&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Provide feedback on the subjects' consumption patterns: once per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Peer support provided by other subjects via the Android App: the App provides platforms&#xD;
           for subjects who have the same interest to communicate to each other. The actions the&#xD;
           subjects can do in the platforms include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Post images or texts related to healthy eating&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Share meals with their ratings&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Like/dislike others' posts&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Comment on others' posts e Create groups which allow subjects who have the same&#xD;
                interest to join&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dependent Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Eating behavior: a score of healthiness of a meal will be assigned by a dietitian.&#xD;
                The scores obtained by the same subject along the experiment compose the subject's&#xD;
                eating behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Engaging behavior: this is measured by the number of meals recorded by the subject&#xD;
                in a week. The numbers for the same subject along the experiment compose the&#xD;
                subject's engaging behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Independent Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Level of peer support: this will be measured by a score representing the number of&#xD;
                posts, likes, and comments received and given by a subject in a week&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Level of professional support: this will be measured by a score representing the&#xD;
                number of messages or comments exchanged with the dietitian in a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mediator Variables: self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and impediments will be measured&#xD;
           by survey instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. User Survey: characteristics and perceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mobile App: time, location, and contents of goal setting, meal entries, communications&#xD;
           with professionals and peers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Web App: contents of goal setting and meal entries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Confirmatory factor analysis and statistical modeling such as structural equation&#xD;
      modeling and mixed models will be conducted to test our hypotheses.&#xD;

    <description>This will be measured by a score representing the healthiness of each selected meal, evaluated by dietitians. Specifically, the score is composed of three sub-scores: 1) portion of fruits and vegetables (7-point Likert scale); 2) portion of the entire meal (7-point Likert scale); 3) evaluators confidence level (4-point Likert scale). One subject will get one score per week, and hence 16 scores in 4-months.</description>
