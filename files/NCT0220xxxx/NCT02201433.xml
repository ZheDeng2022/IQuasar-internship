  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is recommended for preterm infants. Development of breastfeeding is an&#xD;
      important issue, requiring the involvement of medical and paramedical staff in neonatal&#xD;
      units. There are few data concerning the fathers of preterm infants. However, the role of the&#xD;
      father is identified in the literature as a key factor in the initiation and continuation of&#xD;
      breastfeeding. In our neonatal unit care, reasons for breastfeeding high rates are not&#xD;
      identified but may be related to the father being in close and constant contact with the&#xD;
      medical and paramedical staff. In fact, fathers are often first in contact with caregivers.&#xD;
      They can be invested in the implementation of nursing care, skin to skin, as well as being&#xD;
      asked to support the development of their child in the service and at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the beliefs, social representations and the experience of the fathers of&#xD;
           premature infants hospitalized in intensive care unit concerning breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the factors facilitating and inhibiting the initiation and continuation of&#xD;
           breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consider strategies of care and support that can be used for the families of premature&#xD;
           infants and of children born at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the expectations of medical staff with regards to the management of children and&#xD;
           families, their practices, identify the role attributed to the father.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initiate and facilitate reflexivity of medical and paramedical staff about their&#xD;
           respective practices&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in three phases according to the methodology of qualitative&#xD;
      research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first for the preparation of interview guides and observation grids through the&#xD;
           inclusion of 20 participants: caregivers and members of associations of preterm parents,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second part: maintenance by the inclusion of 40 fathers of children born preterm&#xD;
           before 37 weeks and their partner if she wants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third part will, as in any qualitative analysis, data validation with the inclusion&#xD;
           of 20 participants: fathers who experienced this situation in the context of care and&#xD;
           caregivers close to neonatal intensive unit care (NICU) are participants in the first&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      interview methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 exploratory interview two hours on average with each part 1 and part 3 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-5 interviews per part 2 participant. Interviews are conduct with guideline constructed&#xD;
           during the first part of the study. Interview will be conducted by a nurse and /or a&#xD;
           psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full transcript of the interviews. Partial treatment during the study to enrich the interview&#xD;
      guide until data saturation. All data will be treated differently: Software-aided thematic&#xD;
      treatment (NVivo) and textual processing with cross medical data and socio-demographic&#xD;
      variables (Alceste).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Validation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of the study external validation. Literature validation&#xD;
