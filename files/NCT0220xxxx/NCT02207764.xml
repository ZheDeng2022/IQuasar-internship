  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test whether a complementary intervention, Reiki therapy, can&#xD;
      provide added benefits to the standard patient care. Reiki is method for stress reduction&#xD;
      that uses hand positions over and/or on the body to help people relax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are studying the effect of a 15-minute Reiki application compared to an intervention of&#xD;
      nursing presence without Reiki. We hope to find if Reiki can assist in relieving stress, and&#xD;
      improving patient outcomes. In the future we would like to offer complementary interventions&#xD;
      as an adjunct to our standard care for patients.&#xD;

      This pilot study is designed to test if a complementary therapy, Reiki, has an effect on&#xD;
      physiological and subjective measures of stress. This is a 2-arm randomized pilot study of&#xD;
      the use of Reiki therapy prior to a stressful event with a convenience sample of 40&#xD;
      participants who are newly diagnosed hematologic malignancy patients on the inpatient service&#xD;
      who will experience bone marrow aspirate post induction chemotherapy. Reiki therapy is a&#xD;
      non-invasive complementary therapy that can be used in addition to the standard of care. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a 15-minute Reiki session and the control group will receive&#xD;
      15 minutes of nursing presence. Each study arm includes a brief item questionnaire to rank&#xD;
      subjective measures of pain, anxiety, and energy; saliva biological markers related to&#xD;
      stress-reduction; and measures of blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a 15-minute intervention performed on the inpatient unit&#xD;
      prior to the bone marrow aspirate procedure. Data will be collected from patients both before&#xD;
      and after the intervention and before and after the bone marrow aspirate. We will collect&#xD;
      saliva samples from the control group and baseline data including subjective measures of&#xD;
      pain, anxiety and energy and measures of blood pressure, heart rate, and respirations. The&#xD;
      study nurse will maintain presence in the control participant's room for 15-minutes after the&#xD;
      initial measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research hypothesis is that there will be a change in the response to one or more&#xD;
      parameters of physiological or subjective measures for those patients receiving a Reiki&#xD;
      intervention when compared to those receiving standard of care plus the nurse presence in&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is there will be no difference in response between the groups.&#xD;
