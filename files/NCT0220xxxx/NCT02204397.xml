  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A proof-of-concept for safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of a combined regimen of&#xD;
      INGAP-P for β-cell regeneration and ustekinumab for IL-12-23 autoimmune modulation in&#xD;
      patients with established T1DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) daily administration of INGAP-P (600 mg SC once a day in three separate&#xD;
      injection sites) with ustekinumab (two single injections of 45 mg SC, one as pretreatment two&#xD;
      weeks before INGAP-P treatment begins and the second one after 2 weeks of INGAP-P treatment)&#xD;
      in adult patients with established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Safety will be evaluated&#xD;
      by assessing local tolerability, recording incidence of hypoglycemia, performing safety&#xD;
      laboratory measures at frequent intervals, and following subjects very closely for any&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of&#xD;
      INGAP-P and ustekinumab in adult patients with established T1DM, specifically by change from&#xD;
      baseline to Week 12 in: 1) Maximal C-peptide (Cmax) during mixed meal test (MMT) and glucagon&#xD;
      stimulated test (GST); 2) C-peptide release (AUC) during MMT and GST; 3) Fasting C-peptide;&#xD;
      4) Fasting glucose (before breakfast and after at least 8 hours of fasting); 5) Longer term&#xD;
      glycemic control as reflected by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol&#xD;
      (1,5-AG); and, 6) Total daily insulin dose relative to body weight.&#xD;
