    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Maximum Angular Tremor Amplitude of the Wrist (Injected Limb)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>No primary efficacy variables are defined for this study. One of the secondary outcome measures is used for CTgov protocol registration and results reporting purposes only. TremorTek is a tremor kinematic analytics investigational device which is used to measure maximum angular tremor amplitude at wrist of the injected limb (unit: degrees). Angular tremor amplitude is the measure of tremor severity. Reduction of angular tremor amplitude at wrist of the injected limb represents tremor improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Maximum Log-transformed Accelerometric Tremor Amplitude at Wrist Level (Injected Limb)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TremorTek is a tremor kinematic analytics investigational device which is used to measure maximum log-transformed accelerometric tremor amplitude at wrist level of the injected limb (unit: meter per square second [m/s˄2]). Log-transformed accelerometric tremor amplitude is a measure of tremor severity reflecting the non-vectoral intensity of tremor. Reduction of log-transformed accelerometric tremor amplitude at wrist level of the injected limb represents a tremor improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) Tremor Score in Injected Limb (Item 5 [Right Upper Extremity] or 6 [Left Upper Extremity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The FTM tremor rating scale is used for evaluation of tremor severity and function and consists of three parts (A, B, C). For this outcome measure the score of FTM scale item 5 (&quot;right upper extremity&quot;) or item 6 (&quot;left upper extremity&quot;) is used (both items are from part A). The outcome values are calculated as the sum of the three functions &quot;at rest&quot;, &quot;with posture holding&quot;, and &quot;with action and intention&quot;. The score for each item ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe), that is, the possible values range from 0 to 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in FTM Motor Performance Score (Items 11-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The FTM tremor rating scale was used for evaluation of tremor severity and function. This investigator-assessed scale consists of 3 parts (A, B and C). Part A: Tremor location/Severity rating (items 1-10); Part B: Specific motor tasks / Function rating (items 11-15). Ratings for five motor tasks (handwriting, drawing [large/small spiral, line], and pouring); and Part C: Functional disabilities resulting from tremor/activities of daily living (items 16-23). For this outcome measure, the sum of the five FTM motor performance items (from Part B) were used: item 11 ('handwriting for dominant hand only' - irrespective of its injection or non-injection), items 12 to 15 ('drawing large and small spiral', 'line drawing', 'pouring' for the injected upper limb). The score for each item ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Possible values range for total FTM motor performance score: 0-20.</description>

    <measure>Participant's Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The GICS was used to measure the participant's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, with the following values: +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse).</description>

                  fluctuate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First onset of essential tremor at least 6 months before screening with stability of&#xD;
             the tremor symptoms over 4 weeks and in the opinion of the investigator definite&#xD;
             diagnosis of essential tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate-to-marked upper-limb postural and/or kinetic tremor at wrist level,&#xD;
             corresponding to Fahn-Tolosa-Marin upper-limb tremor rating of at least 2 categories&#xD;

             kinematic assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tremor deemed by the investigator to require a treatment with 30 - 200 U NT 201 for a&#xD;
             treatment of up to three joints of the selected upper limb (wrist treatment&#xD;
             mandatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable concomitant anti-tremor medication and no clinically relevant findings in&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in FTM Motor Performance Score (Items 11-15)</title>
        <description>The FTM tremor rating scale was used for evaluation of tremor severity and function. This investigator-assessed scale consists of 3 parts (A, B and C). Part A: Tremor location/Severity rating (items 1-10); Part B: Specific motor tasks / Function rating (items 11-15). Ratings for five motor tasks (handwriting, drawing [large/small spiral, line], and pouring); and Part C: Functional disabilities resulting from tremor/activities of daily living (items 16-23). For this outcome measure, the sum of the five FTM motor performance items (from Part B) were used: item 11 ('handwriting for dominant hand only' - irrespective of its injection or non-injection), items 12 to 15 ('drawing large and small spiral', 'line drawing', 'pouring' for the injected upper limb). The score for each item ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Possible values range for total FTM motor performance score: 0-20.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in FTM Motor Performance Score (Items 11-15)</title>
          <description>The FTM tremor rating scale was used for evaluation of tremor severity and function. This investigator-assessed scale consists of 3 parts (A, B and C). Part A: Tremor location/Severity rating (items 1-10); Part B: Specific motor tasks / Function rating (items 11-15). Ratings for five motor tasks (handwriting, drawing [large/small spiral, line], and pouring); and Part C: Functional disabilities resulting from tremor/activities of daily living (items 16-23). For this outcome measure, the sum of the five FTM motor performance items (from Part B) were used: item 11 ('handwriting for dominant hand only' - irrespective of its injection or non-injection), items 12 to 15 ('drawing large and small spiral', 'line drawing', 'pouring' for the injected upper limb). The score for each item ranges from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Possible values range for total FTM motor performance score: 0-20.</description>
