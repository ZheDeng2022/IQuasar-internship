  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and anti-tumour activity of an&#xD;
      experimental drug BI 836845 taken together with the prostate cancer drug, enzalutamide,&#xD;
      compared to enzalutamide given alone, in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients&#xD;
      that have previously been treated and failed on docetaxel and abiraterone treatments.&#xD;
      Initially, a tolerability and safety phase (phase Ib escalation) will be performed to confirm&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended doses of both BI 836845 and enzalutamide&#xD;
      that can be taken together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD, or recommended phase II dose, have been determined an expansion cohort will&#xD;
      also be explored (phase Ib expansion) in CRPC patients already taking enzalutamide and have a&#xD;
      rise in prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels. Patients may not have received prior docetaxel&#xD;
      or abiraterone. Patients in this cohort will receive the MTD, or recommended phase II dose,&#xD;
      of BI 836845 and enzalutamide determined in the phase Ib escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised trial (phase II) will be an open label, parallel group study design in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to which patients will receive either BI 836845 plus enzalutamide (Arm A) at the&#xD;
      MTD/recommended doses, or enzalutamide alone (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all parts of the trial safety, anti-tumour activity will be assessed, in addition to&#xD;
      circulating tumour cells (CTC), prostate serum antigen (PSA) response and progression, and&#xD;
      determination of Overall Survival (OS).&#xD;
