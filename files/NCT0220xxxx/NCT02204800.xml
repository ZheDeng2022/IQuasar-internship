  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active surveillance in kidney cancer involves closely observing the tumor with periodic&#xD;
      imaging studies rather than immediately proceeding to an invasive treatment. This does not&#xD;
      mean that the tumor is ignored or that future treatment is not necessary, rather it means the&#xD;
      tumor does not require treatment at this time. On active surveillance, a tumor is closely&#xD;
      monitored without treatment, however if the tumor changes and reaches a predefined threshold&#xD;
      that your physician no longer considers safe, your physician will strongly encourage&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      While some patients with small kidney tumors may require eventual treatment, most do not.&#xD;
      Therefore, the American Urologic Association considers active surveillance an acceptable&#xD;
      treatment strategy. This protocol is a prospective study of active surveillance for small&#xD;
      clear cell kidney tumors (the most common type of kidney tumor) and is designed to identify&#xD;
      if there are predictive markers that may help identify which patients are unlikely to require&#xD;
      surgical treatment. Predictive markers are measurable characteristics that may predict the&#xD;
      future behavior of a tumor. There are currently no available predictive markers that can help&#xD;
      identify which tumors are not destined to require treatment. Such a marker may be useful to&#xD;
      increase the use of active surveillance by informing patients with small renal tumors that&#xD;
      immediate treatment may be considered overtreatment.&#xD;
