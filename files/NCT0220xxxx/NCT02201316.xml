  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of two candidate formulations of&#xD;
      mosapride citrate 5mg tablets compared the reference product GASMOTIN (mosapride citrate 5mg)&#xD;
      from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Company in healthy adult subjects. This will be an open-label,&#xD;
      randomised, single dose, three-way crossover, six sequence study. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      single oral dose separated by at least 7 days and no greater than 14 days washout period.&#xD;
      This study is required to select a candidate mosapride citrate (GR107719B) formulation for&#xD;
      further development and provide data to allow the design of a future pivotal bioequivalence&#xD;
      study. The candidate formulations will be compared with the innovator GASMOTIN. GASMOTIN is a&#xD;
      trademark of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Company.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing&#xD;
             the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)&#xD;
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside&#xD;
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required agree and&#xD;
             document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19 - 24.9 kg/m^2&#xD;
             (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for&#xD;
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's&#xD;
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a&#xD;
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40&#xD;
             milli-international units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per&#xD;
             mililiter (pg/mL) [&lt;147 picomole per liter] is confirmatory]. Females on hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to&#xD;
             use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method;&#xD;

             one of the contraception methods listed in protocol for an appropriate period of time&#xD;
             (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to&#xD;
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree&#xD;
             to use contraception until the follow-up contact visit; OR has only same-sex partners,&#xD;
             when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods listed in Protocol. This criterion must be followed from the&#xD;
             time of the first dose of study medication until the follow-up contact visit.&#xD;
