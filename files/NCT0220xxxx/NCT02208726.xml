  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased levels of stress and anxiety are experienced by many students. Stress can have a&#xD;
      negative influence on academic outcome and performance, as well as on the student's mental&#xD;
      health. Conventional treatment options for anxiety include counseling, as well as anxiolytics&#xD;
      and antidepressants, which may have various adverse effects. Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum&#xD;
      acidum are homeopathic remedies that may be helpful in alleviating anxiety in students;&#xD;
      however there has been no research done to date to show their efficacy for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum acidum&#xD;
      Homaccord on perceived levels of anxiety in university students, by means of the&#xD;
      State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory and Anxiety Symptom Score Card.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted over a&#xD;
      two-week period at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Health Clinic, Doornfontein Campus.&#xD;
      Thirty university students, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited into the study by&#xD;
      means of advertisements placed on the campus with relevant permission given. Participants&#xD;
      will attend an initial consultation and will be requested to sign a Participant Information&#xD;
      and Consent form, complete the Participant Information Sheet, and a Remedy Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire to determine inclusion into the study. Participants' vital signs will be&#xD;
      measured. Participants will then receive a 16ml vial of either the Picricum acidum and&#xD;
      Phosphoricum acidum Homaccord pillules, or a placebo (unmedicated sucrose pillules), which&#xD;
      will be randomized and dispensed by the UJ Homeopathic Dispenser. Participants will be&#xD;
      requested to take 5 pillules in a daily dose for 14 days, commencing 21 days before and&#xD;
      ceasing 7 days prior to the start of examinations. The State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI)&#xD;
      and the Anxiety Symptom Score Card will be completed 21 days prior to the first academic&#xD;
      examination, as well as on the last day of taking the medication. Data will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed by Statkon, using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed ranks test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this research may show that the Homeopathic Picricum acidum and Phosphoricum&#xD;
      acidum Homaccord has a positive effect in alleviating anxiety in university students,&#xD;
      allowing for further studies in the field.&#xD;
