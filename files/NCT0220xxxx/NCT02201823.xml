      Ability Pharmaceuticals promotes a clinical trial to determine the adequate dose of a new&#xD;
      drug, ABTL0812, that will be administered orally daily to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib, unicenter, open-label and single-agent study. This study consists of&#xD;
      two different parts, a dose escalation phase and an extension phase in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABTL0812 will be administered orally, daily, for 28 days (considered cycle 1). First endpoint&#xD;
      is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). MTD is defined as the highest dose at which&#xD;
      no more than one in six patients experiences a ABTL0812 related Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
      DLT will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation phase will be performed with an accelerated design of 3 + 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the 28 days cycle has finished, patients may continue receiving ABTL0812 on a daily&#xD;
      continuous schedule if the patient is deemed to have clinical benefit from treatment,&#xD;
      according to the treating physician. Treatment will continue until disease progression, onset&#xD;
      of unacceptable drug toxicities, or patient/physician's request to discontinue.&#xD;
