    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of topiramate monotherapy compared with&#xD;
      levetiracetam another standard antiepileptic drug (AED), as monotherapy for new-onset or&#xD;
      recent-onset epilepsy (seizure disorder) on pediatric growth and maturation, bone&#xD;
      mineralization, and kidney stone formation in children aged 2 to 15 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label,&#xD;
      multi-centric (conducted in more than one center) and 2-arm flexible-dose monotherapy study&#xD;
      of topiramate compared with 1 another AED (levetiracetam) in pediatric participants with&#xD;
      epilepsy. The total study duration will be up to of 1 year and 2 months per participant. The&#xD;
      study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, up to 35 days before study commences on Day&#xD;
      1); Treatment (1 year) and post-treatment (30 days). Safety will primarily be evaluated by&#xD;
      percentage of participants with kidney stones and change from baseline in bone mineral&#xD;
      density at Month 12.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weight Z-score up to Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations (SD) a participant has from the population normal values. The body weight z-scores were designed to take into account the amount of weight gain that was expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. Body weight data were converted to Z-scores using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) programs provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the calculation of the 2000 CDC growth charts. The mean (SD) change in Z scores from baseline up to Month 1 for the total safety population for all age cohorts combined were presented. A negative Z-score indicates values lower than the mean while a positive Z-score indicates values higher than the mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weight Z-score up to Month 1</title>
        <description>The Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations (SD) a participant has from the population normal values. The body weight z-scores were designed to take into account the amount of weight gain that was expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. Body weight data were converted to Z-scores using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) programs provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the calculation of the 2000 CDC growth charts. The mean (SD) change in Z scores from baseline up to Month 1 for the total safety population for all age cohorts combined were presented. A negative Z-score indicates values lower than the mean while a positive Z-score indicates values higher than the mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weight Z-score up to Month 12</title>
        <description>The Z-Score indicates how many SD a participant has from the population normal values. The body weight z-scores were designed to take into account the amount of weight gain that was expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. Body weight data were converted to Z-scores using the SAS programs provided by the CDC for the calculation of the 2000 CDC growth charts. The mean (SD) change in Z scores from baseline to Month 12 for the total safety population for all age cohorts combined were presented. A negative Z-score indicates values lower than the mean while a positive Z-score indicates values higher than the mean.</description>

        <description>Z-Score was a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard. It described whether a mean was above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, &gt;0 a greater mean, and &lt;0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by CDC growth charts.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study, a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to futility of enrollment, the enrollment was stopped early; however, all enrolled participants completed the full course of the trial excluding 7 participants (reasons captured in &quot;participant flow&quot;). Also, there was no exposure to topiramate in 2 to 5 years age cohort. Therefore, no conclusions can be made with regard to this age group due to the absence of comparability.</limitations_and_caveats>
