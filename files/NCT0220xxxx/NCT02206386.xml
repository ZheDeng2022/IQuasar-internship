  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify effective implementation strategies that can efficiently promote the use of&#xD;
      evidence-based practices (EBP) across a large number of geographically dispersed, independent&#xD;
      Home Health Agencies (HHAs). This study will use an agency-randomized design to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a web-based implementation strategy (MHTraining-Net) on the use of an&#xD;
      evidence-based practice for geriatric depression by home healthcare agencies. The EBP is&#xD;
      known as the Depression CARE for PATients at Home (CAREPATH) Intervention. The effectiveness&#xD;
      of MHTraining-Net will be measured by an agency's adherence to the Depression CAREPATH&#xD;
      protocol with its depressed patients and changes in their patients' depressive symptoms over&#xD;
      the episode of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MHTraining-Net uses a web-based platform and several long distance tools (e.g., e-learning&#xD;
      modules, telephone or web consultation, telephone calls, toolkits, and discussion boards) to&#xD;
      deliver four types of implementation activities: infrastructure development, training and&#xD;
      education, quality improvement, and social networking. MHTraining-Net was developed to ensure&#xD;
      that the Depression CAREPATH (CARE for PATients at Home), specifically, and evidence-based&#xD;
      practices, generally, can be implemented widely and successfully across independent&#xD;
      organizations within a sector of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: The effectiveness of MHTraining-Net on the implementation of the Depression&#xD;
      CAREPATH will be tested in an agency-randomized trial of 160 HHAs. All HHAs are clients of&#xD;
      Brightree (formerly CareAnyware, Inc), a software company that offers web-based point-of-care&#xD;
      clinical management and administrative support for HHA nationwide. HHA clinicians record&#xD;
      relevant data that is transmitted directly to Brightree for clinical and administrative&#xD;
      purposes, including quality improvement initiatives. As part of each HHA's contract with&#xD;
      Brightree is permission for using these data for performance enhancement research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brightree has already programmed Cornell's Depression CAREPATH, a depression care management&#xD;
      protocol, into its clinical management system so that all nurses use the protocol. To promote&#xD;
      the use of the protocol, Brightree has posted two relevant videos (archived Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 training web seminar training); demonstration of how to navigate the protocol&#xD;
      within the software) on its user education website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brightree will randomize HHAs to either MHTraining-Net, (N=100) or to Enhanced Support&#xD;
      (N=60). Enhanced Support will have access to only the two training videos until the end of&#xD;
      the study when they will be invited to MHTraining-Net. These procedures represent Brightree's&#xD;
      typical &quot;roll-out&quot; approach on introducing new training and products to their client HHAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test its hypotheses using three sets of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Summary statistics describing the size and type of the 160 HHAs as well as their average&#xD;
           nurse productivity over the 12 months preceding and following the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routinely collected administrative data on patients age &gt;65 who screen positive for&#xD;
           depression over one year, including Medicare-mandated assessments, medication lists,&#xD;
           transaction files, indicators of whether the depression care management protocol was&#xD;
           used, and Medicare case-mix adjustment and reimbursement indicators. We are using to&#xD;
           term 'patients' to refer to a full episode of patient care, defined from the&#xD;
           Start-of-Care date to Discharge, recognizing that a small proportion of unique&#xD;
           individuals may have more than one full episode of care. We will not be able to identify&#xD;
           such individuals. These data will be aggregated at the patient level in preparation for&#xD;
           performance enhancement analyses using Brightree's routine procedures. Brightree will&#xD;
           code the data, remove identifiers, and transmit them to Weill Cornell on a regular basis&#xD;
           using the Weill Cornell ITS Department secure servers and protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agency-level data on the use of the MHTraining-Net website (e.g., summary reports on&#xD;
           'hits' of each webpage) and agency-initiated contacts (telephone, email) through records&#xD;
           maintained by Cornell project staff.&#xD;
