  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of first relapse at 12 months between&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with cyclic exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) (at least 100% daily&#xD;
      calories) and maintenance therapy with supplementary enteral nutritional support (25% daily&#xD;
      calories).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition (EN) is a highly efficacious treatment option for Crohn's disease (CD). In&#xD;
      children, exclusive EN is considered first choice therapy to induce remission in pediatric&#xD;
      CD, as highlighted in the recent ESPGHAN-ECCO guidelines. Several meta-analyses showed that&#xD;
      the anti-inflammatory potential of EEN is comparable to the effects of steroids. In addition,&#xD;
      children with CD often have marked growth retardation and EEN is one of the most efficacious&#xD;
      treatment options to induce catch-up growth in these patients. There is convincing data&#xD;
      indicating that EN is highly efficacious when given on an exclusive basis, while the use of&#xD;
      partial EN is markedly less effective to induce remission in active Crohn's disease as&#xD;
      compared to exclusive EN. Recently, it was suggested that exclusive EN has a dominant effect&#xD;
      on the intestinal microbiota, which contributes to the induction of remission. There exists&#xD;
      several strategies to maintain remission in children with CD, but there is no clear consensus&#xD;
      on which maintenance treatment to follow. There are some indicators to believe that enteral&#xD;
      nutritional therapy might play also a significant role as maintenance therapy for CD. Given&#xD;
      the fact that many centers use a top-down approach with the introduction of immunosuppressors&#xD;
      and/or biologics at/or shortly after diagnosis, the investigators wanted to test the&#xD;
      possibility of a treatment option to efficiently maintain remission with less (or no) side&#xD;
      effects based on enteral nutrition to avoid the early use of immunosuppressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a French multicenter, prospective, randomized study with PROBE (prospective randomized&#xD;
      open blind end-point) evaluation. Randomization will be performed in a blinded and&#xD;
      centralized manner, allocating patients to one of the two treatment groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARM A : Cyclic exclusive MODULEN IBD for 2 weeks every 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARM B: MODULEN IBD supplementation (25% of caloric requirements) alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Physician not involved in the study design and blinded to the treatment arm will perform&#xD;
      the evaluation of the patients during each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of four visits (including final visit) are scheduled for this trial over a period of&#xD;
      12 months at a rhythm of every three months (+/- 2 weeks) for all patients. The study visit&#xD;
      will happen during scheduled routine visits, necessary for the routine care of CD patients.&#xD;
      Each visit comprises a routine clinical evaluation. The assessment of maintenance of&#xD;
      remission is particularly important (wPCDAI&lt;12.5 points), a routine lab analysis including&#xD;
      fecal calprotectin is required at each visit. In addition, all relevant medical or other&#xD;
      events will be recorded. Only for patients who participate in the annex studies an additional&#xD;
      stool sample (microbial analysis) is required. At M9 visit, follow-up endoscopy (M12+/-&#xD;
      6weeks) and entero-MRI (M12+/- 6 weeks) will be programmed as part of the routine&#xD;
      surveillance of patients on maintenance therapy, allowing to adjust treatment in the&#xD;
      following if necessary. Compliance to treatment will be monitored by recordings of daily&#xD;
      MODULEN IBD intake during 2 week periods on the E-system. A quality of life E-questionnaire&#xD;
      will be filled out one day prior to each visit.&#xD;
