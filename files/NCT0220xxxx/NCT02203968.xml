  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is the leading cause of death in people 44 years of age or younger. After major&#xD;
      trauma, such as following high-speed motor vehicle collision, bleeding coupled with clotting&#xD;
      defects is responsible for most of deaths in the first hours of hospital admission. Of note,&#xD;
      these bleeding-related deaths are potentially preventable. Accordingly, the initial&#xD;
      in-hospital management of severely injured patients focuses on stopping bleeding, replacing&#xD;
      blood loss and correcting clotting defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, animal and human research demonstrated that one of the major clotting defects&#xD;
      following injury and bleeding is the drop in blood levels of fibrinogen (a clotting factor),&#xD;
      which is detected on hospital admission in severely injured patients. These low fibrinogen&#xD;
      levels are associated with increased blood transfusion and death. However, in North America,&#xD;
      the standard of care for replacing low fibrinogen requires the use of cryoprecipitate, which&#xD;
      is a frozen blood product with long preparation time, and similarly to other blood products,&#xD;
      carries the risk of viral transmission and transfusion complications. Alternately, many&#xD;
      Europeans countries where cryoprecipitate has been withdrawn from the market due to safety&#xD;
      concerns, use fibrinogen concentrate. Fibrinogen concentrate undergoes pathogen inactivation,&#xD;
      which is a process to eliminate the risk of transmitting viruses, bacteria and parasites, is&#xD;
      likely a safer and faster alternative to cryoprecipitate. In Canada, fibrinogen concentrate&#xD;
      is licensed for congenital low fibrinogen only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although preliminary data suggest that fibrinogen supplementation in trauma is associated&#xD;
      with reduced bleeding, blood transfusion, and death, the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      early fibrinogen replacement remains unknown. We proposed to conduct a feasibility randomized&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the use of early fibrinogen concentrate against placebo in injured patients&#xD;
      at our trauma centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot trial is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly preparing, delivering,&#xD;
      and infusing fibrinogen concentrate as an early therapy to prevent excessive bleeding in&#xD;
      trauma. This feasibility trial will provide preliminary safety and clinical outcome data to&#xD;
      inform the design of larger trials; which ultimately aims to prevent bleeding-related deaths&#xD;
      in the trauma population.&#xD;

    <description>Fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP™) is a freeze-dried lyophilised plasma product presented in powdered form. The powder is reconstituted with water for intravenous injection at a concentration of 20 mg fibrinogen per ml. The concentrate is formulated with human albumin, L-arginine, sodium citrate and sodium chloride. RiaSTAP™ is supplied as a purified lyophilisate in a 1g dosage form and is reconstituted in 50 ml of sterile water. The final volume of RiaSTAP™ to be infused in this study will therefore be 300 ml.</description>
