  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about the safety of injecting the gene&#xD;
      (DNA) for mammaglobin-A into people with breast cancer. The DNA used in this study was&#xD;
      purified from bacteria and contains the gene for mammaglobin-A. Mammaglobin-A is a protein&#xD;
      that is highly expressed by breast cancer cells. Injection of mammaglobin-A DNA may be a way&#xD;
      to generate an immune response to breast cancer cells. There is evidence that an immune&#xD;
      response may be a way to fight cancer. In addition to evaluating the safety of the&#xD;
      mammaglobin-A injection, this study is also looking at the immune response that the&#xD;
      participant's body has after each injection.&#xD;

               -  Investigational agent Note that subjects who do not respond initially to&#xD;
                  endocrine therapy may receive chemotherapy and remain on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any other investigational agent(s) or has received an investigational agent&#xD;
             within the last 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior axillary lymph node sampling (sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node&#xD;
             dissection). FNA or core needle biopsy of axillary lymph node is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or currently active autoimmune disease requiring management with&#xD;
             immunosuppression. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;

             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or&#xD;
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;

             7 days before study entry, and patients must be willing to employ adequate&#xD;
             contraception. Women of childbearing potential must use two forms of contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential&#xD;
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a strong likelihood of non-adherence such as difficulties in adhering to&#xD;
             follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the Siteman Cancer Center should&#xD;
             not knowingly be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals in whom a skinfold measurement of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
             for the eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm&#xD;

             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably&#xD;
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or&#xD;
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, EKG, and/or laboratory screening test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding&#xD;
             a single febrile seizure as a child&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Syncopal episode within 12 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any electronic stimulation device, such as cardiac demand pacemakers,&#xD;
