  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to explore the molecular phenotypic changes in&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer by histopathological,immunohistochemical and molecular&#xD;
      analysis of cancer related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer.After patient&#xD;
      eligibility is determined, tumor tissue will be acquired from archival or transurethral&#xD;
      resection or from re-biopsy specimens from patients with recurrence, visceral metastasis,&#xD;
      bone metastases. According to the molecular phenotypic changes, personalized treatment were&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. The tumor specimens at diagnosis of prostate cancer&#xD;
      should be needed for all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessing for the prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and the tumor molecular&#xD;
      phenotypic features,participants will be separated into different treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants with &quot;AR dependent&quot; CRPC (generally with high PSA level and/or high AR&#xD;
           expression) and with druggable gene mutations will receive Docetaxel/prednisone+Target&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants with &quot;AR dependent&quot; CRPC (generally with high PSA level and/or high AR&#xD;
           expression) and without druggable gene mutations will receive Docetaxel/ Prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants with &quot;AR independent&quot; CRPC (generally without AR expression and/or rapid&#xD;
           progression with low PSA level) and with druggable gene mutations will receive&#xD;
           Cisplatin/Etoposide+Target drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants with &quot;AR independent&quot; CRPC (generally without AR expression and/or rapid&#xD;
           progression with low PSA level) and without druggable gene mutations will receive&#xD;
           Cisplatin/Etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with druggable gene mutations will receive the corresponding molecular targeted&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation will receive a drug&#xD;
      called Gefitinib, which inhibits a protein called EGFR that is thought to be a key factor in&#xD;
      the development and progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) gene mutations will receive a drug called&#xD;
      Vemurafenib, which inhibits a protein called mitogen-activated or extracellular&#xD;
      signal-regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK) that is thought to be a key factor in the&#xD;
      development and progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1) gene mutations will&#xD;
      receive a drug called Celecoxib, which inhibits a protein called v-akt murine thymoma viral&#xD;
      oncogene homologue (AKT) that is thought to be a key factor in the development and&#xD;
      progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) gene mutation&#xD;
      will receive a drug called lapatinib, which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key&#xD;
      factors in the development and progression of some cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PDGFRA gene mutations will receive a drug called sunitinib, which inhibits&#xD;
      some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the development and progression of some&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PIK3CA gene mutations will receive a drug called Everolimus, which inhibits&#xD;
      a protein called AKT that is thought to be a key factor in the development and progression of&#xD;
      some cancers.&#xD;
