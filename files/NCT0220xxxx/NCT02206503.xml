      This study evaluates the efficacy of the addiction of Cyclophosphamide to Revlimid-low dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma patients, who experienced a&#xD;
      biochemical progression, without CRAB, during Rd treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase II multicenter, open label study designed to determine whether the&#xD;
      addiction of Cyclophosphamide to Rd (CRd) treatment significantly increases response rates&#xD;
      and prolonged the outcome (PFS, OS) in patients who experienced a biochemical relapse,&#xD;
      without CRAB under Rd treatment. Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3&#xD;
      study periods: pre-treatment, treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-treatment period includes: screening visits, performed at study entry. After&#xD;
      providing written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      for study eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria&#xD;
      described above. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period includes: administration of the combination CRd for 9 cycles. In order&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment, patients will attend the study center visits&#xD;
      at least every 2 weeks. The response will be assessed after each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed progression disease (PD), all patients&#xD;
      are to be followed for survival every 1-3 months via telephone or office visit.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma who experienced biochemical&#xD;
             progression, without CRAB, during treatment with Rd. CRAB means the presence of organ&#xD;
             damage, multiple myeloma related (renal impairment and/or anemia and/or new bone&#xD;
             lesions and/or hypercalcemia). It is sufficient one of the previous signs for defining&#xD;
             the presence of CRAB. Biochemical progression means: positivization of serum/urine&#xD;
             immunofixation for patients who reached a complete remission with Rd treatment or at&#xD;
             least 25% increment of monoclonal component in serum/urine for patients who reached at&#xD;
             least a stable disease (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient exposed to previous therapy included Lenalidomide, Thalidomide, Bortezomib&#xD;
             and/or autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and in treatment with Rd.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or, if at&#xD;
             childbearing potential, must: understand that the study medication could have an&#xD;
             expected teratogenic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without&#xD;
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy&#xD;
             (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy,&#xD;
             even if she has amenorrhea. This applies unless the subject commits to absolute and&#xD;
             continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are effective methods&#xD;
             of contraception*:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implant**&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)**&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tubal sterilisation&#xD;

               -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined&#xD;
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of&#xD;
             venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  **prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly&#xD;
             in patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25&#xD;
             mills International Units on milliliter (mIU/ml) not more than 3 days before the start&#xD;
             of study medication once the subject has been on effective contraception for at least&#xD;
             4 weeks. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice&#xD;
             complete and continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks&#xD;
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.&#xD;
             These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next&#xD;
             treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who&#xD;
             practice complete and continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  â  A female subject or a female partner of a male subject is considered to have&#xD;
             childbearing potential unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             â¥50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for â¥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer&#xD;
             therapy does not rule out childbearing potential), premature ovarian failure confirmed&#xD;

                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of&#xD;
                  study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one&#xD;
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused&#xD;
                  study drug to the investigator.&#xD;
