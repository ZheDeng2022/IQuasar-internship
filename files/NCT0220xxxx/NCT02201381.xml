    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a regimen of selected&#xD;
      metabolic treatments for patients with cancer in a real world setting and to conduct&#xD;
      exploratory analysis on the relationship between the degree of response and changes in&#xD;
      biochemical markers (such as glucose and lipid levels).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      *This study has been designed to collect data prospectively and to retrospectively analyse&#xD;
      data on the metabolic treatments within the cancer clinic. The retrospective study is&#xD;
      ongoing, while the prospective study has not yet started.*&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a real world study since this gives the best opportunity to properly examine the&#xD;
      effect of multi-drug regimens in representative populations. Including a standard of care arm&#xD;
      is inappropriate, in a population in which that standard of care has already been shown to be&#xD;
      ineffective or intolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be sent to the study clinic directly by their Health Care Professionals&#xD;
      (&quot;HCP's&quot;) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a pre-screening visit to determine eligibility for inclusion into&#xD;
      the study, an initiation visit and then a follow up visit every three months thereafter. If&#xD;
      required, unscheduled visits may take place. Day 0 (baseline) for each patient will be the&#xD;
      initiation visit when study treatment is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting any study-related procedures, subjects will provide written informed&#xD;
      consent, eligibility will be assessed, a medical history and past medical records will be&#xD;
      taken and vital signs will be measured. These records will include the stage of their&#xD;
      disease, response to previous cancer therapy, their prior and current medications and any&#xD;
      specific regimen they are currently on for their cancer. If prior medical records do not&#xD;
      contain sufficient information to determine a baseline for the patient, additional blood&#xD;
      tests and scans will be undertaken as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored quarterly thereafter when blood tests (e.g. safety parameters,&#xD;
      glucose, cholesterol, immune response and cancer markers where applicable) and scans (where&#xD;
      applicable) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be on the same drug regimen (see below) at the same doses throughout the&#xD;
      study. All patients will be followed up until they choose to leave the study, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all patients recruited to the study will be analysed using an Intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (ITT) philosophy, so data will be included in the primary analysis irrespective of whether&#xD;
      the dose regimen was followed throughout the study. If appropriate, and numbers allow,&#xD;
      analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol population, comprising those patients who&#xD;
      adhere to the regimen as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis methods will be used to estimate the Overall survival associated with the&#xD;
      study regimen for each type of cancer. These estimates will be interpreted in the light of&#xD;
      data obtained from the literature, and from eliciting expert opinion. Bayesian methods may be&#xD;
      used where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour response, where applicable, will be summarised in tables and graphs. Estimates of&#xD;
      response rates will be presented for each cancer type with confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between changes in biochemistry values (glucose, lipids) and efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes (Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and HRQoL) will be&#xD;
      investigated graphically, or using other methods as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further exploratory analysis to investigate the effects of other factors such as age , ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds , cancer stage, and response to prior therapy, will also be conducted in order to&#xD;
      try and characterise the profile of patients most likely to benefit from the study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of patients on the regimen and those who do not stay on the regimen, for&#xD;
      whatever reason, will be summarised to see whether there is any observed bias. If&#xD;
      appropriate, methods will be used to adjust for any observed bias, for example using&#xD;
      propensity scores. OS can then be assessed adjusted for this to try and mitigate for any&#xD;
      possible risk of bias which can occur in uncontrolled studies. Furthermore, by enrolling all&#xD;
      eligible patients over a specified time frame, it is hoped that the risk of bias should be&#xD;
      further reduced. In addition, a large number of patients are expected to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
