      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T-cell&#xD;
      immunotherapy in treating patients with malignant glioma that has come back (recurrent) or&#xD;
      has not responded to therapy (refractory). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can&#xD;
      recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body. T cells are taken from the patient's blood and&#xD;
      a modified gene is placed into them in the laboratory and this may help them recognize and&#xD;
      kill glioma cells. Genetically modified T-cells may also help the body build an immune&#xD;
      response against the tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded&#xD;
      autologous memory-enriched T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating&#xD;
      (SIN) lentiviral vector to express an interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13R alpha&#xD;
      2)-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), as well as&#xD;
      a truncated human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) for participants with&#xD;
      recurrent/refractory malignant glioma in one of the following ways: stratum 1 (intratumoral&#xD;
      delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ central memory T cells [Tcm]) (IL13R alpha&#xD;
      2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes),&#xD;
      stratum 2 (intracavitary delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm, stratum 3&#xD;
      (intraventricular delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm), stratum 4 (dual&#xD;
      delivery [both intratumoral and intraventricular] of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tcm),&#xD;
      or stratum 5 (dual delivery of IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ naive and memory T cells&#xD;
      [Tn/mem]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended phase II dosing plan&#xD;
      (RP2D) for each stratum based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the full toxicity&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the timing and extent of brain inflammation, as assessed by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), following T cell administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe cytokine levels (cyst fluid, peripheral blood) over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of three CAR+ T cell doses IIIa.&#xD;
      Estimate the six month progression free survival rate. IIIb. Estimate disease response rates.&#xD;
      IIIc. Estimate median overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In research participants who receive intraventricular infusions after progressing&#xD;
      following intratumoral/intracranial infusions (stratum 1 or 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Estimate disease response. IVb. Describe CAR T cell and endogenous immune populations,&#xD;
      as well as cytokine and microenvironment profiles (cerebral spinal fluid [CSF], cyst fluid,&#xD;
      peripheral blood) considering post progression therapy(ies), if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. In research participants who receive at least one dose of CAR+ T cells estimate the mean&#xD;
      change from baseline in quality of life using the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and EORTC QLQ brain&#xD;
      neoplasm (BN)-20 survey scale, domain and item scores during and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. For research participants who undergo a second resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor micro-environment and the location of&#xD;
      the CAR T cells with respect to the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate IL13R alpha 2 antigen expression levels pre and post CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 5 strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM I (Intratumoral delivery) CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 03/02/2018: Patients receive IL13R alpha&#xD;
      2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes&#xD;
      via intratumoral catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week&#xD;
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients remain eligible&#xD;
      and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or intratumoral&#xD;
      administration may move to intraventricular catheter for the optional infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM II (Intracavitary delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific,&#xD;
      hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via&#xD;
      intracavitary catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week later,&#xD;
      patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to remain&#xD;
      eligible and there is product available. Patients who progress on intracavitary or&#xD;
      intratumoral administration may move to intraventricular catheter for the optional infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM III (Intraventricular delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific,&#xD;
      hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via&#xD;
      intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week&#xD;
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to&#xD;
      remain eligible and there is product available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM IV (Dual delivery): Patients receive IL13R alpha 2-specific, hinge-optimized,&#xD;
      41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes via intratumoral catheter and&#xD;
      intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Beginning as early as 1 week&#xD;
      later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long as patients continue to&#xD;
      remain eligible and there is product available. Based on clinical response after the first 3&#xD;
      infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to continue with the optional&#xD;
      infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring injections at both sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM V (Dual delivery): Patients receive IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ Tn/mem via&#xD;
      intratumoral catheter and intraventricular catheter over 5 minutes weekly for 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Beginning as early as 1 week later, patients may receive additional T cell infusions as long&#xD;
      as patients continue to remain eligible and there is product available. Based on clinical&#xD;
      response after the first 3 infusions, the study principal investigator may decide to continue&#xD;
      with the optional infusions at either one or both sites (instead of requiring injections at&#xD;
      both sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12&#xD;
      months, and then yearly for 15 years.&#xD;
