    <measure>Changes in Motor Function (Jebsen-Taylor Task)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test: measures hand function in real-life activities, by evaluating the time required to perform 7 different tasks. We used the non-constrained hand for the assessments. The sum of the different tasks was used for the analysis.&#xD;
Calculation details: value at 9 months minus value at baseline, change in seconds (adjusted mean difference).</description>

    <measure>Changes in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. We used the upper limb motor function subscale: minimum values= 0 ; maximum values= 66. Higher scores mean a better outcome. Changes from baseline to 90 days (value at 90 days minus value at baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Cortical Excitability Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure cortical excitability using single-pulsed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after stimulation at three different time-points. Changes from baseline to 90 days (value at 90 days minus value at baseline).</description>

        <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. We used the upper limb motor function subscale: minimum values= 0 ; maximum values= 66. Higher scores mean a better outcome. Changes from baseline to 90 days (value at 90 days minus value at baseline).</description>
