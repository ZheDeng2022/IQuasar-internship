  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      experience reduced perception of respiratory resistive loads versus healthy adults in the&#xD;
      same age group. Further, the study will determine whether people with PD and trouble&#xD;
      swallowing experience even more reduction of their perception of a respiratory resistive&#xD;
      load.&#xD;

      Experimental design and procedures: This prospective experimental study will be completed in&#xD;
      one study visit taking between 1 and 3 hours. Verbal and written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by qualified members of the investigative team. Following informed consent, all&#xD;
      participants will complete a health history questionnaire to assess inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. For patients with PD the consenting investigator will review the electronic medical&#xD;
      record to ensure inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental protocol will consist of 1.) Baseline pulmonary function measures, 2.)&#xD;
      Baseline measures of depression and apathy, 3.) Presentation of resistive inspiratory loads&#xD;
      via respiratory equipment, and 4.) Rating the perceived magnitude of respiratory sensations&#xD;
      as measured on a modified Borg scale (ranging from 6 - no breathing difficulty - to 20 -&#xD;
      maximal difficulty). For patients with PD only, the investigators will also review results of&#xD;
      the rehabilitation barium swallow study performed as part of their standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Pulmonary function measures: The forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1) of&#xD;
      a forced vital capacity (FVC) exhalation will be measured for each participant. Maximum&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure (PiMax) will be measured with a manometer. The PiMax test will be&#xD;
      repeated until 3 measurements within 10% variation are obtained, with at least 1 minute rest&#xD;
      between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline depression and apathy: There is a significant impact for emotion on respiratory&#xD;
      perceptual ratings. As such, we will measure baseline depression and apathy scores using 2&#xD;
      validated scales, the Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Marin Apathy Index (MAI). These are not&#xD;
      outcome measures, but will be used to determine exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should depression (17 or greater on BDI) be detected in a participant, that participant will&#xD;
      be provided with contact information for the University of Florida (UF) psychiatry and&#xD;
      psychology clinic and encouraged to seek further evaluation. In the case severe depression is&#xD;
      detected (31 or greater on BDI) the participant will not continue with the study, and will be&#xD;
      provided with contact information for the UF psychiatry and psychology clinic and encouraged&#xD;
      to seek further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory resistive load presentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be seated in a chair, separated from the investigator and experimental&#xD;
      apparatus. The participant will be instructed to &quot;relax and breathe&quot; through a facemask&#xD;
      connected to a non-rebreathing valve in line with a differential pressure transducer. The&#xD;
      inspiratory port of the valve will be connected to the resistive loading manifold. The&#xD;
      manifold consists of 5 differential resistors ranging from 5 - 40 centimeters/water (cmH2O)&#xD;
      of resistive pressure, separated by stoppered ports, as well as a no load condition. The load&#xD;
      is applied by removing the stop for an entire inspiratory breath, and then replacing the port&#xD;
      to continue resting tidal breathing. The pressure transducer will provide measures of mouth&#xD;
      pressure and airflow, which will be digitized and recorded to a desk top computer using&#xD;
      LabChart software. Following each loaded breath, the participant will provide an estimate of&#xD;
      the perceived difficulty of breathing using a modified Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be familiarized with the loads in a practice session prior to initiating&#xD;
      the experimental protocol. During the experimental session, participants will listen to music&#xD;
      of their choice in order to mask experimental sounds. The resistive loads will be applied in&#xD;
      a randomized block design, with each loaded breath separated by at least three unloaded&#xD;
      breaths. Two blocks will be completed with each load presented between 3 and 5 times within&#xD;
      each block. Therefore, there will be a total of between 15 and 25 loaded breaths (3-5 loads x&#xD;
      5 presentations) per block. Participants will be instructed that when they see a small light&#xD;
      flash briefly on the table in front of them (which they will be familiarized with prior to&#xD;
      beginning the experiment) a resistive load will be applied to the next breath. Following the&#xD;
      loaded breath, the participant will be asked to estimate the perceived difficulty of&#xD;
      breathing on the Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation barium swallow study: Participants with PD who are referred for a&#xD;
      rehabilitation barium swallowing evaluation will be recruited for this study. Therefore, the&#xD;
      swallowing evaluation is part of the normal clinical care of the patients and may vary based&#xD;
      on the clinical necessity as judged by the treating speech-language pathologist. Generally,&#xD;
      the standard clinical evaluation protocol consists of multiple swallows of thin liquid&#xD;
      barium, pudding-thick barium, and a cracker or cookie coated with barium. For the purposes of&#xD;
      this study, the researchers will review the most recently recorded swallow study and identify&#xD;
      the worst observed penetration-aspiration (PA) score (ranging from 1-8, where 1 is no&#xD;
      penetration or aspiration, and 8 is silent aspiration). The PA score will be recorded in&#xD;
      order to determine whether the participant has trouble swallowing (scores of 3-8) or not&#xD;
      (scores of 1 and 2).&#xD;
