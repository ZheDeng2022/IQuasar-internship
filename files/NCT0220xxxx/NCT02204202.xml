      The purpose of this research study is to gain understanding of the basic responses of the&#xD;
      lungs to inflammation and specifically if there may be a better way to detect graft&#xD;
      inflammation using non-invasive methods as well as to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment regimens in preventing acute rejection in lung transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a potential way we can&#xD;
      measure lung inflammation. FDG-PET imaging is a clinically accepted and FDA-approved method&#xD;
      that is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of cancer. PET is a machine that&#xD;
      detects radiation and generates pictures using a donut shaped scanner similar in appearance&#xD;
      to an x-ray &quot;CAT&quot; computerized axial tomography or computed tomography (CT) scan. FDG stands&#xD;
      for [18F] (flourine 18) fluorodeoxyglucose, a radiolabeled sugar that is used to identify&#xD;
      areas of inflammation with the PET scanner. A CT scan takes a picture of what the lungs and&#xD;
      airways look like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells are the primary cause of acute rejection of lung transplants. Because T cells must&#xD;
      divide in order to be activated and cause rejection, imaging them while they are dividing is&#xD;
      another way that we can determine whether acute rejection is occurring. A new PET tracer&#xD;
      called [18F]ISO-1 (18F-labeled Ïƒ2-receptor ligand for PET,&#xD;
      N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,-4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-5-methylbe&#xD;
      nzamide (18F-3c), binds to dividing cells. Therefore, [18F]ISO-1 may help us measure acute&#xD;
      rejection more accurately. [18F]ISO-1 is an investigational drug.&#xD;

        Any patient within 7 months of double-lung transplantation and who is scheduled for&#xD;
        bronchoscopy with biopsy will be eligible. Patients will be identified via the bronchoscopy&#xD;
        schedule through the Lung Transplant Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital / Washington&#xD;
        University School of Medicine and approached for potential participation prior to their&#xD;
        scheduled bronchoscopy. PET/CT imaging with [18F]FDG will be performed, if consented, no&#xD;
        more than 3 days after results from the biopsy are reported. [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT imaging will&#xD;
        be performed the day after [18F]FDG PET and can be performed after treatment for acute&#xD;
        rejection has been initiated. We intend to image 30 lung transplant recipients with no&#xD;
        evidence of rejection (grade A0) and 30 recipients with mild to moderate (grades A2-3)&#xD;
        rejection.&#xD;
