      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of different carbon-dioxide concentrations&#xD;
      on cerebral CO2 sensitivity and the resistance and stiffness of systemic arteries during&#xD;
      anesthesia with target-controlled infusion anesthesia using intravenous propofol. Propofol is&#xD;
      a widely and commonly used intravenous anaesthetic, that is mainly used for the induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia and the maintenance of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the velocity of cerebral blood flow and arterial stiffness due to the different&#xD;
      exhaled carbon-dioxide concentrations will allow us to conclude how propofol affects these&#xD;
      parameters during the course of the narcosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasound device called transcranial doppler (TCD) is used to measure the velocity of&#xD;
      blood flow within a main artery located inside the skull.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tonometry device named SphygmoCor is used to assess the pressure wave proceeding in the&#xD;
      radial artery, from which the stiffness of the systemic vessels can be concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Examinations with the ultrasound and tonometry devices are carried out once before the&#xD;
      operation, three times during the intervention, with different exhaled CO2 values and once&#xD;
      after the operation is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Propofol alters cerebral carbon-dioxide sensitivity and the stiffness of systemic arteries&#xD;
      during TCI anaesthesia.&#xD;

      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The study is conducted in four stages: in the first stage, measurements are performed&#xD;
      preoperatively in awake patients. Patients are placed in supine position and mean arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, oxygen saturation are measured. The transcranial doppler&#xD;
      (TCD) probe is fixed in place by applying a headband to maintain a constant angle of&#xD;
      insonation. Mean blood flow velocity (MBFV) and pulsatility index (PI) in the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery (MCA) are obtained. MCA is insonated through the right temporal window by using pulsed&#xD;
      2 megahertz TCD ultrasound probe. Identification of the MCA is confirmed by using standard&#xD;
      criteria, at a depth of 45-55 mm. Cerebral CO2 vasoreactivity is calculated as the percentage&#xD;
      change in MBFV or PI for mmHg change in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SphygmoCor is placed on the left radial artery to obtain data about the central aortic blood&#xD;
      pressure, augmentation pressure (AP) and augmentation index normalised to a 75 beat per&#xD;
      minute heart rate (Alx75). From the derived aortic pulse, calculations can be made, using the&#xD;
      area under the systolic and diastolic part of the curve, to determine the heart's ratio of&#xD;
      oxygen supply and demand, it is called the subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the premedication each patient receives 100 mg diclofenac per os 30 minutes and&#xD;
      500 ml Lactated-Ringer infusion 60 minutes prior to the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia is induced and maintained with target-controlled infusion anesthesia (TCI) using&#xD;
      intravenous propofol at 4 mcg/ml constant plasma concentration. Analgesia is provided by&#xD;
      using 2 ug/kg sufentanyl bolus dose at the time of induction. Afterwards 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium&#xD;
      is given for muscle paralysis and subsequently patients were intubated with a suitable&#xD;
      intratracheal tube. After induction of anaesthesia, the patients are placed on a mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation system, using a volume-controlled setting with an air and oxygen mixture set to&#xD;
      0.4 fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) , the fresh gas flow rate to 2 l/min. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the depth of anesthesia could influence cerebral activity, thereby cerebral&#xD;
      metabolism and blood flow. Bispectral index is placed onto every patient in order to assure&#xD;
      constant depth of anaesthesia during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second series of TCD and SphygmoCor measurements are performed 20 minutes after the&#xD;
      respiratory rate is set to maintain end-tidal CO2 at 40 mmHg in order to allow sufficient&#xD;
      time for equilibrium to be reached and the effect of drugs used for the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia to be terminated. Subsequently the examinations are repeated twice again at 35 and&#xD;
      30 mmHg ETCO2. The measurements were carried out 5-5 minutes after adjusting the minute&#xD;
      ventilation to reach target ETCO2 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Comparisons between the preoperative and three intraoperative stages of the study are made&#xD;
      using repeated measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc correction. The relationship&#xD;
      between MBFV, PI and ETCO2 is assessed using linear regression, while the connection between&#xD;
      SEVR, pulse and Alx75 is calculated with bivariate correlation.&#xD;
