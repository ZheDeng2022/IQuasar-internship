    <textblock>
      Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War who developed Gulf War Illness are being studied. Treatments&#xD;
      with FDA approved generic drugs are being administered to see if they help with the symptoms&#xD;
      of Gulf War Illness, such as chronic fatigue; difficulty with memory, concentration, and&#xD;
      thinking; widespread chronic pain; and autonimic dysfunction. Drugs to be tested are&#xD;
      dextromethorphan and naltrexone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gulf war veterans' illnesses comprise distinct clusters of symptom-defined illnesses for&#xD;
      which there are neither diagnostic tests nor effective treatments. Gulf war veterans had&#xD;
      variable exposures to a number of chemicals, including organophosphate insecticides,&#xD;
      pyrethrum-related insecticides, DEET, Pyridostigmine bromide, smoke from oil well fires, and&#xD;
      Sarin gas. Gulf war veterans' illnesses may reflect an inflammatory cycle involving the brain&#xD;
      which may be a common mechanism of many neurological conditions, whether initiated by toxic&#xD;
      exposures, infection, or trauma. In this theory, central nervous system inflammation&#xD;
      initiated by toxic exposures and sometimes exacerbated by subsequent exposures is a component&#xD;
      of illness hypothesized to explain the neurological manifestations. Substance P release at&#xD;
      sensory nerve endings is an explanation for the peripheral pain manifestations of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This theory suggests that novel anti-inflammatory drugs may be of benefit in symptom-defined&#xD;
      illnesses related to a cycle of inflammation. Dr. J. S. Hong's laboratory at the National&#xD;
      Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has demonstrated that Morphine-related analogs,&#xD;
      including Naltrexone and Dextromethorphan, have great potency in anti-inflammation and&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects. Naltrexone is a safe and readily available generic medication.&#xD;
      Dextromethorphan is also a safe and readily available generic medication that is available&#xD;
      without a prescription as a cough medication. Results from several clinical trials showed&#xD;
      that Naltrexone is effective in several inflammation-related diseases, such as neurogenic&#xD;
      pain, movement disorders, etc. In addition, there were no obvious side effects in patients&#xD;
      taking this drug for six months. This project will conduct randomized double-blinded studies&#xD;
      for treating ill Gulf war veterans with Naltrexone and Dextromethorphan. Laboratory tests for&#xD;
      markers of inflammation including neurogenic inflammation will be performed pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment, to see if these markers are elevated and if so, to see if treatment modulates&#xD;
      these markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ill Gulf veterans will be recruited through the media, veterans groups, and individual&#xD;
      veteran activists. A screening telephone interview will be performed to determine if the&#xD;
      veterans meet a modified Kansas case definition for inclusion. Those veterans who meet study&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to participate. Eligible veterans will be invited for an initial&#xD;
      visit that will consist of obtaining written informed consent, a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and laboratory testing. Institutional review board approval of the study will be&#xD;
      in place. The pharmacy staff at the institution will prepare the medications and placebo in&#xD;
      identical capsules.&#xD;
