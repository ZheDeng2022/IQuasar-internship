  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Integra® TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System (TRS) is a semi-constrained total shoulder&#xD;
      construct. When used under the conditions and purposes intended the TRS will relieve pain and&#xD;
      restore some functional joint motion to the affected shoulder. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the short, mid and long term outcomes of the TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System.&#xD;
