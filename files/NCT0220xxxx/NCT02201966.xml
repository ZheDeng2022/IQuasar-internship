    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common condition in children who perform gymnastics. Commonly, the injury&#xD;
      is not the result of a specific injury, but is a stress injury to the lumbar spine. Regional&#xD;
      interdependence is a theory that suggests when adjacent joints and muscles are not working&#xD;
      properly increased stress is placed on a particular joint. This theory would suggest that if&#xD;
      a patient did not have enough hip extension to perform a back bend increased motion would&#xD;
      occur in the lumbar spine allowing the gymnast to complete the technique. Currently, no&#xD;
      research links impairments in other joints to low back pain in gymnasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross sectional study assessing the relationship between gymnast with back pain and&#xD;
      flexibility and strength of the shoulder and hip joints. Investigators will travel to a local&#xD;
      gymnastics training centers and assess the gymnasts' strength and flexibility of the the hips&#xD;
      and shoulders. The gymnast will also fill our a questionnaire assessing if they have had back&#xD;
      pain in the past month and how much has it limited their ability to participate in&#xD;
      gymnastics. Investigators will be blinded to the results of this survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research study is to see if there are any link between strength and&#xD;
      flexibility of the hips, and shoulders and gymnasts with low back pain. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that gymnasts who demonstrates impairments in strength and flexibility of the&#xD;
      hips, or shoulders will be more likely to have complaints of low back pain.&#xD;

      Female gymnasts will fill out a survey prior having their strength and flexibility tested.&#xD;
      The investigators will be blinded to the results of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionaire asked the gymnasts several questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Years in Gymnastics&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At what level did you last compete?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. On average how many hours per week do you participate in gymnastics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have you had any back pain in the past month that has affected your ability to&#xD;
           participate in gymnastics?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If you answered yes to the last question: please rate your ability to participate in&#xD;
           gymnastics with back pain?(0 represents unable to perform gymnastics and 100 represents&#xD;
           no difficulty participating in gymnastics&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the gymnast complete the survey the investigators will assess the flexibility and&#xD;
      strength of their shoulder and hip muscles. Investigators will be blinded to survey results.&#xD;
      Evaluation measures will be performed in a randomized manner. Subjects will randomly perform&#xD;
      shoulder or hip testing first (determined by flip of coin). Flexibility and strength testing&#xD;
      will also be determined randomly (determined by flip of coin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Flexibility Passive Motion test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to shoulder flexibility testing, the gymnast's arm length is measured from the tip&#xD;
           of the acromion process to a ½ inch wooden dowel grasped by both hands while holding&#xD;
           their shoulders flexed to 90 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For testing, the gymnast lies prone on a firm floor with their chin and nose touching&#xD;
           the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both arms are held parallel to the body with the shoulders flexed to 180 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast grasps the ½ inch dowel with and overhand grip and the tips of her thumbs&#xD;
           are touching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluator maximally flexes the gymnasts shoulders while maintaining wrist in neutral&#xD;
           position, elbows extended and their nose and chin in contact with the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the gymnast's arms are raised to maximum height, the distance from the dowel, where&#xD;
           the thumbs are touching, to the floor is measured and recorded to the nearest ½&#xD;
           centimeter using a rigid measuring stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Shoulder flexibility Passive Motion test raw score is calculated my dividing the&#xD;
           dowel height attained by the length of the gymnast's arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Flexibility Active Motion test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to shoulder flexibility testing, the gymnast's arm length is measured from the tip&#xD;
           of the acromion process to a ½ inch wooden dowel grasped by both hands while holding&#xD;
           their shoulders flexed to 90 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For testing, the gymnast lies prone on a firm floor with their chin and nose touching&#xD;
           the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both arms are held parallel to the body with the shoulders flexed to 180 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast grasps the ½ inch dowel with and overhand grip and the tips of her thumbs&#xD;
           are touching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast is asked to maximally flex their shoulders while maintaining wrist in&#xD;
           neutral position, elbows extended and their nose and chin in contact with the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the gymnast has raised their arms to the maximum height, the distance from the&#xD;
           dowel, where the thumbs are touching, to the floor is measured and recorded to the&#xD;
           nearest ½ centimeter using a rigid measuring stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Shoulder flexibility test raw score is calculated my dividing the dowel height&#xD;
           attained by the length of the gymnast's arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Extension Flexibility test (Thomas test):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to hip extension flexibility testing, the gymnast lays flat on the examination&#xD;
           table with legs extended. The examiner places the digital inclinometer on the anterior&#xD;
           portion of the mid-thigh and zeros the inclinometer. The examiner marks the gymnast's&#xD;
           skin at the distal most portion of the inclinometer in contact with the gymnast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip extension flexibility will be measured by using the modified Thomas test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast is instructed to sit as close to the edge of the examination table as&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast supports their contralateral thigh with their arms and, with the assistance&#xD;
           of the examiner, slowly rolls backward onto the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The contralateral hip is flexed to the point that the gymnast's lumbar lordosis is&#xD;
           flattened, and the right limb is allowed to hang unsupported off the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The examiner palpates the lumbar spine to confirm that it remains in contact with the&#xD;
           table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thigh position is also monitored to prevent abduction of the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the final test position is achieved the examiner places the inclinometer on the&#xD;
           gymnast's anterior thigh in line made prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 degrees indicates the gymnast's thigh is parallel to the horizon. If the thigh was&#xD;
           above horizontal the number from the digital inclinometer will be read as negative. If&#xD;
           the thigh is below horizontal the number will be positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamometer Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having received standardized instructions, subjects will perform a series of&#xD;
      familiarization trials consisting of three submaximal contractions per side. Then maximal&#xD;
      voluntary contraction strength will be measured. The side tested first will be randomized&#xD;
      within each test session. All maximal voluntary contraction strength data provided by the&#xD;
      dynamometer (in kilograms) will be normalized to body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Flexion Strength test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength testing will be performed with hand held dynamometer stabilized by the&#xD;
           examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For testing, the gymnast lies prone on a firm floor with their chin and nose touching&#xD;
           the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both arms are held parallel to the body with the shoulders flexed to 180 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast grasps the ½ inch dowel with and overhand grip and the tips of her thumbs&#xD;
           are touching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dynamometer pad will be will located on the ½ inch dowel where the gymnasts thumbs&#xD;
           meet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gymnast is asked to maximally flex their shoulders pressing the dowel into the&#xD;
           dynamometer pad as hard as they can while maintaining wrist in neutral position, elbows&#xD;
           extended and their nose and chin in contact with the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two to three maximal voluntary contraction trials will be permitted. A third trial is&#xD;
           completed only if the difference between the first two maximal voluntary contractions is&#xD;
           &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of these contractions will be 5 seconds, and thirty seconds of rest will be&#xD;
           given between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If gymnast is unable to actively flex shoulders to 180 degrees the strength test will be&#xD;
           scored as 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric maximal voluntary contraction strength of the hip muscles will be measured with a&#xD;
      portable dynamometer fixed to a custom made frame. The custom-made frame is firmly fixed to a&#xD;
      physical therapy treatment table with use of screw clamps. The frame consisted of two&#xD;
      vertical bars and 1 horizontal bar attached to the vertical bars so as to be perpendicular to&#xD;
      the extremities. The dynamometer is fixed to the horizontal bar so as the testing pad can be&#xD;
      positioned properly for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Extension Strength Dynamometer Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnast is in prone position on examination table with tested leg knee fully extended.&#xD;
           Tested hip is in 5 degrees of extension with the knee in full extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dynamometer is fixed using the custom made frame&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The center of the dynamometer pad will be on the posterior aspect of the calcaneus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnast is told to stabilize themselves by holding onto the examination table&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnasts is instructed to push as hard as they can against the dynamometer testing pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two to three maximal voluntary contraction trials will be permitted. A third trial is&#xD;
           completed only if the difference between the first two maximal voluntary contractions is&#xD;
           &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of these contractions will be 5 seconds, and thirty seconds of rest will be&#xD;
           given between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Abduction Strength Dynamometer test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnast is in sidelying position on examination table with tested leg knee fully&#xD;
           extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The contralateral hip and knee joints will be positioned at approximately 30 degrees of&#xD;
           flexion for stability and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tested hip is in 10 degrees of abduction with the knee in full extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
           •. The center of the dynamometer pad will be located 5 cm proximal to the lateral&#xD;
           femoral condyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnast is told to stabilize themselves by holding onto the examination table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gymnast is instructed to push as hard as they can against the dynamometer testing pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The examiner will inspect the whole body position during the maximal voluntary&#xD;
           contraction trials to ensure minimal compensation from pelvic rotation and flexion and&#xD;
           rotation about the hip. If the examiner judges too much compensation, that test will not&#xD;
           be recorded and the subject will be reinstructed in proper testing form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two to three maximal voluntary contraction trials will be permitted. A third trial is&#xD;
           completed only if the difference between the first two maximal voluntary contractions is&#xD;
           &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of these contractions will be 5 seconds, and thirty seconds of rest will be&#xD;
           given between trials.&#xD;
