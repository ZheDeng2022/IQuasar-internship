      -  A traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used to identify the recommended phase&#xD;
           2 dose (RP2D) of crizotinib when used in combination with standard fixed dose&#xD;
           enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive&#xD;
           crizotinib and enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment&#xD;
                cycle. The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of&#xD;
                study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side&#xD;
                effects in participants that have, not everyone who participates in this research&#xD;
                study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on&#xD;
                the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well&#xD;
                the dose was tolerated.&#xD;

                  investigator can provide evidence of no underlying liver dysfunction and thus, it&#xD;

          -  Able to swallow the study drug as a whole tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of crizotinib and enzalutamide on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because investigational agents as well as other standard&#xD;
             antiandrogen agents used in this trial may be teratogenic, men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of crizotinib&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with c-Met inhibitors&#xD;

             administered more than 14 days before study enrollment with the exception of alocepia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction or seizures that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to crizotinib or enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior&#xD;
             cortical stroke or significant brain trauma, history of loss of consciousness or&#xD;
             transient ischemic attack within 12 months of study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant medications that would lower seizure threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of medications that may alter pharmacokinetics of crizotinib or&#xD;
             enzalutamide. See section 5.5, but would exclude the use of strong CYP3A or CYP2C8&#xD;
             inhibitors, strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19&#xD;
             substrates with narrow therapeutic indice.&#xD;

                       treatment, unless a screening echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan&#xD;
                       (MUGA) performed within three months of the Screening visit results in a&#xD;

                       rate of &lt;50 beats per minute on the Screening ECG, unless pharmaceutically&#xD;
                       induced and thus reversible (i.e. beta blockers) or known, chronic&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  No medications known to prolong the QT interval as crizotinib may increase&#xD;
                       the risk for QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thrombosis or vascular ischemic events within the last six months, such as deep&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because women do not get prostate cancer,&#xD;
             as they have no prostate.&#xD;

          -  No defined washout period from major or minor surgery is required but incisions must&#xD;
             be fully healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with crizotinib or enzalutamide. In&#xD;
             addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
