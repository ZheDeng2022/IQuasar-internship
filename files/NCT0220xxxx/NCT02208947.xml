  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the project are: 1) to test the effectiveness of consumer-directed&#xD;
      financial incentives paired with provider-directed financial incentives, compared to&#xD;
      provider-directed financial incentives alone, for increasing advance care planning (ACP)&#xD;
      among Medicaid beneficiaries; and 2) to assess perceptions regarding the appropriateness of&#xD;
      consumer-directed financial incentives for ACP among study participants. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that consumer-directed financial incentives will result in a 15-percentage point&#xD;
      absolute increase in the proportion of subjects completing ACP. The investigators do not&#xD;
      advance hypotheses about the qualitative component.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel cluster randomized controlled single-blind trial of consumer-directed&#xD;
      financial incentives paired with provider-directed financial incentives (intervention),&#xD;
      compared to provider-directed financial incentives alone (control) on the completion of ACP&#xD;
      among Partnership HealthPlan of California (PHC) Medi-Cal patients. PHC is a county-organized&#xD;
      health system contracted by the State of California to provide a health care delivery system&#xD;
      for 360,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries in Northern California. PHC has 400 contracted Primary&#xD;
      Care Provider (PCP) entities, representing over 2000 individual physicians, working in solo&#xD;
      practice, small groups, community health centers, large groups, and integrated health&#xD;
      systems. The rationale for using PHC is their commitment to experimenting with strategies to&#xD;
      improve ACP, including their current quality improvement program incentive payment to PCPs to&#xD;
      discuss and document ACP with patients 65+ and &lt;65 with a serious chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will randomize 40 PCPs to one of two different patient education packets&#xD;
      for their patients. Each PCP is eligible for financial incentives for documenting ACP (usual&#xD;
      care), regardless of the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each PCP will be responsible for identifying and enrolling 10 eligible subjects during&#xD;
      routine clinic visits, for a target enrollment of 400 patient subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will stratify randomization based on salience of the financial incentive&#xD;
      (e.g., accrues directly to non-salaried provider, such as in a private practice, or accrues&#xD;
      to the organization of a salaried provider, such as in a Federally Qualified Health Center or&#xD;
      multispecialty group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive access to the patient education tool, Prepare for Your&#xD;
      Care (www.prepareforyourcare.org), developed by Dr. Sudore for low-literacy Medi-Cal&#xD;
      populations, in their education packets. The intervention group patients will additionally be&#xD;
      offered a consumer (patient) financial incentive. the primary outcome of the study is having&#xD;
      a conversation with the PCP about ACP. Secondary outcomes include: 1) website use metrics and&#xD;
      2) attitudes about providing financial incentives for ACP (among a purposively sampled subset&#xD;
      of participants).&#xD;

    <description>Partnership HealthPlan of California (PHC) pays primary care physicians (PCPs) to discuss and document ACP with Medi-Cal beneficiaries aged 65 and older and those younger than 65 with a life-limiting illness (usual care). The control condition, or &quot;enhanced usual care,&quot; adds a packet of educational information about ACP and access to the PREPARE website and verbal encouragement by their PCP delivered during a routine clinic visit to usual care.</description>

    <description>The experimental condition adds a consumer-directed financial incentive to enhanced usual care (provider-directed financial incentive and educational packet with information about the PREPARE website). Specifically, subjects will receive an immediate financial reward upon completing self-directed ACP (e.g., PREPARE steps 1-4) and a small probability of a large reward for discussing the plans with their physician (e.g., PREPARE step 5, documented by the PHC ACP attestation form).</description>
