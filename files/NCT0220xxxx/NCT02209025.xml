    <textblock>
      Rationale: Despite successful efforts to lower atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, a substantial residual cardiovascular risk remains. An&#xD;
      additive strategy to further lower this residual risk may be via raising high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and in particular those of its major protein constituent&#xD;
      apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Based on several studies, theobromine may be a promising&#xD;
      candidate in this respect. Recently, theobromine was shown to increase serum HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      (HDL-C) concentrations by 0.16 mmol/L or 10% and apoA-I levels with 8%. The question is&#xD;
      whether this increase in HDL-C and apoA-I concentrations observed translates into an improved&#xD;
      functionality of the blood vessels. Effects of theobromine on vascular function have never&#xD;
      been evaluated in a placebo controlled human intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term effects of theobromine on&#xD;
      vascular function in healthy subjects with a slightly lowered HDL-C in the fasting and the&#xD;
      postprandial state. The second primary objective is to evaluate the long-term effects of&#xD;
      theobromine on intestinal apoA-I mRNA and protein expression levels in healthy subjects with&#xD;
      a slightly lowered HDL-C in the fasting and the postprandial state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to study the long-term effects of theobromine on (1) fasting serum&#xD;
      HDL-C concentrations, (2) cholesterol efflux capacity and (3) postprandial lipid and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over design. The total&#xD;
      study duration will be 12 weeks, consisting of a 4 week experimental period, a 4 week&#xD;
      wash-out, and a 4 week control period. At the end of the experimental and control periods, a&#xD;
      postprandial test will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Forty-eight healthy men aged 45-70 years and women aged 50-70 years, with&#xD;
      slightly lowered HDL-C concentrations (men &lt;1.3 mmol/L and women &lt;1.5 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: During the experimental period, subjects will consume daily at breakfast an&#xD;
      drink containing 500 mg theobromine. During the placebo period, the subjects will consume&#xD;
      daily at breakfast the same drink without theobromine. During the wash-out period, they will&#xD;
      not consume any of the drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Measurements will be performed at the end of both 4-week&#xD;
      intervention periods. The effects of theobromine will be calculated as the absolute&#xD;
      differences between values obtained at the end of each period. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      change in vascular function defined as % change in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after intake&#xD;
      of a daily stressor, a milkshake providing all the three different macronutrients. The second&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the change in apoA-I mRNA and protein expression on the end of each&#xD;
      period 5 hours after intake of the milkshake.&#xD;

      primary endpoint is the change in apoA-I mRNA and protein expression on the end of each&#xD;
      period 5 hours after intake of the milkshake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Before the study, subjects will be screened twice to determine eligibility&#xD;
      during two visits of 15 minutes. During these visits, body weight, height and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured. In addition, a venous blood sample (5.5 mL at each occasion) will be drawn.&#xD;
      During the study, subjects will receive the control and theobromine drinks in random order.&#xD;
      At day 1 and 14 a fasting venous blood sample (16.5 mL and 7 mL respectively) will be drawn&#xD;
      and body weight and blood pressure will be measured. At days 25 and 81 again a fasting blood&#xD;
      sample will be drawn (28 mL). In addition, at day 28 of each experimental period, at t=0&#xD;
      hours, a fasting venous blood sample (30 mL) will be drawn and vascular function will be&#xD;
      measured, followed by a 2.5 h postprandial test with again the vascular function&#xD;
      measurements. As postprandial meal, subjects will receive a high-fat milkshake. Before the&#xD;
      postprandial test a cannula will be placed and blood will be sampled at t=0, 15, 30, 45, 60,&#xD;
      90, 120 and 240 (total volume 129.5 mL). Thus, during the entire 13 (screening and study)&#xD;
      weeks period, in total 444 mL blood will be drawn. Vascular function measurements include a&#xD;
      panel of non-invasive measurements, i.e. FMD, endo peripheral artherial tonometry (endoPAT),&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) and retinal imaging. Subjects will be asked to fill out a food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire two times and to keep a study-diary throughout 12 weeks. On rare&#xD;
      occasions, blood sampling might cause bruises or hematoma. The vascular function measurements&#xD;
      are non-invasive and will cause no burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup of 10 volunteers, 5 hours after the start of the postprandial test, small&#xD;
      intestinal biopsies will be taken in the duodenum to determine the difference in intestinal&#xD;
      apoA-I mRNA and protein expression. Obtaining small intestinal biopsies by standard flexible&#xD;
      gastroscopy induces local discomfort in the pharynx only during the procedure, which takes&#xD;
      about 15 minutes, and causes a theoretical risk for perforations (1:1000) and an infection&#xD;
      risk of 1:1.800.000, with lower risk for healthy subjects. The complication is serious and&#xD;
      subjects will have to stay in the hospital. If there are serious complaints after the&#xD;
      gastroscopy (e.g. vomiting with or without blood, or stomach ache) subjects are have to warn&#xD;
      the project leader or their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total time investment for the subjects will be approximately 14.5 hours, and 17.5 hours in&#xD;
      the subgroup from which biopsies will be taken, excluding travel time.&#xD;
