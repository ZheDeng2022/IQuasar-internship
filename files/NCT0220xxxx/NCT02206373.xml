    <textblock>
      Background： The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high in Taiwan. Though there&#xD;
      are many factors that may affect the measurement of serum creatinine, it is a well-accepted&#xD;
      marker for renal function assessment. The creatinine clearance (ClCr) estimated by&#xD;
      Cockcroft-Gault is commonly used as a reference for dosage adjustment; while the estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) is used in&#xD;
      CKD staging. ClCr and eGFR not only have different units, but the results of estimation from&#xD;
      the two varied among races and individuals. Since 2010, US Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      required both the influences of ClCr and eGFR on the pharmacokinetics of a drug in renal&#xD;
      insufficient patients during pharmacokinetic studies. Because most drugs are excreted through&#xD;
      kidney, an understanding on the relationship between ClCr and eGFR is important to dose&#xD;
      safely and effectively. Furthermore, identifying the factors that may influence the&#xD;
      difference between ClCr and eGFR can provide in-depth consideration during clinical renal&#xD;
      function assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose： The purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between different ClCr and&#xD;
      eGFR equations in order to provide better renal dose. We also want to find the factors that&#xD;
      may cause the differences between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods： This study will conduct literature review to understand study population during the&#xD;
      development of different ClCr and eGFR equations, as well as their scope of application.&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital electronic patient database will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      correlation between ClCr and eGFR and to identify factors that may influence the difference&#xD;
      between ClCr and eGFR. The data from patients who have completed 12-hr or 24-hr urine&#xD;
      collection with calculated renal function will be used to verify the applicability of these&#xD;
      equations (including a ClCr equation developed by our institute) in Taiwanese.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic principles will be used to analyze the appropriate unit to be used for renal&#xD;
      function while dosing a patient.&#xD;
