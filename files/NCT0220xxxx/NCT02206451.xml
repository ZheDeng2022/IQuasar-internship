      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a disease that affects many people in Mali and in Africa. It is caused by germs&#xD;
      that are spread by mosquito bites. Researchers are creating vaccines that they hope will&#xD;
      prevent malaria infection and/or the spread of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test if the PfSPZ vaccine can stop malaria spread by mosquitoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People currently enrolled in the ongoing PfSPZ malaria vaccine trial. Participants must be&#xD;
      willing to have uninfected mosquitoes bite them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be able to take part in this study at every visit after receiving all&#xD;
           scheduled vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked whether they are willing to participate in the procedures.&#xD;
           Female participants will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will put about 60 mosquitoes in 2 or 3 cups (20 or 30 in each cup). They&#xD;
           will hold each cup to the participant s leg or arm so the mosquitoes can bite. These&#xD;
           mosquitoes do not carry germs and will take about 3 drops of blood total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get a cream for any swelling or itching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be checked the next day for any discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may take part in this feeding test multiple times, if they are willing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants have malaria parasites in their blood, they may be asked to take part in&#xD;
           another study. For this, they will sleep alone in their hut the night after the feeding&#xD;
           test. A study team will set up nets to collect mosquitoes that may have bitten the&#xD;
           participant overnight.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine which interrupts malaria transmission (VIMT) is a critical tool to achieve the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of eradication of this disease. VIMTs work by inducing humoral responses in&#xD;
      vaccinated individuals that inhibit the development of malaria parasites in the mosquito, and&#xD;
      combined humoral and cellular responses that inhibit the establishment of infection in&#xD;
      humans. Overall efficacy of these vaccines is evaluated by measuring reduction of infection&#xD;
      and clinical cases among vaccinees and the parasite infectivity to mosquitoes,&#xD;
      (human-to-mosquito transmissibility), before and after vaccination, and with or without&#xD;
      vaccination. One of the candidate VIMTs, the PfSPZ Vaccine, is currently being tested in Mali&#xD;
      for safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this Feeding Assay Protocol is to explore the effect of the PfSPZ Vaccine,&#xD;
      on interrupting human-to-mosquito transmission. Individuals from the the PfSPZ Vaccine trial&#xD;
      in 2014 who also consent to be enrolled in this Feeding Assay Protocol will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in procedures including direct skin feeds (DSF) and experimental huts (EH). The&#xD;
      human-to-mosquito transmission will be evaluated by examining the presence of malaria&#xD;
      parasites in the midgut of mosquitoes fed on study participants. The human-to-mosquito&#xD;
      transmission by DSF and EH assay methods will be analyzed for potential correlation.&#xD;
