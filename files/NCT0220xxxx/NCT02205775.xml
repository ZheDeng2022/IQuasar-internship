      Myocardial necrosis is relatively frequent after percutaneous coronary intervention and is&#xD;
      associated with higher mortality during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since anti-inflammatory properties of statins have been demonstrated and the benefit of&#xD;
      statins in acute coronary syndromes have been proven, this study aims at testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the pre-procedural intensive statin treatment reduce the extent of&#xD;
      peri-procedural necrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial necrosis, assessed by creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) elevation, is relatively frequent&#xD;
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), occurring in up to 40% of cases. Although&#xD;
      most patients remain asymptomatic and with no changes in cardiac function, even a mild&#xD;
      release of CK-MB is associated with higher mortality during the follow-up. A number of&#xD;
      treatment strategies have been proposed to limit myocardial damage during PCI, but procedural&#xD;
      ischemic myocardial injury remains the most frequent complication after coronary angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of therapy with HMG-CoA&#xD;
      reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with already established coronary artery disease&#xD;
      or in normal subjects with hypercholesterolemia in primary prevention, and retrospective&#xD;
      observational studies have suggested that pre-treatment with statins might reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of myocardial infarction after coronary intervention. This benefit was confirmed in&#xD;
      patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) undergoing PCI,&#xD;
      who received 80 mg atorvastatin 12 h before PCI, with a further 40-mg pre-procedure, as&#xD;
      compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of statins in ischemic conditions are not&#xD;
      completely clear. Previous studies have suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      statins may play a role, showing that the benefit was higher in patients with high C-reactive&#xD;
      protein. Since an inflammatory status before angioplasty, as detected by high levels of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, is associated with a higher risk of peri-procedural myocardial necrosis&#xD;
      and adverse cardiac events during the follow-up, the anti-inflammatory effects of statins&#xD;
      might contribute to reduce myocardial necrosis, by reducing to the microembolization&#xD;
      occurring during coronary intervention. Statin administration also rapidly improves&#xD;
      endothelial function. Thus, even short-term treatment with statins (unable to provide LDL&#xD;
      reduction persistent enough to decrease the atherosclerotic burden) may have important&#xD;
      effects on endothelial function and inflammation. In patients undergoing PCI, reduction of&#xD;
      peri-procedural myocardial injury after pre-treatment with statins is paralleled by a&#xD;
      concomitant attenuation of post-procedural increase of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1&#xD;
      (ICAM-1) and E-selectin plasma levels, thus reinforcing the concept that a reduction of&#xD;
      endothelial inflammatory response may explain peri-procedural protective effect of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins induce heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in vitro and are reported to have&#xD;
      pleiotropic benefits that reduce oxidative stress in the vasculature and in various&#xD;
      extravascular tissues Two anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and&#xD;
      transforming growth factor-beta, play a critical role in the modulation of immunoinflammatory&#xD;
      cell infiltration in the atherosclerotic intima and the mechanism underlying the protective&#xD;
      effects of IL-10 against inflammatory cell infiltration involves heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1).&#xD;
      Moreover, statins can efficiently increase levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs),&#xD;
      contributing to vascular repair, in patients with coronary heart disease and in patients with&#xD;
      chronic heart failure, and augment EPC proliferative capacity, in a way similar to vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is directed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. documenting whether the immediate pre-procedural administration of a statin at a high&#xD;
           dosage may reduce the extent of peri-procedural MI compared with placebo on the&#xD;
           background of the best current medical therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. proving that treatment with rosuvastatin, a hydrophilic statin, at the proposed dosage,&#xD;
           is at least comparable (and possibly superior) to atorvastatin at the proposed dosage on&#xD;
           top of standard treatment in inducing a significant reduction of peri-procedural damage&#xD;
           previously documented with atorvastatin in the presence of a 1-week pre-treatment at 40&#xD;
           mg/day (12);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. characterizing the relevance of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition (vs largely HMGCoA&#xD;
           reductase-independent cholesterol lowering) in this phenomenon;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. providing a mechanistic explanation for such effects, investigating the role of 1) HO-1&#xD;
           and 2) EPCs in the context of peri-PCI myocardial damage.&#xD;
