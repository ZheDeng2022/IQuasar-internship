  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if post-operative pain and rate of recovery are&#xD;
      improved in patients undergoing spine surgery using MMA (multimodal analgesia) compared to&#xD;
      usual analgsic care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim #1: To compare the postoperative pain levels of single level lumbar fusion&#xD;
      patients treated with either MMA pain management protocol or standard pain management&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlling postoperative pain is a critical first step in facilitating a patient's recovery&#xD;
      and improved quality of life. In-hospital pain levels will be measured using a numeric pain&#xD;
      scale on a scale of 0-10. Pain assessment is conducted by the hospital nurses as a standard&#xD;
      of care protocol. Assessments are every four to six hours, within 60 minutes after receiving&#xD;
      a pain medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the MMA pain protocol will have significantly less&#xD;
      immediate postoperative pain as compared to patients treated with the standard pain protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To compare the immediate postoperative, or in-hospital, narcotic consumption&#xD;
      of single level lumbar fusion patients treated with either MMA pain management protocol or&#xD;
      standard pain management protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreasing narcotic consumption following lumbar spinal fusion surgery is important for&#xD;
      faster recovery for the patient, decreasing narcotic related side effects (nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, lethargy, ileus, etc) as well as lowering overall treatment costs. The total amount&#xD;
      of narcotic use during the course of the hospitalization for each subject will be recorded.&#xD;
      Dosages of narcotics will be converted to morphine equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the MMA pain protocol will consume significantly less&#xD;
      immediate postoperative narcotic pain medications compared to patients treated with the&#xD;
      standard pain protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: To compare the length of hospital stay of single level lumbar fusion&#xD;
      patients treated with either MMA pain management protocol or standard pain management&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreasing the amount of time patients remain in the hospital may decrease the time it takes&#xD;
      a patient to return to personal and societal responsibilities. Additionally it reduces the&#xD;
      patients risk of a nosocomial infection and reduces the costs of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the MMA pain protocol will have a significantly reduced&#xD;
      length of stay in the hospital compared to patients treated with the standard pain protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4: To compare postoperative quality of life of single level lumbar fusion&#xD;
      patients treated with either MMA pain management protocol or standard pain management&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of lumbar fusion surgery is to improve the quality of life for patients.&#xD;
      The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used as a disease specific measure. The Veterans&#xD;
      Rand 12 (VR-12) will be used as a general health outcome measure. Each of these patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures will be collected pre-operatively and at each of the following&#xD;
      postoperative visits: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 month, 6 visit, 1 visit, and 2 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the MMA pain protocol will have significantly greater&#xD;
      improvement in Quality of Life measures compared to patients treated with the standard pain&#xD;
      protocol and this will be sustained out to two years post-operatively.&#xD;
