    <textblock>
      Definite diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is currently based on renal biopsy findings. In&#xD;
      most cases, however, the diagnosis can be reliably made in patients with macroalbuminuria in&#xD;
      the presence of diabetic retinopathy.Microalbuminuria is often used as a prognostic marker in&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, because approximately 50% of type 1 diabetes patients with microalbuminuria&#xD;
      will eventually develop diabetic nephropathy. Conversely, microalbu- minuria is of much less&#xD;
      value as a marker in DM because it has a variety of causes, including hypertension. Thus,&#xD;
      additional markers are needed to identify patient groups with a high risk of developing overt&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy. The aims of this study is checking urine UbA52 levels with ELISA to&#xD;
      identify its significance in the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;

      It is now well recognized that the incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. It is the&#xD;
      leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries. Diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      has been reported to occur in 25%-40% of people with diabetes. The appearance of&#xD;
      microalbuminuria usually is regarded as incipient nephropathy, but recently, work has&#xD;
      suggested that some individuals with diabetes and decreased GFR may not have an increased&#xD;
      urinary AER.Identification of markers for prediction of the clinical course of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy remains a major challenge. Previous research showed that m/z14766 protein by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, was selectively excreted in the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients, the m/z&#xD;
      14766 mass peaks were identified as UbA52. We suppose that UbA52 can be regard as a simple&#xD;
      and practical biomarker for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
