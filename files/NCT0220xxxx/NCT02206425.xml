    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness (good&#xD;
      and bad effects) of ixazomib given as part of a combination therapy to treat subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed (subjects whose disease came back) or refractory (subjects whose disease did not&#xD;
      respond to past treatment) multiple myeloma. More specifically, the study is focused on&#xD;
      subjects who were previously treated with bortezomib (Velcade®) or carfilzomib (Kyprolis®)&#xD;
      and showed worsening of their myeloma while receiving either one of these drugs in&#xD;
      combination therapy. This study is a Phase I/II. Ixazomib is an investigational drug, which&#xD;
      means that ixazomib is currently being tested and is not yet approved by the United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      Ixazomib is a new study drug that belongs to the same class as bortezomib and carfilzomib;&#xD;
      however, unlike bortezomib and carfilzomib, ixazomib is taken by mouth. Current studies&#xD;
      investigating ixazomib are demonstrating that it is as safe as bortezomib and effective for&#xD;
      the treatment of multiple myeloma both on its own and in combination with other multiple&#xD;
      myeloma medications, such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or prednisone and melphalan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, intra-patient, multicenter, open-label and non-randomized study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixazomib as a replacement for bortezomib or carfilzomib&#xD;
      among multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have failed proteasome inhibitor (PI)-containing&#xD;
      combination regimens. Patients will receive ixazomib once a week in place of bortezomib or&#xD;
      carfilzomib in combination with an alkylating agent (melphalan or cyclophosphamide),&#xD;
      anthracycline (pegylated doxorubicin [PLD]), immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide,&#xD;
      pomalidomide), ascorbic acid and/or a glucocorticosteroid (dexamethasone, prednisone or&#xD;
      methylprednisolone) administered using the same dose(s) and schedule(s) as the last&#xD;
      PI-containing regimen that the patients had received and failed. The total number of&#xD;
      different prior bortezomib- or carfilzomib-containing regimens that will be evaluated is 10,&#xD;
      reflecting those commonly used in the community as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + ascorbic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + PLD + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carfilzomib + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bortezomib + pomalidomide + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carfilzomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carfilzomib + pomalidomide + dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 60 patients who are refractory to a bortezomib- or&#xD;
      carfilzomib-containing combination regimen, as demonstrated by progressive disease (PD) while&#xD;
      being treated, or who have relapsed within 8 weeks from the last dose of bortezomib or&#xD;
      carfilzomib in their last PI-containing combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixazomib will replace bortezomib or carfilzomib using the same PI-containing regimen the&#xD;
      patients failed.The study will consist of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles; 3) a maintenance period; 4) a final assessment to occur 28 days after the&#xD;
      end of the last treatment cycle; and 5) a follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixazomib will be administered PO at 4 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle to patients&#xD;
      enrolled in seven regimens (bortezomib + melphalan + prednisone, bortezomib + dexamethasone,&#xD;
      carfilzomib + dexamethasone, bortezomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone, bortezomib +&#xD;
      pomalidomide + dexamethasone, carfilzomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone, carfilzomib +&#xD;
      pomalidomide + dexamethasone). Subjects on those regimens receiving 4 mg of ixazomib from the&#xD;
      beginning of the trial will continue to do so for the length of the study, unless they suffer&#xD;
      from adverse events requiring dose reductions. For the other three regimens, bortezomib +&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone, bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + ascorbic acid, and&#xD;
      bortezomib + PLD + dexamethasone, the MTD for ixazomib is unknown and intra-patient dose&#xD;
      escalation will be performed to determine the specific MTD for each of them. For these three&#xD;
      regimens, ixazomib will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle at a starting&#xD;
      dose of 3 mg in Cycle 1, and then intra-patient dose-escalation will proceed to 4 mg in Cycle&#xD;
      2. All other agents will be administered at the same schedule and dose intensity as those of&#xD;
      the last PI-containing treatment the patient failed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Currently has progressive MM that has previously progressed or is currently&#xD;
             progressing while receiving or within 8 weeks of receiving bortezomib or carfilzomib&#xD;
             as part of a combination treatment. MM patients that demonstrate refractory disease,&#xD;
             as defined below, are both eligible for enrollment provided they fulfill the other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Patients are refractory to a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination regimen, when&#xD;
             they progress while currently receiving a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination&#xD;
             treatment, or within 8 weeks of its last dose. Patients are considered relapsed, when&#xD;
             they progress between 8 and 12-weeks from their last dose of bortezomib or carfilzomib&#xD;
             as part of a bortezomib or carfilzomib combination therapy. Prior treatment with four&#xD;
             days or less of a total of 400 mg of prednisone (or an equivalent potency of another&#xD;
             steroid) for MM will not be considered a regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients that were on bortezomib-containing regimens must have been administered at&#xD;
             least 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m2 in no more than 28-days cycles. Subjects must&#xD;
             have received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown PD to be&#xD;
             considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients that were on carfilzomib-containing regimens must have received at least 6&#xD;
             doses of at least 27 mg/m2 in no more than 28 days per cycle. Subjects must have&#xD;
             received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown PD to be considered&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Progressed from one of the specific bortezomib- or carfilzomib-containing regimens as&#xD;
             listed on page 51. Although bortezomib- and carfilzomib-containing combination&#xD;
             regimens that are otherwise identical except for the PI result in the same ixazomib&#xD;
             regimen, they will be enrolled separately so that safety/efficacy can be separately&#xD;
             determined, thereby allowing comparisons based on the prior PI that subjects were&#xD;
             exposed to as part of the regimen that they failed (carfilzomib vs. bortezomib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient may have received a carfilzomib- or bortezomib-containing regimen at any time&#xD;
             and may have received other non-proteasome inhibitor-containing intervening treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has been diagnosed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy,&#xD;
                  monoclonal protein (M protein) and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome.3&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Primary amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Plasma cell leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Severe hypercalcemia, i.e., serum calcium = 12 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) corrected for&#xD;
                  albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years before study enrollment or&#xD;
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual&#xD;
             disease. Patients with non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type&#xD;
             are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, New York Heart Association&#xD;

             pericardial disease, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, echocardiogram or&#xD;
             multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) evidence of left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
             (LVEF) below institutional normal within 28 days prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system&#xD;
             abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be&#xD;
             documented by the investigator as not medically relevant&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has peripheral neuropathy grade 3 or higher or Grade 2 with pain on clinical&#xD;
             examination during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has received the following prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Chemotherapy within 21 days of enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) within 21 days of&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Immunotherapy or antibody therapy as well as thalidomide, pomalidomide,&#xD;
                  lenalidomide, arsenic trioxide, carfilzomib, or bortezomib within 21 days before&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
             various formulations of any agent&#xD;
