  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of safety and tolerability of four intradermal injections given at two week&#xD;
      intervals. In addition the efficacy of transferrinfection was determined by quantifying&#xD;
      Interleukin 2 (IL-2), which was locally produced by the implanted, transfected allogenic&#xD;
      melanoma cells at the injection sites. Further determination of tumor specific and clinical&#xD;
      host responses induced or augmented by the treatment were determined.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy or for whom conventional therapy&#xD;
             is not available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic melanoma (stage IV AJCC) which is surgically or medically incurable because&#xD;
             of distant metastatic disease (i.e., a metastasis not in the same lymph node draining&#xD;
             area as the primary malignant melanoma). Histologic confirmation of stage IV is&#xD;
             required. Measurable disease that can be routinely assessed by physical examination&#xD;
             and/or non-invasive radiological procedures&#xD;
&#xD;

             (material derived from autologous melanoma metastases and in-house preparation&#xD;
             successful) is a requisite for entering the study&#xD;

             surgical removal of tumor specimens for DTH material preparation (patients are not&#xD;
             permitted to receive such therapies 4 weeks prior to first cell inoculation except of&#xD;

             clearance &lt; 75 ml/min). In amendments 1 and 3 serum creatinine levels were changed to&#xD;

          -  Impaired hematologic function with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White Blood Count (WBC) &lt; 2500/mm**3 or&#xD;
