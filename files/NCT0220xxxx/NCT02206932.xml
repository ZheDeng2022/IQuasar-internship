    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and effectiveness of the hepatitis C medications sofosbuvir and&#xD;
      simeprevir in patients who have both the HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of an investigational combination of two hepatitis C medications&#xD;
      call sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV). Both medications are approved by the U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of hepatitis C in combination with other&#xD;
      medications. The combination sofosbuvir and simeprevir has not been approved by the FDA and&#xD;
      is being tested as an investigational combination in research studies such as this. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see if SOF + SMV given for 12 weeks is safe and able to clear the&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) from subjects who are co-infected with HIV-1 and who have scarring of&#xD;
      the liver (fibrosis of 3 or 4 on a scale of 0-4, with 4 as the most scarring, also known as&#xD;
      cirrhosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an investigator-initiated clinical trial sponsored by University of California,&#xD;
      San Francisco (UCSF), with support and the study drug simeprevir provided by Janssen&#xD;
      Scientific Affairs, LLC.&#xD;

                  contraceptive choices listed above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may&#xD;
                  actually increase the risk of HIV acquisition. Study subjects who are sexually&#xD;
                  active with HIV-1 negative or unknown HIV-1 serostatus partners should be advised&#xD;
                  that they need to consider effective strategies for reducing the risk of HIV&#xD;
                  transmission, as well as meeting the requirement for effective contraception&#xD;
                  during their participation in the study. Study subjects should discuss&#xD;
                  contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care&#xD;
                  provider.&#xD;
&#xD;

             vasectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives. Acceptable&#xD;
             documentation of sterilization and menopause is specified below.&#xD;
