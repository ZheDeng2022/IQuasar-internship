      Using collagenase to isolate limbal stem cells and improve the technique of ex vivo expansion&#xD;
      of limbal stem cells for the treatment of patients suffering from unilateral limbal stem cell&#xD;
      insufficiency based on the concept of &quot;limbal stem cells need special cell-cell contact and&#xD;
      cell-extracellular matrix interaction to support their survival&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from unilateral limbal stem cell insufficiency and understand the benefits&#xD;
      and risk factors of the operation will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Two weeks before&#xD;
      transplantation, the investigators first take 1-2 mm2 of limbal tissues from the healthy eye,&#xD;
      digest the tissue with collagenase, and get an epithelial cell cluster. The cell cluster will&#xD;
      be cultured on amniotic membrane with SHEM medium which contains Dulbecco's modified Eagle's&#xD;
      medium/F12 (1:1), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 5μg/ml&#xD;
      insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 nM cholera toxin, 50μg/ml gentamicin, 1.25μg/ml&#xD;
      amphotericin B. Seven to ten days later after successful culture, transplantation will be&#xD;
      performed after the cells reaches 1.5-2 cm2 compact confluent epithelial sheets without&#xD;
      evidence of contamination. During the operation, lamellar keratectomy will be performed to&#xD;
      remove the abnormal corneal neovascularization and scar tissue. The cultivated epithelial&#xD;
      sheets will be transplanted to denuded corneal surface with fibrin glue and suture technique.&#xD;
      The patients are planed to be admitted for 2 weeks. After discharge, follow up of the&#xD;
      patients will be performed on one week, two week, one month, two months, three months, six&#xD;
      months and one year later. Pictures of external eyes will be taken and the extent of corneal&#xD;
      epithelium regeneration, visual acuity, and complications will be recorded during follow-up&#xD;
      visits. The investigators plan to collect 10 patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: between 18-70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lesion eye should have limbal insufficiency more than 180 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Lesion eye should have recurrent corneal erosions, corneal neovascularisation and poor&#xD;
             vision caused by limbal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The symptoms should be more than 1/2 year, and have no possibility of improvement by&#xD;
             medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patients will to received the operation and the long term post- operative&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
