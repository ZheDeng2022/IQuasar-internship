  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety of Tetanus Toxoid Reduced&#xD;
      Diphtheria, Toxoid, and Acelluar Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) in pregnant women at ≥ 20 weeks 0&#xD;
      days gestation receiving Tdap as part of standard practice. Prior Tdap/Td/TT history will be&#xD;
      verified by medical record review when possible. There will be an emphasis on enrolling women&#xD;
      who have received Tdap before the current pregnancy, to the greatest extent possible.&#xD;
      Non-pregnant women who are receiving their initial Tdap will also be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection-site (local) and systemic reaction data will be assessed on the vaccination day and&#xD;
      during the 7 days following vaccination using either identical web-based or paper diaries,&#xD;
      depending on the preference of the study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be followed until delivery with comprehensive obstetric and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes obtained from review of the electronic medical record.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Vaccine&#xD;
      administration in the pregnant population will be part of routine care. Vaccine&#xD;
      administration in the non-pregnant women will be provided as either routine care or as part&#xD;
      of the study. Pregnant women at ≥ 20 weeks 0 days gestation who have not received Tdap during&#xD;
      the current pregnancy will be enrolled, with prioritized emphasis on enrolling pregnant women&#xD;
      who have received Tdap prior to the current pregnancy in order to attempt to address the&#xD;
      question of closely-spaced repeated dosing. Detailed data will be collected from study&#xD;
      participants on prior Tdap/Td/TT receipt. The non-pregnant women will consist of both Tdap&#xD;
      naïve and those who have received Tdap previously. With Day 0 serving as the day of&#xD;
      vaccination, participants will be followed through Day 7 for symptoms of reactogenicity. For&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1, symptoms of reactogenicity occurring from Day 0 -7 will be compared&#xD;
      between pregnant and non-pregnant women. For Objective 2, pregnant women will be followed&#xD;
      through delivery for collection of pregnancy outcome data. Pregnancy outcomes among study&#xD;
      participants will be compared with historical outcomes from summary data from both Vanderbilt&#xD;
      and Duke. In addition, follow-up will be conducted for infants born to mothers who received&#xD;
      Tdap during pregnancy to assess health outcomes and growth parameters through 6 months of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet the following criteria will be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        observational study. Tdap administration will be given as routine standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and non-pregnant women, as determined by medical history, aged 18 - 45 years&#xD;
             of age inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For pregnant women only - Singleton gestation ≥ 20 weeks 0 days gestation - ≤34 weeks&#xD;
             0 days gestation based on reconciliation of last menstrual period and ultrasound&#xD;
             dating. Estimated due date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA) - EDD will be based on&#xD;
             reconciliation of a &quot;sure&quot; first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and earliest&#xD;
             dating ultrasound. If the LMP is uncertain, then the earliest dating ultrasound will&#xD;
             be used to determine EDD and GA. If the ultrasound derived-EDD is in agreement with&#xD;
             sure-LMP derived EDD, then the LMP-derived EDD is used to determine GA. If the&#xD;
             ultrasound derived EDD is not in agreement with the LMP-derived EDD, the&#xD;
             ultrasound-derived EDD is used to determine GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention of receiving Tdap vaccine based on ACIP guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English or Spanish literate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention of being available for entire study period and complete all relevant study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who meet the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in this&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Febrile illness within the last 24 hours or an oral temperature &gt; 100.4oF (&gt; 38oC)&#xD;
             prior to Tdap administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of Tdap or any other&#xD;
             diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and pertussis antigen containing vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Encephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures)&#xD;
             within 7 days of administration of a previous pertussis antigen-containing vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function including active infection with&#xD;
             HIV, hepatitis B or C, current use of glucocorticoids, i.e., oral, parenteral, and&#xD;
             high-dose inhaled steroids, and immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note, if a woman were to require antenatal corticosteroids for benefit of fetal lung&#xD;
             maturity within 8 days post enrollment, she would not be excluded from the study for&#xD;
             reactogenicity analysis. However, if antenatal corticosteroids were received anytime&#xD;
             between vaccination and 28-day sample collection for serologic studies, she would be&#xD;
             excluded from serologic studies as they could be altered by steroid receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any licensed vaccine OR investigational product within 1 week prior to Tdap&#xD;
             vaccination in this study or planning receipt of any vaccines during 8-day&#xD;
             post-vaccination period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note, any woman receiving an investigational vaccine or live vaccine inadvertently at&#xD;
             any time during pregnancy will be excluded from analysis. (Note, inadvertent receipt&#xD;
             of licensed HPV vaccine or any other inactivated licensed vaccine outside of the&#xD;
             parameters specified above is not a reason for exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigators, may pose a health risk to&#xD;
             the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is a relative of any research study personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is an employee of any research study personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For pregnant women only&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tdap/Td/TT receipt during current pregnancy prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs or symptoms of active preterm labor, defined as regular uterine contractions&#xD;
             with cervical change&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For non-pregnant women only&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention of becoming pregnant during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is already enrolled or plans to enroll in another clinical trial with an&#xD;
             investigational product within 30 days of Tdap receipt. Co-enrollment in observational&#xD;
             or behavioral intervention studies are allowed at any time while enrollment in a&#xD;
             clinical trial involving an investigational product (other than vaccine) may occur&#xD;
             after 30 days following Tdap receipt. Receipt of inactivated vaccines during&#xD;
             pregnancy, including routinely recommended inactivated influenza vaccine, given as&#xD;
             part of usual care, is not an exclusion for this study, except during the 8 days after&#xD;
             Tdap vaccination&#xD;
