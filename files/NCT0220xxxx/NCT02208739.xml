  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis, a bacterial dental biofilm based infectious disease, is a chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disease of the periodontium which results in irreversible destruction of supporting&#xD;
      structures of the teeth such as periodontal ligaments, connective tissues, cementum and&#xD;
      alveolar bone. More than 700 species of bacteria are estimated to be found in the&#xD;
      sub-gingival dental biofilm in which periodontopathogens are found to be responsible in&#xD;
      initiating periodontal disease. Chronic periodontitis, although termed as 'chronic', starts&#xD;
      as an acute inflammation. Low levels of bacteremia and endotoxins provides a stimulus for the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response. In periodontitis, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#xD;
      from gram-negative bacteria with host cells initiates the secretion of cytokines and the&#xD;
      expression of cell adhesion molecules in gingival tissue which leads to loss of alveolar bone&#xD;
      and connective tissues supporting the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the management of chronic periodontitis, non surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) which&#xD;
      includes oral hygiene instruction (OHI), scaling and root planing, is administered to improve&#xD;
      clinical parameters as well as controlling the bacterial count responsible in initiating the&#xD;
      disease and the resultant inflammatory response. Success of the treatment can be analyzed&#xD;
      when the clinical parameters, counts of the microbes is reduced and inflammatory response is&#xD;
      controlled. Studies which have evaluated the microbiological and immunological response&#xD;
      following NSPT clearly demonstrates an improvement in clinical parameters, reduction in&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators present as well as a decrease in microbial count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OHI which includes tooth brushing and inter-dental cleaning is found beneficial in removing&#xD;
      microbial plaque, thus, preventing periodontal diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis.&#xD;
      Studies have evaluated the role of OHI on clinical and immunological parameters and&#xD;
      microbiological profiles of periodontal maintenance subjects, while none of them evaluated&#xD;
      its role alone in the management of chronic periodontitis subjects. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      the following investigation was to compare the changes in the clinical parameters,&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators as well as level and frequency of detection of periodontopathogens&#xD;
      that take place after 3-months of NSPT versus OHI and to evaluate if clinical parameters have&#xD;
      an effect on these inflammatory mediators and microbiological changes.&#xD;

      Subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis were selected for this longitudinal&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Ethical clearance for the study was granted by the Medical Ethics&#xD;
      Committee, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya [Medical Ethics Committee Number: DF&#xD;
      PE1002/0045(P)]. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975,&#xD;
      as revised in 2000. The CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials were followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of 112 screened patients 56 patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were minimum of 12 teeth present with pocket of 5mm or more and probing&#xD;
      attachment loss of 4mm or more in at least 2 different quadrants which bled on probing.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included history of cardiovascular problems, pregnancy, smokers, and&#xD;
      subjects receiving antibiotics in past 4 months or NSPT in past 6 months. Recruited patients&#xD;
      were treated at the Periodontology clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya. Using&#xD;
      Cohen's d formula it was calculated that at least 26 patients would be needed per treatment&#xD;
      group to detect this difference with 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to baseline examination, patients were assigned in the NSPT and OHI group using block&#xD;
      randomization. Patients in NSPT group received OHI, scaling and root planing followed by&#xD;
      0.12% Chlorhexidine mouth rinses while patients in OHI group received OHI only. At each month&#xD;
      recall visit, participants in both groups were reviewed and motivated. Professional&#xD;
      prophylaxis was only received by NSPT group. Two calibrated examiners (RPCR and WNAWA)&#xD;
      performed all treatment on the patients. Probing pocket depth ( PPD), probing attachment loss&#xD;
      (PAL), gingival bleeding index (BI) and visible plaque index (PI) were determined on all&#xD;
      present teeth except third molars at baseline and 3 months after therapy. For PI and BI, 4&#xD;
      sites were measured (mesial, distal, buccal, lingual) and for PPD and PAL 6 sites were&#xD;
      recorded (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and&#xD;
      disto-lingual). Utilizing Kappa statistics, good agreements (&gt;0.8) were obtained for intra&#xD;
      and inter operator reproducibility of all recorded clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of subgingival microbiota using quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-gingival plaque scraping samples were obtained at baseline and 3-months post therapy with&#xD;
      sterile curettes from the deepest sites at each quadrant and were pooled together for each&#xD;
      subject. Prior to sampling, isolation was maintained with cotton rolls and supra-gingival&#xD;
      plaque was removed using cotton pellets. Plaque scrapings were re-suspended in 1.5 ml of&#xD;
      Phosphate Buffered Saline and stored at -80⁰C freezer prior to DNA extraction. 100µl of&#xD;
      plaque sample was used for automated DNA extraction in the lab using the Qiacube machine&#xD;
      (Qiagen®, Biotechnology, Netherlands). The tubes containing the plaque samples were&#xD;
      centrifuged at a speed of 5,000 × g for 10 minutes on a tabletop centrifuge machine to obtain&#xD;
      the pellet. The pellet was then used for automated DNA extraction with the Qiacube machine.&#xD;
      100µl of eluted DNA was stored in -20⁰C for bacterial detection using quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (Applied Biosystem, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference bacterial strains used in this study were P.gingivalis (W83),&#xD;
      A.actinomycetemcomitans (NCTC9710), P.intermedia (ATCC25611) and T.forsythia (CCUG 21028AT).&#xD;
      All the bacterial strains were grown as recommended by American Type Culture Collection&#xD;
      (ATCC). After the growth of bacteria till late exponential phase they were washed with&#xD;
      sterile distilled water and DNA extraction was carried out using the same protocol as for&#xD;
      plaque samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration and purity of extracted DNA was determined using spectrophotometer machine&#xD;
      (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo scientific, USA). DNA concentration from both plaque samples and&#xD;
      reference strain were calculated and recorded accordingly. The extracted DNAs were stored in&#xD;
      -20⁰C until the initiation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol given by Boutaga et al., (2005) was followed for quantitative polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction . Primers and probes selected for this study are shown in Table 1. A total reaction&#xD;
      mixture of 20ul was used for amplification, which contains 2ul of template DNA from plaque&#xD;
      sample/reference strain,10 ul of 2 x TaqMan fast advanced master mix (Applied biosystems,&#xD;
      USA), 1ul of 20x gene expression assay and 7ul nuclease free water. All the components of&#xD;
      reaction mixture except for DNA sample were added in 1.5ml micro centrifuge tube. The tube&#xD;
      was vortexed and than centrifuged to eliminate air bubbles. Mixture was transferred to&#xD;
      96-well plate with addition of 2ul DNA sample. The Plate was then covered with optical&#xD;
      adhesive and centrifuged again to make sure air bubbles are eliminated. The cycling&#xD;
      conditions used were as follows: 50oc for 2min and 95oc for 10min followed by 45 cycles at&#xD;
      95oc for 15s and 60oc for 1min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilutions of known amounts of reference strains of DNA were used to generate standard curves&#xD;
      with correlation coefficient (R2: 0.99). For quantification/copy number determination, the&#xD;
      results from unknown samples were projected on the standard curves obtained from the pure&#xD;
      cultures using the formula: Quantity DNA=10(ct-b)/m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Interleukin-1, Interleukin-6, Adiponectin and Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha&#xD;
      level in Serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reagents were allowed to reach room temperature before use and were gently mixed prior to&#xD;
      the experiments. Number of 8-well strips needed for the assay was determined. 100 ul of the&#xD;
      Standard Diluent Buffer were added to zero wells and 1 well was reserved for chromogen blank.&#xD;
      100 ul of standards, samples and controls were added to the appropriate microtiter wells. 50&#xD;
      ul of biotinylated anti-Interleukin-6 (Biotin Conjugate) solution were pipetted into each&#xD;
      well except the chromagen blank and then gently tapped on the side of the plate to mix. Next,&#xD;
      plates were covered with plate covers and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.&#xD;
      Solutions were thoroughly aspirated from wells and the liquid discarded. The wells were&#xD;
      washed 4 times. 100 ul streptavidin-histidine-rich protein working solution were added to&#xD;
      each well except the chromogen blank. Again, the plates were covered with the plate covers&#xD;
      and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Solution from wells was thoroughly&#xD;
      aspirated and the liquid discarded. The wells were washed 4 times. 100ul of Stabilized&#xD;
      Chromogen was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room&#xD;
      temperature in the dark. 100 ul of stop solution was added to each well and then gently&#xD;
      tapped on the side of the plate to mix. The absorbance of each well was read at 450 nm having&#xD;
      blanked the plate reader against a chromogen blank composed of 100 ul each of Stabilized&#xD;
      Chromogen and Stop Solution. The absorbance of the standards against the standard&#xD;
      concentration was then plotted on graph paper.&#xD;
