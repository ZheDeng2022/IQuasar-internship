  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of&#xD;
      antibiotics. GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram positive&#xD;
      including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative pathogens&#xD;
      associated with respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections including isolates&#xD;
      resistant to existing classes of antimicrobials. This is a First Time in Human (FTIH) study&#xD;
      to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GSK2140944&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. This study will be a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-rising study in healthy subjects. The proposed single doses will range from 100 mg to&#xD;
      3000 mg.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of&#xD;
      antibiotics which is being developed for treatment of Gram positive [including methicillin&#xD;
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)] and Gram-negative pathogens associated with&#xD;
      respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections including isolates resistant to&#xD;
      existing classes of antimicrobials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study BTZ114595 will be the first administration of GSK2140944 in humans. This study will&#xD;
      examine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of&#xD;
      GSK2140944. The predicted clinical target for efficacy, based on preclinical efficacy models,&#xD;
      is an AUC(0-24) of 16-30 Î¼g.h/mL. This study aims to explore the safety and tolerability at&#xD;
      and above target exposures in order to establish a therapeutic window for this compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating&#xD;
      single oral doses of GSK2140944.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind study to determine safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GSK2140944 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The projected single escalating doses of GSK2140944 will range from a starting dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      to a maximum dose of 3000 mg. The current plan is to administer the study drug after an&#xD;
      overnight fast, but based on emerging PK and safety data, it may be necessary to administer&#xD;
      the study drug under fed state to better understand safety, tolerability or PK of GSK2140944.&#xD;
      Any decision to remove or modify fasting requirements will be made by the GSK Study Team and&#xD;
      the investigator based on joint review of the emerging safety, tolerability and preliminary&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data from prior dose-levels.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin â¤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ranging from 18 to 60 years of age, at the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent. Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential defined as&#xD;
             pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and&#xD;
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;

             a 285 mL glass of full strength beer or 425 mL schooner of light beer or 1 (30 mL)&#xD;
             measure of spirits or 1 glass (100 mL) of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new&#xD;
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the&#xD;
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;

             hours prior to the first dose of study medication. However, the investigator and study&#xD;
             team can review medication use on a case by case basis to determine if its use would&#xD;
             compromise subject safety or interfere with study procedures or data interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pummelos,&#xD;
             exotic citrus fruits or grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices containing such products&#xD;

             an IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,&#xD;
             subdermal implants or a tubal ligation, if engaging in sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             female partner who could become pregnant. This criterion must be followed from the&#xD;
             time of study medication administration and until 84 days after study medication&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,&#xD;
             contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinical&#xD;
             research unit uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).&#xD;
&#xD;
