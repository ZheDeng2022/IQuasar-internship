  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical objective of this study was to determine the effect of BIRB 796 BS on&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic markers of psoriasis as a measure of efficacy, to determine the population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of BIRB 796 BS and to determine the safety of BIRB 796 BS over 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment in patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stable moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis involving ≥5% body&#xD;
             surface area&#xD;

             double-barrier) and have a negative serum pregnancy test upon screening (Visit 1) and&#xD;
             a negative urine test prior to randomization (Visit 2) into the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Give informed consent and sign an approved consent form prior to any study procedures,&#xD;
             including washout of prohibited medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psoriasis which has failed to improve significantly with systemic treatments such as&#xD;
             cyclosporine or methotrexate. Patients resistant to one, but have had a documented&#xD;
             response to another may be included with approval of the medical monitor. Treatment&#xD;
             failure will not include failure to improve if a full course of treatment was unable&#xD;
             to be completed due to adverse events, intolerance of the treatment or administrative&#xD;
             reasons&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced treatment failure with a TNF-blocking agent. Treatment&#xD;
             failure is defined as not achieving at least a 40% reduction in PASI score or having&#xD;
             the TNF-blocking agent discontinued due to lack of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to wash out of all current psoriasis treatments (systemic, topical and&#xD;
             phototherapy) except emollients and shampoos prior to beginning trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking the following medications known to elevate liver enzymes who have not&#xD;
             been taking these medications at a stable dose for at least 1 month (3 months for&#xD;
             diclofenac) without changes to liver functions tests (LFTs) prior to randomization&#xD;
             (Visit 2): estrogens, oral contraceptives, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
             (SSRIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetominophen ≤3 g/day,&#xD;

             doses of acetaminophen greater than three grams per day are excluded. Any other&#xD;
             medication known to elevate hepatic enzymes not listed above is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using any of the medications listed in the protocol, without the appropriate&#xD;
             washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion. All&#xD;
             patients with a serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate&#xD;
             transaminase , alkaline phosphatase greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or&#xD;
             total bilirubin greater than 1.0 x ULN will be excluded regardless of the clinical&#xD;
             condition. Patients with serum creatinine, white blood cell (WBC) count, amylase,&#xD;

             schistocytes greater than 1.0 x ULN will also be excluded. Patients with&#xD;
             hemoglobinuria or proteinuria greater than 1+ will be excluded. Hemoglobinuria must be&#xD;
             confirmed as hematuria with finding of red blood cell (RBC) on microscopic&#xD;
             examination. Hematuria in a menstruating female will not require exclusion but must be&#xD;
             repeated after menses has cleared prior to entry. Repeat laboratory testing is allowed&#xD;
             once at screening prior to excluding the patient, to avoid excluding patients with&#xD;
             transient or erroneous abnormal laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;

             risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the&#xD;
             results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study&#xD;

          -  Any ECG value outside of the reference range of clinical relevance including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, QTcB &gt;480 ms, PR interval &gt;240 ms, QRS interval &gt;110 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy in the past 5 years except treated cutaneous squamous cell or&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active immunodeficiency or active infection, or any serious infection (requiring&#xD;
             hospitalization or IV/intramuscular antibiotics) in the past 3 months prior to&#xD;

             B or hepatitis C will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior tuberculosis infection or active tuberculosis, patients must have a&#xD;
             negative skin test or chest x-ray within the past 6 months prior to screening (Visit&#xD;
             1)&#xD;
