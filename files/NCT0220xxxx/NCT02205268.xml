      Background Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently&#xD;
      diagnosed behavioural disorders in childhood that requires treatment(3-5% of children). It is&#xD;
      an important health problem because it impairs social, educational and occupational&#xD;
      performance, and increases the risk of other psychiatric disorders including anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and substance misuse. There is no cure for ADHD and standard stimulant medication&#xD;
      treatment is at best symptomatic. Moreover, stimulants have side effects and parents are&#xD;
      often concerned over the long-term effects. A number of non-drug treatments have been&#xD;
      developed but these do not target the brain directly. Neurofeedback Training (NTx) is a new,&#xD;
      non-drug treatment that targets the brain directly and that can potentially enhance the&#xD;
      control of attention in ADHD. NTx could be a valuable alternative and/or adjunct to standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Although NTx has gained popularity in Europe and the US, more rigorous studies are&#xD;
      required to support its implementation in the NHS. We therefore propose a pilot study to&#xD;
      establish tolerabilty and safety, and to develop treatment protocols and collect data to&#xD;
      design a follow-on controlled NTx trial in ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We plan an open label, single arm, treatment trial of near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      neurofeedback training of frontal lobe activation in school-aged children with ADHD. 48&#xD;
      participants will be recruited over 1 year and will be offered 20 NTx sessions over 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Mental Health Services. Primary outcomes will be safety&#xD;
      and tolerability and secondary outcomes will include standard clinical behavioural rating&#xD;
      scales and the Test Of the Variables of Attention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in childhood and at least half of&#xD;
      patients have symptoms that persist into adulthood. It is important to seek effective&#xD;
      treatments for ADHD because children with ADHD often do not reach their full potential and&#xD;
      are at increased risk of other psychiatric difficulties in childhood, adolescence and&#xD;
      adulthood, including disorders of mood, anxiety, conduct and substance misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly the available evidence suggest that ADHD may be the result of abnormal levels of&#xD;
      certain chemicals and altered brain function. Standard treatment with stimulant medications&#xD;
      are aimed at the chemical imbalance and whilst they may help some children, they are of&#xD;
      limited benefit in others and of no benefit in more than a quarter of children. Parents are&#xD;
      often reluctant to consider medication due to concerns over side effects and the unknown&#xD;
      longer term effects of these drugs on their children's developing brains and bodies. Non-&#xD;
      drug treatments can provide an alternative and/or adjunct that may overcome some of the&#xD;
      concerns about the long-term side effects of drugs. Furthermore, the latest guidelines from&#xD;
      the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2008) recommend that medication should&#xD;
      only be used as a first-line treatment in severe cases of ADHD. In all other cases it is&#xD;
      advised that children receive a group treatment programme and that parents or carers receive&#xD;
      parent training and education on ADHD. Whilst these guidelines have been welcomed for&#xD;
      promoting alternatives to medication for treating ADHD,concerns have been raised about the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of the recommended group interventions for children and individual&#xD;
      treatments may be easier to implement and more effective for these children. Therefore,&#xD;
      although there are a number of treatments for ADHD, they have limitations in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy, tolerability, side effects and practicability. There is therefore a clear rational&#xD;
      to investigate new treatments that may be superior in efficacy or valuable as additional or&#xD;
      alternative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several individual, non-drug interventions for ADHD have emerged over the last thirty years.&#xD;
      These include at home parental guidance, classroom based teacher intervention, behavioural&#xD;
      therapy, herbal treatment and nutritional supplements. Neurofeedback training appears one of&#xD;
      the most promising because the technique directly targets brain functioning in key areas.&#xD;
      Neurofeedback training (NTx) uses signals directly from the brain to make subjects aware of&#xD;
      brain function. It is an established treatment in epilepsy, migraine and stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Abnormal brain function (electrical and blood flow) has been consistently&#xD;
      demonstrated in ADHD and may therefore be targeted with neurofeedback. These findings have&#xD;
      formed the basis for considering NTx as a potential alternative to medication in the&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compelling evidence from recent controlled studies indicate that NTx that uses electric brain&#xD;
      signals (EEG) is a useful treatment in ADHD and that the effects last for at least 6 months.&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy neurofeedback (NIRS) neurofeedback training (NIRS NTx) is a newer&#xD;
      alternative to EEG NTx. It is easier to administer and may require fewer treatment sessions.&#xD;
      NIRS can determine changes in brain activity by measuring changes in the amount of oxygen in&#xD;
      the brain. Rather than requiring subjects to alter the pattern of electrical brain activity,&#xD;
      NIRSNTx trains subjects to alter blood flow in specific brain areas. Abnormal brain blood&#xD;
      flow has been demonstrated in ADHD and typically, these abnormalities include reduced&#xD;
      activity of brain areas just behind the forehead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS NTx is a low cost technique and it can be applied at home, clinic or school. NIRS can&#xD;
      safely be applied to the head because the low energy light used for the technique do not&#xD;
      cause damage to underlying tissues and is less than 5% of the exposure that occurs in&#xD;
      ordinary midday sunlight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRSNTx is performed using a laptop computer, spectroscope, sensor headband and headphones.&#xD;
      Typically, patients watch a film on the computer screen whilst wearing the sensor headband&#xD;
      and headphones. The headband applies two light sources (red and infrared) and a sensor to the&#xD;
      skin overlying the brain area of interest. No special preparation of the skin is necessary.&#xD;
      The lights shine through the skin and skull into the brain, where it is absorbed in different&#xD;
      quantities depending on the amount of oxygen carried in the blood. Some of the light that is&#xD;
      not absorbed is reflected back to the sensor. This signal is analysed in the spectroscope and&#xD;
      data are sent to the computer where it is interpreted by software that generates the&#xD;
      feedback. Increased blood flow results in positive reinforcement (the film clip advances) and&#xD;
      reduced blood flow results in negative reinforcement (the film clip stops and a monotone&#xD;
      auditory signal is heard). Subjects learn how to spontaneously increase blood flow to the&#xD;
      brain region of interest to enjoy uninterrupted viewing of the film clips. Consequently, NIRS&#xD;
      can provide realtime biofeedback to subjects regarding blood flow in specific brain areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical session of NIRS NTx involves 10 minutes of training at two brain sites. In view of&#xD;
      known haemodynamic changes in ADHD and the functional neuroanatomy of attentional control,&#xD;
      these sites would be the right and left prefrontal areas. Treatment sessions are offered once&#xD;
      or twice weekly for between 15 and 48 sessions. There are no published tolerability data, and&#xD;
      available reports come from personal communications with clinicians. The only side effect&#xD;
      reported is mild headache that is short lived and self-limiting, immediately after training&#xD;
      or on the day following, in around 10% of patients. Clinical observations suggest this&#xD;
      predicts a good response to NTx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofeedback treatment mechanism The human brain has a lifelong capacity to adapt to changes&#xD;
      by reorganising itself. This ability is called plasticity and partly works through changes in&#xD;
      bloodflow. Examples of plasticity in adults include finding that brain activation leads to&#xD;
      brain growth, rewiring of neurons following stroke, larger brain areas dedicated to moving&#xD;
      the fingers of musicians, and enlargement of certain brain areas in London cab drivers.&#xD;
      NIRSNTx may act in part by enhancing the brain's capacity for plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, available evidence suggests that NIRS NTx appears safe and capable of targeting&#xD;
      specific brain areas that show reduced activity in ADHD.&#xD;
