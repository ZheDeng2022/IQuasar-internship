    <textblock>
      This protocol describes the investigation of the use of hyperpolarised helium magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) in reflecting the regional differences in lung function of moderate&#xD;
      to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since finalisation of the original protocol, new medications for COPD have received Market&#xD;
      Authorisation Approvals. Protocol Amendment 02 has been prepared to include these medications&#xD;
      in the protocol eligibility criteria and restrictions for the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity, mortality,&#xD;
      and healthcare costs worldwide. COPD is characterized by progressive airflow limitation that&#xD;
      is not fully reversible and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs&#xD;
      to noxious particles or gases. It has become clear that simple measures of airflow&#xD;
      obstruction are inadequate to relate lung function to exercise capacity or symptoms, and that&#xD;
      complex expressions such as dynamic hyper-inflation need to be invoked in seeking to&#xD;
      understand overall physiology. In addition to abnormalities of air flow, gas exchange is also&#xD;
      deranged. Therefore in considering new treatment approaches, both abnormalities need to be&#xD;
      addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques to study ventilation variation and perfusion matching across the lung exist but&#xD;
      are invasive and exacting, and do not give an indication of the anatomical distribution of&#xD;
      changes. There is a clear need for techniques which can provide sensitive, useful and safe&#xD;
      repeated measures reflecting regional changes in ventilation and gas exchange in COPD. This&#xD;
      study investigates use of hyperpolarised helium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in&#xD;
      reflecting the regional differences in lung function of moderate to severe COPD patients. A&#xD;
      Beta2 bronchodilator - Salbutamol - and a anticholinergic - Ipratropium - will be used in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

             admissions to hospital, and with neither antibiotic therapy nor systemic steroid use&#xD;
