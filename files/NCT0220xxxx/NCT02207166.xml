  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical devices are designed and manufactured by subjective design process that was only&#xD;
      based on engineers' direct concepts to essential principles sets for the device. A home user&#xD;
      may not easily use or operate the piece of medical device through the interfacing components&#xD;
      as the designer's expected such as the meaning when pushing a button or switching a knob,&#xD;
      even the required procedure needed when a certain display shown to fulfill some knowledge&#xD;
      dependent judgment. In addition, the incompatible interfacing designed communication between&#xD;
      a user and the device may cause possible errors that may trigger further negative&#xD;
      consequences during the use of the device to a innocent home user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to closely understand the consequent results of human factor&#xD;
      engineering or usability engineering practices of various types or models of marketed&#xD;
      home-use blood pressure monitors (BPM) in real use.&#xD;

      The aim of this research is to closely understand the consequent results of human factor&#xD;
      engineering or usability engineering practices of various types or models of marketed&#xD;
      home-use blood pressure monitors (BPM) in real use. Participants of the intended user&#xD;
      population interact with marketed BPMs in research to assess ease of learning, ease of use,&#xD;
      effectiveness and efficiency of use, memorability, safety, and/or user appeal among the many&#xD;
      possible attributes of interest. With these understanding and analysis of human factors&#xD;
      engineering / usability engineering (HFE/UE) practiced status, it can help manufacturers to&#xD;
      capture the required and diversified HFE/UE essences with the minimum or limited professional&#xD;
      technical resources in hand some more efficiently.&#xD;
