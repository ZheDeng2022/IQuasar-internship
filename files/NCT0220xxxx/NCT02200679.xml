    <textblock>
      The aims of the national population-based study on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) include:&#xD;
      (1) to understand the overall prevalence of ASD in children aged 6-12 years in 8 cities&#xD;
      (n=120,000), (2) to explore environmental and genetic risk factors associated with ASD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, cross-sectional study involing eight cities. The program includes&#xD;
      a prevalence study and a risk factors analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence study on ASD To estimate the national prevalence of ASD in Chinese pediatric&#xD;
           population aged 6-12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Target population This 4-year study is initiated in the year of 2013 in eight&#xD;
           cities of China . For each city, 3 communities with different economic levels were&#xD;
           chosen including all children born within Jan 2001 to Dec 2007 (ages 6-12 years at&#xD;
           screening) with local residency or have lived in the community over 6 months. The ASD&#xD;
           children who are attending special education schools and meet with the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria will also be included in the prevalence estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Sample size Based on the previous regional studies , we plan to recruit approx.15,&#xD;
           000 subjects for each city (average. 5,000 subjects for each community), and 120,000&#xD;
           subjects in total then comprise the national study sample. The plan will be updated,&#xD;
           based on the prevalence obtained in the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Screening and diagnosis The screening tool will be chosen from Autism Spectrum&#xD;
           Rating Scale (ASRS) or SRS（Social Responsiveness Scale） after pilot study.The&#xD;
           questionnaire is a parent-administered form that takes approximately 15-20 minutes to&#xD;
           complete. Parents of recruied children were invited to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
           Parents of all questionnaire screen-positive children will be contacted for appointing&#xD;
           further diagnostic evaluations. Children whose parents could not be reached are&#xD;
           classified as non-responders. The DSM-Ⅳ, ADI-R and ADOS (ADI-R: Autism Diagnosis&#xD;
           Interview-Revised, ADOS: Autism Diagnosis Observation Scales) are used for diagnostic&#xD;
           evaluations. Co-morbidities, such as epilepsy and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
           Disorder )after aditional medical examinations such as, EEG(electroencephalogram), head&#xD;
           circumference, anthropometrics, allergies, sleep patterns, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk Factors study on ASD A classic case-control design is applied to explore the risk&#xD;
           factors of ASD. 2.1. Study subjects 2.1.1. Cases and control Cases were children living&#xD;
           in target communities who are identified as positive based on questionnaire screen and&#xD;
           the subsequent diagnosis with DSM-Ⅳ, ADOS and ADI-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls were children who are screened to be negative and matched to cases by age, gender,&#xD;
      and class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Environmental pollutants exposures Given the hypothesis that environmental factors might&#xD;
      play a role in the etiology of ASD, we will analyze the biological samples of the subjects to&#xD;
      investigate environmental exposures including chronic lead exposure, pesticides exposure, and&#xD;
      endocrine disruptors exposure , for which, hair, blood, and urine will be collected for cases&#xD;
      and controls. The detailed protocol for the measurement of each kind of biological sample has&#xD;
      been introduced everywhere (see the references in individual block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Analysis of other potential risk factors This study will also analyze the association&#xD;
      between the onset of ASD and other risk factors, including diet (), living&#xD;
      environment(),perinatal characteristics of parents, feeding history, baby growth and&#xD;
      development after birth by using questionnaire and reviewing medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. Genetic analysis We are going to use the targeted area capture technology developed&#xD;
      before and HiSeq2000, the second generation of high throughput sequencing platform, to carry&#xD;
      out the molecular diagnosis screening (monogenic disease). Also, we will screen through Trio&#xD;
      those ASD-related genetic mutations that are of high credibility and occur frequently so as&#xD;
      to classify ASDs according to their definite etiologies.Furthermore, we will continue the&#xD;
      study on the distribution of ASD relevant gene mutations among patients in China, which will&#xD;
      lay a solid foundation for further studies of molecular epidemiology.Meanwhile, we will also&#xD;
      apply genome-wide sequencing technology on the positive cases so as to find new mutation that&#xD;
      might serve as potential molecular markers facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of ASDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study involving 4 cities (n=400 for each, in total n&gt;=1600)will be conducted to test&#xD;
      all methodology that will be applied in the prevalence study. A diagnostic study will be&#xD;
      performed to evalute the performance of ASRS and SRS in screening ASD, one of which will be&#xD;
      applied in the main study.&#xD;
