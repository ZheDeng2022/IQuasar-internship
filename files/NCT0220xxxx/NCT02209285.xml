  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multimorbidity move between multiple care settings, and so they are at high&#xD;
      risk of receiving fragmented care leading to increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and&#xD;
      health care costs. Recent Canadian studies and reports identify significant gaps in the&#xD;
      delivery of effective care to patients with multiple chronic conditions in community-based&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the intervention is to promote successful management of chronic&#xD;
      conditions, enhance quality of life, reduce the on-demand use of expensive health services&#xD;
      and support primary caregivers (i.e. family or friends) who provide physical, emotional or&#xD;
      financial care to an older adult with multimorbidity. This research program will leverage the&#xD;
      tremendous potential to reduce the burden of multimorbidity by enhancing community-based&#xD;
      prevention and chronic disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic mixed-methods randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an interprofessional team-based self-management intervention on health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL), depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and the costs of use of health services for&#xD;
      older adults with multimorbidity receiving home care and their family caregivers. The results&#xD;
      will inform: (1) the development of national standards for community-based care for patients&#xD;
      with multimorbidity and (2) the development of a new and innovative community-based model for&#xD;
      the management of multimorbidity that can be scaled up and spread across Canada.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the acceptability and effects of a six-month self-management program compared to&#xD;
      usual home care services for older adults with multimorbidity and their family and friend&#xD;
      caregivers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a pragmatic, mixed-methods; randomized controlled trial with individuals newly&#xD;
      referred to and using home care services. The intervention is a 6-month self-management&#xD;
      program for older adults with multimorbidity. It will be provided by an interprofessional&#xD;
      team of home care providers and will consist of three components: (1) intensive case&#xD;
      management to facilitate access to services across the care continuum, provide psychosocial&#xD;
      support and advocacy, and coordinate home care; (2) a minimum of two in-home visits by the&#xD;
      Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) Case Manager, two visits by the Registered Nurse (RN),&#xD;
      three visits by the Physiotherapist (PT) or Occupational Therapist (OT), and six visits by a&#xD;
      Personal Support Worker (PSW) over 6 months in addition to usual home care services. The&#xD;
      in-home visit schedule and team composition will be tailored to client needs and will be&#xD;
      determined in collaboration with the home care providers. The interprofessional (IP) team&#xD;
      will conduct comprehensive screening and assessments for chronic conditions, utilize&#xD;
      strengths-based practice to encourage self-management and foster behavioural change, provide&#xD;
      education for multimorbidity, medication review and management, in-home exercise, and&#xD;
      caregiver support; and (3) monthly interprofessional team case conferences to develop an IP&#xD;
      evidence-based, patient-centred care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6 months. Summary descriptive measures will be&#xD;
      reported for all variables. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare study groups,&#xD;
      while adjusting for baseline measurements and potential confounding variables. Subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted based on sex/gender and region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that older adults receiving the intervention will show greater improvements in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life compared to usual home care services. These improvements will&#xD;
      be achieved at no additional cost, from a societal perspective.&#xD;
