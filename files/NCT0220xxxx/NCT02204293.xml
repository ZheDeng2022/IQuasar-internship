    <measure>Core Study Part I: Percentage of Responders as Assessed by Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Responders included participants with change in disease activity score based on 28 joint counts and ESR (DAS28) score &gt; 1.2. The DAS28 score index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity score, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value. Total score ranged between 0-10. A DAS28-ESR score of 5.1 or above = high disease activity, a value between 3.2 and 5.1 = moderate disease activity and value between 2.6 and 3.2 = low disease activity, value &lt; 2.6 = disease remission.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) took part in the study from June 21, 2012 to May 5, 2018 at 14 investigative sites located in Germany to participate in two double-blind parts - Part I (Up to Week 12) and Part II (Up to Week 24) and one open-label Long-Term Extension (LTE) phase (Up to Month 27).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 36 participants entered in Part I to receive canakinumab/placebo. Out of 31, 5 participants from canakinumab arm, and 3 from placebo arm did not enter Part II, 23 participants entered Part II and received canakinumab or placebo up to Week 24. 7 participants who achieved clinical remission entered LTE Phase to receive canakinumab.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Responders included participants with change in disease activity score based on 28 joint counts and ESR (DAS28) score &gt; 1.2. The DAS28 score index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity score, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value. Total score ranged between 0-10. A DAS28-ESR score of 5.1 or above = high disease activity, a value between 3.2 and 5.1 = moderate disease activity and value between 2.6 and 3.2 = low disease activity, value &lt; 2.6 = disease remission.</description>

        <title>Core Study Part I: CFB in DAS28 C-reactive Protein (CRP) Score</title>
        <description>The DAS28 index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity score, and CRP value. Total score ranged between 0-10. A DAS28-CRP score of 5.1 or above = high disease activity, a value between 3.2 and 5.1 = moderate disease activity and value between 2.6 and 3.2 = low disease activity, value &lt; 2.6 = disease remission. A positive change in score indicates worsening, and a negative change indicates improvement. LS mean was calculated by MMRM analyses.</description>

        <population>ITT population included all participants who did not violate any of the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease and disease activity based on DAS28 score of ≥ 3.2 at Screening.

        <title>Core Study Part I: CFB in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Component: 68 Tender Joint Count (TJC)</title>
        <description>The 68 TJC included the 8 distal interphalangeal (IP), 10 proximal IP and 10 metacarpophalangeal (MTP) joints of hands, the 10 MTP and 10 proximal IP joints of feet, the 2 wrists, 2 elbows, 2 shoulders, 2 acromioclavicular, 2 sternoclavicular, 2 temporomandibular, 2 hip, 2 knee, 2 talo-tibial, and 2 mid-tarsal joints. Joint tenderness was graded present (1) or absent (0). Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which range from 0 (no tender joint) to 68 (all tender joints). Lower scores indicate no tender joint and higher scores indicate worsening tender joints. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LS mean was calculated by MMRM analyses.</description>

        <title>Core Study Part I: CFB in ACR Component: 66 Swollen Joint Count (SJC)</title>
        <description>The 66 SJC included the 8 distal interphalangeal (IP), 10 proximal IP and 10 metacarpophalangeal (MTP) joints of hands, the 10 MTP and 10 proximal IP joints of feet, the 2 wrists, 2 elbows, 2 shoulders, 2 acromioclavicular, 2 sternoclavicular, 2 temporomandibular, 2 knee, 2 talo-tibial, and 2 mid-tarsal joints. Swelling was graded present (1) or absent (0). Total score is calculated by adding the scores, which range from 0 (no swollen joint) to 66 (all swollen joints). Lower scores indicate no swollen joint and higher scores indicate worsening swollen joints. A negative change in Baseline indicates improvement. LS mean was calculated by MMRM analyses.</description>

        <description>The HAQ measures physical disability and functional status. It has 4 dimensions: disability, pain, drug side effects and dollar costs. The HAQ score is calculated by summing the computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. It ranges from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. LS mean was calculated by MMRM analyses.</description>

        <description>EULAR response is based on DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP scores. The DAS28 index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, subject global assessment of disease activity score, and ESR or CRP value. A DAS28-CRP or ESR score of 5.1 or above = high disease activity, a value between 3.2 and 5.1 = moderate disease activity and value between 2.6 and 3.2 = low disease activity, value &lt; 2.6 = disease remission. EULAR response has 3 categories: EULAR Good response: DAS28 ≤ 3.2 and a change from Baseline &lt; -1.2.

          <title>Core Study Part I: Percentage of Responders Achieving Disease Remission and Extended Disease Remission</title>
          <description>Participants with disease remission: LDA (DAS28 score&lt; 2.6). The DAS28 index is a composite score of weighted components including both 28 TJC an SJC, participant global assessment of disease activity score, and ESR or CRP value. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1: high disease activity, ≤ 3.2: low disease activity, and less than 2.6: remission. Extended remission criteria included DAS28 &lt; 2.6 and no signs of systemic activity for up to two consecutive study visits till Week 12 defined as any of Yamaguchi´s primary classification criteria for AOSD which included fever attacks at 39 °C for more than a week, arthralgia, salmon red, maculate, urticarial or maculo-papular rash and leukocytosis (white blood cells increase) of &gt; 10000/cubic millimeters (mm^3) with &gt; 80% neutrophils.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all participants who did not violate any of the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease and disease activity based on DAS28 score of ≥ 3.2 at Screening.</population>

        <description>An AE is an adverse medical event which occurs in a participant of the study and which is not necessarily in a causal relationship with the treatment the participant receives. AEs include symptoms of illnesses, as well as every unfavourable and unintended reaction. SAEs are AEs leading to death, are life-threatening, require hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalizations, represent an innate malformation or a congenital abnormality.</description>
