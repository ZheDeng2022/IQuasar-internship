      The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T cell-mediated disorders, i.e.&#xD;
      celiac disease and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic reactions. However, besides&#xD;
      celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten reactions in which neither&#xD;
      autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved. These are generally defined as&#xD;
      GS or Not-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). Typically, NCWS diagnosis is made by exclusion,&#xD;
      and an elimination diet and an &quot;open challenge&quot; (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of&#xD;
      gluten-containing foods) are most often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen&#xD;
      with the elimination or reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively. In some&#xD;
      circumstances, it is very difficult to distinguish between NCWS and celiac disease. The&#xD;
      presence of positive celiac disease specific serum antibodies (anti-tissue transglutaminase&#xD;
      (anti-tTG), and anti-endomysium (EmAs) antibodies) is of paramount importance to pose the&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, it is well known that the frequency of a positive serology is dependent&#xD;
      by the severity of the intestinal damage. Consequently, patients with less severe histology&#xD;
      damage (Marsh 1) can have negative serum antibodies. Previous studies had demonstrated that&#xD;
      EmAs are produced by the intestinal lymphocytes and previous data from our group showed that&#xD;
      EmAs assay in the culture medium of the intestinal biopsies has higher diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      than serum EmAs in diagnosis. Therefore, the aims of our study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical-serologic-histology course of NCWS patients, showing positive EmAs assay in the&#xD;
      culture medium of the duodenal biopsies at the time of the first evaluation, and the&#xD;
      adherence to a gluten-free diet in NCWS patients after a previous full evaluation and a NCWS&#xD;
      diagnosis based on double-blinded placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and&#xD;
      barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed&#xD;
      throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the &quot;engineering&quot; of&#xD;
      gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten&#xD;
      exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions,&#xD;
      including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity (GS), that, combined, seems to&#xD;
      affect about 10% of the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune responsiveness to wheat antigens represents a complex process, and its&#xD;
      establishment and maintenance are not completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases&#xD;
      caused by wheat ingestion are T cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and IgE-mediated&#xD;
      allergic reactions. However, besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of&#xD;
      gluten reactions in which neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are&#xD;
      involved. These are generally defined as GS or Not-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), because&#xD;
      it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms. Some subjects, who&#xD;
      experience symptoms when eating gluten-containing products and show improvement when&#xD;
      following a gluten-free diet (GFD) may have NCWS instead of celiac disease or wheat allergy.&#xD;
      NCWS patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse reaction when eating&#xD;
      gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not lead to small intestinal&#xD;
      damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in NCWS patients may resemble those associated with celiac&#xD;
      disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, NCWS diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an elimination diet and an &quot;open&#xD;
      challenge&quot; (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of gluten-containing foods) are most often&#xD;
      used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen with the elimination or reintroduction of&#xD;
      gluten in the diet, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of NCWS is however still unknown, even though some studies indicated that it is&#xD;
      higher than that of celiac disease; consequently, it is very probable that this condition&#xD;
      have been undiagnosed and under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. However, it is&#xD;
      very difficult, in some circumstances, to distinguish between NCWS and celiac disease. In&#xD;
      fact, NCWS patients can show an intestinal histology characterized by intra-epithelial&#xD;
      lymphocytosis (Marsh 1), a finding considered compatible with a celiac disease diagnosis. In&#xD;
      this difficult, possible, celiac disease diagnosis, the presence of positive specific serum&#xD;
      antibodies (anti-tTG and EmAs) is of paramount importance to pose the diagnosis. However, it&#xD;
      is well known that the frequency of a positive serology is dependent by the severity of the&#xD;
      intestinal damage. Consequently, celiac disease patients with less severe histology damage&#xD;
      (Marsh 1) can have negative serum antibodies. Previous studies had demonstrated that EmAs are&#xD;
      produced by the intestinal lymphocytes and previous data from our group showed that EmAs&#xD;
      assay in the culture medium of the intestinal biopsies has higher diagnostic accuracy than&#xD;
      serum EmAs in celiac disease diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study has one major aim: 1. Evaluation of the clinical-serologic-histology&#xD;
      course of NCWS patients showing positive EmAs assay in the culture medium of the duodenal&#xD;
      biopsies at the time of the first evaluation; and one secondary aim: 2. Evaluation of the&#xD;
      adherence to a GFD in NCWS patients after a previous full evaluation and a NCWS diagnosis&#xD;
      based on double-blinded placebo-controlled (DBPC) challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our research, the investigators will select adult patients, both genders, affected with&#xD;
      NCWS (i.e. with symptoms/signs which disappeared on gluten-free diet and worsen on a gluten&#xD;
      containing diet, testing negative for celiac disease, [anti-tTG and EmAs negative, and with&#xD;
      biopsy Marsh 0-1] and wheat allergy [serum specific IgE for wheat negative]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include exclusively patients who had been previously fully evaluated&#xD;
      for suspected celiac disease in our Hospitals (Department of Internal Medicine, Giovanni&#xD;
      Paolo II Hospital of Sciacca, Agrigento, and of Internal Medicine of the University of&#xD;
      Palermo) from January 2002 to December 2012. In all patients NCWS diagnosis had been posed by&#xD;
      means of a DBPC challenge with wheat flour. At the time of the first evaluation, gluten-free&#xD;
      diet was not prescribed, but simply suggested, as these patients were not considered as&#xD;
      suffering from celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit, as a study group, those NCWS patients who had showed a&#xD;
      negative celiac disease serology and Marsh 0-1 duodenal histology, but who had displayed a&#xD;
      positive EmAs assay in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies (EmA-biopsy). As control&#xD;
      group, NCWS patients with negative EmA-biopsy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include at least one year before evaluated patients. At the time of&#xD;
      the recruitment it will be evaluated both the adherence to the gluten-free diet, by means of&#xD;
      a previously validated dietary form containing a printed list of the most common foods, and&#xD;
      the symptoms score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, GSRS). Then, the investigators&#xD;
      will re-evaluate the patients for a possible celiac disease diagnosis. Serum anti-tTG IgA and&#xD;
      IgG, anti-deamidated peptides of gliadin (DPG) IgA and IgG, and anti-gliadin (AGA) IgA and&#xD;
      IgG will be assayed. Duodenal biopsies will be taken for histological evaluation and for&#xD;
      culture EmAs assay.&#xD;
