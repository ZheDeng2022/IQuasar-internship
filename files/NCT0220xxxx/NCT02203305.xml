  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to determine whether subjects with Single-Sided Deafness&#xD;
      (SSD) experience an improvement in speech perception, localization, and quality of life with&#xD;
      a cochlear implant as compared to an unaided listening condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-sided deafness (SSD) can be defined as moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss&#xD;
      with limited speech perception benefit in one ear and normal hearing in the contralateral&#xD;
      ear. Though one ear is within the normal hearing limits, SSD may result in reduced speech&#xD;
      perception in noise, variable abilities on localization tasks, increased subjective report of&#xD;
      hearing handicap, and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This patient population cannot utilize conventional amplification due to the severity of the&#xD;
      hearing loss and poor speech discrimination abilities in the affected ear. Current treatment&#xD;
      options include: contralateral routing of the signal (CROS) hearing aids, and bone-conduction&#xD;
      devices. A CROS hearing aid is a two-part system that includes a microphone/transmitter on&#xD;
      the affected ear and a receiver on the normal hearing ear. The microphone/transmitter sends&#xD;
      the acoustic signal from the affected ear to the receiver, which is presented to the normal&#xD;
      hearing ear. Bone-conduction devices utilize a percutaneous, implanted titanium abutment to&#xD;
      send the acoustic signal from the affected side to the normal hearing ear via vibrations. The&#xD;
      goal of both of these technologies is to send the signal from the affected side to the normal&#xD;
      hearing side, thereby leaving the patient in a unilateral listening condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though CROS hearing aids and bone-conduction devices provide the patient with auditory&#xD;
      information from both sides to the better hearing ear, the ability to use binaural cues for&#xD;
      speech perception in noise is variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of interest whether cochlear implantation of the affected ear would benefit the SSD&#xD;
      population. A cochlear implant is a two-part system, including the internal electrode array&#xD;
      and external speech processor. The internal electrode array is surgically implanted into the&#xD;
      affected cochlea. The external speech processor receives sounds and transmits this signal to&#xD;
      the internal portion. The electrode array presents the acoustic signal via electrical pulses&#xD;
      within the cochlea, which is interpreted by the brain as sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presumably, cochlear implantation may provide the SSD population improvements in speech&#xD;
      perception in the affected ear, which cannot benefit from appropriately fit hearing aids.&#xD;
      Cochlear implantation may provide a benefit over current treatment options in the SSD&#xD;
      population, as it stimulates the auditory pathway on the affected side, thus allowing for&#xD;
      ipsilateral representation of acoustic signals arriving to each ear independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this project is to determine whether subjects with SSD experience an&#xD;
      improvement in speech perception, localization, and quality of life with a cochlear implant&#xD;
      as compared to an unaided listening condition. Secondary aims include: 1) a comparison of&#xD;
      speech perception, localization, and quality of life outcomes in the study population to a&#xD;
      SSD control group with long-term listening experience with a current treatment option (i.e.&#xD;
      bone-conduction device), and 2) a within-subject comparison of speech perception and&#xD;
      localization abilities with cochlear implantation versus the bone-conduction test device.&#xD;
