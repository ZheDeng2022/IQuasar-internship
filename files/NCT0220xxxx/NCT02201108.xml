      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on disease activity measured&#xD;
      by time to first clinical relapse after randomization in children and adolescents 10 to 17&#xD;
      years of age with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on disease&#xD;
           activity/progression measured by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and on cognitive&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of teriflunomide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study duration included a screening period up to 4 weeks, a double-blind treatment period&#xD;
      of up to 96 weeks, an open-label period which included the remainder of the initial 96 weeks,&#xD;
      where applicable, and a 96-week extension, i.e., up to a maximum of 192 weeks after&#xD;
      randomization. There was a follow-up period of 4 weeks for participants discontinuing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the 96 weeks double-blind treatment period, the first 4 weeks were PK run-in phase in&#xD;
      which PK samples (blood samples) were collected from participants and then 4 weeks of&#xD;
      analysis (no samples drawn). The PK run-in phase (total 8 weeks) was intended to provide&#xD;
      individual PK parameters to allow the dose adjustment to the 14 milligrams (mg)&#xD;
      adult-equivalent dose for the rest of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who experienced a relapse after the PK run-in phase (8 weeks) and confirmed by&#xD;
      the Relapse Adjudication Panel and participants who fulfilled MRI criteria (high number of&#xD;
      new lesions at weeks 36, 48 or 72 compared to previous images) had the option to continue in&#xD;
      an open-label teriflunomide treatment arm up to 192 weeks from randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional additional extension period is available for young participants with&#xD;
      teriflunomide until the participants are 18 years old and/or able to switch to commercial&#xD;
      product, whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to First Confirmed Clinical Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first clinical relapse was defined as the duration (in weeks) between randomization and first confirmed clinical relapse. Clinical relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon neurological examination and documented by a standardized, quantified functional system score (FSSs) which included 8 items and items were rated on different scales: brain stem, cerebellar and cerebral functions rated on a scale of 0 to 5; visual, pyramidal, sensory and bowel/bladder rated on a scale of 0 to 6 and ambulation on a scale of 0 to 12, where higher score in each scale indicated worsened neurological function. Confirmed clinical relapse were reviewed and confirmed by an independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (RAP). A participant without confirmed clinical relapse, was considered as clinical relapse free until the end of Week 96.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>'Trail Making Test Part A' is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a participant to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive numbers (1,2, 3,etc.) in sequential order on a sheet of paper or computer screen. The goal of the participant is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test used as the primary performance metric (in seconds). This is a timed test and the number of seconds to complete the task is recorded. Maximum time allowed is 300 seconds. A lower score indicates better cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Letter Fluency Total Correct Raw Score at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Letter Fluency is a condition measured in the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Participants are asked to name as many words as they can, starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. The words cannot be names, places, numbers or grammatical variants of previous answers. Repeated answers are not scored as a correct response. There are 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses is totaled for all 3 trials and a Letter Fluency Score is given. A higher score is considered better. There is no set range as the score depends on how many correct words the participant relays in the given time period.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Category Fluency is a condition measured in the D-KEFS. It measures participant's ability to generate words from three different categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables and animals), within a minute for each category. Total score is number of correct words for each category with no points for repetitions or non-words. Score range 0 to unlimited, where 0 = low score, higher score indicates better performance.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment - Selective Reminding Test (SRT): Change From Baseline in Total Number of Words on Delayed Recall at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>SRT is a test to assess verbal learning and memory. During the administration of the SRT only the examiner and the participant should be in the testing room. A list of twelve words is read aloud by the examiner at a rate of one word per two seconds. The participant is asked to recall all twelve words after a 30 minute delay. Only the words that are missed on the preceding trial are given in the consecutive trial. The total score represents a sum score of total 6 trials, therefore the range is from 0-72. The lower the value the worse the outcome, higher value indicates better recall.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted at 57 active centers in 21 countries. A total of 185 participants were screened between 16 July 2014 and 27 December 2017, of which 166 participants were enrolled and randomized. A total of 19 participants failed screening mainly due to meeting exclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either teriflunomide or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (109 teriflunomide and 57 placebo) via Interactive Voice Response System. Randomization was stratified by the country and participant's pubertal status. Data reported based on the primary completion date of 25 October 2019.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Teriflunomide</title>
          <description>Participants received 1 Teriflunomide tablet, 3.5 milligram (mg) (in case of body weight [BW] up to 40 kilogram [kg]) or 7 mg (in case of BW greater than[&gt;] 40 kg) orally QD for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, based on participant's predicted pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, teriflunomide was administered in following manner up to 96 weeks:if predicted PK parameters less than or equal to (&lt;=) 95th percentile of adult range after 7 mg QD:1 tablet of 7 mg daily (for BW up to 40 kg) or 1 tablet of 14 mg daily (for BW&gt;40 kg); or if predicted PK parameters&gt;95th percentile of adult range:1 tablet of 3.5 mg daily (for BW up to 40 kg) or 1 tablet of 7 mg daily (for BW&gt;40 kg). The adult range (5th-95th percentile) of predicted steady state PK parameters for 7 mg dose was defined as maximum concentration observed (Cmax) ranging from 8.03 to 49.10 microgram per milliliter (mcg/mL) and area under the curve from time 0 hour to 24 hours (AUC0-24) ranging from 184 to 1160 microgram*hour per milliliter (mcg*h/mL).</description>

        <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Assessment: Number of New or Enlarged T2 Lesions Per MRI Scan</title>
        <description>Number of new or enlarged T2 lesions per scan was defined as the total number of new or enlarged T2 lesion that occurred during the 96 weeks treatment period divided by the total number of scans performed during 96 weeks. To account for the different numbers of scans performed among the participants, a negative binomial regression model with robust variance estimation was used. The model included the total number of new or enlarged T2-lesions as the response variable, with treatment group, region, pubertal status and age as covariates and log-transformed number of scans as an offset variable.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Total Number of Correct Substitutions Measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at Weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96</title>
        <description>SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. It is a simple substitution task that gives the examinee 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures as a measure for screening cognitive impairment. The score is the number of correct substitution and ranged from 0 (worst outcome) to 110 (best outcome), where higher score indicated better cognitive function.</description>

          <description>SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. It is a simple substitution task that gives the examinee 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures as a measure for screening cognitive impairment. The score is the number of completed items and ranged from 0 (worst outcome) to 110 (best outcome), where higher score indicated better cognitive function.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on ITT population. Here, 'number analyzed' represent the number of participants analyzed for each category.</population>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) Scores at Week 96</title>
        <description>The BVMT consists of three trials in which participants must recall shapes by drawing figures on a blank page (response booklet) after being given the opportunity to memorize the figures (given in BMVT-R form) for 10 seconds. BMVT-R form consists of six figures. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the drawn figure and by correct placement on the blank page. A minimum of 0 to 12 points/scores are awarded per trial, so a participant can score between 0 and 36 points for all three trials (by adding the points/score from each trial), where higher score indicates better outcome.</description>

        <description>'Trail Making Test Part A' is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a participant to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive numbers (1,2, 3,etc.) in sequential order on a sheet of paper or computer screen. The goal of the participant is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test used as the primary performance metric (in seconds). This is a timed test and the number of seconds to complete the task is recorded. Maximum time allowed is 300 seconds. A lower score indicates better cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Beery Visual-motor Integration (BVMI) Scores at Week 96</title>
        <description>The Beery VMI is a non-verbal assessment that assessed the extent to which individuals can integrate their visual and motor abilities. The participants were provided with geometric designs ranging from simple line drawings to more complex figures and were asked to copy the designs. The test consisted of 24 figures. One point was scored for each successful copy of drawings and no scoring was given when the participant failed to copy the drawings properly. Each successful copying of drawings was summed up and the total was scored on a scale ranged from 0 to 24, where higher score indicated better visual construction skills/better visual and motor abilities and lower score indicated poor visual construction skills/poor visual and motor abilities.</description>

One point was scored for each successful copy of drawings and no scoring was given when the participant failed to copy the drawings properly. Each successful copying of drawings was summed up and the total was scored on a scale ranged from 0 to 24, where higher score indicated better visual construction skills/better visual and motor abilities and lower score indicated poor visual construction skills/poor visual and motor abilities.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II (WASI-II) Vocabulary Total Raw Scores at Week 96</title>
        <description>The WASI-II: Vocabulary test is a quick estimate of an individual's level of intellectual functioning which comprised of 31 total items that require the participant to orally define 3 images and 28 words presented both orally and visually. Items 1 to 3 rated on a score of 0 or 1, items 4 and 5 rated on a score of 0 or 2, items 6 to 31 rated on a scale of 0 to 2. Each item score was summed up to derive the total score which was ranged from 0 (minimum score) to 59 (maximum score), where higher score indicated better level of intellectual functioning/higher level of intelligence.</description>

        <description>Letter Fluency is a condition measured in the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Participants are asked to name as many words as they can, starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. The words cannot be names, places, numbers or grammatical variants of previous answers. Repeated answers are not scored as a correct response. There are 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses is totaled for all 3 trials and a Letter Fluency Score is given. A higher score is considered better. There is no set range as the score depends on how many correct words the participant relays in the given time period.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment - Selective Reminding Test (SRT): Change From Baseline in Total Number of Words on Delayed Recall at Week 96</title>
        <description>SRT is a test to assess verbal learning and memory. During the administration of the SRT only the examiner and the participant should be in the testing room. A list of twelve words is read aloud by the examiner at a rate of one word per two seconds. The participant is asked to recall all twelve words after a 30 minute delay. Only the words that are missed on the preceding trial are given in the consecutive trial. The total score represents a sum score of total 6 trials, therefore the range is from 0-72. The lower the value the worse the outcome, higher value indicates better recall.</description>

          <description>Participants received 1 Teriflunomide tablet, 3.5 mg (in case of BW up to 40 kg) or 7 mg (in case of BW &gt;40 kg) orally QD for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, based on participant's predicted PK parameters, teriflunomide was administered in following manner up to 96 weeks: if predicted PK parameters &lt;= 95th percentile of adult range after 7 mg QD: 1 tablet of 7 mg daily (for BW up to 40 kg) or 1 tablet of 14 mg daily (for BW &gt;40 kg); or if predicted PK parameters &gt;95th percentile of adult range: 1 tablet of 3.5 mg daily (for BW up to 40 kg) or 1 tablet of 7 mg daily (for BW &gt;40 kg). The adult range (5th - 95th percentile) of predicted steady state PK parameters for a 7 mg dose was defined as Cmax ranging from 8.03 to 49.10 mcg/mL and AUC0-24 ranging from 184 to 1160 mcg*h/mL.</description>
