      The objective of this protocol is to pilot an innovative approach to medication adherence to&#xD;
      determine if such an approach will improve inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication adherence,&#xD;
      a critical gap in improving the health of children with asthma. SNAPP incorporates&#xD;
      monitoring, reminders, and dynamic feedback through a smartphone that will improve ICS&#xD;
      medication adherence and that the investigators believe will influence the child's future&#xD;

      The objective of this protocol is to pilot an innovative approach to medication adherence to&#xD;
      determine if such an approach will improve inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medication adherence,&#xD;
      a critical gap in improving the health of children with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute asthma exacerbations occur yearly in almost 60% of children with asthma. They are the&#xD;
      most frequent reason for childhood hospitalization and the most expensive component of&#xD;
      pediatric asthma care in the U.S. Exacerbations impair quality of life and disproportionately&#xD;
      affect African-American children, children with Medicaid insurance, and the poor. Up to 70%&#xD;
      of exacerbations are preventable if guideline-recommended inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)&#xD;
      medication adherence is achieved. However, ICS medication adherence in children with&#xD;
      persistent asthma is dismal at only 11 - 18%. Amongst children with Medicaid insurance&#xD;
      prescribed ICS, 63% discontinue the medication within 90 days. As a healthcare system,&#xD;
      investigators have been unable to meaningfully improve ICS medication adherence in a&#xD;
      cost-efficient way for patients with asthma, and particularly for the high-risk,&#xD;
      highest-potential population of children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. These&#xD;
      children suffer the greatest morbidity and mortality from asthma yet have highest-potential&#xD;
      to benefit from improved ICS medication adherence. There is an urgent need for an efficacious&#xD;
      adherence intervention for this population because, without it, these children will continue&#xD;
      to experience impaired health and disproportionate morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' long-term objective is to identify and disseminate an intervention that&#xD;
      will minimize the occurrence and severity of exacerbations in this population. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of Smartphone-facilitated medication&#xD;
      Notification for Asthma Control in Pediatric Patients (SNAPP) using a wireless medication&#xD;
      monitor (WMM) and smartphone application that provides parents reminders for administration&#xD;
      of ICS medication, real-time feedback on preventive and controller medication adherence, and&#xD;
      wireless upload of this data to a secure online database. The central hypothesis is that for&#xD;
      children in this population, SNAPP will result in &gt;=25% improved Asthma Control Test (ACT)&#xD;
      scores in comparison with usual management. Secondary hypotheses are that the intervention&#xD;
      will result in a &gt;= 30% decrease in FeNO in comparison with usual care at 6 months and &gt;=40%&#xD;
      increase in ICS medication adherence at 6 months. The central hypothesis has been formulated&#xD;
      on the basis of reports that parents of children with acute exacerbations continue to have&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge of asthma self-management yet are motivated to do what is best for&#xD;
      their child. SNAPP incorporates monitoring, reminders, and dynamic feedback through a&#xD;
      smartphone that will improve ICS medication adherence and that will influence the child's&#xD;
      future independence and chronic disease-management skills. Importantly, the investigators&#xD;
      will use wireless medication monitors to accurately and objectively ascertain ICS medication&#xD;
      adherence without patient effort. Parents are facile with and use wireless technology to&#xD;
      organize their daily activities and for communicating. Incorporating this technology into&#xD;
      health care and medication adherence is a logical next-step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test the hypotheses through the following Aim: To determine&#xD;
      whether SNAPP meaningfully improves 6-month asthma control measured with the Asthma Control&#xD;
      Test, airway inflammation measured using exhaled nitric oxide and ICS adherence compared with&#xD;
      usual care, in an RCT of children with moderate or severe persistent asthma.&#xD;
