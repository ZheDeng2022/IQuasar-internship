      This is pilot study designed to quantifying the innate immune inflammatory burden in a cohort&#xD;
      of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis subjects. Innate immunity is recognized as a&#xD;
      major cause of tissue injury in central nervous system (CNS) disease. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the innate immune response is heightened in SPMS as compared to healthy controls (HC's) and&#xD;
      this activity increases over time and correlates with ongoing neuronal loss and disability.&#xD;
      The investigators will test this hypothesis by using highly specific molecular imaging&#xD;
      techniques, specifically PET, in conjunction with high field MRI. The investigators will&#xD;
      utilize the PET radioligand [11C]PK11195 which will be used as a marker of activated&#xD;
      macrophages/microglia. The investigators will correlate [11C]PK11195 uptake with conventional&#xD;
      measures of inflammation and neuronal integrity on high-resolution MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPMS subjects will have two baseline [11C]PK-11195 PET scans (separated by 24 to 72 hours,&#xD;
      test-retest) and subsequent scans at 6, 12 and 24 months. SPMS Subjects will have brain MRI's&#xD;
      at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Controls will have 2 baseline PET scans and one MRI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is pilot study designed to determine the baseline and longitudinal regional-specific&#xD;
      change in uptake of [11C]PK-11195 in subjects with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (SPMS). Eighteen subjects with SPMS will be enrolled in the two-year study. Given low sample&#xD;
      size, a stable treatment regimen is required to control for potential treatment effect. In&#xD;
      addition, subjects must have been on current therapy for at least 6 months to ensure the&#xD;
      measurement is reflective of true disease activity and not treatment effect. Thirteen&#xD;
      age-matched healthy controls (HC) will be enrolled. The role of HC is to establish the&#xD;
      variability or &quot;noise&quot; associated with the instrument (test-retest), which will ensure that&#xD;
      PK uptake measured at any time point in MS is biologically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal also includes a sub-study to validate a non-invasive quantification methodology&#xD;
      for PK-PET. The most rigorous method, or gold standard, for quantifying PET data is based&#xD;
      upon measuring the arterial input function. Measuring radioactivity within the arterial&#xD;
      circulation requires arterial cannulation. Arterial cannulation is considered safe; however,&#xD;
      is labor-intensive and often discourages subjects from participation. Image-derived input&#xD;
      function (IDIF) is a method to calculate the input function without cannulation of the artery&#xD;
      using the imaging data. Studies in human research volunteers are still required to compare&#xD;
      the results obtained with classical arterial sampling and the IDIF. The current study will&#xD;
      validate IDIF as a substitute for arterial sampling in this context. All healthy controls&#xD;
      will undergo this validation process, which will include arterial and venous sampling. This&#xD;
      validation is also required within subjects. Subjects will be given the option to participate&#xD;
      in this validation stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute Quantification of PK-PET (gold standard arterial sampling): Catheters will be placed&#xD;
      in the radial artery for characterizing the plasma input function. This will make it possible&#xD;
      to use a two tissue reversible plasma input (2T4k) model. Blood sampling will be acquired&#xD;
      using both an online continuous blood sampling device as well as manually at discrete times&#xD;
      (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes post injection). The continuous sampling will be&#xD;
      used to measure the activity concentrations of the whole blood, while the discrete manual&#xD;
      sampling will be used to calculate the plasma concentration, and estimate the fraction of&#xD;
      radioactive metabolites using HPLC. The total blood loss is estimated to be 8-10 tablespoons&#xD;
      (120-150 mL, or about one third of the amount that volunteers donate to the Red Cross when&#xD;
      giving blood). To generate the plasma input functions, the ratio of the plasma data to whole&#xD;
      blood will be calculated for each manual blood sample and fitted through these points to a&#xD;
      model with a one- or two-exponential function. Metabolite correction will be accomplished by&#xD;
      multiplying the plasma curve with a function obtainable from a fit to the measured parent&#xD;
      fraction. Venous blood will be similarly obtained for IDIF metabolic correction and utilized&#xD;
      for validation against classic arterial sampling. The investigators will acquire up to 6&#xD;
      venous samples of 3 mL each with a 2 mL purge prior to each sample, for a total blood loss of&#xD;
      30 mL (one fluid ounce, or about 6.67% of the amount that volunteers donate to the Red Cross&#xD;
      when giving blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic PET acquisition and processing: The data will be acquired in list mode to facilitate&#xD;
      processing at any dynamic framing rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innate immunity is recognized as a major cause of tissue injury in central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) disease. In this study the investigators will specifically quantify the innate immune&#xD;
      inflammatory burden in a cohort of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) subjects.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the innate immune response is heightened in SPMS as compared to&#xD;
      healthy controls (HC's) and this activity increases over time and correlates with ongoing&#xD;
      neuronal loss and disability. The investigators will test this hypothesis by using highly&#xD;
      specific molecular imaging techniques, specifically PET, in conjunction with high field MRI.&#xD;
      The investigators will utilize the PET radioligand [11C]1533; PK11195 which binds to the&#xD;
      translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) on activated macrophages/microglia. The investigators will&#xD;
      correlate [11C]PK11195 uptake with conventional measures of inflammation and neuronal&#xD;
      integrity on high-resolution MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of central nervous system characterized by focal T cell&#xD;
      and macrophage infiltrates associated with demyelination. The primary innate immune cells in&#xD;
      MS consist of infiltrating macrophages/monocytes and resident microglia. Cells of the innate&#xD;
      immune system are effector cells that function to cause CNS injury both through direct&#xD;
      effects on neighboring cells, such as oligodendrocytes, and through generation of soluble&#xD;
      proinflammatory mediators that have distant effects on cells, such as neurons. The innate&#xD;
      immune inflammatory is thus sufficient to explain focal injury and diffuse injury. In the&#xD;
      majority of subjects, MS begins as a relapsing-remitting course but eventually evolves to a&#xD;
      state of progressive decline in disability. Focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions are the&#xD;
      predominant pathological findings in the subjects with relapsing disease whereas diffuse&#xD;
      axonal injury with microglial activation has been found to be the hallmark of progressive&#xD;
      disease.1 Microglial activation itself occurs either as a response to CNS injury for example&#xD;
      as in Wallerian degeneration, or in response to signals from other inflammatory cells&#xD;
      including macrophages and lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages express TSPO (previously referred to as the&#xD;
      peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) which can be detected with radioligand [11C]PK-111952.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the significance of any [11C]PK-11195 uptake within a cohort of MS subjects&#xD;
      would require a correlation with HCÂ¿s to ensure the observation is a valid measurement of&#xD;
      disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MS subjects will also have two baseline [11C]PK-11195 PET scans (separated by 24 to 72&#xD;
      hours, test-retest) to measure disease related intra-individual variability and will have&#xD;
      subsequent scans at 6, 12 and 24 months. Baseline test-retest [11C]PK-11195 PET uptake&#xD;
      between MS subjects and HC's will be compared to ensure minimal disease-related variability&#xD;
      and to ensure our baseline and subsequent longitudinal measurements in MS subjects have met a&#xD;
      level of biological significance. One baseline brain MRI is required for HC and MS subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will have brain MRI's at 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Aim 1: To quantify level of activity and dynamic change in the innate immune&#xD;
      inflammatory burden over the course of two years in a cohort of SPMS subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Measure the level of baseline and change of whole brain uptake of&#xD;
      [11C]PK-11195 at 6, 12 and 24 months in SPMS subjects.&#xD;
