      RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a &quot;one-size-fits- all&quot;&#xD;
      approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal&#xD;
      receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive&#xD;
      lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma&#xD;
      based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of&#xD;
      a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC&#xD;
      patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer&#xD;
      subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in&#xD;
      reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in&#xD;
      expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as&#xD;
      a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive,&#xD;
      HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or&#xD;
      further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine&#xD;
      treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given&#xD;
      orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant&#xD;
           endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA&#xD;
           expression at baseline and post-treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone&#xD;
             receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm)&#xD;
             radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will&#xD;
             be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation.&#xD;
             Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology&#xD;
             review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to&#xD;
             undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible&#xD;
             or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their&#xD;
             archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27&#xD;
             after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be&#xD;
             obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy&#xD;
             will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In&#xD;
             the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does&#xD;
             not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints,&#xD;
             tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy&#xD;
             if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol&#xD;
             therapy as planned in this unlikely event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial&#xD;
             enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining&#xD;
             is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling&#xD;
             institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial.&#xD;
             Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this&#xD;
             central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. HER2 status will&#xD;
             be determined locally only, based upon current ASCO/CAP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be fully postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by a history and physical exam that&#xD;
             rules out comorbidities that would be exclusions to participation in the study (see&#xD;
             exclusion criteria) and clinical laboratory parameters as deemed clinically&#xD;
             appropriate by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen&#xD;
             and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study&#xD;
             enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study&#xD;
             requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or concurrent use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel&#xD;
             therapy to treat the current breast cancer, including any history of prior irradiation&#xD;
             to the ipsilateral breast. Additionally, the patient must not have had hormonal&#xD;
             therapy for breast cancer treatment or for breast cancer prevention within 2 years&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment. (Note: Synchronous breast, cancer (including bilateral&#xD;
             breast cancer) at separate sites is permissible, provided the patient does not receive&#xD;
             medical treatments for breast cancer or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast&#xD;
             during the 21 day study intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to tamoxifen, anastrozole, or fulvestrant or any of&#xD;
             their ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of thromboembolic disease or uterine cancer that is considered a&#xD;
             contraindication to tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis viral infections or a known history of liver disease, especially&#xD;
             moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) to severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER-2 positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased Risk of bleeding: including a history of a bleeding diathesis and/or known&#xD;
             history of severe thrombocytopenia. NOTE: Anticoagulant use is not a contraindication&#xD;
             to fulvestrant, but caution is advised in administration in patients on&#xD;
             anticoagulation. Patients on anticoagulation who will receive fulvestrant will have PT&#xD;
             and aPTT/INR assessed at baseline.&#xD;
