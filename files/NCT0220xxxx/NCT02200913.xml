  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) present problems in&#xD;
      balance. Alterations in proprioception are the possible causes of alteration of postural&#xD;
      balance in LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies reported an improvement of CSE on joint mobility, pain, functional&#xD;
      disability, and trunk muscle activation pattern in patients with clinical lumbar instability&#xD;
      (CLI); however, it was an immediate effect. However, previous studies did not report indirect&#xD;
      effect may occur in CLI as postural balance and other kinds of exercise as strengthening in&#xD;
      CLI. The general trunk strengthening exercise is common used in physical therapy clinic on&#xD;
      LBP, that improve pain, physical disability, and trunk muscles activity. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      the usefulness of CSE has not yet been investigated in CLI patients with outcome measure of&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will conduct to fill the gaps of previous studies which will provide&#xD;
      immediate-, accumulative- and detraining-effects of CSE on postural balance, pain intensity&#xD;
      and ratio activation of trunk muscles and included blinding process of the assessor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal complaint. In most LBPs, it is benign&#xD;
      and disappears within six weeks, but approximately 20% of individuals with LBP do not show&#xD;
      any improvement in their condition, which may progress to chronic low back pain. LBP not only&#xD;
      interferes with biomechanical change, but also causes ability to work leading to reduced&#xD;
      productivity, economic burden to individuals and society for medical costs Recent studies&#xD;
      indicate that patients with chronic low back pain present diminished postural control,&#xD;
      manifesting problems in balance. Postural balance is controlled by sensory information,&#xD;
      central processing and neuromuscular responses. Alterations in proprioception are the&#xD;
      possible causes of alteration of postural balance in individuals with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical studies using core stabilization exercise (CSE) as treatment have revealed&#xD;
      conflicting findings on pain, functional disability and muscle responses in chronic LBP. The&#xD;
      few studies that investigated CSE as an isolated factor. Kumar (2011) reported an improvement&#xD;
      of CSE on joint mobility and pain pressure threshold in patients with clinical lumbar&#xD;
      instability; however, it was an immediate effect of CSE and blinding process was not&#xD;
      performed. However, an effectiveness of CSE on pain intensity, functional disability, and&#xD;
      trunk muscle activation pattern were improved in clinical lumbar instability (CLI). In&#xD;
      addition, after 10-week CSE provides greater training and retention effects on pain-related&#xD;
      outcomes and induced activation of deep abdominal muscles in CLI compared with conventional&#xD;
      treatment (stretching exercise and hot pack). However, previous studies did not report&#xD;
      indirect effect may occur in CLI as postural balance and other kinds of exercise as&#xD;
      strengthening in CLI. The general trunk strengthening exercise is common used in physical&#xD;
      therapy clinic on LBP, that improve pain, physical disability, and trunk muscles activity. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, the usefulness of CSE technique as abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) has&#xD;
      not yet been investigated in CLI patients with outcome measure of balance.&#xD;
