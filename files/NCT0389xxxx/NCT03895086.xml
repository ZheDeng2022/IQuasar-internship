  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a common, expensive and controversial condition, one of whose origins would&#xD;
      be central nervous system sensitization to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual treatment consists of multimodal care including physical activity. This dosage should&#xD;
      be adapted to the patient's health needs. Currently recommended physical exercise is aerobic&#xD;
      work associated with muscle reinforcement, without evidence of superiority of the efficacy of&#xD;
      one over the other. Recommended dosage for aerobic exercises is 20 minutes (or twice 10&#xD;
      minutes), two to three times a week (70 - 80% of Theoretical Maximum Heart Rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Vendee Departmental Hospital Center (CHD), adapted physical activity is proposed to&#xD;
      fibromyalgia patientsby the associative group &quot;Siel Bleu&quot;. This physical activity, performed&#xD;
      with patients suffering from different pathologies, is non specific for fibromyalgia context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, a preliminary study showed the interest of a lifestyle coaching for fibromyalgia&#xD;
      patients, performed by physiotherapists, nurses and coaches specifically trainede.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another possibility seems to be personalized coaching with a physical activity adapted to the&#xD;
      physical and organizational constraints of the patient, and specific to pathology. This&#xD;
      solution would make it possible to adapt to the patient's choice of physical activities, to&#xD;
      ensure a better adaptation to their physical and organizational constraints as well as a&#xD;
      better individualized follow-up.&#xD;
