    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a condition where the upper airway&#xD;
      partially collapses and closes. This can lead to sleep problems including low oxygen levels,&#xD;
      poor sleep, elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood, and activation of the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. Results from having disrupted sleep may be excessive daytime sleepiness along&#xD;
      with behavioral, functional, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction. Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for OSAHS. CPAP stabilizes the airway&#xD;
      and prevents instability and collapse. Other forms of positive airway pressure that are&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of OSAHS include automatically adjusting CPAP, Bi-level Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure (BiPAP), and automatically adjusting BiPAP. Automatically adjusting CPAP&#xD;
      (Auto CPAP) evaluates the airflow pattern and adjusts pressure to optimize airflow. AutoSV&#xD;
      (Auto Servo Ventilation) is a mode of positive airway pressure used to treat obstructive and&#xD;
      complex central sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prior study, the investigators found that the Auto S7 device led to more positive&#xD;
      ventilation outcomes. Specifically, there was prolongation of QTc interval (the calculated&#xD;
      time from the Q wave to the end of the T wave) and a tendency for greater premature&#xD;
      ventricular contractions. The mechanistic basis for this could be attributable to excessive&#xD;
      ventilation and related pro-arrhythmic effects of hypocapnia, though the investigators had&#xD;
      not performed measures (partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) to detect this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators would like to investigate the hypothesis that the S7&#xD;
      device leads to lower PaCO2 levels than other devices, and whether these effects are&#xD;
      augmented in individuals with complex sleep apnea in the setting of systolic heart failure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a condition characterized by&#xD;
      intermittent partial collapse and closure of the upper airway (UA). This leads to sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation, oxygen desaturation, hypercarbia, and activation of the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system. OSAHS is also associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as other&#xD;
      behavioral, functional, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for the OSAHS.&#xD;
      CPAP stabilizes the airway and prevents instability and collapse. With a stable airway,&#xD;
      breathing continues in a normal manner, gas exchange is improved, and there is no disruption&#xD;
      of sleep related to disturbed breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP is applied to the upper airway via a mask that covers the nose or the nose and mouth and&#xD;
      reduces/eliminates sleep disordered breathing. The period of maximum susceptibility to airway&#xD;
      collapse is at the end of exhalation and during early inhalation. During inhalation, negative&#xD;
      pressures are generated in the airway by the normal process of ventilation (increase of&#xD;
      thoracic volume and reduction of intra-thoracic pressure). The constant pressure of CPAP&#xD;
      supports the airway throughout the ventilatory cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sleep laboratory, titration of positive airway pressure is performed to determine&#xD;
      effective CPAP pressures. During the procedure, the patient is instrumented for full&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG). Therapy is applied and pressure is adjusted during the course of the&#xD;
      night to stabilize the upper airway and the breathing pattern. With conventional CPAP, a&#xD;
      single pressure level is applied to the airway. While adequate for a majority of patients&#xD;
      with obstructive sleep apnea, this static prescription will present challenges in certain&#xD;
      patients and conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other forms of positive airway pressure that are approved for the treatment of OSAHS include&#xD;
      automatically adjusting CPAP (Auto CPAP), Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), and&#xD;
      automatically adjusting BiPAP. Auto CPAP evaluates the airflow pattern and adjusts pressure&#xD;
      to optimize airflow. Auto CPAP accommodates patients presenting with highly variable pressure&#xD;
      requirements (e.g., sleep stage or body position dependent sleep apnea). The automatic&#xD;
      adjustment can be used in patients for whom in-laboratory therapy titration is either delayed&#xD;
      or impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REMStar Auto algorithm is proactive and flow-based. It evaluates the inspiratory flow and&#xD;
      determines impending or actual flow limitation. This occurs in concert with a program of&#xD;
      pressure adjustments designed to evaluate the pressure at which the airway is susceptible to&#xD;
      collapse and maintains pressures slightly above the critical pressure. The patient is&#xD;
      protected from &quot;break-through&quot; events with a full complement of intelligent responses to&#xD;
      airflow events and snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BiPAP therapy is another alternative. With BiPAP therapy, the patient's breathing pattern is&#xD;
      monitored to identify the inspiratory and expiratory phases. Pressure is increased during&#xD;
      inhalation and decreased during exhalation. The expiratory pressure (EPAP) is adjusted to&#xD;
      prevent airway collapse and the inspiratory pressure (IPAP) is adjusted to prevent airflow&#xD;
      limitation, hypopnea, snoring or arterial desaturation not associated with complete airway&#xD;
      obstruction. BiPAP therapy differs from CPAP therapy, in that in addition to stabilizing the&#xD;
      airway, inspiratory effort is assisted by the difference between the inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with OSAHS may be prescribed BiPAP therapy if CPAP therapy is not tolerated. BiPAP&#xD;
      therapy may also be prescribed for patients with other respiratory disorders or for patients&#xD;
      with both sleep and respiratory-related dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing reduced ventilation from lung disease, neuromuscular disorders, or&#xD;
      problems with the control of the breathing can experience nocturnal hypoventilation that is&#xD;
      worse during sleep than it is during wakefulness. These patients are typically more complex&#xD;
      and require more extensive evaluation and follow-up than patients suffering only from OSAHS.&#xD;
      Patients may also be more vulnerable to loss or interruptions in treatment and often require&#xD;
      more advanced modes and features such as alarms and timed back-up breaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSAHS patients may respond to increases in CPAP or BiPAP therapy by demonstrating a shift in&#xD;
      the nature of the apnea from obstructive to central. In these cases, patients may not receive&#xD;
      adequate treatment with CPAP since lower pressure levels do not manage the instability of the&#xD;
      airway leaving residual airway obstruction, while higher pressure levels are associated with&#xD;
      CPAP emergent events. This condition is referred to as CPAP Emergent Complex Apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auto SV (Auto Servo Ventilation) is a mode of positive airway pressure used to treat&#xD;
      obstructive and complex central sleep apnea. Its main features include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normalization of ventilation by automatically adjusting IPAP pressure to achieve a&#xD;
           target ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of timed, back-up breaths during central apneas. The optimal back-up rate is&#xD;
           automatically determined by the device based on the patient's breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automatic control of EPAP pressure to treat obstructive events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several manufacturers produce these types of devices. The algorithms used to determine the&#xD;
      IPAP, EPAP and minimum respiratory rate are different. The largest number of these devices&#xD;
      currently in use are the BiPAP AutoSV Advanced System One (Philips Respironics, Murrysville&#xD;
      PA), Dreamstation BiPAP AutoSV and the VPAP (variable positive airway pressure) Adapt S7&#xD;
      (ResMed Corp., San Diego CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive Servo Ventilation (ASV) is a mode of positive airway pressure used to treat central&#xD;
      sleep apnea and complex sleep apnea. The main features of the Auto SV mode include;&#xD;
      normalization of ventilation by automatically adjusting IPAP to achieve and stabilize a&#xD;
      target ventilation; provision of timed, back-up breaths during central apneas wherein the&#xD;
      optimal back-up rate is automatically determined by the device based on the patient's&#xD;
      breathing; and automatic control of EPAP to treat obstructive events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The older version of the VPAP Adapt (S7) was found to lead to increased risk for all-cause&#xD;
      mortality when compared to control group that involved medical management in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central sleep apnea in a&#xD;
      recent study (SERVE-HF). An accompanying editorial by Magalang and Pack suggested that the&#xD;
      device algorithms may have played a role -- specifically, greater levels of pressure assist&#xD;
      and associated increase in minute ventilation. This was supported by the measurements of&#xD;
      minute ventilation delivered by the S7 device in the trial which was found to be greater than&#xD;
      other servo-ventilation devices. Such increased levels of ventilation could potentially cause&#xD;
      respiratory alkalosis which, in turn, could lead to QT interval prolongation and cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias. The investigators recently performed a study of patient-ventilator interaction&#xD;
      in patients with complex sleep apnea and preserved cardiac contractility (left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction &gt; 45%) in order to determine the performance of various ASV devices on&#xD;
      respiratory parameters - such as minute ventilation and apnea-hypopnea index. In order to&#xD;
      facilitate feasibility and promote safety, the investigators avoided performing the study in&#xD;
      the target population of the SERVE-HF trial, viz., patients with predominant central sleep&#xD;
      apnea and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFreF). The investigators performed&#xD;
      the study only on patients with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF &gt; 45%). In the current&#xD;
      proposal, the investigators propose to perform the study on patients with predominantly&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea and HFreF who need ASV therapy due to PAP-emergent central apneas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prior study, in order to avoid intolerance to device therapy, the investigators&#xD;
      preferred study patients who were already adherent in using servo ventilation therapy at&#xD;
      home. The investigators will do the same in the currently proposed study. In the prior study,&#xD;
      the investigators found that S7 device led to greater minute ventilation than other devices&#xD;
      and that such greater levels of minute ventilation was attributable to a greater tidal&#xD;
      volume, higher respiratory rate, and greater pressure assist. Interestingly, there was&#xD;
      prolongation of QTc interval and a tendency for greater premature ventricular contractions in&#xD;
      the same patients during the nights that they were exposed to the S7 device. Although the&#xD;
      mechanistic basis for this finding is potentially attributable to excessive ventilation and&#xD;
      related pro-arrhythmic effects of hypocapnia, the investigators had not performed measures of&#xD;
      partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) in this prior study. Specifically, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      therapy with the S7 device leads to lower PaCO2 levels than other devices and whether such&#xD;
      effects are augmented in individuals with high loop gain (complex sleep apnea in the setting&#xD;
      of HFreF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increases in minute ventilation (Ve) during wakefulness causes hypocapnia (respiratory&#xD;
      alkalosis), which, in turn, could cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia due to nighttime&#xD;
      intracellular shifts in potassium ions can prolong QT interval. Conceivably, nighttime&#xD;
      alkalosis due to excessive ventilation may lead to daytime hypokalemia and QTc prolongation&#xD;
      through renal loss of potassium at night with consequent effects on QTc prolongation during&#xD;
      the daytime. The observed QTc prolongation during S7 therapy was small in magnitude (~ 20&#xD;
      msec), but such effects may be magnified in patients with heart failure who develop metabolic&#xD;
      alkalosis due to loop diuretics.The investigators did not, however, measure serum potassium&#xD;
      levels which was a study limitation. In the current proposal, the investigators will&#xD;
      ascertain the effects of nocturnal ASV therapy on serum potassium levels. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the inter-individual variability in susceptibility in measured Ve&#xD;
      or QTc interval.&#xD;
