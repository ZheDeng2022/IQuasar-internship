  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a larger&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to test whether individuals with MCI can benefit from mental&#xD;
      training programs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of participants will be randomized to a mindfulness group and half to a brain games and&#xD;
      puzzles group as forms of mental training. Participants are adults with mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing, MRI scanning, and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews to assess feasibility of conducting a larger randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      in a population with mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
