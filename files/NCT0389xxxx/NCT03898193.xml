  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, single-dose, crossover, in two periods and&#xD;
      in two sequences comparative study, where each participant is randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference or the test formulation in each period of the study (sequences Test-Reference (TR)&#xD;
      or Reference-Test (RT)), in order to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish if two formulations of montelukast are&#xD;
      bioequivalent. Also monitoring, registration and evaluation of adverse events will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test formulation is Montelukast, 5 mg сhewable tablets (Pharmtechnology LLC, Belarus).&#xD;
      The reference formulation is Singulair®, 5 mg сhewable tablets (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme B.V., the&#xD;
      Netherlands). 34 healthy adult volunteers of both genders, with age ranging from 18 to 45&#xD;
      years old, will be divided into two cohorts with equal number of participants (17). Each&#xD;
      participant in a cohort will receive single tablet (5 mg of montelukast) of the test or the&#xD;
      reference product with 200 ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours,&#xD;
      according to the pre-defined randomization list, i. e. 17 participants in each cohort will&#xD;
      receive the test product and 17 participants in each cohort will receive the reference&#xD;
      product in each of two periods of the study. Participants will fast 4 hours after&#xD;
      administration of the study drugs during each study period. Standardized meals will be&#xD;
      provided in each study period. Water will not be accessible to the participants 1 hour prior&#xD;
      to administration of the study drugs and 2 hours after administration of the study drugs in&#xD;
      each period. In each period blood samples will be collected withing 30 minutes before dosing&#xD;
      and 0.5, 1.00, 1.5, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.00, 3.25, 3.5, 4.00, 4.5, 5.00, 6.00,&#xD;
      8.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00 hours after dosing (total number: 20). The washout period will be 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the bio-analytical stage, a validated High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem&#xD;
      Mass Spectrometry detection (HPLC/MS) method will be used to determine plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of montelukast. At all stages of working with biological samples measures to protect&#xD;
      montelukast from daylight exposure should be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Area Under the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic Curve from the beginning of the study to the time of the last measured&#xD;
      concentration (AUC0-t) and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of&#xD;
      geometric means of the test and the reference products, obtained from the log-transformed&#xD;
      data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval for montelukast falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax and&#xD;
      AUC0-t&#xD;
