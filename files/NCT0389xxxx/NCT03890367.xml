      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (antibody titers greater than or equal to&#xD;
           [&gt;=] 1:8) to meningococcal serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW Conjugate&#xD;
           or Nimenrix® as measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA). If&#xD;
           this non-inferiority was demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (geometric mean titers [GMT]). If this&#xD;
           non-inferiority was demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the superiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this superiority was demonstrated,&#xD;
           then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the superiority of the seroprotection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Or to demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (antibody titers &gt;= 1:8) to meningococcal&#xD;
           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW Conjugate or NeisVac-C® as measured&#xD;
           by serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA). If this non-inferiority&#xD;
           was demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this non-inferiority was&#xD;
           demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the superiority of the antibody response (GMT).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate (antibody titers &gt;= 1:8) to meningococcal&#xD;
           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as&#xD;
           measured by rSBA. If this non-inferiority was demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this non-inferiority was&#xD;

           serogroup C following the administration of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or NeisVac-C® as&#xD;
           measured by hSBA. If this non-inferiority was demonstrated, then&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the non-inferiority of the antibody response (GMT). If this non-inferiority was&#xD;
           demonstrated, then&#xD;

      Study duration per participant was approximately 30 days including: 1 day of screening and&#xD;
      vaccination, a phone call and a safety-follow up/end of study visit at Day 8 and Day 30 after&#xD;
      vaccine administration, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment included solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited&#xD;
      adverse events up to 30 days after vaccination, serious adverse events and adverse event of&#xD;
      special interest throughout the study.&#xD;

             epidemic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a&#xD;
             life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the study or to a vaccine containing&#xD;
             any of the same substances .&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/ legally acceptable representative or&#xD;
             suspected thrombocytopenia contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,&#xD;
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, was at a stage where it&#xD;
             might interfere with trial conduct or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the&#xD;
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature &gt;= 38.0 degree Celsius). A&#xD;
             prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition had&#xD;
             resolved or the febrile event had subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first&#xD;
             blood draw.&#xD;
