      This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose&#xD;
      expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of SL-279252 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The&#xD;
      study design consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts. In the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels. During dose&#xD;
      escalation, two possible schedules for administration of SL-279252 may be explored. The MTD&#xD;
      or MAD may be determined for either schedule. Based on accumulating data from the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase, including safety, PK, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity, up to two&#xD;
      dose expansion cohorts may be opened. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to&#xD;
      further refine the safety and tolerability of SL-279252. The expansion cohorts will evaluate&#xD;
      one or two doses of SL-279252 using one selected schedule. At the end of dose escalation and&#xD;
      dose expansion, safety, PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to&#xD;
      identify the RP2D.&#xD;
