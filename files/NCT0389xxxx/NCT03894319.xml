  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to determine if adding an objective measurement of back function&#xD;
      can assess the success of a commonly performed back injection procedure-lumbar medial branch&#xD;
      blocks. Researchers also hope to compare whether those who have objective improvements after&#xD;
      lumbar medial branch blocks will also have more successful lumbar medial branch&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care to determine the success of lumbar medical branch block(s) (MBB)&#xD;
      is highly subjective, even if clinicians were to use validated questionairres. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no studies that use a validated objective functional outcome measure to practically&#xD;
      and efficiently assess lumbar MBB success prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The&#xD;
      addition of a validated objective measure of functional impairment to the current standard of&#xD;
      care may help us improve in identifying the patients that will benefit from lumbar RFA. It&#xD;
      has the potential to minimize procedures of limited benefit with a significant impact on&#xD;
      containing healthcare spending. Additionally, it may further knowledge on how to&#xD;
      appropriately select patients without relying on the stringent double block diagnostic&#xD;
      technique put forth by the CMS that may exclude patients who could greatly benefit from a&#xD;
      lumbar RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the objective measure the study will use a lumber motion monitor (LMM). The LMM weighs&#xD;
      less than 5 pounds and fits on with a shoulder harness and belt. The LMM measures motion in&#xD;
      all three directions (forward back, side to side, and twisting) just like the spine. The LMM&#xD;
      testing may take up to 30 minutes depending on how many tasks can be performed by the&#xD;
      participant and how many practice trials are required. The LMM testing includes bending&#xD;
      forward and back to upright as fast as possible; comfortably while maintaining a twist&#xD;
      position.&#xD;

    <description>The Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM) is an objective, validated, reproducible and accurate tool to rapidly assess the degree of impairment with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 97%, respectively. This device provides a functional measure of trunk range of motion, flexion velocity, extension velocity, flexion acceleration, extension acceleration and compares recordings to a normative database. The LMM is able to provide an overall impairment score known as a &quot;functional performance probability(P(n)).</description>
