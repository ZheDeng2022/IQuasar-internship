  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain information pertaining to the occurrence of antibodies&#xD;
      to investigational SPK-3006 capsid and GAA, GAA activity and GAA antigen levels in the usual&#xD;
      care setting of Late-Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) participants on an enzyme replacement&#xD;
      regimen. Additionally, a careful evaluation of laboratory and functional testing in patients&#xD;
      with LOPD may provide information to better understand the disease features and better drive&#xD;
      the design of a future interventional investigational gene therapy trial. An understanding of&#xD;
      the underlying status of liver and muscle health in individuals with LOPD may also inform&#xD;
      best surveillance during the conduct of gene therapy trials.&#xD;

    <description>This is a multi-center, low-interventional study with a retrospective component in participants with LOPD. During a single study visit, assessments including but not limited to, liver health, neutralizing antibodies to SPK-3006 capsid and GAA, anti-GAA binding antibodies, GAA activity and GAA antigen levels will be performed. Additional information will be collected to provide retrospective evaluations relating to muscle and liver inflammation and/or injury. Historic data relating to Pompe disease will be collected from medical records. The retrospective and laboratory data collected may assist in providing baseline information for a future investigational gene therapy study.</description>
