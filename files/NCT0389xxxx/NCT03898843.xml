  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted animal therapy (AAT) is getting more and more used worldwide, in such areas as&#xD;
      gerontology, psychiatry, or oncology. It is a complementary therapy, and benefits for&#xD;
      patients are various, including decrease of anxiety. In ICU, some case reports exist, but no&#xD;
      study has ever been made in order to prove its benefits, not even its feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ReAnimal, the investigator aims to compare a group of patients receiving assisted animal&#xD;
      therapy, versus a group of patients not receiving it. Primary objective will be the evolution&#xD;
      of anxiety scores between the 2 groups of patients. Secondary objectives will be the&#xD;
      comparison of mood scores, post traumatic stress syndrome scores, pain scores, and&#xD;
      physiologic parameters such as blood pressure, cardiac frequency. The investigating team will&#xD;
      also compare multi drug resistant bacteria incidence between the 2 groups. In the assisted&#xD;
      animal therapy group, patients will also be asked to answer a satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
