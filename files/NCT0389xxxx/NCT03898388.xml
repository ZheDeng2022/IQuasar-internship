  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center study to include up to 600 subjects with knee osteoarthritis in unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral knees treated with Regenexx® SD in the osteoarthritic knee/s. Synovial fluid drawn&#xD;
      from patients' knee/s prior to receiving Regenexx-SD treatment will be correlated with their&#xD;
      clinical outcomes after treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial study procedures include baseline evaluation of medical history, knee history, knee&#xD;
      examination, medication use, MRI, and subject-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each osteoarthritic subject will undergo withdrawal of knee joint synovial fluid for each&#xD;
      knee being treated (0.3-0.5 ml) which will be analyzed by the research laboratory via&#xD;
      multiplexed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dimethylmethylene blue assay (DMMB)&#xD;
      at pre-injection (2-8 days before Regenexx-SD treatment). Documentation of osteoarthritic&#xD;
      joint characteristics and injection procedure details will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unaffected knee joint will undergo no treatment, but bilateral knees may be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to correlate the pre- Regenexx-SD treatment levels of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and&#xD;
      catabolic articular cartilage breakdown products in the osteoarthritic knee synovial fluid&#xD;
      microenvironment with 6 month post-treatment clinical outcomes. This data will be used to&#xD;
      establish a predictive a priori testing &quot;model&quot; to determine if a patient is a good candidate&#xD;
      for the Regenexx-SD treatment based on their initial osteoarthritic knee synovial fluid&#xD;
      microenvironment phenotype. It may also be used to determine if the micro-environment can be&#xD;
      altered to improve outcome before receiving Regenexx-SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of post-operative complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical&#xD;
      intervention and change in pain score will be considered while determining these direct and&#xD;
      indirect associations upon completion of the Regenexx-SD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of the synovial fluid will be correlated to post-treatment clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      which include several self-reported questionnaires as well as assessment of post-injection&#xD;
      complications, adverse events, re-injections and surgical interventions. Patient reported&#xD;
      questionnaires include IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation, Lower Extremity Function Scale, Pain&#xD;
      Scales and a Modified Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE).&#xD;
