  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is the number one cause of death in Canada. It is often the first symptom of&#xD;
      cardiac disease for the victims. Eighty-five percent of victims collapse in their own home.&#xD;
      Fifty percent collapse in the presence of a family member. Bystander cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR) can improve the chance to survive a cardiac arrest by three to four&#xD;
      times, but needs to be started quickly. In most communities, less than 30% of victims receive&#xD;
      CPR before the ambulance arrives. Currently, only 8% of cardiac arrest victims can leave the&#xD;
      hospital alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many things have been tried to improve the number of times people do CPR. So far, the only&#xD;
      thing that really increased the number of times that someone did CPR is when 9-1-1 attendants&#xD;
      started to give CPR instructions to callers over the phone. The only problem is that about&#xD;
      25% of cardiac arrest victims gasp for air in the first few minutes. This can fool the 9-1-1&#xD;
      callers and attendants into thinking that the victim is still alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have looked at all the studies on how to help 9-1-1 attendants to recognize&#xD;
      abnormal breathing over the phone. The investigators have also learned what should be taught&#xD;
      after finishing a large survey with 9-1-1 attendants from across Canada. This survey was done&#xD;
      with the help of psychologists and other education experts. It measured the impact of&#xD;
      attitudes, social pressures, and 9-1-1 attendants' perceived control over their ability to&#xD;
      recognize abnormal breathing and cardiac arrest. Then the investigators developed a teaching&#xD;
      tool which helped Ottawa 9-1-1 attendants recognize abnormal breathing. When they could do&#xD;
      that, they could also recognize more cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this project is to use the tool developed in Ottawa in more centres to help&#xD;
      9-1-1 attendants save the lives of even more cardiac arrest victims across Canada.&#xD;
