  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of avelumab and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)&#xD;
      and see what effects (good and bad) that this combination treatment has on subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent bladder cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be exams, tests and procedures to see if the patient is eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Some are part of regular cancer care and others are part of the study. Subjects will also&#xD;
      need to complete a research questionnaire at certain points in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive treatment of avelumab and intravesical BCG until unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      or tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation is up to three years.&#xD;
