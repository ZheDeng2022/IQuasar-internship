      This study addresses the focus areas of Post-Operative Pain Management. We propose a&#xD;
      randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a systemic&#xD;
      infusion of intravenous lidocaine as a non-opioid method of post-operative pain management&#xD;
      following postoperative spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The outcomes&#xD;
      assessed will be (1) the effect of intravenous lidocaine on post-operative opioid&#xD;
      consumption, both in-hospital and at three-month follow-up, (2) the effect of intravenous&#xD;
      lidocaine on the immunophenotype expressed following surgery, and (3) the effect of&#xD;
      intravenous lidocaine on recovery from surgery as assessed by the Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System-Computer Adaptive Tests for Pain Interference (PI) and&#xD;
      Mobility (M) (PROMIS-CAT). Thus, we propose a study of a non-opioid method of pain control to&#xD;
      minimize opioid consumption in-hospital and at three-months postoperatively, with primary&#xD;
      outcomes measures that include morphine-equivalent opioid consumption and PROMIS-Mobility to&#xD;
      assess recovery. In addition, we will test the ability of systemic lidocaine to attenuate the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response to major spine surgery. The immunologic response to surgery&#xD;
      has been associated with rehabilitation and recovery following total hip arthroplasty and&#xD;
      this study will provide data to support further work.&#xD;

      a Phase IV, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two study groups:&#xD;
      postoperative standard of care with opioid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and IV&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion versus postoperative standard of care plus normal saline placebo. Block&#xD;
      randomization into one of the two groups will be based on a random table generated using an&#xD;
      R-program. Group 1 (Study) will receive intravenous lidocaine during and after posterior&#xD;
      spinal fusion for AIS. Group 2 (Control) will receive saline placebo during and after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>IV lidocaine</intervention_name>
    <description>an amide-type, short-acting local anesthetic and delivered as an aqueous solution for intravenous administration. It has a half-life of 1.5-2 hours. A traditional method of administration is via epidural delivery. Epidural lidocaine is effective and this effect is due, in part, to systemic absorption. Systemic (intravenous) administration of lidocaine is a Food and Drug Administration approved method of delivery. Low plasma levels are needed for effective use, 0.5µg/mL to 5.0µg/mL. Given this low concentration required and the short half-life, continuous infusion of lidocaine is thought to be generally safe with low risk of complication.</description>
