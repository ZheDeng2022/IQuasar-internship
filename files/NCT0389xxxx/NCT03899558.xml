  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, affecting 1.2 million&#xD;
      people in the United Kingdom (UK). COPD patients suffer with episodes of worsening breathing&#xD;
      symptoms called acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Exacerbations occur more often as the disease&#xD;
      progresses and are a leading cause of emergency hospitalisation. Patients recovering from&#xD;
      exacerbations are at high risk of deteriorating, with one quarter readmitted to hospital&#xD;
      within thirty days. COPD thus imposes immense burdens on the National Health Service and&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will investigate the effects of using humidified nasal high-flow (HNHF) during&#xD;
      recovery from severe COPD exacerbations. HNHF delivers warmed, humidified air under flows of&#xD;
      up to 60 litres per minute through a nasal interface. This has been shown to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, including exacerbation frequency, hospitalisations, breathlessness and quality of&#xD;
      life amongst COPD patients with respiratory failure. It is thought to achieve this by&#xD;
      improving secretion clearance and providing positive airways pressure which supports the&#xD;
      breathing system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to St Thomas' Hospital, London with COPD exacerbations will be recruited.&#xD;
      Prior to discharge, participants will be randomised to receive either usual care alone or&#xD;
      usual care plus a HNHF device, which they will be trained to use for a regular period daily.&#xD;
      Usual care includes inhalers, steroids and may include antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up for 30-days after hospital discharge using weekly&#xD;
      assessments, daily symptom diaries and wrist-worn watch-like devices that detect physical&#xD;
      activity. This will enable evaluation of the clinical effects of HNHF on re-exacerbations,&#xD;
      readmissions, breathlessness, physical activity and quality of life. Device usage will also&#xD;
      be quantified. Participants who receive devices will be interviewed to explore their&#xD;
      experiences. After the 30-day home follow-up period, a sub-group of participants will undergo&#xD;
      detailed breathing tests during and after exercise to explore the effects of HNHF on the&#xD;
      respiratory system.&#xD;
