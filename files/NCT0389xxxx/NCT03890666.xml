  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week treatment, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group comparison&#xD;
      feasibility study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Albuterol eMDPI Digital System (DS),&#xD;
      including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in patients&#xD;
      at least 13 years of age or older with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening visit, a 12-week open-label treatment period, and a&#xD;
      follow-up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to 1 of 2 parallel groups stratified by investigational center: DS group patients&#xD;
      utilizing the Albuterol eMDPI DS, including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and&#xD;
      dashboard, and CC group patients who will be treated with their standard of care&#xD;
      albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and will not use the DS during the treatment period.&#xD;
