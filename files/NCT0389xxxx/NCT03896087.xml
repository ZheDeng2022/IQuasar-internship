  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FIND is preparing a study to evaluate the performance, as measured by sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, of four centralized assays for the detection of HCV RNA using capillary blood&#xD;
      collected on dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma separation card (PSC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available data on the performance of HCV RNA assays from DBS samples are insufficient to&#xD;
      introduce their use in clinical practice. Only a few studies have been performed on DBS&#xD;
      stored at ambient temperature, while the majority had DBS samples refrigerated or frozen&#xD;
      right after collection, which does not mimic real-life settings. Additionally, due to the&#xD;
      lack of standardized procedures, DBS collection and elution protocols varied across different&#xD;
      studies. A large multicentre diagnostic accuracy study using standardized DBS collection and&#xD;
      elution protocols validated by test manufacturers is needed to inform national hepatitis&#xD;
      programmes and international guideline development groups. Test manufacturers need clinical&#xD;
      evaluation data to update their regulatory claims and include DBS as an alternative sample&#xD;
      type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIND is preparing a trial to evaluate the performance, as measured by sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, of four laboratory-based assays for detection of HCV RNA assays using capillary&#xD;
      blood collected on DBS/PSC. This will be provisional on the manufacturers agreeing to&#xD;
      participate, as well as committing to applying to stringent regulatory approval for DBS/PSC.&#xD;
