  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In oncology, personalized medicine is progressing by providing increasingly tumor- and&#xD;
      patient-specific care. Thus, medical imaging allows precise morphological and functional&#xD;
      characterization of the tumor by volume measurements, used in particular in radiotherapy to&#xD;
      define the macroscopic tumor volume (GTV), and radiomic measurements that correspond to a&#xD;
      recent concept of extraction of textural parameters and/or tumor shape (tumor heterogeneity,&#xD;
      tumor invasiveness...). Precise characterization of the patient is also possible by&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements (measurements of total muscle mass, visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
      mass...) which can be important predictive and prognostic factors and which are generally&#xD;
      estimated more accurately in imaging than by using mathematical formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these measurements are partly dependent on the imaging acquisition mode (PET, CT or&#xD;
      MRI). The volume measurements, and therefore the GTV, are thus different depending on the&#xD;
      imaging used. Studying these differences is important because no single imaging technique&#xD;
      encompasses all potential GTV regions but, on the other hand, a combination of anatomical and&#xD;
      functional information could improve tumor delineation. Beyond this volume analysis, the&#xD;
      extraction of radiomic characteristics seems very promising in radiotherapy with however many&#xD;
      limitations to be overcome, linked in particular to the data acquisition mode. Concerning&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, CT and MRI have become essential techniques for precise&#xD;
      anatomical quantification, particularly of lean mass, visceral adipose tissue or muscle mass,&#xD;
      but automatic measurement techniques for these parameters have yet to be defined,&#xD;
      particularly during CT or MRI acquisitions associated with PET for attenuation correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify useful volume, radiomic and anthropometric characteristics, medical imaging thus&#xD;
      requires prospective cohorts of patients with comparable cancer histologies and standardized&#xD;
      images acquired by different modalities (e. g. PET, CT or MRI) during the pre-treatment&#xD;
      assessment before similar treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort to study volume, radiomic and&#xD;
      anthropometric characteristics by taking advantage of the recent installation of MRI in the&#xD;
      medical imaging department of the Henri Becquerel Cancer Center (HBCC), Rouen, France,&#xD;
      allowing PET/MRI to be performed and by taking advantage of the collaboration between the&#xD;
      radiotherapy and medical imaging departments of the HBCC.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort to study volume, radiomic and&#xD;
      anthropometric characteristics. For that 60 patients will be included before treatment by&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit from a detailed pre-therapeutic imaging assessment with trimodal&#xD;
      acquisitions (CT/MRI/PET with 18F-FDG) before radiotherapy and in radiotherapeutic position&#xD;
      according to the &quot;CRAI&quot; (for &quot;Centre Régional de thérapie Assistée par l'Imagerie&quot;)&#xD;
      acquisition protocol, innovative in trimodality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial imaging assessment will be supplemented by a whole-body biphoton absorptiometry&#xD;
      which will be used as a reference examination for certain anthropometric parameters. This&#xD;
      examination will be carried out at the Rouen University Hospital in the Rheumatology&#xD;
      Department&#xD;
