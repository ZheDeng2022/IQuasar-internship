      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate activity&#xD;
      and the safety of the combination of Carfilzomib (K), Lenalidomide (R) and Dexamethasone (D)&#xD;
      in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to BTK&#xD;
      inhibitor (BTKi) monotherapy or BTKi containing regimens with active disease necessitating&#xD;

      BTK inhibitor (BTKi) monotherapy or BTKi containing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be assessed 12 months after the start of treatment of the last&#xD;
      patient. However, responsive patients (CR, PR, SD) may continue to receive K up to a maximum&#xD;
      of 24 cycles and RD up to a maximum of 24 cycles. Patients who will interrupt therapy (for&#xD;
      any reason) will be followed up to 12 months after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
