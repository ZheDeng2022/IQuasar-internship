  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the feasibility of a system that involves&#xD;
      implanting small electrodes in the parts of the brain that control movement and sensation,&#xD;
      and combining that with electrodes in the upper arm and shoulder to activate paralyzed&#xD;
      muscles of the arm and hand. This system is intended for people with extensive paralysis in&#xD;
      their arms. The small electrodes in the brain will be used to attempt to measure intended&#xD;
      movements, and the muscles in the arm and hand will be stimulated to attempt to follow those&#xD;
      intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, exploratory safety/feasibility trial&#xD;
      of up to 12 subjects. The Primary Endpoint will be evaluation over the first 13 months after&#xD;
      implantation, after which the subjects will have the option of removal of the device or&#xD;
      continued participation in a long-term study.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of this trial is to advance development of a novel technological approach&#xD;
      to allow individuals with tetraplegia to interact with their environment using their own&#xD;
      paralyzed limbs by combining recording of brain activity, brain stimulation to provide&#xD;
      sensory feedback, and stimulation of the paralyzed extremities based on neural recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Name:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconnecting the Hand and Arm to the Brain (ReHAB) System&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Use The proposed device is intended to allow greater functional independence for&#xD;
      individuals who are paralyzed due to disease or injury. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      advance development of a novel technological approach to allow individuals with tetraplegia&#xD;
      to interact with their environment using their own paralyzed limbs by combining recording of&#xD;
      brain activity, brain stimulation to provide sensory feedback, and stimulation of the&#xD;
      paralyzed extremities based on neural recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population are individuals with high tetraplegia, defined as less than antigravity&#xD;
      weakness of both upper extremities and both lower extremities as a result of an identified&#xD;
      and static (stable for at least 3 months) injury or disease affecting upper motor neurons&#xD;
      process that prevents motor neural activity from activating muscles below the neck to perform&#xD;
      functional activities. Injuries and diseases that lead to this clinical condition include&#xD;
      spinal cord injury, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of an approach combining multiple intracortical brain recording/stimulating&#xD;
      microarrays with direct peripheral nerve and muscle stimulation for restoration of arm and&#xD;
      hand movement in people with high tetraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include validation of the combined platform described above as a&#xD;
      clinical device to allow paralyzed individuals to have a more meaningful interaction with&#xD;
      their environment as assessed by ability to perform brain-controlled reaching and grasping&#xD;
      tasks that ultimately might allow for greater functional independence.&#xD;
