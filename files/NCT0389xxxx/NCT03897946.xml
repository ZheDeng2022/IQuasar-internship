      This project will assess the immunogenicity of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in&#xD;
      hepatitis B-exposed and hepatitis B-unexposed infants in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the&#xD;
      Congo. A better understanding of the protection offered by the addition of birth dose vaccine&#xD;
      to the EPI schedule is necessary in order to promote universal adoption of a birth dose&#xD;
      vaccine in the DRC and throughout SSA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a neglected tropical disease despite the availability of&#xD;
      effective prevention measures. HBV vaccine has been incorporated into pediatric immunization&#xD;
      schedules worldwide for nearly two decades, and yet 257 million people are still living with&#xD;
      chronic HBV infection. Current control measures are failing to prevent further transmission&#xD;
      of HBV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
      prevalence surpasses 8% in highly endemic areas. An estimated 1% of infants (&gt;365,000 per&#xD;
      year) are infected with HBV by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) in SSA, and when infected&#xD;
      in the first year of life, these infants have a 90% risk of developing chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric HBV is a substantial problem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey in the DRC revealed that&#xD;
      2.2% of children under the age of five are infected with HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is the seroprevalence of HBV so high in children? The three-dose HBV vaccine has been&#xD;
      part of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in the DRC since 2007, with vaccination&#xD;
      rates now approaching 80%. However, the EPI vaccination schedule does not begin until six&#xD;
      weeks of life. In contrast, in developed countries, infants receive the first dose of HBV&#xD;
      vaccine at birth. This birth dose is rarely administered in SSA. Routine birth dose&#xD;
      vaccination could be a simple and cost-effective means to reduce the pool of infected and&#xD;
      highly infectious children in the DRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the protective efficacy of a three-dose series of HBV vaccine plus immunoglobulin&#xD;
      (HBIG) initiated at birth is ≥95%, immunogenicity of HBV vaccine administered according to&#xD;
      the EPI schedule (pentavalent vaccine administered at 6,10 and 14 weeks) is only 80-85%. This&#xD;
      gap in antibody response leads to a significant population of children who are potentially&#xD;
      vulnerable to infection in infancy or later in life. The immunogenicity of a four-dose HBV&#xD;
      vaccine series including a monovalent birth dose prior to the EPI schedule has not been fully&#xD;
      assessed to date. Furthermore, HBIG is not available in SSA due to prohibitive cost and&#xD;
      storage issues, necessitating an evaluation of the effectiveness of the vaccine series alone&#xD;
      without HBIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the DRC Ministry of Health, Abbott Laboratories and Ohio State&#xD;
      University, the investigators are conducting the Arresting Vertical Transmission of HBV&#xD;
      (AVERT-HBV) study, which leverages the existing HIV PMTCT framework in the DRC to screen and&#xD;
      treat pregnant women and their infants to prevent MTCT of HBV. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      AVERT study population to recruit participants (HBV-exposed infants and their mothers) for&#xD;
      this study. Women who screen negative for HBV as part of AVERT will be included in this study&#xD;
      as the HBV-unexposed cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While HIV PMTCT programs have been successful in reducing the number of HIV-infected infants&#xD;
      in the DRC, many infants fall into the HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) category. These HEU&#xD;
      infants are known to have lowered immune responses to vaccines than HIV-unexposed infants,&#xD;
      including protective immunity to HBV after the EPI-associated three-dose series. Little is&#xD;
      known about the effects of in utero HBV exposure on the immune response to HBV vaccine. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that because the immune response of infants exposed to HBV may be&#xD;
      blunted, these infants may benefit from an additional dose of HBV vaccine at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the AVERT-HBV cohort as a basis, this project will assess the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      birth dose vaccine in HBV-exposed and HBV-unexposed infants. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      protection offered by the addition of birth dose vaccine to the EPI schedule is necessary in&#xD;
      order to promote universal adoption of a birth dose vaccine in the DRC and throughout SSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study will involve 100 HBV-exposed infants who will receive 4 doses&#xD;
      of HBV vaccine starting at birth (Group A), 100 HBV-unexposed infants who receive 3 doses of&#xD;
      HBV vaccine according to the EPI schedule (Group B) and 100 HBV-unexposed infants who receive&#xD;
      4 doses of HBV vaccine starting at birth (Group C). The infants will be followed for 12&#xD;
      months, at which time protective immunity against HBV, defined as HBsAb ≥10&#xD;
      milli-international units (mIU)/mL, will be measured.&#xD;

        MOTHERS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HBsAg+ mothers and HBsAg- mothers will be recruited from the cohort screened during&#xD;
             the AVERT study at 2 maternity centers (Binza and Kingasani) in Kinshasa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any women who do not intend to stay in Kinshasa for prenatal care through delivery or&#xD;
             who deliver at a facility other than Binza or Kingasani&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women &lt;18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        INFANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants born to HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative women who receive care at Binza and&#xD;
             Kingasani maternity centers will be recruited for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-exposed infants (those born to HIV-positive mothers) will be excluded given an&#xD;
             expected difference in immune response in these infants and inability to recruit&#xD;
             enough HIV-exposed infants to be able to detect these differences in immune response&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HBV-unexposed infants weighing &lt;2,000 grams at birth will not be eligible to receive&#xD;
             the birth HBV vaccine. (HBV-exposed infants receive the birth dose vaccine regardless&#xD;
             of birth weight because the potential benefit of preventing mother-to-child&#xD;
             transmission outweighs the potential risk of vaccination in a low birthweight infant.&#xD;
             The research team recognizes that Group B may include a disproportionate number of low&#xD;
             birthweight infants compared to Group C, but will account for this in post-hoc&#xD;
             analyses and if need be, will exclude low birthweight infants from the analysis to&#xD;
             account for potential bias).&#xD;
