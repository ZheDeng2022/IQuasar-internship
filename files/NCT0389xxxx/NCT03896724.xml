  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of R21&#xD;
      adjuvanted with Matrix-M in healthy 5-17 month old children in a malaria endemic area.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomised 2:1 to receive vaccination with the IMP (R21 adjuvanted with&#xD;
      Matrix-M; Group 1 and Group 2) or control vaccination with Rabies Vaccine (Group 3).&#xD;
      Participants and investigators will be blinded to group allocation for each participant.&#xD;
      Efficacy of vaccination will be assessed by comparing the development of malaria between&#xD;
      Groups 1 versus Group 2 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two study vaccines: the IMP, R21 adjuvanted with Matrix-M; and Rabies Vaccine.&#xD;
      Group 1 (active vaccine group) participants will receive 3 vaccinations of R21 5μg with 25μg&#xD;
      Matrix-M, 4 weeks apart via the intramuscular route, and a booster vaccination one year&#xD;
      following the third vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (active vaccine group) participants will receive 3 vaccinations of R21 5μg with 50μg&#xD;
      Matrix-M, 4 weeks apart via the intramuscular route, and a booster vaccination one year&#xD;
      following the third vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (control group) participants will receive three vaccinations with rabies vaccine,&#xD;
      four weeks apart, all given intramuscularly and a fourth vaccination with rabies vaccine one&#xD;
      year following the third vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first booster vaccination, participants in Groups 1 and 2 will be further&#xD;
      randomised 2:1 to receive R21 with Matrix-M: control.&#xD;
