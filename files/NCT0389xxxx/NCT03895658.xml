      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat people with severe depression. During ECT,&#xD;
      the brain is given electric pulses that cause a seizure. Although it is effective, it can&#xD;
      cause side effects, including memory loss. Researchers want to study a new way to give ECT&#xD;
      called iLAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if iLAST is safe and feasible in treating depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 22 70 years old who have major depressive disorder and are eligible for ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 01-M-0254. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and psychiatric history and exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be inpatients at the Clinical Center. They study has 3 phases and will last&#xD;
      up to 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will last 1 week. It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants will lie in a scanner that takes pictures of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG: A cone over the participant s head will record brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS: A wire coil placed on the participant s scalp will produce an electrical current to&#xD;
      affect brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEP: An electrode on the participant s wrist will give a small electrical shock to test nerve&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will last 2 and a half weeks. It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven sessions of iLAST under general anesthesia. Participants may also get standard ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG: A small electrode placed on the participant s scalp will record brain waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews about mood, symptoms, and side effects. Participants facial expressions may be&#xD;
      video recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III will last at least 1 week. It will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard ECT if needed. Participants will have sessions every other day, 3 times a week.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite advances in antidepressant interventions, none has replaced electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
      (ECT) in its acute efficacy and spectrum of action in severely depressed patients, including&#xD;
      in psychotic depression, catatonia, and acutely suicidal patients. However, ECT carries a&#xD;
      risk of significant adverse effects including cognitive and physiological side effects, some&#xD;
      of which can be long term. The side effects are thought to be related to stimulation of brain&#xD;
      areas beyond those implicated in depression, so called non-target regions. While these&#xD;
      advances have improved the safety and tolerability of seizure therapy, a risk of cognitive&#xD;
      side effects remains, and none of the currently used procedures individualize the current&#xD;
      amplitude for each patient despite knowledge that anatomical variation significantly impacts&#xD;
      the strength of the current delivered to the brain. We propose a first-in-human safety and&#xD;
      feasibility study of this approach (termed individualized low amplitude seizure therapy , or&#xD;
      iLAST). iLAST introduces three areas of improvement over conventional ECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. use of a multi-electrode array to selectively target different regions of the brain&#xD;
           coupled&#xD;
&#xD;
           with computational electric field modeling on an individual patient basis to examine the&#xD;
&#xD;
           current flow in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an alternative dosing strategy in which the stimulus is titrated in the current&#xD;
           amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
           domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. use of high-density EEG electrodes that are weaved into the multi-stimulation electrode&#xD;
&#xD;
      array so that topographical ictal EEG is recorded. As mandated by the US FDA, a first in&#xD;
      human (FIH) study is a type of study in which a device for a specific indication is evaluated&#xD;
      for the first time in human subjects. We propose a FIH study of iLAST in 10 subjects. If&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of iLAST are supported, this could lead to the development of a&#xD;
      practical and safer alternative to ECT that could be rapidly disseminated through&#xD;
      modification of ECT devices already cleared by the FDA, lowering regulatory barriers and&#xD;
      development cost. If the aims are not supported, this would provide further support that&#xD;
      development of the magnetic approach to seizure therapy is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the current protocol is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of iLAST in&#xD;
      10 adults with major depressive episode (unipolar) eligible for ECT. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      iLAST will result in superior neurocognitive outcomes than conventional ECT. In addition, we&#xD;
      will evaluate the feasibility of alternative methods to individualize the pulse amplitude.&#xD;
      The approach to individualizing pulse amplitude is to apply trains of pulses of increasing&#xD;
      amplitude until a seizure is induced. To be practical in the clinical setting, the motor&#xD;
      threshold (MT) procedure will be completed rapidly to minimize time under anesthesia. To this&#xD;
      end, we will evaluate a rapid- estimation motor thresholding algorithm under anesthesia. This&#xD;
      will allow us to determine the relationships among measured amplitude-titrated seizure&#xD;
      threshold (STa), measured MT, and simulated MT derived from electric field modeling. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that both measured and simulated MT are correlated with STa, thus providing a&#xD;
      clinically useful predictor of current amplitude necessary to perform seizure therapy under&#xD;
      the time-constraints of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 10 individuals between 22 and 70 years old, with a major depressive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a within-subject safety and feasibility study that comprises three phases. Phase I&#xD;
      includes medication taper (as clinically indicated), and baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, patients will receive the 7 ultrabrief pulse width (0.3 ms) seizure therapy&#xD;
      conditions. As treatments will be delivered on a 3 per week schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each experimental condition day, patients will undergo a number of procedures to assess&#xD;
      clinical status and safety. Post procedure acute battery assessments will include: a) side&#xD;
      effect questionnaire, b) neurocognitive battery, and c) neuroplasticity battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase III, patients will be offered routine clinical management consisting of a&#xD;
      conventional ECT course (typically 6 12 treatments) based on clinical need. Patients will&#xD;
      receive pre- and post- course measures including: clinical rating scales, neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing, neuroimaging, and a neuroplasticity battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also receive optional TMS EEG and ictal EEG recording at the 2nd, 8th or final&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome measures: successful seizure induction as measured by topographical EEG and&#xD;
      motor manifestations, vital signs, ECG, subjective side effect scale, and adverse&#xD;
      events/significant adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome measures: Neurocognitive battery known to be sensitive to the cognitive&#xD;
      effects of ECT, with alternative versions to avoid practice effects; and, Amplitude-titrated&#xD;
      seizure threshold (STa), measured electrical MT, and simulated MT derived from realistic head&#xD;
      modeling.&#xD;
