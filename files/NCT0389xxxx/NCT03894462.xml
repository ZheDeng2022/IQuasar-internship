  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective, brief, low-cost interventions for individuals who attempt suicide are needed to&#xD;
      save lives and achieve the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. In response&#xD;
      to an NIMH Notice of Interest, this time-sensitive proposal leverages an existing federal&#xD;
      investment in Zero Suicide to test the effectiveness of a highly promising new treatment for&#xD;
      recent suicide attempt survivors and learn how it works. If hypotheses are supported, the&#xD;
      study will provide evidence of a brief, practical, and cost-effective therapy that reduces&#xD;
      suicide reattempts in a real-world health setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide rates are rising in the US and more than a million Americans try to take their own&#xD;
      lives each year. Effective, brief, low-cost interventions for individuals who attempt suicide&#xD;
      are essential to saving lives and achieving the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide&#xD;
      Prevention. This study takes advantage of a time-sensitive research opportunity to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP), a manualized&#xD;
      3-session intervention for recent suicide attempt survivors that produced dramatic reductions&#xD;
      in suicide attempts in a efficacy trial-80% fewer reattempts and an average of 72% fewer&#xD;
      hospital days over 24 months in the intervention group compared to controls. This research&#xD;
      will now test its effectiveness of in the US public mental health care system, examine&#xD;
      theoretically grounded mechanisms, and explore cost-effectiveness. ASSIP is currently being&#xD;
      implemented by New York State in a Zero Suicide initiative funded by SAMHSA. Consistent with&#xD;
      NIMH Notice of Interest MH-17-03, this project leverages this federal investment and a strong&#xD;
      state partnership to conduct effectiveness research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ASSIP in&#xD;
      reducing suicide reattempts in a community mental health setting in the U.S. To accomplish&#xD;
      this aim the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 400 individuals&#xD;
      referred from psychiatric inpatient and emergency services following a suicide attempt.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either usual care + ASSIP (intervention arm) or&#xD;
      usual care only (control arm), and followed for assessments at baseline, 6-weeks 3-, 6-, 12-,&#xD;
      and 18-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism. The secondary aim of this study to examine the psychological mechanisms of ASSIP,&#xD;
      as predicted by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide. To accomplish this aim the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct statistical analyses of a mediation model to determine (a) whether ASSIP&#xD;
      improves perceptions of low belonging and being a burden on others, and (b) whether the&#xD;
      effect of treatment on reductions in suicide re-attempts is mediated by these improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-Effectiveness. The exploratory aim is to identify potential implementation costs,&#xD;
      barriers, and facilitators for delivering ASSIP. A stakeholder summary report will be written&#xD;
      and disseminated, including an estimate, from the perspective of an ASSIP provider, the&#xD;
      incremental cost per suicide attempt averted by delivering ASSIP to supplement usual care&#xD;
      following a suicide attempt. This report can be used by organizations and localities&#xD;
      considering implementing ASSIP as part of their Zero Suicide strategy.&#xD;

    <description>In Onondaga County, NYS aims to implement a countywide &quot;Zero Suicide Safety Net&quot; of providers who share enhanced protocols for clinical care, staff training, and data collection (improved EMR coding of suicidal behavior). Participating behavioral health systems have agreed to common protocols for clinical care, training, and data collection. Participating providers receive robust training in suicide prevention best practices. Because of the wide participation of mental health facilities in the NYS-OMH Zero Suicide project, most subjects who engage in outpatient treatment will receive that treatment in facilities that are adopting NYS Zero Suicide protocols. Those who do not engage in care will nonetheless experience enhanced transition and follow-up contact from the services from which they are discharged.</description>

ASSIP is a manualized, three-session intervention, delivered either in-person or via telehealth: In Session 1, the therapist guides the patient in telling the story of their attempt. The session is video recorded. In Session 2, the therapist and patient sit side-by-side to view selections of the video, working together to understand the feelings and events that preceded the attempt. The patient is assigned a homework task. In Session 3, the therapist and patient create a summary of the suicide attempt and what led up to it, along with creating a personal safety plan.</description>
