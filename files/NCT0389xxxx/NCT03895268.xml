      Prospective clinical study on the performance of an Influenza A+B rapid test kit. The main&#xD;
      goal is to establish the sensitivity and specificity (i.e. how accurate the test is) when&#xD;
      compared to a gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option of participating in this clinical study will be presented to patients displaying&#xD;
      influenza-like illness. Informed consent will be collected from patients or patient's next of&#xD;
      kin/guardian before samples (nasopharyngeal swab) are taken from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabs are tested using both the investigational test kit and a predicate&#xD;
      fluorescence immunoassay test kit. All samples will be tested using a molecular-based PCR&#xD;
      test kit as a confirmatory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analysed statistically and the performance of the Influenza A+B test kit&#xD;
      can be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in&#xD;
      all parts of the world. Influenza viruses are causative agents of highly contagious, acute,&#xD;
      viral infections of the respiratory tract. Influenza viruses are immunologically diverse,&#xD;
      single-stranded RNA viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, and C. Influenza A+B and B&#xD;
      viruses circulate and cause outbreaks and epidemics. Influenza type C virus is detected much&#xD;
      less frequently and usually causes mild infections, thus presents less significant public&#xD;
      health implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seasonal influenza has an incubation period of approximately 2 days and is characterized by a&#xD;
      sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat&#xD;
      and a runny nose. Most people recover within a week without requiring medical attention but&#xD;
      influenza can cause severe illness or death especially in vulnerable populations such as&#xD;
      children, pregnant women and elderlies. Seasonal influenza causes public health concerns as&#xD;
      it spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiviral drugs for Influenza A and Influenza B are available in some countries and may&#xD;
      reduce severe complications and deaths. Ideally these antiviral drugs need to be administered&#xD;
      within 48 hours of onset of symptoms and hence rapid diagnosis of influenza in patients&#xD;
      displaying influenza-like Illness can reduce the number of severe complications and deaths&#xD;
      associated with influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescent Immunoassay is a biochemical technique used for detecting the binding of the&#xD;
      &quot;detection&quot; antibody and the analyte molecule. The advantages of a fluorescent detection&#xD;
      system have been known for many years. These include higher sensitivity detection of the&#xD;
      analyte, simplified reagents and simpler assay designs. Several breakthroughs have occurred&#xD;
      over the past few years that have enabled the implementation of a fluorescent based&#xD;
      immunoassay system at the point of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modern fluorescent based immunoassay uses a fluorescent compound, which absorbs light or&#xD;
      energy (excitation energy) at a specific wavelength and then emits light or energy at a&#xD;
      different wavelength, as the detection reagent. The difference between the wavelength of the&#xD;
      excitation light and the emission light is called the Stokes shift. The greater the shift or&#xD;
      difference in the wavelength the less interference there will be by having the excitation&#xD;
      light detected as part of the emission light. Recently many technical improvements have&#xD;
      occurred that has enabled the implementation of a high sensitivity immunoassay system. These&#xD;
      include the availability of narrow wavelength low cost light sources, newer more stable&#xD;
      fluorophores that have very wide Stokes shifts, stable solid state light detectors and&#xD;
      microprocessors to process and analyse the data from each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a fluorescent detection system is linked to a lateral flow assay and matched with a&#xD;
      powerful analyser like the ALiA Diagnostic Platform, the result is improved assay&#xD;
      performance, the opportunity for walk away testing along with the elimination of&#xD;
      misinterpretation often associated with visually-read point-of-care assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A and Influenza B affect all population, any patients of age 18 or above displaying&#xD;
      symptoms of respiratory infection will be included as potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no restriction on the ethnicity of patients but the majority of patients to be&#xD;
      recruited are expected to be of Asian origin as the clinical trial is based in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      However, it has been proved that Influenza strains do not vary / have minimal variation in&#xD;
      human of different ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option for participating in this clinical study will be presented to patients satisfying the&#xD;
      patient selection criteria. Informed consent will be collected from patients before samples&#xD;
      (nasopharyngeal swab) are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabs are tested using the investigational products, a predicate fluorescence&#xD;
      immunoassay test, and a molecular-based PCR test will be used as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the seasonal nature of the disease, duration of the study is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 24 months from inclusion of first subject to the day of final analysis of the&#xD;
      last subject's sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared to PCR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive percent agreement (sensitivity) for the investigational product when testing for&#xD;
      influenza A and influenza B should be at least 85 percent with a lower bound of the 95&#xD;
      percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 70 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative percent agreement (specificity) for the Investigational Product when testing for&#xD;
      influenza A is at least 90 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval&#xD;
      that is greater than or equal to 80 percent.&#xD;
