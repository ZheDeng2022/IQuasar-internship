  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the Conveyor System can safely provide left ventricular access to deliver&#xD;
      the SAPIEN 3 (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) transcatheter heart valve in patients&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with prior mitral valve replacement or repair (failing bioprosthetic&#xD;
      mitral valve) who are candidates for mitral valve-in-valve procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center early feasibility study designed to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the Conveyor System can safely provide left ventricular access to deliver an&#xD;
      Edwards SAPIEN 3 TAVR valve into the mitral valve position in a valve-in-valve procedure.&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients with symptomatic heart disease due to a failing bioprosthetic&#xD;
      mitral valve (stenosed insufficient, or combined).&#xD;

    <description>The ability of the Conveyor System to safely position the valve delivery system to facilitate correct positioning of the implant without causing any serious adverse events through 30-day follow up. Cineangiography will be used in delivery to ensure that the implant is orthogonal to the mitral valve annulus and centered within it from multiple views. The patient will be seen in the clinic in a routine follow-up to ascertain any untoward clinical signs or symptoms.</description>

&#xD;
          4. Estimated life expectancy &gt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients demonstrated to have symptomatic post-therapeutic mitral valve dysfunction as&#xD;
             determined at diagnostic cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, and/or MR and a&#xD;
             mitral valve annulus suitable for a &quot;valve in valve&quot; transcatheter valve replacement&#xD;
             procedure using the Edwards SAPIEN 3™ TAVR device based on diagnostic cardiac&#xD;
             catheterization, echocardiography and/or MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has been evaluated by a Heart Team and judged to be a candidate for mitral&#xD;
             valve in valve procedure.&#xD;
