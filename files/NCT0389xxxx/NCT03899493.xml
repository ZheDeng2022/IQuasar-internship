  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the uterus, abdominal wall, pelvic floor and brain interact&#xD;
      during labor and parturition. It will uses electromyography (EMG) to compare the&#xD;
      characteristics of the uterus, abdominal wall and perineum in subjects with and without&#xD;
      various pregnancy characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG will help established burst frequency and characteristics of the uterus compared to other&#xD;
      parts of the body during labor and delivery. Other parts of the body may include abdominal&#xD;
      surfaces (for uterine, abdominal, maternal EMG and fetal heart rate monitoring), perineal&#xD;
      surface (for perineal muscles monitoring) and the maternal scalp (brain monitoring). EEG&#xD;
      measures the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is recorded using wire electrodes&#xD;
      attached to the scalp or mounted on a cap placed on the head. E MG measures electrical&#xD;
      activity from muscles. It uses wire electrodes placed on the skin over the muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant adult volunteers and patients who present to the investigator's institution may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will lay or sit in a semi-reclining chair with sticker electrodes placed on the&#xD;
      body surface area of interest. Muscle and/or brain activity will be measured with EEG and EMG&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the relationship between uterine electrical activity EMG during labor and&#xD;
           parturition to various phases of labor and cervical dilations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the relationship between uterine and body site electrical activity EMG and&#xD;
           brain EEG during labor and parturition in patient with hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
           pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize electrical activity of pelvic floor muscles in relationship to uterine&#xD;
           and abdominal muscles during delivery between subsets of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the electrical activity of women in preterm labor and those with labor&#xD;
           dystocias to observe the effects of various treatments, which may have an impact on&#xD;
           preventing or augmenting labor progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the impact of naturally occurring pregnancy pathology and common obstetrical&#xD;
           interventions on the changes in uterine, abdominal, pelvic floor and brain EEG/EMG&#xD;
           characteristics as compared to health normal gravid patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant volunteers greater than 18 years of age who speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the participant's admission, they will be dispositioned to usual&#xD;
      obstetric care which may include minimal intervention if spontaneous labor, induction of&#xD;
      labor or augmentation of labor as indicated. As part of the study protocol, enrolled&#xD;
      participants will be monitored with external sensors/transducers. The device will be attached&#xD;
      to a patient's body, which may include the abdominal surface, perineal surface and the&#xD;
      mother's scalp by trained study staff through electrical leads that are connected to&#xD;
      commercially available EMG or EEG electrodes that have adhesive material in contact with the&#xD;
      surface of the patient. Recordings will be made at specific times during labor&#xD;
