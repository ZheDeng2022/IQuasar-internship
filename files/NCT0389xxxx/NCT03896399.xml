  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two center phase II prospective single-arm safety and feasibility trial for 20&#xD;
      patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma with an increased risk for anastomotic leakage,&#xD;
      as based upon UCS and NASCET calcification scores on pre-op CT-scan. In these patients,&#xD;
      laparoscopic ischemic conditioning is performed 12-18 days before an Ivor-Lewis&#xD;
      esophagectomy. The primary outcome is all complications grade 2 and higher (Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      classification) occurring during or after the laparoscopic ischemic conditioning. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are complications after the esophagectomy, and the induction of angiogenesis by&#xD;
      biomarkers of microcirculation and redistribution of blood flow by measurement of indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG) fluorescence angiography.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage is the most important surgical complication following esophagectomy for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A major cause of leakage is&#xD;
      impaired healing due to ischemia of the gastric tube that is used for reconstruction of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. Calcifications of the aorta or stenosis of the celiac trunk on&#xD;
      pre-operative CT scan have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage. So far, no individualized treatment has been initiated for this selected group of&#xD;
      patients. Laparoscopic ischemic conditioning (ISCON) of the gastric tube aims to increase&#xD;
      perfusion at the anastomotic site by redistribution of the gastric blood flow and/or&#xD;
      induction of angiogenesis. This is achieved by occlusion of the supplying gastric arteries&#xD;
      except for the right gastroepiploic artery during a separate intervention prior to&#xD;
      esophagectomy. Of note, these arteries would also be occluded during conventional&#xD;
      esophagectomy, but with laparoscopic ISCON they are occluded at an earlier moment in time&#xD;
      during a separate intervention. Retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of this&#xD;
      technique. Prospective studies have not yet been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic ISCON 12-18 days prior to esophagectomy for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer in patients with arterial calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two center phase II prospective single-arm safety and feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma (cT1-4a, N0-3, M0) with &quot;major calcifications&quot;&#xD;
      of the thoracic aorta (UCS) and any additional calcification or stenosis of the celiac axis&#xD;
      (modified NASCET score) on preoperative CT scan, who are planned to undergo esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ISCON followed by esophagectomy after an interval of 12-18 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      all complications grade 2 and higher (Clavien-Dindo classification) occurring during or after&#xD;
      operation 1 (laparoscopic ISCON) and before operation 2 (esophagectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary outcomes with regard to operation 1 (laparoscopic ISCON) are the duration of the&#xD;
      procedure, blood loss, day of discharge postoperatively and grade 1 complications. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes with regard to operation 2 (esophagectomy) are anastomotic leakage rate, all other&#xD;
      grade 3b or higher complications and 30 day mortality. Further secondary endpoints are the&#xD;
      induction of angiogenesis by biomarkers of microcirculation and redistribution of blood flow&#xD;
      by measurement of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the additional burden for the patient consists of an extra operation of approximately 40&#xD;
      minutes during which laparoscopic ISCON will be performed, prior to the planned&#xD;
      esophagectomy. We would classify the current study as medium risk. Potential benefits in&#xD;
      comparison to current standard treatment are a reduced risk of anastomotic leakage and&#xD;
      severity of anastomotic leakage. Potential risks are complications following operation 1&#xD;
      (laparoscopic ISCON). Mainly, based upon prior experience, we expect gastroparesis to occur&#xD;
      in 25% of patients. Patients with gastroparesis have an increased risk of aspiration and will&#xD;
      require a stomach emptying by nasogastric tube and nasojejunal tube feeding till the&#xD;
      performance of operating 2 (esophagectomy).&#xD;
