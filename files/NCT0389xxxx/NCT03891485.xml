      The project aims to identify Nivolumab predictive biomarkers in metastatic renal cancer&#xD;
      patients through functional evaluation of peripheral Tregs and NKs. Moreover the efficacy of&#xD;
      new CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/ US2013/0079292A1) will be ex vivo&#xD;
      evaluated in modulating Tregs and NKs function&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) is a disease with an estimated 338,000 new cases diagnosed&#xD;
      worldwide. Approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease. Since November 2015&#xD;
      the human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, Nivolumab, was approved to treat advanced&#xD;
      (metastatic) clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients who have received a prior&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic therapy. PD-1 (also know as CD279), is an immune checkpoint receptor (ICR)&#xD;
      expressed on the surface of T cells. The binding with its ligands PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2&#xD;
      (B7-DC) expressed on tumour cells, stromal cells or both suppress effector T cells activation&#xD;
      and inflammatory activity promoting self-tolerance and allowing cancer cells to evade immune&#xD;
      system. Despite encouraging results in multiple solid tumors the clinical anti-PD1 response&#xD;
      is not as wide as expected due to multiple immuno-escape mechanisms; moreover there aren't&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict or follow RCC patient's response to Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune evasion comprise the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and reduced access of&#xD;
      T-effector cells to tumor microenvironment. T-regulatory cells (Tregs) suppress a whole range&#xD;
      of immune cells and ICRs regulate generation and/or suppression of their function. Immune&#xD;
      cell access to tumor is controlled by the chemokine CXCL12, CXCR4 ligand. CXCL12 repels&#xD;
      tumor-specific effector T cells and recruits suppressive cell populations at tumor sites. von&#xD;
      Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations, detectable in 70% of RCC patients, regulate immune&#xD;
      response inducing PD-L1 expression and promoting Natural Killer (NK) cells function. Thus NK&#xD;
      function is a crucial element in nivolumab sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will enroll patients receiving Nivolumab in 2nd or 3rd line treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic ccRCC and, as control cohorts, either everolimus or axitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Tregs function on peripheral blood/neoplastic tissue from mRCC patients&#xD;
           undergoing nivolumab treatment. Ex vivo effect of CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/&#xD;
           EP2528936B1/ US2013/0079292A1) and other Tregs targets antagonists (ICOS,CD39/CD73) or&#xD;
           agonists (TLR7L) as putative anti-PD1 resistance mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate NK function on peripheral blood/neoplastic tissue from mRCC patients&#xD;
           undergoing nivolumab treatment. Ex vivo effect of CXCR4 antagonists&#xD;
