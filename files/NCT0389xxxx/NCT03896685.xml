      endTB-Q Clinical Trial is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority,&#xD;
      multi-country trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two new, all-oral, shortened&#xD;
      regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with fluoroquinolone resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-country trial evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of new combination regimens for treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and delamanid with existing drugs&#xD;
      known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid and clofazimine). The study&#xD;
      will enroll in parallel across 1 experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms, in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio. Randomization will be stratified by extent-of-TB-disease phenotype. In the&#xD;
      experimental arm, treatment will be for 24 or 39 weeks; duration will be assigned according&#xD;
      to extent-of-TB-diseasephenotype. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according&#xD;
      to WHO guidelines (and local practice); duration will be variable. Trial participation in&#xD;
      both arms will last at least until Week 73, and up to Week 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority will be established for the experimental arm if the lower bound of the&#xD;
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the&#xD;
      control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.&#xD;
