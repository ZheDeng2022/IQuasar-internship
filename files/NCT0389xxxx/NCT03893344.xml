      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease of the central nervous system (CNS) (Huang et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact etiology of the disease is unknown, it is a heterogeneous, multifactorial and&#xD;
      immune-mediated disease that is caused by complex gene-environment interactions (Olsson el&#xD;
      al., 2017). It is mediated by autoreactive lymphocytes that cross the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) and enter the CNS where they cause local inflammation that results in demyelination,&#xD;
      gliotic scarring, and axonal loss (Huang et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of MS has been typically observed in individuals aged from 20 to 40 years, with the&#xD;
      female to male ratio of 2:1 (Koch-Henriksen and Sørensen, 2010). According to a documented MS&#xD;
      registry from Egypt done in 2010 and 2017, the epidemiology of MS was slightly differed from&#xD;
      other Arab countries and western countries. The mean age of disease onset was 26.6±7.8 years,&#xD;
      with the majority being females (2.11:1). Relapsing-remitting MS was the most common type&#xD;
      (75.1%) (Hamdy et al., 2017). And its prevalence was found to be 14.1/100.000 (Hashem et al.,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological hallmark of MS is the accumulation of inflammatory demyelinating lesions&#xD;
      that occur in the white matter and the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord (Celius and&#xD;
      Smestad, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is regarded as a T cell mediated autoim¬mune disorder with a predominance of CD8+ cells&#xD;
      compared with other T-cell subsets. The disease begins in inflammatory induced lesions&#xD;
      consisting mainly of CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells, and activate microglia/macrophages&#xD;
      (Traugott et al., 1983; Ferguson el al., 1997). B lymphocytes and their cytokines are other&#xD;
      factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. They have both positive and negative effects in&#xD;
      the development of MS through lymphotoxin and IL-10, respectively (Duddy el al., 2007). It&#xD;
      can be triggered by various environmental components, such as exposure to ultraviolet light,&#xD;
      drugs, chemicals, and viral infections (Olsson el al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical symptoms of MS are determined by the exact neuroanatomical location of the&#xD;
      plaque; the disease being essentially diagnosed by the manifestation of symptoms and signs&#xD;
      attributable to lesions of white matter. It may appear as an abrupt onset of focal sensory&#xD;
      disturbances that is accompanied by unilateral painless damage of vision, double vision, limb&#xD;
      weakness, unsteadiness of gait, and bowel or bladder symptoms (Celius and Smestad, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although MS is associated with change in average life expectancy, it is not considered a&#xD;
      fatal condition and clinical course, which appears highly variable, is unpredictable for the&#xD;
      individual patient. Typically, the early stages of disease ( relapsing remitting MS) (RRMS)&#xD;
      are characterized by reversible clinical exacerbations, or relapses. It is caused by&#xD;
      autoreactive immune cells that traffic into the CNS, resulting in focal inflammation and&#xD;
      demyelination often visible as gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). Relapses are followed by periods of clinical remission as inflammation resolves and&#xD;
      remyelination occurs (Mahad el al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a chronic inflammation with scar formation, accumulation&#xD;
      of axonal damage and brain atrophy, and inhibition of remyelination contribute to&#xD;
      progressively worsening disability. In ~15% of patients, the disease is progressive from&#xD;
      clinical onset and is designated as primary progressive MS (PPMS) (Harris et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of MS is primary clinical, to distinguish it from other similar neurological&#xD;
      manifestations, McDonald criteria have been proposed (Filippi et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intriguingly, genetically determined changes in signaling responses and activation thresholds&#xD;
      in specific immune cell lineages have been described in MS. Identifying dysregulated&#xD;
      signaling pathways in cell compartments relevant to the disease and their relationship with&#xD;
      genetic variance could represent a useful strategy to better understand the natural history&#xD;
      of MS and discover new therapeutic targets (Housley et el., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) genes have been identified&#xD;
      in three chromosomal clusters: STAT1 and STAT4 on human chromosome 2 (q12-33); STAT2 and&#xD;
      STAT6 on chromosome 12 (q13-14); and STAT3, STAT5a, and 5b on chromosome 17 (q11.2-22). This&#xD;
      gene encodes a transcription factor that can be activated by interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23&#xD;
      and plays a role in the signaling via type-1 interferon (IFN I) receptor (Ceccarelli et al.,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAT4 is essential for IL-12 signaling and induces interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production&#xD;
      (Gestermann et al., 2010). Signal transmission from the interferons involves STAT1 and STAT4&#xD;
      (Raafat et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal levels of phosphorylated proteins belonging to the STAT family in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells of MS patients have been associated with a number of clinically&#xD;
      relevant phenotypes (Canto et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extensive involvement of type I and type II interferons in the pathogenesis of MS made&#xD;
      STAT4 an obvious candidate region for genetic predisposition to these autoimmune diseases&#xD;
      (Bolin et al. 2013). Moreover, the requirement of STAT4 in IL-23 induced IL-17 production has&#xD;
      been suggested (Tanasescu et al. 2010).&#xD;
