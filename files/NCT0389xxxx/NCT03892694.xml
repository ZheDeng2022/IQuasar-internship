          3. Subject has a diagnosis of CB and COPD and has been symptomatic for a minimum of two&#xD;
             years. (Chronic Bronchitis is defined clinically as chronic productive cough for 3&#xD;
             months in each of 2 successive years in a patient in whom other causes of productive&#xD;
             cough have been excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is classified as having moderate or severe (GOLD stage 2-3) airflow&#xD;
             obstruction defined by a post-bronchodilator of =&gt;30% FEV1 to &lt;80% predicted with a&#xD;
             baseline FEV1/FVC of &lt;0.70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a COPD assessment tool (CAT) score of ≥10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is being treated according to current medically accepted treatment guidelines&#xD;
             without successful resolution of chronic bronchitis and agrees to continue maintenance&#xD;
             pulmonary/COPD medications (as defined per GOLD Standard for medications) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study (subject must be on a regime of pulmonary medications for a&#xD;
             minimum of 2 weeks prior to enrolment into the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Smoking history of at least 10 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Non-smoking for a minimum of 2 months prior to consent and agrees to continue not&#xD;
             smoking for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is able to adhere to and undergo 4 bronchoscopic procedures (5 for control&#xD;
             subjects accepting cross over option), in the opinion of the investigator or per&#xD;
             hospital guidelines.&#xD;

             thermoplasty, rheoplasty or cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has had a prior lung device procedure, including emphysema stent(s) implanted,&#xD;
             lung coils, valves, lung denervation or other devices for emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject is unable to temporarily discontinue use of anticoagulant therapy: warfarin,&#xD;

             bleeding disorder, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction in the past year, renal failure, liver disease, cerebrovascular accident&#xD;
             within the past 6 months, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or uncontrolled gastric reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has or is receiving chemotherapy or active radiation therapy within the past 6&#xD;
             months or is expected to receive chemotherapy during participation in this study.&#xD;
