      The primary objectives of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of a high-fat diet on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a 0.75 mg single&#xD;
           dose of S-888711 orally administered as 0.25 mg tablets in healthy volunteer adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of a calcium supplement on the PK of a 0.75 mg single dose of&#xD;
           S-888711 orally administered as 0.25 mg tablets in healthy volunteer adults&#xD;
