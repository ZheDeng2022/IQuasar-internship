  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft ischemia after liver transplantation is associated with a high incidence of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality . The overall incidence of vascular complications in adults varies widely among&#xD;
      transplant centers worldwide, but remains around 7% in various series of deceased donor liver&#xD;
      transplantation (DDLT), and around 13% involving living donor liver transplantation (LDLT)&#xD;
      Vascular complications include; hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis, portal vein&#xD;
      thrombosis and stenosis, caval and hepatic veins obstruction, arterial pseudo aneurysm.&#xD;
      Biliary complications include; biliary leakage, stricture and obstruction .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most severe and frequent complication represents more&#xD;
      than 50% of all arterial complications. Early HAT occurring within 1 month post-operation in&#xD;
      2.9%, and late HAT in 2.2%. The overall mortality rate for patients with early HAT is about&#xD;
      33% (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic arterial stenosis can occur immediately postoperative or later with an incidence of&#xD;
      1% to 2% and has been suggested to progress to HAT. This is due to surgical technique or&#xD;
      fibrotic healing (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic artery aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is rare and has an incidence of 0.27-3%. They occur&#xD;
      in the second or third post-transplant week after infection caused by biliary sepsis,&#xD;
      intestinal perforation, anastomotic leak, or intrahepatic stenting, or technical failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portal vein thrombosis (partial or complete) or stenosis has an incidence of 2-3%, it can&#xD;
      occur early postoperative within 1 month or more late. Early portal vein thrombosis can lead&#xD;
      to liver insufficiency and failure. Late presentation, depending on the collateral&#xD;
      circulation, can lead to portal hypertension with varices and ascites .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, transplant outflow obstruction by kinking, stenosis or thrombosis of the inferior&#xD;
      vena cava (IVC) or hepatic vein, especially in LDLT, are relatively uncommon complications&#xD;
      following liver transplantation with an reported incidence of less than 3%. The main risk&#xD;
      factor is a technical error in the creation of the anastomosis Despite all the advances in&#xD;
      transplant patient care and surgical techniques, biliary complications remain high incidence&#xD;
      in living donor or split liver transplant. There are early and late complications, and there&#xD;
      are anastomotic, and nonanastomotic biliary complications, such as stones, sludge and casts .&#xD;
