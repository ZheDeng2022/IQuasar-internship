      20 minute Whole Blood Clotting Test(20'WBCT) recommended by World Health Organisation&#xD;
      guidelines is probably the most routinely employed bed side screening tool in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Lee and White (MLW) method gives a value which when performed serially gives a&#xD;
      trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a better tool in serially&#xD;
      assessing the victim compared to the 20'WBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot&#xD;
      stability at 30 minutes also provides added information in management of snake bite victims.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Envenomation by snakes is common in India. Hematotoxic bites cause the highest morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in Kerala, a state in the south of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 minute Whole Blood Clotting Test(20'WBCT) recommended by World Health Organisation&#xD;
      guidelines is probably the most routinely employed bed side screening tool in the country. It&#xD;
      is the tool of choice due to its cost effectiveness in low and middle income countries&#xD;
      (LMIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability of 20'WBCT is questionable with respect to not just its rapidity but also its&#xD;
      reliability. There is no standardisation for the test and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Lee White (MLW) Method for coagulation is a cheap bed side test used as part of the&#xD;
      standard treatment protocol of snake bite victims. The MLW method gives a value which when&#xD;
      performed serially gives a trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a&#xD;
      better tool in serially assessing the victim compared to the World Health Organisation&#xD;
      recommended 20'WBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot&#xD;
      stability also provides added information in management of snake bite victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bed side coagulation test done, forms the trigger to commence antivenom in snake bite&#xD;
      victims with hematotoxicity in resource limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lee White (MLW) Method for coagulation is a test that has been employed for decades to assess&#xD;
      coagulation in Jubilee Mission Hospital, Medical College and Research Institute in Thrissur&#xD;
      for snake bite victims. It is a cheap bed side test used as part of the standard treatment&#xD;
      protocol of snake bite victims. The MLW method gives a value which when performed serially&#xD;
      gives a trend in clotting time which the investigators hypothesise to be a better tool in&#xD;
      serially assessing the victim compared to the World Health Organisation recommended 20'WBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also propose that delayed reading of both MLW and 20'WBCT to check for clot&#xD;
      stability or 'clot lysis' also provides added information in management of snake bite&#xD;
      victims.&#xD;

    <description>1ml of blood drawn from snake bite victims in clean glass test tubes of 1 cm diameter Kept undisturbed for a period of 20 minutes (measured by a stop watch). At the end of 20 minutes the tube is tilted to see if the blood has clotted or not.&#xD;
If a well formed clot is not formed, the test is recorded as 'abnormal'.&#xD;
If the clot seems well formed, it is further observed for a period of 30 minutes to look for dissolution of the formed clot and would be termed &quot;clot lysis&quot;. Clot lysis indicates an unstable clot.</description>

    <description>The blood collected in three additional test tubes would be utilised for MLW.&#xD;
The three test tubes would be kept on a rack at ambient temperature.&#xD;
The blood sample would be drawn in a 5cc syringe and 1 ml would be added in the three test tubes consecutively.&#xD;
The test tube would be left undisturbed for 5 minutes, after that the first tube would be tilted approximately to check for clot formation every 30 seconds while the other tubes are left undisturbed.&#xD;
After the blood in the first tube has clotted, the time would be noted and the second tube would be tilted every 30 seconds and examined.&#xD;
Following its clotting, the third tube would be examined. The time at which the third tube is recorded as the CT value.&#xD;
Once clotted, then the sample in the all three test tube would be assessed at 20 minute and 30 min to look for breakup or lysis of the clot.</description>
