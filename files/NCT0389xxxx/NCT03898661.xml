      4 Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main causes of benign esophageal strictures are inflammatory (reflux disease,&#xD;
      eosinophilic esophagitis, caustic…) or iatrogenic (post-irradiation, post endoscopic&#xD;
      (sub)mucosal resection, post radiofrequency ablation, anastomotic…). Most esophageal&#xD;
      strictures respond well to endoscopic balloon dilation. Nonetheless, more than one third of&#xD;
      patients develop recurrent symptoms after dilation within the first year (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially iatrogenic strictures can be difficult to treat and often require multiple&#xD;
      dilation sessions to obtain long-term relief of dysphagia (2, 3). According to the Kochman&#xD;
      criteria, a refractory stricture is defined as a cicatricial or fibrotic narrowing of the&#xD;
      esophageal luminal diameter resulting in clinical symptoms of dysphagia, with an inability to&#xD;
      successfully remediate the anatomic problem to a diameter of at least 14 mm over 5 dilation&#xD;
      sessions at two-week intervals (4). A recurrent stricture is defined as a cicatricial or&#xD;
      fibrotic narrowing with an inability to maintain a satisfactory luminal diameter for four&#xD;
      weeks once the target diameter of 14 mm has been achieved (4). Several options (stenting,&#xD;
      intralesional injection of corticosteroids, needle knife incision) have been proposed to&#xD;
      manage these strictures, with a varying success rate (5). A significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients will finally need self-bougienage or surgery (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the treatment of esophageal iatrogenic strictures remains a challenge for&#xD;
      clinicians and there is an unmet need for novel approaches to manage the patients suffering&#xD;
      from this condition in order to avoid repeated dilations and/or invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XiapexR is a locally injectable collagenase approved for the management of Dupuytren's and&#xD;
      Peyronie's disease (6, 7). Xiapex is a mixture of two collagenases, enzymes produced by the&#xD;
      bacterium Clostridium histolyticum that dismantle collagen. Approximately 24 hours after&#xD;
      local injection, the collagen fibres have lost their strength and can be easily broken by&#xD;
      manipulation. This therapy has been a breakthrough in the management of Dupuytren's disease,&#xD;
      avoiding surgery in the vast majority of patients (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After local injection, the collagenases do not reach the bloodstream in significant amounts&#xD;
      and are presumed to largely stay at the point of injection until they are broken down by&#xD;
      proteases. As a result, side effects are uncommon and are most often injection site reactions&#xD;
      including lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), itching, pain, oedema, and bleeding (for&#xD;
      example in the form of bruises or ecchymoses). Allergic reactions are seen in less than 1% of&#xD;
      patients (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XiapexR has been proposed as a promising treatment for refractory urethral strictures but has&#xD;
      never been evaluated in refractory GI strictures (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 The present study&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proof of concept open pilot study with a historical control cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.1 Composition and dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      One vial (0.9mg) xiapex in 3ml dissolvent (also provided by the company) will be divided over&#xD;
      4 quadrants within the fibrotic stricture&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2 Producer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lonza AG Lonzastrasse 3930 Visp Switzerland&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.3 Distributor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB SE-112 76 Stockholm Sweden&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.4 Packaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xiapex powder is supplied in a clear glass vial (3 ml, type I glass) with rubber stopper,&#xD;
      aluminium seal and flip-off cap (polypropylene). Solvent: 3 ml solution supplied in a clear&#xD;
      glass vial (5 ml, type I glass) with rubber stopper, aluminium seal and flip-off cap&#xD;
      (polypropylene).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.5 Administration way&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intralaesional injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.6 Labelling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xiapex is a commercialized product and the commercially available labelling will be used. A&#xD;
      study label will be applied to the medication (not obscuring the original label), with&#xD;
      following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.7 Storage conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.8 Known side effects of the medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      After local injection the collagenases do not reach the bloodstream in significant amounts&#xD;
      and are presumed to largely stay at the point of injection until they are broken down by&#xD;
      proteases. As a result, side effects are uncommon and are most often injection site reactions&#xD;
      including lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), itching, pain, oedema, and bleeding (for&#xD;
      example in the form of bruises or ecchymoses). Allergic reactions are seen in less than 1% of&#xD;
      patients Drug accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.9 Drug accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug accountability will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 The subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.1 Number of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active group: 10 patients presenting with iatrogenic esophageal strictures. Control group: A&#xD;
      historical cohort that consists of 40 consecutive patients that received an endoscopic&#xD;
      balloon dilation 12-15mm for an iatrogenic anastomotic stricture at our centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is 18-90 years old The patient suffers from dysphagia caused by an iatrogenic&#xD;
      esophageal stricture The stricture is amenable for endoscopic dilation The patient has&#xD;
      undergone at least 1 previous endoscopic dilation for the same stricture The patient has&#xD;
      signed the ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.3 Exclusion criteria The patient is not fluent in Dutch&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.4 Replacement of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are not able to participate to the study will receive the standard of care,&#xD;
      consisting of endoscopic dilations alone. Only 1 intralaesional administration of the study&#xD;
      drug is given at the start of the experiment. Early drop-out of the study (before 6 months)&#xD;
      will therefore not impact further standard care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.5 Restrictions and prohibitions for the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient need fasting for at least 8 hours prior to the gastroscopies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on anticoagulant medication need to interrupt the treatment according to the&#xD;
           recommendations of the treating physician (Prof dr. Pieter Hindryckx or prof dr Danny De&#xD;
           Looze)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.6 Possible advantages and risks for the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that participation to the study will result in less need for repeat dilations&#xD;
      for the iatrogenic esophageal strictures (unknown).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every dilation carries the risk of perforation, even in the most experiences hands. No&#xD;
      additional dilations are performed in light of the study. It is unknown whether local&#xD;
      injection of the study drug augments the risks of perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient is carefully monitored after dilation (standard of care). Upon clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of perforation, a CT scan is performed for confirmation. In case of confirmed&#xD;
      perforation, endoscopic stenting is immediately performed to bridge the defect, allowing&#xD;
      healing of the defect. The stent can most of the time be removed after 6 weeks. Surgical&#xD;
      intervention is seldomly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of the study drug (XiapexR) are expected to be very limited, as the study drug&#xD;
      does not enter the bloodstream in significant amounts and is rapidly degraded in the&#xD;
      bloodstream by proteases. Local reactions (bleeding, swelling, inflammation) are&#xD;
      theoretically possible. Like all foreign substances, Xiapex can induce allergic reactions but&#xD;
      these seem to be very rare (only 1 case described in literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, patients with an iatrogenic esophageal stricture will receive a first&#xD;
      esophagoscopy with local injection of XiapexR injection into the stricture prior to&#xD;
      dilatation. One vial (0.9mg) xiapex in 3ml dissolvent (also provided by the company) will be&#xD;
      divided over 4 quadrants within the fibrotic stricture. After 24 hours, a second&#xD;
      esophagoscopy will be performed to perform balloon dilation of the stricture 12-15mm&#xD;
      (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The historical cohort will not undergo any procedures, but their patient file will be&#xD;
      reviewed to gain outcome data. ICF will be obtained if the patient is still in follow-up at&#xD;
      our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Flowchart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between day -7 to day -1: Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 0: Endoscopy, xiapex injection into the strictures (4 quadrants, 0.75ml or 0.25mg&#xD;
           per quadrant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day +1: Endoscopy, CRE balloon dilation 12mm to max 15mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day +2 to month 2: clinical evaluation (by phone) every 2 weeks with a window of 3 days&#xD;
           (see above for primary and secondary outcome measures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 2-month 6: Clinical evaluation (by phone) every 4 weeks with a window of 3 days&#xD;
           (see above for primary and secondary outcome measures)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected total duration of the trial is 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Randomisation / blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not Applicable, as this is an open label trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Prior and concomitant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on anticoagulant medication need to interrupt the treatment according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of the treating physician (Prof dr. Pieter Hindryckx or prof dr Danny De&#xD;
      Looze).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other prior or concomitant medications are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;

      Adverse Reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nature of adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  date and time of occurrence and disappearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intensity: mild, moderate or severe&#xD;

&#xD;
      AE's will be recorded from the first drug administration until the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special attention will be given to those subjects who have discontinued the trial for an AE,&#xD;
      or who experienced a severe or a serious AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical&#xD;
      investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily&#xD;
      have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any&#xD;
      unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease&#xD;
      temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not&#xD;
      related to the medicinal (investigational) product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Avent (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited&#xD;
      reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not&#xD;
      be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the&#xD;
      subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unexpected adverse event An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent&#xD;
      with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved&#xD;
      investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved&#xD;
      product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life-threatening Any event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the&#xD;
      event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were&#xD;
      more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associated with the use of the drug An adverse event is considered associated with the use of&#xD;
      the drug if the attribution is possible, probable or definitive.&#xD;
