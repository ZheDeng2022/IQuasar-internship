      The NASCITA study (NAscere e creSCere in ITAlia) was created to improve the understanding of&#xD;
      the health status of Italian children early on and how it is affected by social and health&#xD;
      determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate physical, cognitive, and psychological development, and health status&#xD;
      and health resource use during the first six years of life in a group of newborns, as well as&#xD;
      potential associated factors. The association between the well-being of children and parental&#xD;
      adherence to the recommendations for better child care and development will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on the children will be collected by paediatricians mostly during routine visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings will be used in the development of specific prevention measures and&#xD;
      interventions to improve the health of children, in particular more vulnerable ones.&#xD;

      The NASCITA study (NAscere e creSCere in ITAlia) was created to improve the understanding of&#xD;
      the health status of Italian children early on and how it is affected by social and health&#xD;
      determinants. The findings will be used in the development of specific prevention measures&#xD;
      and interventions to improve the health of children, in particular more vulnerable ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  differences due to environmental, sociodemographic, and parental determinants, as well&#xD;
           as to child characteristics and physician attitudes, exist between geographic areas in a&#xD;
           population's health and in the use of health resources in the first few years of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  differences exist in the appropriateness of care provided by the National Health Service&#xD;
           at different levels (regional, local, family pediatrician);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  differences exist between geographical settings in parental attitudes toward the&#xD;
           recommendations concerning children's health care, and these differences may be a&#xD;
           determinant of child development and well-being and health resource utilization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the existing differences between geographical settings in the opportunities for children&#xD;
           to access educational/socialization experiences (e.g. day-care centers) may have an&#xD;
           impact on development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main aim of the NASCITA cohort is to evaluate physical, cognitive, and psychological&#xD;
           development, and health status and health resource use during the first six years of&#xD;
           life in a group of newborns, and to evaluate potential associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences between geographical settings in educational and socialization&#xD;
           opportunities available for young children and in the care provided by the family&#xD;
           pediatricians and by the National Health Service for the same needs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between the well-being of children and parental adherence to&#xD;
           the recommendations for better child care and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate child development through the monitoring of domains that affect nurturing&#xD;
           care during the preschool period: health (disease prevention and treatment), nutrition&#xD;
           (breastfeeding and dietary approach), safety and security (care and early intervention&#xD;
           for vulnerable children), responsive caregiving (caregiving routine), and early learning&#xD;
           (home opportunities to explore and learn);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify potential factors influencing child well-being and growth and development,&#xD;
           including the acquisition of competences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of the NASCITA cohort study will consist of children born in Italy&#xD;
      during a one-year period who will be followed prospectively by participating pediatricians&#xD;
      until at least the age of 6 years and whose parents agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy the large North-South divide is a major factor of socio-economic weakness and can be&#xD;
      noted by the huge difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions&#xD;
      and municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization The coordination of the NASCITA study will be provided by the team of the&#xD;
      Laboratory for Mother and Child Health of the Mario Negri Research Institute that integrates&#xD;
      different expertise and competence with a long-standing experience in multicenter clinical&#xD;
      research. The coordinating center will also carry out data collection, storage, management,&#xD;
      and analysis. An independent scientific committee consisting of representatives of different&#xD;
      disciplines and realities (including lay people) will monitor the development and results of&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NASCITA will be embedded in Italian pediatric primary care practice. A network of local&#xD;
      contacts between pediatricians has been set up so that each node, representative of a&#xD;
      setting, will act as a bridge to the coordinating center in conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The network that the study coordination center has built over the years involving&#xD;
      hundreds of family pediatricians, documented by numerous collaborative publications,&#xD;
      represents the first interlocutor to whom to propose participation in the study. The national&#xD;
      Pediatric Cultural Association (ACP), with about 2000 members consisting mainly of family&#xD;
      pediatricians, is among the supporters of the study. Pediatric scientific societies and&#xD;
      associations will be contacted because detailed information concerning the study will be&#xD;
      disseminated through national pediatric journals and internet-based resources. Recruitment&#xD;
      will be based on the voluntary participation of interested pediatricians who can guarantee&#xD;
      seven years of professional activity so that they can follow the enrolled newborns for the&#xD;
      whole study period. This approach to enrolling pediatricians can be defined as a mixed method&#xD;
      using also non-probability sampling techniques (convenience and purposive sampling) applied&#xD;
      to choose a sample of subjects/units from a population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three geographic clusters were identified as representative of the country based on&#xD;
      geographic and socio-economic characteristics and administrative divisions. Pediatricians and&#xD;
      newborns of all the 23 identified clusters will be involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the newborns (and their parents) will take place during the first routine well&#xD;
      child visit scheduled for all newborns within their first 45 days of life at the office of&#xD;
      the pediatrician assigned to them by the Local Health Units (LHU) to which they belong.&#xD;
      Parents will receive oral and written information about the purpose and methods of the study&#xD;
      and will be invited to participate.If they agree to participate, they will be asked to sign&#xD;
      an informed consent. Recruitment of newborns will start in the first half of 2019, while&#xD;
      recruitment of pediatricians will start in the preceding months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and tutorial activities Before the start of the study, family pediatricians will be&#xD;
      involved in training activities. Local coordinators will be trained by the research team, and&#xD;
      will be responsible for the training of their peers at the local level. A CRF (case report&#xD;
      form) was created in an online form with the contribution of local representatives of family&#xD;
      pediatricians and scientific committee participants. During an initial phase, a group of&#xD;
      family pediatricians tested the electronic CRF (eCRF), leading to improvements and adding the&#xD;
      necessary questions to achieve an eCRF that would allow a more complete and simple collection&#xD;
      of data. The eCRF will be available online before the start of the enrolment period in order&#xD;
      to let participating family pediatricians familiarize with the information that needs to be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central and local monitoring of the study will be scheduled with the aim to guarantee follow&#xD;
      up of the infants and the quality of data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data considered for the basic CRF are part of those routinely collected by&#xD;
      the family pediatricians at the 7 standard well-child visits scheduled for all children&#xD;
      during their first 6 years of life, and data collected during each contact with the enrolled&#xD;
      children. However, expansion of the eCRF for specific research interests that may occur&#xD;
      during the study period is foreseen. In order to enhance the quality of the data, the eCRF&#xD;
      includes consistency and range checks to prevent internal inconsistencies, although the&#xD;
      continuing review of collected data is guaranteed by the coordinating center and, in case of&#xD;
      inconsistencies, pediatricians will be contacted. The administrators of the website (the&#xD;
      coordinating center) will be able to view the completed forms also in a graphic format that&#xD;
      will be updated periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data At the first visit (within 45 days of life of the newborn), parents will be&#xD;
      asked about parental medical history, characteristics and lifestyle, indoor and outdoor&#xD;
      environment, and circumstances during pregnancy and around birth. Pregnancy and perinatal&#xD;
      data will be collected also through hospital discharge documents following delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population size The NASCITA cohort is sized to have enough power to study relatively&#xD;
      common childhood exposures and outcomes, based on the national prevalence of certain health&#xD;
      characteristics of Italian children and the expected number of cases for different enrolling&#xD;
      scenarios. The aim is to recruit no less than 5000, and hopefully at least 10,000, newborns&#xD;
      with complete information collected over the period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the aims of the study, univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed in&#xD;
      an ongoing manner to investigate several associations in order to provide an answer to a&#xD;
      number of research questions, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between prenatal and living setting determinants and child&#xD;
           neurocognitive development and health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the relationship between pregnancy, perinatal, and newborn growth characteristics and&#xD;
           occurrence of adverse outcomes (i.e., obesity, hypertension, wheezing, eczema, hay&#xD;
           fever, and asthma);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the relationship between newborn and child nutrition quality and occurrence of&#xD;
           overweight and obesity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between early stimulating learning initiatives and neurodevelopment of&#xD;
           enrolled children;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between vaccination and prevalence of preventable infectious diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between lifestyle factors and health inequalities and the trajectory of&#xD;
           health in the preschool period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migrant newborns will be included in a special subgroup of analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials produced A specific web portal for the NASCITA cohort study was developed&#xD;
      (https://coortenascita.marionegri.it) to collect data, through a web-based form, and to&#xD;
      provide findings and other information during the study period, also with the use of graphics&#xD;
      on the analyses and data collected based on a successful approach already reported by the&#xD;
      coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination A consent form for participation will be signed by the pediatricians&#xD;
      upon their first access to the web site. A paper consent form will be signed by parents at&#xD;
      the first visit. This form includes the consent to data collection at each contact with the&#xD;
      pediatrician during the six-year study period (first 6 years of the child's life). The filled&#xD;
      in consent form will be stored by the pediatrician for ten years. Withdrawal from the study&#xD;
      is guaranteed at any time both to pediatricians and parents. When consent is withdrawn, the&#xD;
      child's data collected up to that point will be kept in the analyses, but no further data&#xD;
      will be collected. Standard procedures for the protection of confidential individual&#xD;
      information will be applied according to national and international ethical recommendations&#xD;
      and guidelines as well as national legal regulations. Data will be pseudonymized and all&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted with fully anonymized data sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newsletter report will periodically be sent to the pediatricians and uploaded on the web&#xD;
      site. During the study, different tools will be used to update the participating families&#xD;
      mainly through the web site. Collected data will be periodically analyzed according to the&#xD;
      aims of the project, and findings reported to lay people and the scientific community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the enrolled children reach the age of 6 years, if not decided otherwise in the&#xD;
      meantime, their personal files will no longer be updated, but will be kept for another 10&#xD;
      years in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NASCITA proposes to be a resource for the research community, so data will be available to&#xD;
      public researchers outside the NASCITA research group upon request for collaborative research&#xD;
      initiatives, after approval by the scientific committee.&#xD;

        Italian healthcare is provided through a network of Local Health Units, each of which&#xD;
        consists of multiple healthcare districts. Every Italian resident is registered with a&#xD;
        family (pediatric or general) practitioner. In Italy there are about 7500 family&#xD;
        pediatricians, for an average of 450.000 births/year. About 60 newborns/year are therefore&#xD;
        assigned to each pediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty-two geographic clusters were identified as representative of Italy based on&#xD;
        geographic and socio-economic characteristics and administrative divisions. Pediatricians&#xD;
        and newborns from all 22 clusters will be involved in the study. From the start of 2019,&#xD;
        newborns will be continuously included in the study for an entire one-year period chosen by&#xD;
        each pediatrician and will be followed until 6 years of age.&#xD;
