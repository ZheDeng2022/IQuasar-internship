      Two hallmarks of both healthy aging and age-related disease are 1) memory and navigational&#xD;
      deficits, particularly in orienting towards goal locations and planning how to navigate to&#xD;
      them, and 2) increased susceptibility to stress and altered regulation of the stress&#xD;
      response. However, there are marked individual differences in these age-related changes. The&#xD;
      investigators' proposal will help characterize factors that contribute to this variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be pseudorandomly assigned to stress-manipulated or control groups. The&#xD;
      investigators will give both groups a novel immersive navigation task, validated by the PI in&#xD;
      healthy young adults. This paradigm gives participants the opportunity to either (a) flexibly&#xD;
      draw on spatial memory in order to plan efficient routes to goal locations, or (b) fall back&#xD;
      on inefficient, but cognitively less-demanding, stimulus-response associations (i.e.,&#xD;
      habits). Using neuroimaging and behavioral measures, the investigators' protocol will test&#xD;
      whether experimentally-induced stress leads individuals to bring fewer details about future&#xD;
      locations to mind when route planning, and whether such restricted prospective thought&#xD;
      ultimately biases participants towards relatively inflexible, habitual actions.&#xD;

      Two hallmarks of both healthy aging and age-related disease are 1) memory and navigational&#xD;
      deficits, particularly in orienting towards goal locations and planning how to navigate to&#xD;
      them, and 2) increased susceptibility to stress and altered regulation of the stress&#xD;
      response. However, there are marked individual differences in these age-related changes. The&#xD;
      investigators' proposal will help characterize factors that contribute to this variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study that utilizes cutting-edge imaging and virtual reality&#xD;
      techniques to characterize the neural mechanisms of prospective (future goal-directed)&#xD;
      navigational planning in aging. The investigators will use multi-voxel pattern analyses&#xD;
      (MVPA) to obtain neural indices of memory-guided navigational planning. The investigators&#xD;
      will then examine the mechanisms through which stress limits the ability of individuals to&#xD;
      flexibly navigate to future goals. A critical aim will be to evaluate the neural bases for&#xD;
      individual differences in navigational planning and the stress response, providing novel&#xD;
      insight into convergent neurocognitive traits that underlie different degrees of age-related&#xD;
      cognitive decline. The investigators predict that impaired prospective planning is associated&#xD;
      with individual differences in (a) susceptibility to exogenous, experimentally-induced&#xD;
      stress, and (b) stress-disrupted functioning of memory and attention and cognitive control&#xD;
      networks necessary for mental simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' proposal combines a novel immersive navigation paradigm, validated by the&#xD;
      PI in healthy young adults, and an established between-subjects exogenous manipulation of&#xD;
      psychological stress (see Research Strategy). This paradigm gives participants the&#xD;
      opportunity to either (a) flexibly draw on spatial memory in order to plan efficient routes&#xD;
      to goal locations, or (b) fall back on inefficient, but cognitively less-demanding,&#xD;
      stimulus-response associations (i.e., habits). Participants will be pseudorandomly assigned&#xD;
      to stress-manipulated or control groups, with an initial prospective random assignment of&#xD;
      subject IDs being adjusted as recruitment progresses in order to enforce approximately&#xD;
      equivalent age distributions in the two groups (and thus limit confounds in subsequent group&#xD;
      comparisons). Salivary cortisol (stress hormone) assays (de-identified) will help validate&#xD;
      the stress difference between groups. Leveraging MVPA, and trait questionnaires, the&#xD;
      investigators' study will test whether experimentally-induced stress leads individuals to&#xD;
      bring fewer details about future locations to mind when route planning, and whether such&#xD;
      restricted prospective thought ultimately biases participants towards relatively inflexible,&#xD;
      habitual actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging is associated with differences in the degree to which people rely on &quot;map-like&quot; spatial&#xD;
      memory vs. procedural motor responses to traverse environments. Thus the investigators'&#xD;
      investigation of the effects of stress on habitual vs. prospective spatial memory-guided&#xD;
      navigation is embedded within the context of age-related differences in spatial memory&#xD;
      processing in the investigators' target population. The investigators will further employ an&#xD;
      endogenous navigational strategy identification task, enabling us to 1) establish a link&#xD;
      between endogenous navigation strategy preferences and performance on the investigators'&#xD;
      prospective navigation task, and 2) study how endogenous navigational strategy preferences&#xD;
      interact with induced stress to affect the investigators' neural and behavioral outcome&#xD;
      measures indexing efficient, prospective spatial cognition.&#xD;
