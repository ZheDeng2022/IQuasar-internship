  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 50% of HCC cases worldwide are related to chronic HBV. There are&#xD;
      approximately 350-400 million people across the world infected with HBV, the majority reside&#xD;
      in or originate from Asia. Each year HBV accounts for 749,000 new cases of HCC and 692,000&#xD;
      HCC-related deaths. The annual incidence of HCC is estimated to be &lt;1% for non-cirrhotic HBV&#xD;
      infected patients and 2-3% for those with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the most approved nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) suppress HBV replication through&#xD;
      inhibition of HBV-DNA polymerase and are reported to reduce the risk of HCC incidence,&#xD;
      however, such risk is not completely eliminated under NA treatment. The recent availability&#xD;
      of commercial quantitative assays of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has enabled&#xD;
      quantitative HBsAg to be used as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in CHB. It&#xD;
      has been suggested that HBsAg decline during lamivudine or entecavir therapy is slower and&#xD;
      less pronounced compared to interferon treatment, despite a higher effect on HBV DNA&#xD;
      suppression. Based on HBsAg kinetics, it has been estimated that the predicted median time to&#xD;
      HBsAg loss in patients treated with lamivudine or entecavir is more than 30 years. Thus,&#xD;
      treatment that can induce rapid decline of HBsAg would have clear advantage in reducing the&#xD;
      treatment duration required to achieve HBsAg-loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, in a recent preliminary study, 12-weeks of treatment with nivolumab has showed&#xD;
      the modest effect on HBsAg decline in HBeAg negative CHB patients. Thus, in this clinical&#xD;
      trial, the investigator will investigate whether immune checkpoint therapy is more effective&#xD;
      in inducing HBsAg decline compared with target therapy in HBsAg-positive patients with&#xD;
      advanced stage HCC.&#xD;
