  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) following female incontinence surgery ranges&#xD;
      between 6-48%. The literature has shown mixed results of the therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
      cranberry extract to prevent UTI in females, with some promising preliminary work in the&#xD;
      prevention of UTI's following gynecologic surgery. The researchers will conduct a study of&#xD;
      the effect of cranberry extracts on preventing urinary tract infections following mid&#xD;
      urethral slings, which are the most common urinary incontinence procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are going to perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of&#xD;
      cranberry extract capsules for the prevention of UTI following incontinence surgery. They&#xD;
      will recruit patients from a single hospital in a 24 month duration. Eligible participants&#xD;
      are women undergoing elective incontinence procedures that does not involve fistula repair or&#xD;
      vaginal mesh excision. The therapeutic regimen will be Theracran One cranberry capsules&#xD;
      containing 36mg of proanthocyanidins and placebo cranberry capsules and placebo capsules.&#xD;
      Both will be supplied by Theralogix Nutritional Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization into treatment or placebo therapy, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      start prophylaxis on day of surgery for a duration of six weeks. The researchers will collect&#xD;
      urine specimen via catheter upon insertion in the operating room. At time of discharge, the&#xD;
      researchers will provide all participants with capsules for six weeks of the assigned regimen&#xD;
      until they are seen for their post-operative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told to contact research staff immediately and collect a urine specimen&#xD;
      should they experience urinary symptoms consistent with UTI. The researchers will administer&#xD;
      a brief structured interview regarding type and duration of symptoms and refer for treatment&#xD;
      when necessary. Urine will be cultured using standard microbiologic techniques for the&#xD;
      presence of uropathogens at one clinical laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire at the two week&#xD;
      post-operative clinic visit and again at six weeks. At study exit, the researchers will&#xD;
      collect capsule bottles to ensure and assess compliance.&#xD;
