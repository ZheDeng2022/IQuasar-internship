    <textblock>
      This is multicenter, open-label, 2-part crossover study. Eligible subjects will have&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. This study includes a pretreatment and treatment&#xD;
      phase. The pretreatment phase consists of screening and baseline. The treatment phase&#xD;
      consists of Periods 1 and 2 (Part A), Treatment (Part B), and Follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be an open-label, 2-part, crossover study to assess the effect of food on Oraxol exposure. The study will consist of the following periods: Screening, Baseline, Periods 1 and 2 (Part A), Treatment (Part B), and Follow-up. Part A will assess the effect of food on Oraxol pharmacokinetics. In Part A, subjects will be randomized to the sequence (fed/fasted or fasted/fed conditions) under which they will be administered single-dose treatment after an overnight fast. There will be a minimum of 7 days after Period 1 treatment before subjects cross over to Period 2 treatment. Subjects who have participated in the PK assessments in Part A of the study may continue into Part B, during which Oraxol will be dosed for 3 consecutive days per week under fasting conditions.</intervention_model_description>
