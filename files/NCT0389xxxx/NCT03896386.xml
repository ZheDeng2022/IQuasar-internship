    <textblock>
      During a three-month period, the study subjects will be using an electronic diary app that&#xD;
      they can download and install on their smartphones to register the occurrence of seizures and&#xD;
      also to register the potential alerting behaviour of their dogs. This information will&#xD;
      increase the knowledge of the accuracy of these alerts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a international study by Ghent University that will initially involve people from&#xD;
      Belgium, Italy and the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of alerting dog accuracy are either case studies or retrospective studies&#xD;
      that rely on memory recall of information about alerting behaviour, with the risk of memory&#xD;
      bias that reduces reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of electronic diaries has been described as more accurate and has better compliance&#xD;
      than paper ones. Nowadays, electronic diaries offer the possibility of receiving live&#xD;
      information and/or timed answers, thereby increasing compliance and decreasing the incidence&#xD;
      of memory bias. This would be the first time that &quot;real time&quot; information about dog behaviour&#xD;
      and seizures in the same patients is collected systematically. This will facilitate the&#xD;
      analysis of the specificity and sensitivity of alerting behaviour as perceived by the owner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a three-month period, systematic data on the occurrence of seizures in the patient and&#xD;
      on alerting behaviour by the dog will be collected. This information will increase the&#xD;
      knowledge of the type of alerting behaviours that the dogs display and will allow to&#xD;
      calculate the specificity and sensitivity of dog behaviour interpreted by the owner as&#xD;
      predictive of a seizure. Depending on availability of trained and untrained dogs, possible&#xD;
      differences in the alerting behaviour between both types of dogs and in their alerting&#xD;
      specificity/sensitivity will be studied.To avoid recall bias the information will be received&#xD;
      live through a back-end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to participate, the volunteers will grant the investigators permission, via the&#xD;
      informed consent, to contact their neurologist to confirm their epilepsy diagnosis and to&#xD;
      send monthly reports of the electronic diary (see below) to their neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be stated clearly in the instructions and the informed consent that the purpose of&#xD;
      the app is to collect data to investigate dog behaviour and that the app is not intended as a&#xD;
      monitoring tool for the patient. In the instructions and informed consent the investigators&#xD;
      will be insisting that the volunteers only use the app when they are in a safe position&#xD;
      or/and have recovered fully from the seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The documents will also include a recommendation to contact their neurologist should a sudden&#xD;
      change in the frequency or duration of the seizures occur. In addition, the research team&#xD;
      will provide monthly reports of the volunteers' electronic diary to their treating&#xD;
      neurologists. Before the start of the study, Prof. De Herdt will contact the treating&#xD;
      neurologist to inform them and to confirm the epilepsy diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic Diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      A smartphone app for Android and iOS will be developed with a main focus on&#xD;
      user-friendliness. The App's main screen will display two buttons. The first button is to add&#xD;
      alert events by the dog (= behaviour interpreted by the owner as an alert), i.e., to indicate&#xD;
      that the dog has alerted. The second button is to add a seizure event (= to indicate a&#xD;
      seizure is occurring or has just occurred). A calendar will show the alert and seizure&#xD;
      entries on each day. When one of the two buttons is pressed, the time at which this occurred&#xD;
      will be registered. It will not be possible to change the entry time, but the patient will&#xD;
      have the option to indicate if the seizure happened at a time different from the time of the&#xD;
      entry by accessing the seizure entry on the calendar. Once 24 hours have passed, the seizure&#xD;
      entry can no longer be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient does not enter any seizure for a whole day, a notification will appear the&#xD;
      morning after to ask to confirm that there were no seizures during the previous day. Extra&#xD;
      information about the presence/absence of auras and/or prodromi can be entered during the 24&#xD;
      hours after a seizure occurred, by accessing the seizure entry on the calendar. Data&#xD;
      introduction and storage will be possible even without internet connection. The data will be&#xD;
      uploaded to a database as soon as the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi signal. Compliance will&#xD;
      be monitored and patients that are not filling in information regularly (at least once a&#xD;
      week, but depending on the frequency with which they experience seizures) will be contacted&#xD;
      to verify whether there are any problems using the App and to resolve potential problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be treated in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation&#xD;
      (EU) 2016/679. The back-end will be SSL certificated and the data will be processed only via&#xD;
      the Athena platform and will never be stored or processed locally. The data will be&#xD;
      anonymized for analysis, and the database of patients will be coded and stored also in the&#xD;
      UGent central IT environment. The database will only be accessed by the supervising team from&#xD;
      Ghent University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have the right to request information about the state and usage of their&#xD;
      data and to request to modify or remove their data from the database at any point. All&#xD;
      personal information that could allow us to identify the patient will be destroyed at the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
