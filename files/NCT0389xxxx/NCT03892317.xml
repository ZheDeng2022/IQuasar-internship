  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organs for transplantation remain a scarce and precious resource with over 5000 patients&#xD;
      currently on the kidney transplant waiting list. A kidney transplant costs approximately&#xD;
      £17,000 in the first year and £5,000 per subsequent year. If the transplant fails, the&#xD;
      patient must return to dialysis at an estimated cost of £30,800 per year or be&#xD;
      retransplanted. While short term outcomes have improved steadily over the last 15-20 years,&#xD;
      longer term outcomes haven't and after 10 years approximately 30% of kidney transplants have&#xD;
      failed. Nonadherence to immunosuppressive medication is increasingly being associated with&#xD;
      these poor long term outcomes and studies have estimated that 30- 50% of transplant patients&#xD;
      are nonadherent to their immunosuppressive medication. The investigators want to determine&#xD;
      whether immunosuppression medication adherence can be improved in a group of patients&#xD;
      receiving tailored medication adherence support form a pharmacist. Adherence support will be&#xD;
      provided for one year and will be individualised to each patient in the intervention group&#xD;
      after identifying both their practical and perceptual barriers to adherence. The adherence&#xD;
      interventions offered may include additional education and medication counselling, setting&#xD;
      alarms, provision of a medication list, the use of a medications adherence app on a smart&#xD;
      phone, reducing the number and frequency of tablets a patient takes or referral on to another&#xD;
      health professional such as a social worker or psychologist for additional support. A range&#xD;
      of clinical outcomes will be assessed for all patients on a regular basis in order to&#xD;
      determine whether the provision of effective medication adherence support for our kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients may help to optimise the long-term outcomes of these transplants&#xD;

      This study will be undertaken using a prospective, multidimensional design. 42 nonadherent&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients will be included in the intervention group. The nonadherent&#xD;
      patients will be identified through Imperial College Renal and Transplant Centre (ICRTC)&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic based at Hammersmith Hospital. Standard and transplant specific&#xD;
      demographics will be collected for all patients. All kidney transplant patients have their&#xD;
      tacrolimus levels measured at each clinic visit. The variability of these levels can be used&#xD;
      as a marker of their adherence. Patients with a high intrapatient variability (IPV) of their&#xD;
      levels are said to be nonadherent. The Chief Investigator or another member of the research&#xD;
      team will approach individual patients directly in the transplant out-patient clinic where&#xD;
      they are members of the multidisciplinary clinical care team. The Chief Investigator or&#xD;
      another member of the research team may also telephone patients to invite them to clinic to&#xD;
      discuss participation in the trial. The Chief Investigator or another member of the research&#xD;
      team will describe the study to the patient, answer any questions they have and provide them&#xD;
      with a participant information sheet (PIS). Patients will be given the opportunity to take&#xD;
      the PIS away and think about whether they would like to participate. A follow up discussion&#xD;
      either in clinic or on the phone will be arranged with the patient to answer any queries they&#xD;
      have within two weeks of providing them with the PIS; during that discussion, the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator or other member of the research team will arrange an appointment in the&#xD;
      transplant clinic with the patient to sign the consent form if they do decide to participate.&#xD;
      Patients recruited into the study will receive pharmacist led, patient tailored interventions&#xD;
      to improve immunosuppressant medication adherence. Patients will be included in the study for&#xD;
      one year from recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist led, patient tailored intervention will involve regular, intensive,&#xD;
      personalised support from a pharmacist to improve adherence to immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
      The pharmacist will meet with the patient on a regular basis in the transplant clinic to&#xD;
      identify their perceptual and practical barriers to adherence and agree a support plan that&#xD;
      is tailored to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the first two weeks of recruitment, the study pharmacist will meet with the patient in&#xD;
      transplant clinic to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake a full medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss self-reported medication nonadherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake the BAASIS questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask the patient to complete a Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake a socioeconomic and educational assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake to gain collateral reporting of nonadherence by clinicians, relatives, friends&#xD;
           or carers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a tacrolimus pill count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check in-house dispensing records of tacrolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify barriers to adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tailor interventions and support to the needs of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a motivational interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Agree to meet again during an outpatient clinic visit within an agreed time which is&#xD;
           appropriate for the patient needs and within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first visit will provide a baseline assessment of the patient's medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tailored support may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting alarms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication diary card or calendar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication compliance aid filled by the patient, family/carers or by a pharmacy&#xD;
           professional&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence app&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing the complexity of the medication regime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positioning medication within their daily routine eg. by toothbrush&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changing formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional education regarding need for medication / timing of doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to a social worker to assist with affordability of medicines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to a psychologist to explore deeper psychological issues regarding medicines&#xD;
           taking&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structure of each follow up adherence review will be the same as the first formal&#xD;
      adherence review with the exception that the BMQ will only be repeated at the end of the one&#xD;
      year follow-up and the socioeconomic and educational assessment will only be undertaken at&#xD;
      the first assessment review. Every patient will have a formal adherence assessment at&#xD;
      recruitment and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. At the end of one year of follow-up, the&#xD;
      specific benefits perceived by the patient of intensive adherence support from a pharmacist&#xD;
      will be determined through a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline nonadherence will be measured at the first visit with the study pharmacist within&#xD;
      two weeks of recruitment and then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The IPV of their tacrolimus&#xD;
      levels and their outpatient clinic nonattendance rate will be measured retrospectively in the&#xD;
      12 months prior to recruitment to the study and then prospectively at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention year. The IPV is calculated from the tacrolimus levels measured for an&#xD;
      individual patient using the coefficient of variance mathematical formula - Coefficient of&#xD;
      variance (COV) defined as: SD x 100 / Mean. The outpatient clinic nonattendance for each&#xD;
      participant will be taken from the hospital integrated computer system.&#xD;
