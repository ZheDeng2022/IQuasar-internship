    <textblock>
      This study aims to extend the researchers' prior work on Function-Based Elopement Treatment&#xD;
      (FBET) with a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of FBET in 76 children&#xD;
      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and elopement. Participants will be randomized to FBET or&#xD;
      an active control group receiving a parent education program (PEP). Each study arm will&#xD;
      include 12 appointments over 16 weeks and will be administered by a Board Certified Behavior&#xD;
      Analyst (BCBA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elopement (running/wandering away from supervision) affects nearly 50% of children with ASD&#xD;
      and is a contributor to the fact that children with ASD have nearly double the premature&#xD;
      death rate of their typically developing peers. Existing interventions, such as prevention&#xD;
      kits, increase safety by decreasing elopement opportunities (e.g., locking doors), but do not&#xD;
      necessarily decrease attempts. Given that a single successful attempt can be fatal, the fact&#xD;
      that prevention-only strategies cannot eliminate elopement means that other treatment&#xD;
      approaches are necessary. Interventions based in applied behavior analysis (ABA) have been&#xD;
      successful in reducing elopement attempts. ABA relies on function-based treatments, which&#xD;
      start with assessment to identify why an individual elopes (i.e., its function). Common&#xD;
      functions of elopement include accessing attention (e.g., parent's reaction), preferred items&#xD;
      (e.g., toys), or escape from nonpreferred situations (e.g., leaving a store). Function is&#xD;
      crucial, as common strategies may be contraindicated based on function. For example, a&#xD;
      caregiver may pick up a child and discuss safety after elopement. Unfortunately, this may&#xD;
      reinforce elopement, and make it worse, if the function for that child is to gain attention.&#xD;
      Key elements of function-based treatments include preventing delivery of the functional&#xD;
      reinforcer following elopement (i.e., extinction) and teaching an appropriate means of&#xD;
      accessing it instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is support in the literature for function-based treatments, it has relied on&#xD;
      small sample sizes. In the largest elopement treatment study to date, the researchers&#xD;
      demonstrated significant improvements based on clinical outcomes. However, even this study&#xD;
      was relatively small (N=11) and lacked a control group. The bulk of research supporting these&#xD;
      interventions has also been conducted in specialized treatment centers by doctoral level&#xD;
      professionals. This is in contrast to the majority of ABA services delivered by Master level&#xD;
      Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) operating in community settings. Thus, even if&#xD;
      ABA-based interventions are efficacious, their generality and community viability remain&#xD;
      unknown. Finally, research has evaluated either prevention strategies or function-based&#xD;
      interventions, while studies combining these are strikingly absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a structured, exportable&#xD;
      intervention for elopement with prevention strategies and function-based interventions has&#xD;
      not been conducted, but is critical for several reasons. First, rigorous studies with a&#xD;
      control group and sufficient sample size are needed for function-based treatments to be&#xD;
      widely accepted as empirically supported. Second, evaluation of a manualized intervention&#xD;
      combining these approaches implemented in a community context will demonstrate the viability&#xD;
      outside of specialized clinics. A manualized treatment can serve as a much needed resource&#xD;
      for community providers faced with treating elopement. The researchers have developed a&#xD;
      manualized, parent-mediated intervention called Function-Based Elopement Treatment (FBET). In&#xD;
      a pilot feasibility study the researchers evaluated FBET with 24 children with ASD (age 4 to&#xD;
      12), who were randomly assigned to FBET (n=12) or a waitlist (n=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be randomized to receive the FBET intervention or PEP for 16&#xD;
      weeks. Participants in the PEP study arm will be offered the opportunity to have the FBET&#xD;
      intervention at the end of the 16 week study period. The study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate whether FBET is superior to PEP in reducing elopement in 76 children (age ≥ 4&#xD;
      to ≤ 12) with ASD after 16 weeks of treatment using the Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist-Hyperactivity subscale (ABC-H).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate two key secondary outcomes (at Wk 16): a) the independent evaluator ratings&#xD;
      on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement rating (CGI-I) and b) home safety, based on the&#xD;
      percentage of prevention items endorsed on the home elopement safety checklist (HESC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate whether direct observation of elopement, based on parent data on elopement&#xD;
      frequency for one week leading up to each assessment point, demonstrates a significant&#xD;
      decrease in the FBET compared to PEP participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Evaluate whether gains made in the FBET group are maintained after treatment (at Wk&#xD;
      28, using the ABC-H, HESC, and CGI-I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of FBET on disruptive behavior using the&#xD;
      ABC-Irritability subscale&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Hyperactivity (ABC-H) Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Elopement will be measured by the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-H). The full ABC is a 58-item caregiver completed measure with 5 subscales. It is used extensively with children with ASD in clinical trials and has demonstrated validity and reliability with this population. Although the ABC-H targets hyperactivity, there are several items directly related to elopement. The hyperactivity subscale includes 16 items that are answered on a scale of 0 (not a problem) to 3 (severe problem). Scores for this subscale range from 0 to 48, where higher scores indicate a higher severity of hyperactivity.</description>

    <description>The Home Elopement Safety Checklist (HESC) is a 22-item instrument listing steps to prevent elopement (e.g., locks, alarms) and decrease safety risk if elopement were to occur (e.g., purchasing identification bracelets).

The a higher percentage means that more safety elements have been implemented in order to reduce elopement or to increase the child's safety if they do elope.</description>

    <description>The Function-Based Elopement Treatment (FBET) includes 12 appointments over 16 weeks. FBET focuses on parent-training, with the parent implementing procedures with therapist support. The goals of FBET are:&#xD;
to create a safer environment&#xD;
teach adaptive skills to replace elopement&#xD;
arrange the environment and rewards to reduce elopement&#xD;
and teach caregivers how to respond if elopement occurs Psychoeducation is emphasized, including discussions of elopement as a learned behavior, reinforcement, functions of elopement, extinction, and descriptions of treatment components. The FBET manual includes scripted text, examples, caregiver completed activities, and checks for understanding.</description>
