  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single dose, sequential group study to compare the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of pretomanid in the following groups of subjects: 1) subjects with severe&#xD;
      renal impairment including those with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) not needing dialysis,&#xD;
      and subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment, designated as Groups 2, 3, and 4,&#xD;
      respectively; and 2) subjects with normal renal function matched to the above renal&#xD;
      impairment groups, designated as Groups 1A, 1B, and 1C, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted following a reduced Pharmacokinetic (PK) study design in Part A&#xD;
      and Part B. Part A will enroll subjects from Group 1A (i.e., 6 healthy matched controls) and&#xD;
      Group 2 (i.e., 6 subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD, not on dialysis). A decision&#xD;
      will be made after the PK of pretomanid and safety of subjects enrolled in Part A have been&#xD;
      reviewed. If Part A demonstrated different pretomanid exposures at least a 50-100% increase&#xD;
      in Area under the Curve (AUC) in Group 2 (severe renal impairments and ESRD, not on dialysis)&#xD;
      relative to the exposures in Group 1A (matched subjects with normal renal function), then the&#xD;
      reduced PK study will extend to the full PK study to enroll subjects into Part B (i.e., to&#xD;
      investigate mild, and moderate renal impairment) and all enrollment will be initiated&#xD;
      concurrently in Part B groups (1B, 1C, 3 and 4). If no difference in PK and safety is&#xD;
      observed in Part A, then no further study (Part B) is recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate patient involvement will be 3 months. The primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the PK profiles of pretomanid in plasma and urine after a single oral dose of 200 mg in&#xD;
      subjects with renal impairment compared to matched healthy controls.&#xD;
