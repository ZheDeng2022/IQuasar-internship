    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and device performance of The RenalGuard System in the management of patients admitted with&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of&#xD;
      volume overload. Subjects will be referred by their physician if he/she feels that the&#xD;
      subject could benefit from observed diuresis in a hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device being utilized is called The RenalGuard® System (The System). By default, The&#xD;
      System infuses a volume of hydration fluid equal to the volume of urine output. This is known&#xD;
      as matched hydration. In addition, the clinician has the ability to adjust the matched&#xD;
      setting such that RenalGuard can infuse hydration fluid to achieve a positive fluid balance&#xD;
      (e.g. +100 ml/hr.) or a negative fluid balance (e.g. -100 ml/hr.). The purpose of this&#xD;
      balanced fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension and vital&#xD;
      organ dysfunction, or fluid overload that may lead to shortness of breath in subjects in whom&#xD;
      high urine output is desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with The RenalGuard System for a minimum of 24-hours, and&#xD;
      possibly longer, at the investigators discretion. They will be followed for 30 days post&#xD;
      discharge. The protocol will enroll up to 40 subjects to develop the clinical algorithm&#xD;
      required to optimally and safely perform removal of volume. The study will be conducted in up&#xD;
      to 5 sites in Europe.&#xD;

             and the end of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  persistent dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion at screening and at the time&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subject with pre-existing chronic renal failure (impaired renal function) defined as&#xD;
             an eGFR between presentation and enrollment of ≥ 25 and &lt;90 mL/min/1.73m2, calculated&#xD;
             using the MDRD equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has agreed to all follow-up testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known inability to have a Foley catheter placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Total urine output &lt; 200 ml or average urine rate &lt; 50 ml/hour in the Diuretic&#xD;

             infections (i.e., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis,&#xD;
             pneumonia), which may interfere with the ability to interpret the primary cause of&#xD;
             dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg at the time of enrollment or persistent heart&#xD;

          7. Clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome currently or within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. (Note: the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
             and that the sole presence of elevated troponin concentrations is not sufficient for a&#xD;
             diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, given that troponin concentrations may be&#xD;

             prior to screening, or active life-threatening GI bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known hepatic impairment (as evidenced by total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL, or increased&#xD;
             ammonia levels, if performed) or history of cirrhosis with evidence of portal&#xD;

             cm2 or mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg on prior or current echocardiogram) or severe mitral&#xD;
             stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Severe aortic insufficiency or severe mitral regurgitation for which surgical or&#xD;
             percutaneous intervention is indicated.&#xD;

             balloon pump or any ventricular assist device; hemofiltration, ultrafiltration or&#xD;
             dialysis), with the exception of IV furosemide (or equivalent diuretic), or IV&#xD;
             nitrates at a dose of ≤ 0.1 mg/kg/hour if the patient has a systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg at&#xD;
             the start of screening.&#xD;

         21. Inability to follow instructions or comply with follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any other medical condition(s) that may put the patient at risk or influence study&#xD;
             results in the investigator's opinion, or that the investigator deems unsuitable for&#xD;
             the study, including drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric, behavioral or cognitive&#xD;
             disorders, sufficient to interfere with the patient's ability to understand and comply&#xD;
