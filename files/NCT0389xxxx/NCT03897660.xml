  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of a diet enriched with omega-3 fatty acids are multiple and confirmed by&#xD;
      several clinical studies. Supplementation with vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, can increase&#xD;
      or maintain bone density in postmenopausal women and reduce the risk of fracture. In&#xD;
      addition, some studies show that vitamin K may promote the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids.&#xD;
      Fish oil, rich in omega-3, is one of the world's favorite forms of omega-3 supplements.&#xD;
      However, many people suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort when ingesting fish oil&#xD;
      capsules. To minimize these discomforts and improve plasmatic omega-3 bioavailability,&#xD;
      Neptune Wellness Solutions has developed a patented formulation of fish oil called MaxSimil®,&#xD;
      where omega-3s are in the monoglyceride (MAG) form, a predigested omega-3 form. This&#xD;
      formulation has been tested in humans in a double-blind controlled-randomized pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) pilot study with crossover design. PK is defined as a monitoring of omega-3 levels in&#xD;
      the blood by frequent blood sampling over a period of 24 hours following the ingestion of a&#xD;
      single dose of omega-3. The results obtained showed that MaxSimil® omega-3s are 3 times more&#xD;
      absorbed in the blood than the comparison formulation, a source of omega-3 in the ethyl ester&#xD;
      (EE) form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this first study confirms a greater bioavailability of MaxSimil®, a complementary PK&#xD;
      study is necessary to confirm these results and to correct an important methodological bias.&#xD;
      In fact, the pilot study did not include a comparator group where omega-3s were in the&#xD;
      triglyceride (TG) form, the most widely omega-3 form currently consumed, but rather use an EE&#xD;
      form, which have lower bioavailability than TG form. This may therefore have biased the study&#xD;
      from the point of view of the comparator and thus give the impression that the comparator had&#xD;
      been deliberately chosen to be less bioavailable than the MaxSimil®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to confirm the superiority of MaxSimil® (omega-3 MAG form), both in terms of&#xD;
      bioavailability and incidence of side effects, the aim of this study is to redo a PK study&#xD;
      using this time two comparators, the two main forms of omega-3 currently used (TG and EE&#xD;
      forms), as well as a supplementation with vitamin K2 (a form of vitamin K). Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that MaxSimil® will be associated with a better omega-3 bioavailability and a lower incidence&#xD;
      of side effects than the other two forms (TG and EE), and possibly also with a better vitamin&#xD;
      K bioavailability.&#xD;

      Long Chain-Polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) are needed to support normal physiological&#xD;
      functions: Unlike saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, synthesis of eicosapentaenoic&#xD;
      acid (EPA, 20:5 omega-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 omega-3) from its omega-3 PUFA&#xD;
      precursor, alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-3), is extremely limited in humans. Thus, it is&#xD;
      recommended that DHA be obtained from dietary sources such as fish and seafood. Intake of EPA&#xD;
      and DHA from fish normally correlates positively with the concentrations of EPA and DHA in&#xD;
      plasma. However, recent data suggest that EPA levels are approximately twice higher in plasma&#xD;
      lipids of the elderly as compared to young individuals, suggesting that potential alterations&#xD;
      in EPA incorporation and utilization occur during aging. Similar results were obtained with a&#xD;
      DHA-enriched supplement where the increase of DHA in plasma total lipids was 42% higher in&#xD;
      the elderly compared to the young. At sufficient levels of cellular content, the LC-PUFA&#xD;
      influence the physical nature of cell membranes and membrane protein-mediated responses,&#xD;
      lipid-mediator generation, cell signalling, and gene expression in many different cell types.&#xD;
      Through these mechanisms, ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4 omega-6) and DHA influence both cell&#xD;
      and tissue responses to external signals, and thereby their physiology. Therefore, imbalances&#xD;
      in LC-PUFA homeostasis potentially induce dysfunctions in the physiology of organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging of the Canadians and their nutrition: Canada's population is expected to age more&#xD;
      rapidly in the coming years. Senior citizens have become more numerous than children in 2015.&#xD;
      A major concern about old age, both the individual and society, is a decline in health,&#xD;
      especially if this means a loss of self-sufficiency and independence. Increasing research for&#xD;
      promoting healthy aging is ongoing but there are physiological modifications occurring during&#xD;
      aging that might change bioavailability of LC-PUFA. For instance, intake of EPA and DHA&#xD;
      concentrated in fish normally correlates positively with the concentrations of EPA and DHA in&#xD;
      plasma. However, recent data from our laboratories suggest that EPA levels are approximately&#xD;
      twice higher in plasma lipids of the elderly as compared to young individuals, suggesting&#xD;
      that potential alterations in EPA incorporation and utilization occur during aging. DHA&#xD;
      response to a DHA-rich supplement was significantly higher in the elderly as compared to the&#xD;
      young. While on DHA-rich supplement, ARA was not decreased in the young and the elderly, but&#xD;
      similarly to EPA, ARA remained significantly higher in the elderly compared to the young. The&#xD;
      investigators also have publish data suggesting that 40 years old is the age where the EPA&#xD;
      and DHA levels in the plasma are higher than expected, and this was independent to their&#xD;
      dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake. Hence, these results are important indications that the&#xD;
      metabolism of LC-PUFA is modified by age and this observation lead to the idea that their&#xD;
      uptake and usage by organs and tissue can be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13C-DHA in humans: Tracing metabolism of carbon 13 (13C)-labelled fatty acids may provide&#xD;
      some insight into possible aging-related changes in fatty acid metabolism in humans. The&#xD;
      investigators recently used 13C-DHA to trace its metabolism in six young and six elderly&#xD;
      participants. The investigators found that, in the elderly, 13C-DHA was 4 times higher in&#xD;
      plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids at 4 h post-dose, beta-oxidation was 1.9 times&#xD;
      higher whereas apparent retro-conversion of 13C-DHA to other 13C-omega-3 fatty acids was 2.1&#xD;
      times higher 24 h and 7 d after tracer intake compared to the young. Hence, because DHA seems&#xD;
      to remain transiently for longer periods of time in the blood of the elderly compared to the&#xD;
      young, it may thus indicate that efficiency to remove DHA from the blood is lower in the&#xD;
      elderly than in the young, resulting in lower incorporation of DHA in the membrane of cells&#xD;
      that serve to initiate signalization. This observation is potentially at the root of altered&#xD;
      signalization in the elderly compared to the young.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioavailability of EPA and DHA esterified in TG, PL or as an ethyl ester (EE): Most of fish&#xD;
      oil supplements on the market are EPA and DHA esterified in TG and to a lower level in EE and&#xD;
      PL. There has been a lot of study evaluating whether one form of esterification enhances&#xD;
      bioavailability of EPA and DHA. In pharmacology, &quot;Bioavailability&quot; is defined as a&#xD;
      subcategory of absorption and it is the portion of the administered dose of a drug or in this&#xD;
      case, EPA+DHA that reaches the systemic circulation. By definition, an intravenous drug is&#xD;
      100% bioavailable but when a drug is administered orally, its bioavailability is usually&#xD;
      decreased due to incomplete absorption or first-pass metabolism. Hence, in the review paper&#xD;
      of Ghasemifard et al., they reviewed 21 papers that evaluated whether omega-3 fatty acid were&#xD;
      more bioavailable when given in the form of EE, TG, non-esterified form or as a PL. Four&#xD;
      studies were rejected because there were no control group, eight studies were evaluating&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) defined as a follow up between 8 h up to 72 h of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      the omega-3 fatty acid product whereas nine studies evaluated the long term intake&#xD;
      (pharmacodynamic, PD) of a repeated daily dose of omega-3 fatty acids over a period of 2&#xD;
      weeks and up to 6 months. Although the methodologies of the studies differ, some conclusion&#xD;
      about the PK was that bioavailability of EPA+ DHA was higher when given in the forms of&#xD;
      non-esterified fatty acid &gt; TG &gt;&gt;&gt; EE. Lower absorption of the EE form might be because&#xD;
      pancreatic hydrolysis of EPA and DHA of the EE form compared to the TG form is 10-50 times&#xD;
      lower. Hence, the esterification form of omega-3 fatty acids might change their short-term&#xD;
      bioavailability and this information is particularly relevant in the context of metabolic&#xD;
      diseases that can either affect fat absorption or to an aging population where there are&#xD;
      dyslipidemias that might change omega-3 fatty acid bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is MAG-Omega-3 form a better bioavailable source of EPA+DHA?: One study in rats reported&#xD;
      bioavailability of DHA esterified in TG, PL or MAG (2-mono-acylglycerol) in plasma,&#xD;
      erythrocytes, retina and brain tissue. They reported that after giving DHA in the different&#xD;
      forms to rats for 35 days, DHA given in the MAG and PL form were 23-50% more concentrated in&#xD;
      plasma total lipids and erythrocytes compared to TG-DHA. In the retina and the brain, DHA&#xD;
      increase to the same levels whatsoever esterification form it was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conditions of lipid malabsorption, MAG enriched with EPA + DHA enhance their delivery to&#xD;
      circulatory system in humans. In humans with cystic fibrosis, a disease recognized as having&#xD;
      fat malabsorption, especially the long chain fatty acids such as DHA, it was reported that&#xD;
      providing a MAG-DHA supplementation for one month was efficient to increase levels of DHA in&#xD;
      the erythrocytes. This pilot study indicates that MAG-DHA supplementation corrects&#xD;
      erythrocyte ARA/DHA imbalance and may exert anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether&#xD;
      MAG-DHA is more efficient in participants without malabsorption problems remains to be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects associated to fish oil intake: In a meta-analysis evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of prescribed omega-3 fatty acid supplements, it was reported that only three&#xD;
      minor side effects were associated to fish oil intake: fishy taste, fishy burp and nausea.&#xD;
      Although these sides effects seem limited to gastro-intestinal discomforts, it can largely&#xD;
      compromise short- and long-term adherence to fish oil intake. One protective microorganism to&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux is the presence of Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori). Moreover, it was&#xD;
      recently suggested that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation inhibit H. Pylori, by inhibiting&#xD;
      the synthesis of vitamin K that is required by this microorganism for its own survival. A&#xD;
      pre-digested form of omega-3 fatty acid such as a MAG form with added vitamin K might limit&#xD;
      these gastro-intestinal discomforts, and this is something the investigators want to&#xD;
      investigate in this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is Vitamin K2?: Vitamins are essential for different physiological functions of the&#xD;
      body. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. Its discovery was mainly driven by its role on&#xD;
      blood coagulation but other roles of this vitamin include regulation of calcium metabolism in&#xD;
      tissues, cell growth and proliferation. There are three main forms for vitamin K: K1, K2 and&#xD;
      K3. Vitamin K2 is referred as menaquinone since it shares a naphthoquinone ring and a side&#xD;
      chain with variable length. Most of menaquinones are synthesized by bacteria. Since omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid intake seems to inhibit vitamin K2 synthesis by bacteria such as H. Pylori, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to add vitamin K2 in the MAG-omega-3 formulation to evaluate whether&#xD;
      this formulation could decrease side effects of fish oil supplement consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of this study: Over the 20th century, consumption of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6)&#xD;
      increased from 2.79% to 7.21% of energy and this is largely due to our dependence on new food&#xD;
      production methodologies, including soybean oil. This has created over decades a diet that is&#xD;
      deficient in long chain omega-3 fatty acids. Recently, and because of the enthusiasm around&#xD;
      consumption of fish oil, there is increasing concerns about fish sustainability. These&#xD;
      critical issues leads us to have a sustainable source of omega-3 fatty acids, that is the&#xD;
      most bioavailable and to recommend lower doses of EPA+DHA to be consumed by the population to&#xD;
      have similar health effects. At the same time, having a source of omega-3 fatty acid with&#xD;
      limited side effects would also contribute to a better adherence of the population to their&#xD;
      consumption and perhaps decrease capsule waste. The plasma DHA pool is critical to bring DHA&#xD;
      to the brain and other organs and it is dynamic, constantly exchanging FA with organs and&#xD;
      tissues. Numerous studies have assessed the absorption, bioavailability and accretion of DHA&#xD;
      in the plasma with the conclusion that non-esterified DHA &gt; TG &gt;&gt;&gt; EE. Recently, there has&#xD;
      been enthusiasm for MAG-Omega-3 formulations since it was shown to improve EPA and DHA&#xD;
      bioavailability in humans with lower intestinal lipid absorption. However, whether EPA and&#xD;
      DHA are better absorbed and bioavailable in humans without any issues with intestinal lipid&#xD;
      absorption remain to be established. Therefore, this project will test a MAG-Omega-3&#xD;
      formulation enriched with vitamin K2, since the investigators hypothesized that this&#xD;
      formulation will be the most absorbed and bioavailable with the lowest side effects in men&#xD;
      and women without any disease such as intestinal lipid absorption issues.&#xD;
