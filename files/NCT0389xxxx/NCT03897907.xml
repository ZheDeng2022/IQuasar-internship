  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study assessing the impact of psychosocial factors on pain&#xD;
      and physical performance among adolescents with anterior knee pain. A set of psychosocial&#xD;
      surveys assessing activity-related fear, stress, anxiety and depression will be completed by&#xD;
      the participant/parents. Participants will then complete clinical tests of physical&#xD;
      performance, numeric pain rating scale, and a self-report questionnaire of functional&#xD;
      ability. Participants will then be randomized into one of two psychosocial intervention&#xD;
      groups (psychologically informed education group and a control group). After participants&#xD;
      receive their assigned education intervention, the clinical tests of pain and self-reported&#xD;
      functional ability will be readministered. Participants with anterior knee pain will then&#xD;
      complete follow-up surveys of their psychosocial beliefs, pain and self-reported functional&#xD;
      ability through REDcap at immediately post-intervention, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial design. Participants will&#xD;
      complete the randomized intervention immediately after completing baseline testing.&#xD;
      Post-intervention testing will also be completed immediately after the randomized&#xD;
      intervention. A follow-up REDcap survey will be sent by email to assess function and pain at&#xD;
      2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Psychologically Informed Education Group Psychologically Informed Education&#xD;
      Medium There are many ways to provide patient education, but the investigators believe that&#xD;
      adolescents will respond well to video education on a tablet. Adolescents are extremely&#xD;
      comfortable with this technology, and the video will allow for standardized education among&#xD;
      all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of Psychologically Informed Education for adolescents with AKP Recommended adult&#xD;
      pain science education will be modified using published recommendations for the adolescent&#xD;
      population and tailored to anterior knee pain.(Robins, Perron, Heathcote, &amp; Simons, 2016) The&#xD;
      education session will teach participants how the body processes nociception and experiences&#xD;
      pain, and pain does not mean tissues are being damaged. Additionally the psychologically&#xD;
      informed education video will use the framework called the &quot;Common Sense Model of&#xD;
      Self-Regulation&quot; which advocates for education to address five cognitive dimensions: (1)&#xD;
      identity (the effort to evaluate symptoms and label the illness); (2) cause (the subjectively&#xD;
      formulated belief of what is causing the symptoms); (3) time-line (the patient's perception&#xD;
      of how long the problem will last); (4) consequences (the patient's predictions of how the&#xD;
      illness will affect them in different areas of their life); and (5) controllability (the&#xD;
      patient's belief regarding their outcome and personal ability to change it).(Leventhal,&#xD;
      Phillips, &amp; Burns, 2016) Control Group Participants in the control education group will watch&#xD;
      a video on the iPad equal in length to the psychologically informed education video. The&#xD;
      control video will discuss basic anatomy of the knee and provide no psychosocial education or&#xD;
      positive reinforcement about their condition.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of change of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS). The AKPS is a self-reported 13 item questionnaire with discrete categories related to various levels of current knee function. Categories within each item are weighted, and responses are summed to provide an overall score of 0-100, with 100 representing no disability. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale is found to be valid and reliable in patients from 12-50 years of age presenting with anterior knee pain with a test-retest reliability of .95 (Watson, 2005). A change of 10 points represent the minimal clinical difference (Crossley, 2004).</description>

    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, 2 weeks (12-16 days post-evaluation), 6 weeks (39-46 days post-evaluation), and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain rating scale asks the patient their highest pain in the last 24 hours. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a 0-10 scale subjectively assessing a patients perceived level of pain. With 0 on the scale = to no pain, and 10 = to the worst pain imaginable. The use of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for assessing pain has been validated for use in patients with knee pain and has been found to have a minimal detectable change of 1 points.</description>

Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the patient sample is composed of minors who are a protected patient population Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Aggregate data including sample means, standard deviations, frequencies and significance values will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and conference abstracts.
