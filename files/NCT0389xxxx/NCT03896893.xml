      This study will evaluate the effect of skin antisepsis and/or emollient therapy on bacterial&#xD;
      colonization dynamics in very low birth weight, hospitalized infants. Bacterial swabs from 5&#xD;
      body sites will be collected at baseline, day 3, day 8 and day 13 following study arm&#xD;
      assignment. Study outcomes include changes in bacterial colony counts, burden of&#xD;
      gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens and overall skin score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite substantial global decline in childhood mortality rates, equivalent progress in&#xD;
      neonatal mortality reduction has not been achieved. Severe bacterial infection affects&#xD;
      approximately 6.9 million neonates and causes an estimated 750 000 deaths in low-middle&#xD;
      income countries (LMIC) annually. The neonatal period extends from birth to 28 days of life,&#xD;
      although neonatal hospitalization episodes (and therefore infection risk) are often&#xD;
      substantially prolonged in preterm infants. In South Africa, infections account for 13.8% of&#xD;
      neonatal mortality (following prematurity and intrapartum hypoxia). The South African&#xD;
      Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP) cites nosocomial infection as the second&#xD;
      most prevalent avoidable factor in neonatal deaths. Developing new approaches to prevent&#xD;
      infection in hospitalized and preterm newborns in LMIC is key to achieving the Sustainable&#xD;
      Development targets for under-five child survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk for hospital-onset sepsis in African neonates is disproportionately high and&#xD;
      influenced by many factors including: high rates of prematurity and low birth weight;&#xD;
      increasing in-hospital births, understaffing of maternity and neonatal services and limited&#xD;
      implementation of infection prevention practices. Of infections among hospitalized neonates&#xD;
      in high-income settings, hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) predominate,&#xD;
      accounting for 57% of infections. Research addressing the problem of hospital-onset neonatal&#xD;
      infection should therefore focus on BSI prevention. A key target for sepsis reduction is&#xD;
      prevention of intrapartum and post-delivery acquisition of bacterial colonization. Although&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of bacterial colonization preceding invasive infection is well-accepted,&#xD;
      there is limited data describing neonatal bacterial colonization dynamics in low-resource&#xD;
      settings. Full characterization of timing, source and route of bacterial acquisition,&#xD;
      flora/pathogen distribution, balance and changes over time is needed to identify all&#xD;
      potential targets for neonatal BSI prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emollient therapy and reduction of pathogen colonization through skin antisepsis, are&#xD;
      potentially useful targets for reducing risk of hospital-acquired BSI in neonates. Emollients&#xD;
      (oils, creams and ointments) have been applied daily or bi-daily in neonatal research and&#xD;
      routine practice settings, to promote skin integrity in preterm infants &lt;37 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
      The postulated mechanism of effect is improved skin barrier function and promotion of normal&#xD;
      flora colonization, which may prevent pathogen ingress and subsequent invasive infection. A&#xD;
      2016 Cochrane review of emollient therapy for sepsis prevention in preterm infants found no&#xD;
      evidence of reduced mortality or bloodstream infection rates, but the authors concluded that&#xD;
      further studies in low-resource settings were warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is a bisbiguanide molecule with broad-spectrum antiseptic&#xD;
      activity producing membrane disruption through increased cell permeability and bacterial&#xD;
      lysis. Efficacy and safety of daily CHG bathing to prevent pediatric bacteremia was&#xD;
      established in a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial for infants &gt;2 months in intensive&#xD;
      care (ICU) using 2% CHG-impregnated cloths. Three high-quality studies of newborn CHG skin or&#xD;
      cord cleansing showed reduced neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community-based neonates.&#xD;
      Safety of topical CHG application for neonates has been established at concentrations â‰¤1%,&#xD;
      although there is little data available on its use in premature, hospitalized neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHG skin cleansing and emollient therapy are potentially useful interventions for prevention&#xD;
      of hospital-acquired BSI in neonates from low-resource settings. In addition, these&#xD;
      interventions are suitable for inclusion in a neonatal sepsis prevention care bundle, should&#xD;
      they be found to be effective, safe and feasible. In addition these interventions would be&#xD;
      low-cost, easily scalable and potentially, a maternally-administered intervention. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of skin antisepsis and/or emollient therapy on bacterial&#xD;
      colonization dynamics in very low birth weight, hospitalized infants. Bacterial swabs from 5&#xD;
      body sites will be collected at baseline, day 3, day 8 and day 13 following study arm&#xD;
      assignment. Study outcomes include changes in bacterial colony counts, burden of&#xD;
      gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens and overall skin score.&#xD;
