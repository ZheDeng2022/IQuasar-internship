  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a rare disease characterized by an increase in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance, leading to a progressive decline in cardiac output (CO).Since cardiac&#xD;
      output is correlated with the prognosis of the disease, the conduct of a right heart&#xD;
      catheterization (thermodilution measurement, reference technique) during the annual follow-up&#xD;
      visit of patients in competences centres is recommended. In practice, it is not&#xD;
      systematically performed because of it is invasive, with potential risk for the patient, and&#xD;
      there is limited logistical capacity for its implementation. The estimation of cardiac output&#xD;
      is thus often based on cardiac ultrasound but its measurement is potentially biased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starling ™ SV is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor based on thoracic bio-reactance&#xD;
      measurement. Several clinical studies have shown that cardiac output measured by&#xD;
      bio-reactance is strongly correlated with the measurement obtained by catheterization in&#xD;
      different indications. Rich et al. (2013) assessed bio-reactance specifically in 50 patients&#xD;
      with Pulmonary Hypertension compared with thermodilution. The results showed that the&#xD;
      measurement of cardiac output by bio-reactance was feasible in these patients, had a better&#xD;
      accuracy than by catheterization, and was reliable for detecting changes in cardiac output&#xD;
      after a vasodilatation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Starling ™ SV monitor could thus have a place in the follow-up of patients who are being&#xD;
      treated for Pulmonary Hypertension. Since it is a rapid, non-invasive examination, it could&#xD;
      be performed on an outpatient basis, especially as a first-line test to check the stability&#xD;
      of the CO, thus avoiding the systematic use of right heart catheterization, which would then&#xD;
      be reserved only to patients for whom the measurement by bio-reactance would show a decrease&#xD;
      of cardiac output compared to the previous value. Before being able to propose this use in&#xD;
      current practice, it is necessary to carry out a pilot study which will make it possible to&#xD;
      explore the interest of bio-reactance in this situation.&#xD;

Then, the ability of the relative variation of cardiac output measured by thoracic bio-reactance to predict the patient's status (stable or unstable) will be assessed.</description>
