  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on&#xD;
      postural control of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). All participants&#xD;
      will receive four conditions of stimulation, in a crossover protocol: cerebellar anodic,&#xD;
      cerebellar cathodic, primary motor cortex anodic (M1) or sham tDCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a highly frequent neurodevelopmental disorder&#xD;
      with negative impacts on children's motor repertoire, quality of life and general health. One&#xD;
      of the main problems faced is the balance deficit, which although well characterized in this&#xD;
      population, little is known about the etiological core of this impairment. The cerebellum&#xD;
      appears to be a functionally impaired structure in DCD, but frontal motor areas are also&#xD;
      involved. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive way of inducing&#xD;
      local-specific polarity-dependent synaptic modulation. Cerebellar tDCS (CE-tDCS) is even more&#xD;
      recent, with still unclear results on its effects on postural balance, with only one study in&#xD;
      children, which requires us to better understand the type of stimulation necessary to induce&#xD;
      balance improvement in children with DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators aimed to verify the effects of anodal tDCS over primary motor cortex&#xD;
      (M1-atDCS) and CE-tDCS (anodic, cathodic and sham) on the balance of children with DCD,&#xD;
      compared to children without DCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Fifteen children with DCD (total MABC-2 and balance &lt;15%, with DCDQ positive / TL&#xD;
      positive) and 15 children without DCD (MABC-2 total and balance ≥50% and DCDQ negative) will&#xD;
      be assessed by platform stabilometry (PS) before and after receiving M1, cerebellar anodic,&#xD;
      cerebellar cathodic, primary motor cortex anodic (M1) or sham tDCS (crossover). They will be&#xD;
      evaluated under conditions without proprioceptive manipulation (direct on PS) with open and&#xD;
      closed eyes, and with proprioceptive manipulation (on foam surface) with open and closed&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
