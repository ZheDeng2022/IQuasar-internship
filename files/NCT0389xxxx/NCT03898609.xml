      Introduction. The multifactorial chylomicronemia ((MCM), also known as type V&#xD;
      hyperlipoproteinaemia or mixed hyperlipidaemia) is an oligogenic or polygenic disorder that&#xD;
      is associated with a reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity which leads to chylomicronemia.&#xD;
      In this disease, very high concentrations of serum triglycerides (≥10 mmol/l (≥880 mg/dL))&#xD;
      can be observed in the fasting state due to the accumulation of both VLDL-C and chylomicron.&#xD;
      In patients with MCM, chylomicronemia typically occur in adulthood and is exacerbated by the&#xD;
      presence of secondary factors such as a diet rich in dietary fats and simple sugars, obesity,&#xD;
      alcohol intake and uncontrolled diabetes. It has been estimated that chylomicronemia can be&#xD;
      found in 1:600 adults. However, it is likely that the prevalence of MCM may increase in the&#xD;
      future due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      This condition increases the risk of acute pancreatitis, which can be recurrent and&#xD;
      potentially fatal. Indeed, the risk of acute pancreatitis is 10-20% for TG levels &gt; 22.58&#xD;
      mmol/L (&gt;2000 mg/dL). Furthermore, because MCM patients often present with other lipid&#xD;
      disturbances as well as a worse metabolic profile, these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fortunately, MCM patients generally respond well to&#xD;
      modifications in lifestyle, to treatment of secondary factors and to triglycerides lowering&#xD;
      therapies such as fibrates. However, it is still unknown which kind of diet has the greatest&#xD;
      effect on triglycerides level and on the metabolic profile in MCM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional recommendations can be very different according to the nature of the&#xD;
      patient's population to be treated. In order to reduce and manage triglycerides level in the&#xD;
      general population, the American Heart Association guidelines recommend reduction of simple&#xD;
      carbohydrates intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the nutritional intervention strategy is quite different for subjects&#xD;
      affected by familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), for which the treatment focuses on&#xD;
      restriction of dietary fat. FCS is a very rare autosomal recessive disease that leads to a&#xD;
      drastic reduction of chylomicrons clearance leading to chylomicronaemia. Therefore, a very&#xD;
      strict lipid-controlled diet low in long-chain fatty acid (10-30g/day or 10%-15% of total&#xD;
      energy intake) is required in order to lower chylomicron formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCM is a complex condition in which both an increased VLDL formation by the liver and a&#xD;
      decreased chylomicrons and VLDL clearance are present. Furthermore, triglycerides values are&#xD;
      fluctuating from day to day but generally remain very high. Therefore, the best dietary&#xD;
      approach for these patients remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of low-fat&#xD;
      vs low-carbohydrate diets on fasting serum triglyceride concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on other fasting&#xD;
           cardiometabolic parameters: measured LDL-C, total cholesterol, HDL-C, glucose, insulin,&#xD;
           HOMA-IR, apoB, non-HDL-C, hs-CRP, PCSK9 and free fatty acids (FFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on SBP, DBP and waist&#xD;
           circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate diets on lipoprotein subfractions&#xD;
           (fasting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effects of low-fat vs low-carbohydrate meals on postprandial&#xD;
           triglycerides, insulin, glucose, FFA and PCSK9 after a standardized test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the patients' appreciation, compliance and tolerability for each experimental&#xD;
           diet (feedback questionnaire).&#xD;
