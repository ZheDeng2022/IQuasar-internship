    <textblock>
      The STELLAR trial will assess the effect of acalabrutinib taken in combination with CHOP-R&#xD;
      compared to taking CHOP-R alone in patients with newly diagnosed Richter's Syndrome (RS). It&#xD;
      will also be a platform to test other new drugs that show potential for treating RS. Chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) is the most common blood cancer in adults, usually in their 70s&#xD;
      or older. In a few patients, CLL can transform from a slow-growing cancer into an aggressive&#xD;
      lymphoma called Richter's Syndrome. RS is very difficult to treat and patients have a short&#xD;
      life-expectancy - usually a few months after diagnosis. Treatment for Richter's Syndrome in&#xD;
      the UK is CHOP (four chemotherapy drugs) plus rituximab ('R' - an antibody treatment). The&#xD;
      CHOP-R treatment is given as a standard of care for RS but has limited benefit - it is often&#xD;
      temporary to extend life. Richter's Syndrome returns in most patients who then die from this&#xD;
      disease. The STELLAR trial will investigate if a new drug called acalabrutinib, which is&#xD;
      effective used by itself in patients with relapsed CLL and also some with Richter's Syndrome,&#xD;
      will improve outcomes for newly diagnosed patients with RS. Acalabrutinib blocks a protein in&#xD;
      CLL which can stop the cancer growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have Richter's Syndrome and are suitable for CHOP-R will be recruited by&#xD;
      specialised hospitals across the UK. People with another cancer, heart problems, or recent&#xD;
      stroke cannot take part. Participants will have a lymph node biopsy, 3-4 bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsies, blood samples, and PET-CT and CT scans. CHOP-R is given in a hospital every three&#xD;
      weeks up to 6 times. All participants will receive CHOP-R; half will also receive&#xD;
      acalabrutinib. When treatment with CHOP-R ends the patients who had acalabrutinib can&#xD;
      continue to take it; patients who had CHOP-R alone may have acalabrutinib if their Richter's&#xD;
      Syndrome returns after CHOP-R.&#xD;

      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STELLAR is a UK multi-centre trial for patients with newly-diagnosed Richter's Syndrome (RS),&#xD;
      which is a rare and highly aggressive transformation of another blood cancer, chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). It has two parts: a randomised trial (the main component of the&#xD;
      trial) which compares the current standard of care with an 'experimental' combination, and a&#xD;
      platform for trialing single-arm studies investigating new drugs, or new combinations of&#xD;
      drugs, for treating patients with newly-diagnosed Richter's Syndrome. The first novel&#xD;
      treatment to be investigated in STELLAR is acalabrutinib which is a 'small molecule' drug&#xD;
      that targets and blocks one of the pathways that causes the CLL (and by extension Richter's&#xD;
      Syndrome) cancer cells to grow and multiply. Stopping the proliferation of cancer cells is a&#xD;
      key aim of cancer treatments. There have been promising studies using acalabrutinib to treat&#xD;
      patients with CLL and patients with Richter's Syndrome, but so far these are small and have&#xD;
      not compared acalabrutinib, on its own or in a combination, with the current Standard of Care&#xD;
      treatment for Richter's Syndrome: CHOP-R chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
      vincristine, prednisolone and rituximab). In the STELLAR trial we will investigate if adding&#xD;
      acalabrutinib to CHOP-R gives a better outcome for patients than CHOP-R alone. The sample&#xD;
      sizes described below have been calculated by biostatisticians and are based on the known&#xD;
      rates of progression, survival, and response rates for patients with Richter's Syndrome. The&#xD;
      sample sizes given below will enable us to answer the research questions with the appropriate&#xD;
      number of patients with a strong confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomised component of STELLAR, 60 eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 between&#xD;
      the current standard of care for Richter's Syndrome (CHOP-R) and the experimental treatment&#xD;
      of CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib such that 30 patients are in each of these two sets. The trial&#xD;
      is not blinded so participants, clinic staff, and trial staff will know which treatment they&#xD;
      receive after the patient has been randomised. Participants will have frequent assessments,&#xD;
      which includes assessments after 4 and 6 cycles of treatment to see if the treatment is&#xD;
      working, and all patients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. The primary aim of&#xD;
      the randomised component is to see if adding acalabrutinib to CHOP-R improves the rate of&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) for RS patients, i.e. if they are in remission from Richter's&#xD;
      Syndrome for a longer period of time. It is important that this component is randomised so&#xD;
      that the comparison of the two treatments will be fair and unbiased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the platform study part of STELLAR, single-arm cohorts (not randomised) will receive&#xD;
      treatment which will test the activity of novel combinations or treatment. The platform may&#xD;
      be expanded to test other promising treatments if any are identified whilst the randomised&#xD;
      trial is open to recruitment. In the first platform study there are two cohorts which will&#xD;
      answer two different research questions. The platform arms are not randomised or blinded&#xD;
      because they are not comparable; it is rather that they help us to determine whether these&#xD;
      treatments may be possible candidates for future therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (21-30 participants) will be made up of patients whose Richter's Syndrome has&#xD;
           progressed (their disease has got worse) whilst being treated with CHOP-R (or CHOP +&#xD;
           another immunotherapy treatment) alone or who have relapsed with Richter's Syndrome&#xD;
           after completing treatment with CHOP-R. Entry to this cohort will be prioritised for&#xD;
           patients who have taken part in the STELLAR randomised trial, but will be opened up to&#xD;
           patients outside STELLAR if fewer than 21 patients from STELLAR take part. In this&#xD;
           cohort we will investigate if giving acalabrutinib treatment on its own improves&#xD;
           outcomes for patients who have got worse on or relapsed after the current standard of&#xD;
           care (CHOP-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (up to 15 patients) are anthracycline-naïve (they haven't received CHOP-R&#xD;
           before) Richter's Syndrome patients, who have been diagnosed whilst being treated with&#xD;
           ibrutinib (defined as a diagnosis within 4 weeks of the last dose of ibrutinib).&#xD;
           Ibrutinib is the same class of drug as acalabrutinib, though acalabrutinib is a newer&#xD;
           drug. Ibrutinib is often used to treat CLL and it is not known if patients who have been&#xD;
           treated with ibrutinib will respond to treatment with acalabrutinib if they have&#xD;
           Richter's Syndrome. Ibrutinib is becoming a routine treatment for CLL, so it is&#xD;
           important to find out if acalabrutinib will help patients who do not respond to&#xD;
           ibrutinib. These patients are not included in the randomised trial so that we can&#xD;
           determine if acalabrutinib will work in these ibrutinib-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified at specialist haemato-oncology centres around the UK through&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team meetings and consultant referral from other centres. Patients will be&#xD;
      approached by their consultant and other, trained, members of the clinic team to introduce&#xD;
      and discuss the trial. Patients will receive a patient information sheet and will be given at&#xD;
      least 24 hours to review the information and ask any additional questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have enrolled on STELLAR who are offered entry into Cohort 1 because their&#xD;
      disease has worsened when treated with CHOP-R alone, will already be familiar with the trial&#xD;
      processes and systems. They will need to know all of the new information about acalabrutinib&#xD;
      (the treatment for Cohort 1) and will be provided with a separate patient information sheet,&#xD;
      clinicians will aim to give patients at least 24 hours to review the information. Because&#xD;
      these patients are already familiar with the trial and will need urgent treatment they may be&#xD;
      permitted to consent on the same day that they have received the patient information sheet if&#xD;
      they have all their questions answered and are happy to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the standard of care arm will receive up to 6 cycles of CHOP-R&#xD;
      where each cycle is 21 days. Participants will be treated in a hospital day unit on day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle and will have tablets to take at home on days 2 to 5. All participants will be&#xD;
      formally assessed after 4 and 6 cycles of treatment. Participants who have achieved a&#xD;
      response may continue on to a stem cell transplant if they are suitable. Participants who do&#xD;
      not achieve a response will be offered entry in to the platform Cohort 1 to receive&#xD;
      acalabrutinib monotherapy if they are eligible. Entry into Cohort 1 is not mandatory; the&#xD;
      participant's doctor will discuss all possible treatment options with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who consent and are registered to Cohort 1 will take 100 mg twice-daily of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib at home as oral tablets. Treatment is continuous until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or patient choice. Participants will be formally assessed at weeks 12&#xD;
      and 24 to determine if they are responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the experimental arm of STELLAR and registered to Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      receive up to 6 cycles of CHOP-R where each cycle is 21 days. Participants will be treated in&#xD;
      a hospital day unit on day 1 of each cycle and will have tablets to take at home on days 2 to&#xD;
      5. Patients will then take 100 mg twice daily of acalabrutinib oral tablets at home on days&#xD;
      6-21. All participants will be formally assessed after 4 and 6 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
      Participants who have achieved a response will continue to take acalabrutinib at home at 100&#xD;
      mg twice daily, continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient&#xD;
      choice. These participants may continue on to a stem cell transplant if they are suitable. If&#xD;
      these patients do not achieve a response, they will discontinue trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, if patients do not respond to treatment or wish to withdraw from the trial they&#xD;
      will be counselled by their medical team on the options available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the STELLAR trial will have frequent assessments in the first 4 to 6 months&#xD;
      of the study so that they are monitored for toxicity and response to treatment. Most of the&#xD;
      assessments for participants receiving CHOP-R (with or without acalabrutinib) would be done&#xD;
      as part of their standard of care. Before entering the study each potential participant will&#xD;
      undergo screening assessments in the 4 weeks before trial entry (date of randomisation or&#xD;
      registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical and medical assessment by their doctor to record their: age, medical history,&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse, weight, any symptoms of their Richter's Syndrome, ECG (heart trace),&#xD;
      and any other relevant information. Women who are could become pregnant have to have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Blood samples are taken for local assessments (blood count and other&#xD;
      haematology tests, biochemistry, virology, immunology) and also for research (these are&#xD;
      'extra' samples that are not standard of care). Patients will also have a bone marrow&#xD;
      assessment, a PET-CT scan, and a lymph node biopsy; these assessments would be done as part&#xD;
      of the patients' standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments during the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have local assessments carried out whilst they receive CHOP-R, most of&#xD;
      these assessments are standard of care. Patients will have extra assessments that will help&#xD;
      us to answer the exploratory questions posed in the trial. Most of these extra assessments&#xD;
      will be done at the same time as local assessments so that patients don't have lots of extra&#xD;
      visits to the hospital. Patients in all cohorts will have: a physical assessment by their&#xD;
      doctor to record their blood pressure, pulse, weight, and any symptoms or side effects they&#xD;
      may have; blood samples are taken for local assessments, patients receiving acalabrutinib&#xD;
      will have more blood samples taken for research at the same time as the local ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and PET-CT scan as part of&#xD;
      their screening assessments. Some patients may have a bone marrow biopsy at the end of cycle&#xD;
      6 (or week 24 for Cohort 1) which would be part of their standard of care. All patients will&#xD;
      have a CT scan at the end of cycle 4 (week 12 for Cohort 1) and a PET-CT at the end of cycle&#xD;
      6 (week 24 for Cohort 1). If a patient has disease progression they will have another PET-CT&#xD;
      scan and lymph node biopsy, and some patients will have a bone marrow biopsy. All of these&#xD;
      scans and biopsies would be part of the patient's standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as medical assessments, patients will complete validated Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaires at trials visits. There are three multi item scales on fatigue, treatment side&#xD;
      effects and disease symptoms, infection and social activities and future health worries.&#xD;
      These questionnaires will be completed at clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All STELLAR patients will be followed-up for disease status and survival for at least 2 years&#xD;
      from trial entry to determine the long-term effectiveness of the therapy.&#xD;
