  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with a variety of important complications,&#xD;
      namely cardiovascular, neurocognitive and metabolic disturbances. The prevalence of OSA is&#xD;
      well studied in children and adults. However, adolescence - an interface between childhood&#xD;
      and adulthood, and a period of developmental changes known to affect sleep is largely&#xD;
      unexplored in relation to OSA. The only published prevalence study on adolescents is limited&#xD;
      by its small sample size, not a true representation of the general population and primarily&#xD;
      focused on Caucasians. In this proposal, the investigators aim to determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      OSA, and associated clinical features in a population-based sample of adolescents aged&#xD;
      between 12 and 16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample selection will be based on a stratified (by districts) and clustered (subjects&#xD;
      within randomly selected schools) randomised sampling frame. Each participant will fill in a&#xD;
      sleep habit questionnaire, undergo anthropometric measurements, physical examination and&#xD;
      complete home polysomnographic recordings. Participants will undergo Conners' Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Test and have blood samples taken to phenotype their cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      risk. The primary outcome is prevalence of OSA, assessed by the obstructive apnoea hypopnoea&#xD;
      index. Secondary outcomes include use of logistic regression models to assess association&#xD;
      between different severities of OSA and various demographic, clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained result will provide the much-needed OSA prevalence in adolescents which is&#xD;
      essential for estimating the true burden of disease within this population. This information&#xD;
      is also vital when considering population-based health policies and interventional&#xD;
      strategies. Globally, the findings from currently evidence-sparse region of the world allow&#xD;
      future international comparison of disease burden. Our study will also form a platform from&#xD;
      which repeated measurements can be made to assess time trends and to answer the important&#xD;
      question of whether adulthood OSA takes its origin from adolescence.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a cross-sectional, population-based study. Subjects who are found to meet all the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be recruited. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      set of sleep-related questionnaires, undergo anthropometric measurements, home&#xD;
      polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring, attention assessment and phenotyping of their metabolic&#xD;
      and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Data The subjects will attend our unit for assessment and explanation of home&#xD;
      PSG monitoring. After a 15-minute rest, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure&#xD;
      will be taken using the Datascope Accutorr Plus. Two measurements are taken at 1-minute&#xD;
      intervals, with a third reading taken 5 minutes later if the difference between the first two&#xD;
      &gt;4 mmHg. The average of two repeatable readings (difference ≤4 mmHg) will be used.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters including standing height (in metres) without shoes and body weight&#xD;
      (in kilograms) will be recorded using Harpenden Stadiometer (Holtain, UK) and an electronic&#xD;
      weighing scale (Tanita BF-522, Japan) respectively according to standard recommendations.&#xD;
      Waist and hip circumference (in centimetres) will also be obtained. Neck circumference will&#xD;
      be measured at the level of the most prominent portion of the thyroid cartilage with the head&#xD;
      held erect and the eyes facing forward. Z scores of body mass index and waist circumference&#xD;
      will be calculated using local references.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participating school is agreeable and logistically feasible, our research team can&#xD;
      carry out the above at school. However, in our experience schools close to our unit prefer to&#xD;
      send their students to us to undergo the various assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments will be carried out during the week to avoid weekday-weekend difference in&#xD;
      adolescents' sleep pattern. The students will also complete a chronotype preference&#xD;
      questionnaire, result from which can provide guidance regarding effects of sleep phase. The&#xD;
      reduced version of Horne and Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) will be&#xD;
      used to measure chronotype preference. It consists of five items designed to assess one's&#xD;
      preferred bedtime and rise time, the degree of tiredness in the morning, peak time for&#xD;
      optimal performance, and self-perceived circadian preference. The rMEQ has been validated in&#xD;
      ethnic Chinese individuals, with good psychometric properties [36], and has been used in&#xD;
      previous research conducted in adolescents.[37, 38] Participants scored higher than 17 and&#xD;
      lower than 12 will be classified as morning-type and evening-type, respectively. Participants&#xD;
      with total rMEQ scores between 12 and 17 will be classified as intermediate-type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level III sleep study will be conducted at home for every subject. A model of NOX-T3 sleep&#xD;
      monitor will be used to record the following parameters: respiratory movements of the chest&#xD;
      and abdomen by inductance plethysmography, oxygen saturation and derived heart rate by&#xD;
      oximetry, respiratory airflow by pressure transducer, snoring, body movement and body&#xD;
      position. An adequate overnight sleep study is defined as one with total sleep time &gt;6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sample of subjects will also be invited to undergo overnight full polysomnography&#xD;
      (PSG) in our sleep laboratory to validate the level III study (please see below for details).&#xD;
      In our laboratory, a model SiestaTM ProFusion III PSG monitor (Compumedics Telemed, Victoria,&#xD;
      Australia) will be used to record the following parameters: electroencephalogram from three&#xD;
      channels (F4/A1, C4/A1, O2/A1), bilateral electrooculogram, electromyogram of mentalis&#xD;
      activity and bilateral anterior tibialis. Inductance plethysmography will be used to record&#xD;
      respiratory movements of the chest and abdomen. Heart rate and electrocardiogram will be&#xD;
      obtained from 2 chest leads. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) will be measured by an oximeter (Ohmeda&#xD;
      Biox 3900 Pulse Oximeter) with finger probe. Respiratory airflow pressure signals and end&#xD;
      tidal CO2 will be recorded simultaneously via a triple-port nasal catheter placed at the&#xD;
      anterior nares and connected to a pressure transducer and a capnograph (BCI Capnocheck Plus)&#xD;
      respectively. An oronasal thermal sensor will also be used to detect absence of airflow.&#xD;
      Snoring will be measured by a snoring microphone placed near the throat. Body position is&#xD;
      monitored via a body position sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory events including obstructive apnoeas, mixed apnoeas, central apnoeas and&#xD;
      hypopnoeas will be scored based on the recommendations from The AASM Manual for the Scoring&#xD;
      of Sleep and Associated Events. [39] Respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) will be&#xD;
      scored when there is a fall of &lt;50% from baseline in the amplitude of nasal pressure signal&#xD;
      with flattening of the nasal pressure waveform, accompanied by snoring, noisy breathing, or&#xD;
      evidence of increased effort of breathing. A respiratory event is only scored when it lasts&#xD;
      ≥2 breaths irrespective of its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive apnoea hypopnoea index (OAHI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation index (ODI), arousal index (ArI) and respiratory arousal index (RAI) are defined&#xD;
      according to standard recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have carried out a pilot study to validate the proposed home sleep monitor&#xD;
      (NOX-T3). Eleven subjects aged between 12-16 years were recruited from various sources,&#xD;
      namely attendants to the sleep disorder clinic, healthy subjects who participated in our&#xD;
      sleep duration and blood pressure study and relatives of patients who attend our respiratory&#xD;
      clinic. Participants underwent an overnight in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) with&#xD;
      simultaneous NOX-T3 portable monitor recording, followed by unattended home recording with&#xD;
      NOX-T3. The mean±SD OAHI was 5.8 ± 6.6 events/h on PSG, 6.0 ± 6.9 events/h on in-laboratory&#xD;
      NOX-T3 recording, and 4.3 ± 4.8 events/h on home NOX-T3 recording (p=0.6). The intra-class&#xD;
      correlation between OAHI obtained from in-laboratory PSG and in-laboratory NOX-T3 recording&#xD;
      is 0.982 (95% CI: 0.937-0.995), indicating an excellent agreement. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      intra-class correlation between OAHI obtained from in-laboratory PSG and home recording with&#xD;
      NOX-T3 is 0.656 (95% CI: 0.155-0.893), indicating a moderate reliability of the home testing.&#xD;
      Moreover, based on a cutoff of OAHI ≥1 or 5 events/h, the Cohen's Kappa agreement between&#xD;
      in-laboratory PSG and home testing with NOX-T3 are both high at 0.814 (SE: 0.175).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to further validate this degree of agreement (Cohen's Kappa = 0.814)&#xD;
      of the home sleep testing by recruitment more subjects during the study period to undergo&#xD;
      both home testing and in-laboratory PSG. A sample size of 23 will provide an 80% power with a&#xD;
      type I error of 0.05 to validate a Cohen's Kappa of 0.814 of the home sleep testing against&#xD;
      the null hypothesis that the Cohen's Kappa is less than 0.3, i.e. a poor agreement. In other&#xD;
      words, another 12 random subjects will be recruited during the study period, making it a&#xD;
      total of 23 subjects for validating the home monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-day sleep pattern monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep will be objectively measured using actigraphs. Actigraph is a wristwatch-like device&#xD;
      that uses a piezo-electric beam to detect movements which are translated into digital counts&#xD;
      accumulated across predesigned epoch intervals (for example, 1 minute) and stored in internal&#xD;
      memory. Data can then be downloaded for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will be worn on the non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive days and nights. The&#xD;
      parents / caregivers will be instructed to keep a sleep log on bedtimes and waking times,&#xD;
      temporary pauses in actigraph registration (for example, while taking a bath), and&#xD;
      significant events that might affect sleep quantity or quality (for example, illness, injury&#xD;
      etc). The child with help of parents / caregiver will be instructed to press a button (event&#xD;
      marker) in the actigraph at bedtime and waking times. A completed sleep log will be obtained&#xD;
      from all participants, including both parent-reported sleep log and event markers on bedtimes&#xD;
      and waking times reported by the child. The activity data will be visually inspected to&#xD;
      detect significant discrepancies among the sleep log, event markers, and the activity&#xD;
      pattern. If there are discrepancies between event markers and sleep log recording, the latter&#xD;
      will be used to define bedtime and waking times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded nights will be excluded if (a) the actigraph is not in use, (b) information on&#xD;
      bedtime / waking times is missing, (c) there is a change in usual life routines due to, for&#xD;
      example, illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be scored using the Actiwatch Activity &amp; Sleep Analysis software. The scored&#xD;
      sleep data will be averaged for each study subject over the valid registration nights and&#xD;
      separately for weekday and weekend nights. Sleep duration is defined as the actual sleeping&#xD;
      time. Sleep start is defined as 10 minutes of consecutively recorded inactive data. Sleep&#xD;
      efficiency is defined as the actual sleep time divided by the time in bed. Sleep duration and&#xD;
      efficiency will be analysed as both continuous and dichotomous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper Airway Size Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tonsillar size will be examined and recorded using a validated grading system. Modified&#xD;
      Mallampati score will also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPT-II (Ver. 5.2 for Windows®) is designed as a computer game-like test for the evaluation of&#xD;
      sustained attention and response inhibition for respondents aged 6 or above. Subjects are&#xD;
      required to press the space bar or click the mouse whenever any letter except the letter 'X'&#xD;
      appears on the computer screen. The test requires about 14 minutes to complete. It will be&#xD;
      administered in the morning in a quiet room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Levels of Biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample will be taken from the subjects for fasting (at least 8 hours) glucose level,&#xD;
      lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), appetite-regulating hormones and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines determination. Plasma and serum samples will be stored at -80 °C&#xD;
      until measurement. Plasma glucose is measured by hexokinase method (Cobas C8000 Clinical&#xD;
      Chemistry Analyser, Roche Diagnostics Corp, Indianapolis, IN). The inter-assay coefficient of&#xD;
      variation is 3% or less at all concentrations up to 41.6 mmol/L. The lipid profile includes&#xD;
      total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, which are measured by appropriate&#xD;
      enzymatic assays (Cobas C8000 Clinical Chemistry Analyser, Roche Diagnostics Corp,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, IN, USA) with inter-assay coefficients of variation of ≤3%. Serum hs-CRP will&#xD;
      be measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay using the IMMULITE Analyzer (Diagnostic Products&#xD;
      Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). Our reference range for hs-CRP is&lt;11.0 mg/L and the&#xD;
      sensitivity and inter-assay coefficients of variation are 0.1 mg/L, 6.6% at 1.7 mg/L, 6.5% at&#xD;
      4.8 mg/L and 5.7% at 7.1 mg/L. Ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin and proinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      TNF-α and IL-6 will also be measured using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay.&#xD;
