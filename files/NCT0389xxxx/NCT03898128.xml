      In phase 2 and phase 3 studies, inotuzumab has shown evidence of single agent anti-leukemic&#xD;
      activity and proved to be particularly effective in providing a deep response, with an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile. Since 2014 anti-CD22 has been available for compassionate use in&#xD;
      Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this non-interventional retrospective study, toxicity, effectiveness and costs assessment&#xD;
      data will be collected from patients with ALL, to improve the knowledge about anti-CD22&#xD;
      treatment in clinical practice. Collecting data of patients and analyzing a large unbiased&#xD;
      patient-set of patients receiving anti-CD22 immunoconjugates could enlarge our knowledge on&#xD;
      therapies engaging CD22&#xD;

      In phase 2 and phase 3 studies, inotuzumab has shown evidence of single agent anti-leukemic&#xD;
      activity and proved to be particularly effective in providing a deep response, with an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile. Since 2014 anti-CD22 has been available for compassionate use in&#xD;
      Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this non-interventional retrospective study, toxicity, effectiveness and costs assessment&#xD;
      data will be collected from patients with ALL, to improve the knowledge about anti-CD22&#xD;
      treatment in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent advancements in the treatment of hematological malignancies, still a&#xD;
      considerable number of cases cannot be cured and represent real societal challenges with a&#xD;
      relevant social and economic impact. Indeed, treatments are becoming more expensive and the&#xD;
      current state of the art does not allow a good prediction of the therapeutic outcome. In&#xD;
      particular, several steps of the diagnostic and therapeutic paths should be improved, from&#xD;
      early and advanced diagnosis, in order to avoid treatment delays or impairment, to prognostic&#xD;
      assessment and monitoring of therapeutic response. The unsatisfactory response to&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy has led to the development of high-cost targeted therapies, whose&#xD;
      administration and schedules has to be guided by defined molecular criteria. Beside the&#xD;
      economic perspective, these novel drugs have relevant side effects that cannot be predicted&#xD;
      before treatment starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of hematological malignancies is further complicated by the high level of&#xD;
      disease heterogeneity in terms of pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms. A number of subtypes&#xD;
      have been defined for each disease, based on cytogenetic and molecular profiles and relevant&#xD;
      differences can be even observed within the same disease subtype, leading to different&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and responses to treatment and to guide therapeutic decisions for patients&#xD;
      affected by CD22 positive ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the observational nature of the study, for the patient there is no benefit expected.&#xD;
      For this observational nature of the study, for the patient there is no risk about his&#xD;
      health. Data will be treated according GCP/EU laws/Italian laws/local laws according the most&#xD;
      restrictive between these laws.&#xD;
