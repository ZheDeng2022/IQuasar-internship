  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic corticosteroid (CS) exposure is associated with changes in memory and the hippocampus&#xD;
      in both humans and in animal models. The hippocampus has a high concentration of&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptors (GCRs), and the pre-clinical literature demonstrates shortening of&#xD;
      apical dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in the&#xD;
      dentate gyrus (DG) following CS administration. In humans, both stress and CS exposure are&#xD;
      associated with a decline in declarative memory performance (a process mediated by the&#xD;
      hippocampus). Impairment in declarative memory and hippocampal atrophy are reported in&#xD;
      patients with excessive CS release due to Cushing's disease, and, by our group, in patients&#xD;
      receiving prescription CS therapy. These findings have important implications for patients&#xD;
      with mood disorders, as a large subset of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) show&#xD;
      evidence of HPA axis activation, elevated cortisol and, importantly, resistance to the&#xD;
      effects of CSs on both the HPA axis and on declarative memory. Thus, resistance to&#xD;
      corticosteroids appears to be a consequence of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study will examine changes in declarative memory, as well as use state-of-the-art&#xD;
      high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging, including structural and functional (i.e.,&#xD;
      task-based and resting state) MRI, in both men and women healthy controls, and, as an&#xD;
      exploratory aim, a depressed group, given 3-day exposures to hydrocortisone (160 mg/day) or&#xD;
      placebo. The study will translate preclinical findings to humans, provide valuable data on&#xD;
      possible sex differences in the response to cortisol and, for the first time, identify&#xD;
      specific hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA3/DG) in humans that are most sensitive to acute CS&#xD;
      effects. Using resting state fMRI data and whole brain connectomics using graph theoretical&#xD;
      approaches, we will determine the effects of cortisol exposure on functional brain networks.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this will be the first study to use neuroimaging to compare the brain's response&#xD;
      to CSs in people with depression vs. controls, and determine whether depressed people&#xD;
      demonstrate glucocorticoid resistance within the hippocampus. We hypothesize that hippocampal&#xD;
      response to acute CSs will be greatest in the CA3/DG subfield, greater in women than in men,&#xD;
      and that depressed people will show a blunted hippocampal response to CSs compared to&#xD;
      controls. A multidisciplinary research team with extensive experience in CS effects on the&#xD;
      brain and hippocampal subfield neuroimaging, and a prior history of research collaboration,&#xD;
      will conduct the project.&#xD;
