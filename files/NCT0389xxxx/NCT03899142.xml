  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sanquin Plasma Products BV developed a new manufacturing process for the Quin plasma products&#xD;
      in order to improve viral safety and to remove procoagulant activity. Since the new&#xD;
      manufacturing process will be the same for all Quin products, a clinical study with one of&#xD;
      the Quin products is sufficient for marketing authorisation of all new Quin products.&#xD;
      HepBQuin will serve as model for all other Quin products. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are&#xD;
      considered as a surrogate indicator of efficacy.&#xD;
