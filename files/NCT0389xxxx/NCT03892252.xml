      Guided by the idea of combining disease differentiation with syndrome differentiation in&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine, this study used the form of questionnaire to summarize the&#xD;
      changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types in colorectal cancer patients before and&#xD;
      after surgery. The Next-generation sequencing technology was used to explore the changes and&#xD;
      differences of intestinal microorganisms before and after surgery. The correlation between&#xD;
      changes of TCM syndromes, TCM constitution types, intestinal microbial evolution and tumor&#xD;
      biological characteristics in colorectal cancer patients before and after surgery was&#xD;
      analyzed. To explore the rationality of TCM in the prevention and treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer recurrence and metastasis in order to guide the individualized treatment and dietary&#xD;
      regulation of TCM.&#xD;
