  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fiasp® is a meal-time insulin that has been available in Sweden since June 2017. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the effectiveness of Fiasp® in treating Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The study&#xD;
      will be based on blood sugar measurements that the participants have uploaded to the Diasend®&#xD;
      database and on existing data in their electronic medical records. The study does not require&#xD;
      any additional visits to the study doctor.&#xD;
