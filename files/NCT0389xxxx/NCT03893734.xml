      A number of drugs used in the perioperative period may cause prolongation of the QT interval&#xD;
      on the electrocardiogram (EKG). These drugs include inhalational agents, antiemetic agents,&#xD;
      pain medications, and drugs used to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants. Approximately&#xD;
      80% of patients undergoing a general anesthetic will demonstrate significant prolongation of&#xD;
      the QT interval on the EKG in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) following surgery. The&#xD;
      concern with QT interval prolongation is that it can result in a potentially lethal&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia termed torsade des pointes. Despite the concurrent use of several of&#xD;
      these medications in a typical general anesthetic, torsade des pointes is a rare event in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. In the past decade, the use of intravenous methadone as part of a&#xD;
      balanced anesthetic technique has increased significantly. A single dose provided at&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia can provide prolonged (24-48 hours) relief from pain. Studies in&#xD;
      patients receiving long-term treatment with methadone for addiction therapy or chronic pain&#xD;
      have revealed that these patients are at risk for QT prolongation, torsade des pointe, and&#xD;
      cardiac death. However, the effect of a single intravenous dose of methadone used in the&#xD;
      operating room on the QT interval is uncertain. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is&#xD;
      to compare the impact of methadone, when compared to the more commonly-used opioid&#xD;
      hydromorphone, on QT prolongation measured with a 12-lead EKG in the PACU and on&#xD;
      postoperative day 1. We hypothesize that methadone will not result in significant QT&#xD;
      prolongation when used as part of a standardized general anesthetic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, the single most common cause of withdrawal of the use of drugs that have&#xD;
      already been marketed has been the prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram&#xD;
      associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or torsade de pointes. Without&#xD;
      treatment, torsade de pointes can progress to a lethal ventricular arrhythmia. A number of&#xD;
      drugs which prolong the QT interval can precipitate torsade de pointes. However, a number of&#xD;
      risk factors are often present in patients who develop drug-induced torsade de pointes. These&#xD;
      include hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, female gender, bradycardia, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      rapid rate of drug infusion, and high drug concentrations. Exposure to a drug that prolongs&#xD;
      the QT interval, particularly in a susceptible patient, may cause an exaggerated QT&#xD;
      prolongation.1 Another reason for the variability in risk for torsade de pointes relates to&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility for this arrhythmia. These factors control the duration of the QT&#xD;
      interval. At least 6 separate genes, if mutated, can cause the congenital long-QT interval.&#xD;
      In particular, the human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG), which encodes a potassium-channel&#xD;
      protein that regulates repolarization potassium currents, has been implicated in increasing&#xD;
      the risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of drugs used by physicians in the perioperative period effect the QT interval.&#xD;
      These include the anti-arrhythmic agents, calcium-channel blockers, antibiotics,&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs, and antiemetic agents like droperidol and haloperidol. Any agent which&#xD;
      results in a QT prolongation greater than 500 ms is thought to significantly escalate the&#xD;
      possibility of developing this arrhythmia. Drugs which increases that QT interval more than&#xD;
      500 ms should be immediately discontinued (normal values for the QT interval are &lt; 430 ms in&#xD;
      males and &lt; 450 ms in females). According to guidelines published by the European Agency for&#xD;
      the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, drugs which induce individual changes in the QT of 30&#xD;
      ms are unlikely to raise concerns about arrhythmias, changes of 30-60 ms are thought to&#xD;
      potentially increase the risk for arrhythmias, and drug-effects which raise the QT interval&#xD;
      more than 60 ms increase concerns about arrythmogenic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral methadone is a long acting agent which has been traditionally used to treat opioid&#xD;
      addiction. In addition, it is being increasingly used as an important therapy for chronic&#xD;
      pain. This agent has a long half-life and can be administered once daily. In addition to its&#xD;
      analgesic effects due to its long-acting agonist effect on the Âµ-receptor, methadone is an&#xD;
      antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor may&#xD;
      play an important role in treating acute pain and preventing the development of chronic&#xD;
      postoperative pain. Furthermore, methadone may prevent reuptake of the neurotransmitters&#xD;
      norepinephrine and serotonin and result in improved mood states. In chronic pain patients,&#xD;
      methadone may be more effective in treating neuropathic pain and prevent the development of&#xD;
      tolerance. Despite these potential advantages, patients receiving chronic methadone therapy&#xD;
      are at increased risk of cardiac death. Methadone has been reported to be implicated in&#xD;
      30-40% of opioid-related deaths. Although a number of these deaths may be related to&#xD;
      respiratory depression, others may be due to QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Risk&#xD;
      factors in these patients for lethal arrhythmias include dose of methadone, duration of&#xD;
      treatment, electrolyte abnormalities, older age, female sex, cirrhosis, genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility, and use of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a mean increase in the QT interval of 15 ms and 34 ms in patients on chronic&#xD;
      methadone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, the use of intravenous methadone in the operating room setting has&#xD;
      dramatically increased. An important limitation of the intravenous opioids typically used in&#xD;
      the operating room and in the postoperative period for pain management is that the duration&#xD;
      of effect of these agents is only 3 to 4 hours. This results in periods of effective pain&#xD;
      relief, followed by periods of moderate-to-severe pain in the postoperative period. An&#xD;
      alternative strategy for opioid utilization may involve the administration of a very&#xD;
      long-acting opioid in the operating room that would provide effective analgesia for the first&#xD;
      24 postoperative hours (which corresponds with the period of the most severe pain after&#xD;
      surgery). At the present time, intravenous methadone is the only long-acting opioid available&#xD;
      to anesthesiologists. A primary advantage of methadone is its long half-life, which ranges&#xD;
      from 25-52 hours when given intravenously in larger doses. Therefore, a single dose given at&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia can be used in patients with moderate-to-severe to provide analgesia&#xD;
      throughout the perioperative period. In randomized, double-blinded investigations in cardiac&#xD;
      and orthopedic surgical patients, subjects randomized to the methadone group reported less&#xD;
      pain, required reduced postoperative analgesic medications, and described increased&#xD;
      satisfaction with overall pain management when compared to subjects administered a standard&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No adverse events directly attributable to methadone were reported in any clinical trials&#xD;
      using methadone in the operating room. In particular, no cardiac events, episodes of QT&#xD;
      prolongation, or observations of torsade de pointes were reported in any studies. In&#xD;
      addition, no case reports of adverse cardiac events related to methadone have been described&#xD;
      in the literature. However, none of the previous studies have specifically assessed the&#xD;
      effect of methadone on the incidence of QT prolongation or obtained postoperative EKGs. Only&#xD;
      two previous investigations have examined the potential effects of a single dose of methadone&#xD;
      on the QT interval. In dogs given 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg doses of intravenous methadone, no&#xD;
      significant effect on the QRS duration or QT interval was observed. In a post-hoc analysis of&#xD;
      data from a randomized study examining the effect of vitamin treatment and nitrous oxide on&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, the impact of various anesthetic agents on the QT interval was&#xD;
      examined. EKGs were obtained before anesthesia, 30 minutes after PACU admission, and on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1 and 2. Eighty percent of patients had significant QT prolongation in the&#xD;
      PACU, whereas no patient had QT prolongation by postoperative day 1. Several drugs were&#xD;
      associated with increases in the QT interval, including inhalational agents, ketorolac,&#xD;
      antibiotics, vasoactive drugs, and methadone. Fifty-three percent of the patients&#xD;
      administered methadone had a QT interval increase of &gt; 30 ms. An important limitation of this&#xD;
      investigation is that it was a post-hoc analysis of data from a study in which anesthetic&#xD;
      care was not standardized. The data demonstrates, however, that a number of anesthetic agents&#xD;
      increase the QT interval. In addition, the stress response to surgery has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to increase the QT interval. Despite the frequent use of these agents in the operating room,&#xD;
      torsade de pointes is a rare event during or immediately following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, no previous randomized trials have assessed the effect of a single dose&#xD;
      of methadone, given at induction of anesthesia, on the QT interval as a primary endpoint. The&#xD;
      aim of this clinical investigation is to examine the impact of a standard dose of&#xD;
      perioperative methadone (0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight (IBW)) on the QT interval, measured with&#xD;
      a 12-lead EKG, 30 minutes after PACU admission and on the morning of postoperative day 1. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients randomized to receive methadone will not have a higher incidence of&#xD;
      QT prolongation, when compared to patients given a dose of hydromorphone (the standard&#xD;
      intraoperative opioid administered to patients undergoing procedures associated with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe postoperative pain). Secondary endpoints include levels of postoperative&#xD;
      pain, analgesic requirements, and any opioid-related complications (level of sedation,&#xD;
      episodes of respiratory complications)&#xD;
