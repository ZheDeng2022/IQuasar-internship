  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival and the outcomes of critically ill patients are strongly influenced by&#xD;
      insulin-therapy and nutritional support. The GLUCOSAFE 2 pilot study, aims to test the&#xD;
      performance and the security of the new GLUCOSAFE 2 software, developed by the model-based&#xD;
      medical decision support of Aalborg University (Denmark) and adapted to the clinical needs in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG). This new device is&#xD;
      based on a mathematical model of the glucose-insulin metabolism and attempts to give advices&#xD;
      for better glycaemia control and nutritional therapy. The GLUCOSAFE 2 study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      the use of the Glucosafe 2 software will allow better glycaemia (&quot;Time-in-target&quot;) control&#xD;
      and better achievement of nutritional energy and protein targets in comparison to the local&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
