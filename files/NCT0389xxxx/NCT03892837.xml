  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma(PRP), is a concentrate of platelet-rich plasma protein derived from&#xD;
      whole blood. The main components of it are platelets, leukocytes and fibrin. Autologous PRP&#xD;
      treatment can avoid the immune rejection caused by exogenous growth factor and the spread of&#xD;
      disease. Evidence of the efficacy and safety of PRP has been proven in many studies. Benign&#xD;
      central airway stenosis is characterized by airway compromise involving the larynx, trachea,&#xD;
      or bronchi and will lead to devastating consequences. Unfortunately, the incidence of this&#xD;
      disease is increasing steadily. As most important treatment for benign airway stenosis,&#xD;
      respiratory intervention has become one of the most common treatments to fight the disease.&#xD;
      However, the restenosis caused by tissue hyperplasia, wound repair and scar formation after&#xD;
      treatment is still common, which remains the limitation of respiratory intervention.&#xD;
      Long-term efficacy of repeated interventional treatment is unsatisfying, too. Several studies&#xD;
      have discovered similar mechanism between stenosis of tracheal to hyperplastic scar of skin,&#xD;
      both of which are relative with deep structure injury such as the intrinsic layer of airway&#xD;
      mucosa. PRP has shown significant efficacy for hyperplastic scar of skin. Correspondingly,&#xD;
      PRP will be applied as treatment of refractory benign airway stenosis to reduce restenosis by&#xD;
      inhibit the formation of granulation.&#xD;
