  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1),which&#xD;
      prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell&#xD;
      activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.&#xD;
      As a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative&#xD;
      signaling，anlotinib is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone progression or recurrence&#xD;
      after ≥ 2 lines of systemic chemotherapy. The Phase III study showed that the Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Response Rate (ORR) were&#xD;
      significantly better than placebo group.&#xD;
