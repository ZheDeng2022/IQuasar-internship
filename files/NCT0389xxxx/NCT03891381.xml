      Residual neuromuscular blockade (weakness) is a common occurrence in the postanesthesia care&#xD;
      unit when muscle relaxant drugs have been used in the operating room. The only method of&#xD;
      reliably detecting residual neuromuscular blockade is through the use of quantitative&#xD;
      neuromuscular monitors. These devices measure and quantify the degree of muscle weakness and&#xD;
      display the results on a screen. When using train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation, the ratio&#xD;
      of the fourth muscle contraction (twitch) to the first twitch will be displayed; when this&#xD;
      ratio is 90% (or 0.9) or greater, full recovery of muscle strength is present, and the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube can be safely removed. At the present time, there is only one commercially&#xD;
      available quantitative monitor produced in the United States -the TOF-Watch. The TOF-Watch is&#xD;
      not used by many clinicians because it requires experience to obtain accurate results, is&#xD;
      expensive, and is subject to interference by factors in the operating room. The aim of this&#xD;
      investigation is to examine a new quantitative monitor (the TetraGraph, an electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) device) in the clinical setting. Patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      electromyography monitoring (EMG group-using the TetraGraph) or qualitative peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulator monitoring (PNS group-the standard type of neuromuscular monitoring used at&#xD;
      NorthShore University HealthSystem). The primary endpoint of the investigation is the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative residual blockade (defined as a TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 with TOF-Watch,&#xD;
      the current &quot;gold standard quantitative monitor). Secondary endpoints include a variety of&#xD;
      standard clinical recovery variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anesthesiologists recognize that residual neuromuscular block can adversely affect&#xD;
      postoperative recovery, a high percentage of patients continue to arrive in the PACU with TOF&#xD;
      ratios &lt; 0.9. An important reason this problem occurs is that anesthesiologists rarely use&#xD;
      quantitative neuromuscular monitoring in the operating room. In current anesthesia practices,&#xD;
      clinicians typically use standard peripheral nerve stimulators (qualitative neuromuscular&#xD;
      monitors) and / or clinical tests of muscle strength to detect residual muscle weakness at&#xD;
      the end of surgical procedures. Qualitative nerve stimulators/monitors are routinely used in&#xD;
      the operating rooms; TOF electrical stimuli are applied to a peripheral nerve, and the&#xD;
      contractions of the innervated muscle observed. However, visual or tactile assessment of TOF&#xD;
      stimulation using these monitors is only effective in detecting profound levels of muscle&#xD;
      weakness (TOF ratios &lt; 0.4) Therefore, qualitative nerve stimulators are unable to reliably&#xD;
      detect clinically relevant neuromuscular block (TOF ratios of 0.5-0.9). Clinical assessment&#xD;
      of patients for signs of muscle weakness (head-lift, hand squeeze) is also an insensitive&#xD;
      method of detecting residual neuromuscular block, since many patients can perform these tests&#xD;
      with TOF ratios as low as 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for clinicians to reliably exclude residual neuromuscular blockade, quantitative&#xD;
      neuromuscular monitoring should be used. At the present time, only one stand-alone&#xD;
      quantitative monitor has been produced for clinical use, the TOF-Watch (Blue Star&#xD;
      Enterprises, Chanhassen, Minnesota-no longer manufactured). This technology&#xD;
      (acceleromyography (AMG)) uses a piezoelectric crystal to sense the acceleration of muscle&#xD;
      contractions, and converts this data into a displayed TOF ratio (0-100%). Although the use of&#xD;
      the TOF-Watch has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of residual blockade, the routine&#xD;
      application of this monitor by clinicians has been limited by a number of factors, related to&#xD;
      complexity of use in the operating room.. There is an urgent need for an easy-to-use and&#xD;
      accurate quantitative neuromuscular monitor in the clinical setting. Recently, a new device&#xD;
      has been developed that uses electromyography (EMG) technology to assess recovery of muscle&#xD;
      function in the clinical setting (the TetraGraph). This EMG device measures electrical&#xD;
      activity (compound muscle action potentials) following nerve stimulation (usually at the&#xD;
      thenar eminence after ulnar or median nerve stimulation). When TOF stimuli are provided, this&#xD;
      data is then converted to a measurable TOF ratio (from 0-1.0 or 0-100%). In a study completed&#xD;
      at NorthShore University HealthSystem, the investigators compared the applicability (ease of&#xD;
      use, equipment need, etc.), repeatability (precision or internal consistency), and&#xD;
      performance (agreement with established standard, bias) of this EMG technology to the&#xD;
      TOF-Watch (the current clinical &quot;gold standard&quot; quantitative neuromuscular monitor). The&#xD;
      subsequent analysis suggested that EMG monitoring accurately measures onset and recovery of&#xD;
      neuromuscular function in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring in the operating room should allow for more&#xD;
      rational management of dosing and reversal of NMBAs. Furthermore, if incomplete neuromuscular&#xD;
      recovery is detected at the end of a surgical procedure, tracheal extubation can be delayed&#xD;
      until full recovery of muscle strength has occurred. Therefore, fewer patients should leave&#xD;
      the operating room with muscle weakness, and the risks/complications of residual blockade in&#xD;
      the PACU reduced. The aim of this clinical investigation is to determine whether EMG&#xD;
      monitoring in the operating room reduces the incidence of postoperative residual blockade&#xD;
      (measured at the time of tracheal extubation and on arrival to the PACU). During the PACU&#xD;
      admission, patients will also be assessed for potential complications related to incomplete&#xD;
      neuromuscular recovery (signs and symptoms of muscle weakness, episodes of hypoxemia and&#xD;
      airway obstruction, prolonged PACU length of stay). Patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either electromyography monitoring (EMG group-TetraGraph) or qualitative peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulator monitoring (PNS group) in the operating room. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative residual block (defined as a TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 with the TOF-Watch&#xD;
      monitor). Secondary endpoints include a variety of clinical recovery variables listed below.&#xD;
