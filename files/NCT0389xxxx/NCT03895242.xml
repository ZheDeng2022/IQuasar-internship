  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positioning, which is one of the individualized developmental care methods, is known as the&#xD;
      important care support process which is applied with the purpose of ensuring the least damage&#xD;
      from the environmental. Positioning in preterm infants is the basis of neonatal nursing care.&#xD;
      Positioning in preterm infants receiving mechanical ventilation support is important in terms&#xD;
      of physiological and neurodevelopment. In infants undergoing respiratory support in NICU, it&#xD;
      is important to determine the appropriate position, the frequency and duration of position&#xD;
      change in order to reduce the oxygen need. In this respect, the aim of this study, designed&#xD;
      as a randomized controlled trial, was to determine the effect of supine and prone positions&#xD;
      on physiological variables (oxygen saturation and heart rate) of preterm infants receiving&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

      In infants undergoing respiratory support in NICU, it is important to determine the&#xD;
      appropriate position, the frequency and duration of position change in order to reduce the&#xD;
      oxygen need. Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled study, test the efficacy of two&#xD;
      different positions (prone-supine) given to preterm newborns receiving mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.The study was conducted from February 2015 to June 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We were interested in establishing the difference between the supine position and the prone&#xD;
      position, with an error margin of 10%. According to the formula of the calculated sample&#xD;
      size, for a crossover design with a = 0.05, the sample size required to achieve a 90% power&#xD;
      is 36 infants. Thirty-eight infants who met the inclusion criteria of the study were selected&#xD;
      and invited to participate. Of these, parents of 38 infants consented. A convenience sample&#xD;
      of hospitalized preterm infants (less than 37 weeks gestational age) was selected from a&#xD;
      tertiary neonatal intensive care unit of a teaching and research hospital in Turkey. Preterm&#xD;
      infants were divided into two groups by randomization according to position priority (n =&#xD;
      38). First group was first supine position followed by prone position (n = 19), second group&#xD;
      was first prone position, then supine position (n = 19). The priority of the positions to be&#xD;
      given to preterm infants was randomly determined using the closed envelope method. The&#xD;
      positions of infants were written in envelopes and closed. The clinical nurse, who was not in&#xD;
      the research, pulled the envelope and identified position group of the infant . Thus, data&#xD;
      were collected for both the prone and the supine position from a newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants involved in the study were cared for in a incubator and wore diapers only. The&#xD;
      temperature of the incubator was set to maintain a body temperature ranging from 36.5 to 37.2&#xD;
      °C. After necessary routine procedures such as diapering, body cleaning, weighing and&#xD;
      suctioning were completed, each subject was randomly assigned to the supine-prone group or&#xD;
      prone-supine group sequence. All of the positions of preterm infants were given carefully by&#xD;
      the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant descriptive characteristics form: The form was developed in light of the relevant&#xD;
      literature to collect data about gender, age, gestational age, body weight at study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant's clinical variables form. The form was developed by the researchers according to the&#xD;
      literature to collect data such as infant feeding method, caffeine and surfactant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological variable monitoring form: The form was developed to record heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      (min) and oxygen saturation (% SpO2) values in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse Oximeter Device: A pulse oximetry was used to determine HR and SpO2. The physiological&#xD;
      parameters were measured and recorded every 15 minute for a total of 120 minute. The normal&#xD;
      vital sign ranges assumed for the study subjects were as follows; heart rate range of 121 to&#xD;
      179 beats per minute, oxygen saturation range ≥92%. The pulse oximetry was calibrated as&#xD;
      recommended by the manufacturer prior to use at the beginning of each shift within the study&#xD;
      period. The pulse oximetry probe was attached to the foot of the leg.All of the measurements&#xD;
      were performed by researcher who carefully and prudently recorded the infants' response&#xD;
      throughout the study process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rolled sheets were used when infants were given positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical program.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were reported using frequencies, percentages, mean values, standard&#xD;
      deviation, and range. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted to assess the distribution of&#xD;
      the variables in order to use a parametric or non-parametric test. All the variables were&#xD;
      normally distributed. Therefore, parametric tests such as analysis of variance and t-test&#xD;
      were used to determine the differences in variables between groups. Variance analysis was&#xD;
      used for repeated measurements of heart rates and oxygen saturation measured by infants at 15&#xD;
      min intervals. A value of p &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      İn the study, written consent was obtained from the ethics committee, institutions and&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
