    <textblock>
      There is a huge gap between the clinical efficacy and community effectiveness in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Taiwan. HCV infection prevails in uremic patients with&#xD;
      the prevalence of &gt; 10 % in Taiwan.The current study will be executed in each participating&#xD;
      hemodialysis centers by an outreach team of HCV treaters, treating all of the HCV-viremic&#xD;
      uremia patients and HD staffs at the same time (group therapy) in each individual HD center&#xD;
      (Erase-C campaign) with all oral directly-acting antivirals, to ensure the rates of&#xD;
      diagnosis, accessibility, treatment and follow-up.The purpose of the study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      a model of care using outreach HCV treaters by implementing the concept of &quot;group therapy&quot;&#xD;
      with one-size-fit-all pangenotypic DAA regimen, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, in each&#xD;
      individual hemodialysis center (Erase-C campaign) to achieve HCV micro-elimination.&#xD;

      Background 1.1 Background of ESRD patients on maintenance HD with chronic HCV infection&#xD;
      Taiwan has the leading prevalence and incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide.&#xD;
      Uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are at great risk for hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) infection. The prevalence and annual incidence of HCV infection in ESRD patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis have been reported to be 10%-59% and 0.2%-6.2%, respectively.&#xD;
      HCV-related morbidities and mortality remain the major disease burdens in the ESRD&#xD;
      population. Uremic patients with HCV infection are associated with higher risk of morbidities&#xD;
      and mortality. Anti-HCV therapy at individual patient level might prevent the liver-related&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality, however, patients remain at high risk of HCV new- or re-infection if&#xD;
      there are HCV patients untreated or failed treatment in the HD units. FORMOSA-LIKE is a study&#xD;
      group of Hepatologists and Nephrologists from 15 HD centers at community, regional or&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals (now 19) that caring &gt; 1900 uremic patients under maintenance HD in&#xD;
      Taiwan, established in 2012. The anti-HCV seropositivity rate was 17% among HD patients; HCV&#xD;
      viremic rate was 74.6% among anti-HCV seropositivity HD subjects. To decrease the rate of new&#xD;
      HCV infection between HD patients, all anti-HCV-seropositive uremic patients are requested to&#xD;
      receive HD in an isolated &quot;HCV-zone&quot;. Recently, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control&#xD;
      recommends that anti-HCV-seropositive uremic patients could be moved from HCV-zone to&#xD;
      clean-zone if they have PCR-undetectable HCV RNA for more than 24 weeks, whatever&#xD;
      spontaneously or after antiviral therapy. The new policy raises the question that whether it&#xD;
      is possible to create a &quot;NoC-HD&quot; environment where HCV-zone no longer exists due to all&#xD;
      HCV-viremic patients are cured. The achievement of NoC-HD could provide not only obligation&#xD;
      of transmitting HCV within HD centers, but also a much more cost-effective care of&#xD;
      hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Gap of anti-HCV therapy for HCV patients on maintenance HD There is a huge gap between&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and community effectiveness in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in&#xD;
      Taiwan, with treatment uptake rate &lt; 20%. The treatment hurdle is more significant in uremic&#xD;
      patients because many primary HD units outside medical centers have poor accessibility to HCV&#xD;
      testing and treatment. Meanwhile, directly acting antivirals (DAAs) has just replaced&#xD;
      interferon (IFN)-based therapy as standard of care in Taiwan since 2017. The majority of HD&#xD;
      patients do not receive IFN-based therapy due to unsatisfactory efficacy and frequent and&#xD;
      significant adverse events. The innovation of DAAs provide very high sustained virological&#xD;
      response (SVR) rates of &gt; 95% in general population and uremic patients with chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection. Nevertheless, there remains big hurdle for uremic HCV patients to access DAA&#xD;
      therapy because that only gastroenterologists specialists could prescribe reimbursed DAA&#xD;
      regimens in Taiwan. Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) is a fixed-dose combination of HCV&#xD;
      non-structural 5A (NS5A) inhibitor and NS5B inhibitor. SOF/VEL is the only all oral,&#xD;
      pan-genotypic DAA not only for patients with compensated liver disease but also for patients&#xD;
      in the decompensated status. A universal 12-week regimen of SOF/VEL provides a SVR12 rate of&#xD;
      &gt; 95 % in general population with different viral genotypes and special populations, and is&#xD;
      the current standard of care by regional guidelines. SOF/VEL has been recently proved to be&#xD;
      highly effective and well tolerated in uremic patients with HCV viremia; an SVR12 rate of 95%&#xD;
      could be achieved in uremic patients receiving 12 weeks of SOF/VEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Background of HCV elimination World Health Organization (WHO) sets a goal of HCV&#xD;
      elimination worldwide by 2030. However, there remains many barriers to achieve the goal of&#xD;
      HCV elimination, including the low rates of disease diagnosis/awareness, accessibility and&#xD;
      treatment. The concept of micro-elimination of HCV by using pangenotypic DAA for HCV&#xD;
      communities could provide evidence to obviate the treatment barriers to HCV elimination. In&#xD;
      addition, the reported annual incidence of new HCV infection among uremic patients under&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis in Taiwan was 1.36%. Therefore, treatment as prevention; increasing&#xD;
      the treatment uptake at the population level would provide completely blockage of HCV&#xD;
      spreading in highly endemic/contagious community. The target population of micro-elimination&#xD;
      should possess three major characteristics: 1. high prevalence 2. highly contagious 3.&#xD;
      closely contact environment. The current uremic population in Taiwan fulfills all the factors&#xD;
      mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will be executed in each participating hemodialysis centers by an outreach&#xD;
      team of HCV treaters, treating all of the HCV-viremic uremia patients and HD staffs at the&#xD;
      same time (group therapy) in each individual HD center (Erase-C campaign), to ensure the&#xD;
      rates of diagnosis, accessibility, treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate a model of care using outreach HCV treaters by&#xD;
      implementing the concept of &quot;group therapy&quot; with one-size-fit-all pangenotypic DAA regimen,&#xD;
      12 weeks of SOF/VEL, in each individual hemodialysis center (Erase-C campaign) to achieve HCV&#xD;
      micro-elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm: sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg/Velpatasvir(VEL) 100 mg fixed-dosage combination once-daily&#xD;
      for 12 weeks for all HCV genotype patients with and without hepatic decompensation HCV RNA&#xD;
      and liver function tests, pregnancy test will be monitoring at baseline, during and after&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
