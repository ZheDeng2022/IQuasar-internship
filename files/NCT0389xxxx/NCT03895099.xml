      Oocyte donation is a cumbersome and demanding procedure, involving an injectable hormonal&#xD;
      treatment for an average duration of 12 days, according to the protocols, 1 to several daily&#xD;
      injections. The objective of this study is to show that treatments can be simplified without&#xD;
      reducing the number of oocytes that have been punctured, by blocking the luteinizing hormone&#xD;
      (LH) surge by using oral progesterone and by limiting the number of injections of&#xD;
      gonadotropins using corifollitropin alpha, regardless of the start date of the pacing&#xD;
      protocol during a natural cycle.&#xD;

      Medically assisted procreation can help infertile patients with a panel of techniques adapted&#xD;
      to various causes of infertility. In most cases, these techniques use patients' own gametes.&#xD;
      However, despite the medical advances, it is still impossible today to regenerate gametic&#xD;
      cells when they have disappeared from the gonads. Especially for women with premature ovarian&#xD;
      failure, the only feasible option is to receive oocytes from a third-party donor. In France,&#xD;
      the principle of free and anonymous applies to the donation and no compensation is allowed&#xD;
      outside the reimbursement of expenses incurred. Oocyte donors are women volunteers who agree&#xD;
      to undergo heavy medical treatment to help other women, without any other consideration so&#xD;
      that the recognition of their donation. It is important for these women to minimize the risks&#xD;
      involved, to simplify and minimize ovarian stimulation treatments, which are generally&#xD;
      injections and to offer maximum flexibility, without reducing the quality of the donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of oocyte and embryo vitrification has opened up new opportunities for&#xD;
      reproductive scientists to improve the practice and results of IVF attempts. It is now&#xD;
      established that vitrification of whole oocyte cohorts does not compromise, and may even&#xD;
      improve, the results of IVF attempts. In addition, it is now clear that progesterone&#xD;
      modulates the frequency of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) pulses and can strongly&#xD;
      inhibit the pulsatile secretion of GnRH and LH and thereby inhibit the LH peak induced by&#xD;
      increased plasma concentrations of GnRH and LH. estradiol. And, in the context of oocyte&#xD;
      donation, the deleterious effects of ovarian stimulation on endometrial receptivity have no&#xD;
      impact: the increase in progesterone levels during stimulation is not a concern in this group&#xD;
      who will not benefit from an embryonic transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, progesterone stimulation protocols were performed during the luteal phase as part&#xD;
      of the urgent preservation of fertility in cancer patients. The first European feasibility&#xD;
      study was conducted and published in 2013 in normotensive patients. While the preliminary&#xD;
      findings were not optimistic, many publications, from 2013, showed that this luteal strategy&#xD;
      is effective without the addition of a GnRH antagonist, but imposes a freeze all strategy. In&#xD;
      all these studies, whether it is luteal phase stimulation schemes, strategies of 2&#xD;
      consecutive stimulations, in the follicular and then luteal phase, or random-start&#xD;
      stimulation protocol, the quality of the oocytes does not seem to be impacted, with identical&#xD;
      implantation and birth rates in the control groups (conventional ovarian stimulation). The&#xD;
      state of health of newborns and malformation rates are also identical to those of&#xD;
      conventional protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although luteal phase endogenous progesterone levels appear to be sufficient to block the LH&#xD;
      surge, recent publications have also shown the efficacy of exogenous progesterone, which can,&#xD;
      without compromising the oocyte's competence, replace the use of an agonist or antagonist&#xD;
      during the follicular phase. The advantages are oral administration and the reduction of&#xD;
      potential costs, without any secondary effect on the competence of oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different progestins were used. Kuang et al (2015) report the first randomized study studying&#xD;
      an exogenous progestogen-based ovarian stimulation protocol using medroxyprogesterone acetate&#xD;
      (MPA). Compared to a standard short protocol, with embryonic vitrification in both groups,&#xD;
      the number of mature oocytes and the number of frozen embryos, the implantation and pregnancy&#xD;
      rates after thawed embryo transfers were not significantly different. The same group&#xD;
      published between 2015 and 2017, 4 studies validating micronized progesterone as an effective&#xD;
      oral alternative to treatment with GnRH agonists for the prevention of premature LH surge&#xD;
      during controlled ovarian stimulation for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI).&#xD;
      Recently, the same group compared dydrogesterone and micronized progesterone with the same&#xD;
      results. More recently, another progestogen, desogestrel, has been used in addition to&#xD;
      corifollitropin alpha in an oocyte donation program, compared to a conventional antagonist&#xD;
      protocol. The authors reported the same number of oocytes in both groups, with better&#xD;
      tolerance of treatment in the desogestrel group. In the same way as for luteal phase&#xD;
      stimulation protocols, exogenous progestin-exogenous ovarian stimulation protocols have&#xD;
      similar neonatal outcomes, compared to &quot;standard&quot; protocols, for birth weight, gestational&#xD;
      age, and Congenital malformation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of luteal phase or follicular phase stimulation protocols with progestins could&#xD;
      rapidly develop in the context of oocyte donation where no embryo transfer is performed. A&#xD;
      single published study reports 13 MPA-blocked oocyte donor (PPO) cycles compared to&#xD;
      counter-protocol donation cycles. This retrospective study found a significant difference in&#xD;
      favor of the progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol for the number of oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved. The duration of ovarian stimulation, the number of units of gonadotropins needed&#xD;
      were not different from one group to another. No peak of LH was observed in the PPOS group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These PPOS protocols have many advantages for these women wishing to donate their oocytes:&#xD;
      improved flexibility (donors can choose the date of their oocyte retrieval, without cycle&#xD;
      constraint), better acceptance with fewer injections, and lower cost. In addition, the use of&#xD;
      Corifollitropin Alpha (CTA) improves patient comfort by reducing the number of injections (1&#xD;
      instead of 7), without altering the quality and number of oocytes. In addition, these&#xD;
      protocols allow the initiation of ovulation by injection of GnRH agonists, drastically&#xD;
      reducing the risk of hyperstimulation syndrome and contributing to the safety of donors. A&#xD;
      retrospective study (proof of concept study) published in 2018 shows that the joint use of a&#xD;
      PPOS and CTA gives satisfactory results, while being acceptable (&quot;patient friendly&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve donor comfort and validate the use of progestogen-blocking ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      protocols, this protocol combining the use of corifollitropin alpha and blocking the&#xD;
      preterm-mediated progestogen LH peak is an innovative and promising approach, without impact&#xD;
      neither on quantity nor on oocyte quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study (proof of concept) aims to validate the use of PPOS in oocyte donation, and to show&#xD;
      that these stimulation protocols can be started whatever the phase of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumptions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The number of oocytes retrieved is not significantly different, regardless of the start&#xD;
      date of treatment during the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exogenous progestin therapy effectively blocks the LH surge during ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - It is possible to significantly reduce the number of injections during controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation for oocyte donors and the cost to society, without decreasing the effectiveness&#xD;
      of ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
