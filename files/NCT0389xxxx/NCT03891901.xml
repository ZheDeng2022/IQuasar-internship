    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effects of&#xD;
      imatinib on myelopoiesis in adults when given with and without isoniazid and rifabutin. The&#xD;
      results of this trial will determine the imatinib dose to be studied in a subsequent Phase&#xD;
      IIB treatment trial of imatinib as an adjunctive therapy with an antimicrobial regimen&#xD;
      (rifabutin, PZA, INH and ethambutol) for drug-sensitive TB.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effects of imatinib on&#xD;
      myelopoiesis in adults when given with and without isoniazid and rifabutin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into one of two cohorts. In Cohort 1, participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a dose-escalating fashion to receive one of four doses of imatinib alone for 14&#xD;
      days, followed by imatinib in combination with rifabutin and isoniazid for another 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2, participants will receive rifabutin and isoniazid for 14 days, followed by 14&#xD;
      days of rifabutin and isoniazid in combination with one of the two selected doses of&#xD;
      imatinib. The exact doses of imatinib administered in Cohort 2 will be determined after&#xD;
      analyzing data from Cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration for participants will be 50 days, during which time participants will&#xD;
      attend several study visits. Study visits may include a physical exam, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      blood and urine collection, and pharmacokinetic assessments.&#xD;
