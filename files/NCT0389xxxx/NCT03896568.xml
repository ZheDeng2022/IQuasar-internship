    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies best dose and side effects of oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401 in&#xD;
      treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back (recurrent). Oncolytic adenovirus&#xD;
      DNX-2401 is made from the common cold virus that has been changed in the laboratory to make&#xD;
      it less likely to cause an infection (such as a cold). The virus is also changed to target&#xD;
      brain cancer cells and attack them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of allogeneic bone marrow-derived human&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) loaded with the oncolytic adenovirus DNX-2401&#xD;
      (BM-hMSCs-DNX2401) administered by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral&#xD;
      super-selective endovascular intracranial injection) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      (GBM), gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the local and systemic toxicity of allogeneic BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered&#xD;
      by intra-arterial injection (i.e., transfemoral super-selective endovascular intracranial&#xD;
      injection) in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine at the molecular and cellular level the capacity of allogeneic&#xD;
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 administered intra-arterially to home to and deliver DNX-2401 to recurrent&#xD;
      GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma by analyzing post-treatment&#xD;
      surgical brain tumor specimens for the expression and distribution of adenoviral proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess shedding of adenovirus into the blood, sputum, and nasopharynx after&#xD;
      intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma&#xD;
      or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the development of anti-adenovirus antibodies after intra-arterial&#xD;
      administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type&#xD;
      IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate immune-mediated cytokine responses after intra-arterial administration of&#xD;
      BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess anti-tumoral activity and to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) after intra-arterial administration of BM-hMSCs-DNX2401 in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent GBM, gliosarcoma or wild-type IDH-1 anaplastic astrocytoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 intra-arterially (IA) over 20-30&#xD;
      minutes on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Patients receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 as in part I. After 2 weeks,&#xD;
      patients undergo surgery, then receive oncolytic adenovirus Ad5-DNX-2401 IA over 20-30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients in part I are followed up on days 1, 4, 7, and&#xD;
      14 of month 1, months 1.5, 3, and 4.5, every 2 months up to month 26, month 30, then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter. Patients in part II will be followed up on the day after surgery, weeks 1,&#xD;
      2 and 4, months 2, 2.5, 4, 5.5 and 7, every 2 months until month 19, every 4 months until&#xD;
      month 32, then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide informed consent, undergo and comply with&#xD;
             all study assessments and adhere to the protocol schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent malignant GBM or gliosarcoma will be eligible. Patients with&#xD;
             recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma with wild-type IDH-1 gene will also be eligible if&#xD;
             there is a significant enhancing mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because&#xD;
             their prognosis/behavior is similar to GBM. A pathology report constitutes adequate&#xD;
             documentation of histology for study inclusion. Subjects with an initial diagnosis of&#xD;
             a lower grade glioma are eligible if a subsequent biopsy is determined to be GBM and&#xD;
             there is a significant enhancing mass on MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must show unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI&#xD;
             scan after failing prior surgical resection, biopsy, chemotherapy or radiation. A&#xD;
             baseline MRI must be performed within 24 days prior to registration. Biopsy is&#xD;
             encouraged at the time of recurrence if it is unclear that there is recurrent tumor.&#xD;
             However, biopsy is not required if the practicing physician thinks that there is&#xD;
             adequate radiographic and clinical evidence for recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to undergo endovascular treatment based on Doppler studies&#xD;
             showing internal carotid artery (ICA) that is less than 50% occluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients undergoing resection for biological endpoints, tumors must be surgically&#xD;
             resectable at the time of baseline evaluation and craniotomy for tumor resection would&#xD;
             be part of their standard medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumors must be &gt; 1.0 cm in diameter with upper limit of 5 cm maximal diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance score &gt;= 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute granulocyte count &gt;= 1,500 prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 75,000 prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic&#xD;
             transaminase (SGOT) &lt; 2 times institutional normal ranges prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times institutional normal ranges prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 times institutional normal prior to starting therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and thrombin time within&#xD;
             institutional normal limits after correction of nutritional deficiencies that may&#xD;
             contribute to prolonged PT/PTT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received the following chemotherapies must have completed them&#xD;
             within the following time periods prior to baseline/day 0 of hMSC-DNX2401 delivery&#xD;
             with recovery from any drug-related toxic effects to grade 1, or less, severity: 4&#xD;
             weeks from cytotoxic agents (3 weeks from procarbazine or temozolomide, 2 weeks from&#xD;
             vincristine), 6 weeks from nitrosoureas (lomustine [CCNU], carmustine [BCNU]), 4 weeks&#xD;
             from any investigational agent, 1 week from non-cytotoxic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 8 weeks from radiotherapy to minimize the potential for MRI changes&#xD;
             related to radiation necrosis that might be misdiagnosed as progression of disease, or&#xD;
             4 weeks if a new lesion, relative to the pre-radiation MRI, develops that is outside&#xD;
             the primary radiation field (beyond 80% isodose line). However, if a biopsy is&#xD;
             undertaken prior to these times and this biopsy documents histological evidence for&#xD;
             recurrent disease, then patients will be eligible regardless of the time after&#xD;
             radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to forego other cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drug or radiation&#xD;
             therapy against the tumor while enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test documented&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to study initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects and their partners must be willing to use effective birth control during the&#xD;
             study and for up to 6 months following administration of hMSC-DNX2401. Birth control&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Using twice the normal protection of birth control (i.e., double-barrier) by&#xD;
                  using a condom AND spermicidal jelly or foam, or a diaphragm AND spermicidal&#xD;
                  jelly or foam. A spermicidal jelly or foam must be used in addition to a barrier&#xD;
                  method (e.g., condom or diaphragm)&#xD;
