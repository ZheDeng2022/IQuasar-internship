  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 4.0 per 1,000.&#xD;
      The introduction of antipsychotic medications in the 1950s resulted in marked clinical&#xD;
      improvement in the symptom profile of schizophrenia, nevertheless the disease still&#xD;
      contributes to a significant proportion of global disease burden in terms of both morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. In this regard, cognitive deficits and residual negative symptoms are&#xD;
      considered major contributing factors to psychosocial disability and poor functional outcome&#xD;
      associated with the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher-order cognitive functions; e.g. working memory and executive functions; show variable&#xD;
      deficits and are considered a core clinical symptom of schizophrenia. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      disorder is also characterized by abnormalities at the basic level of primary sensory&#xD;
      processing, i.e. auditory, visual and somatosensory processing. Such abnormalities in the&#xD;
      primary process of sensory perception could change the sensory experiences of schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients and thus contribute to the psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event-related potentials (ERPs) are the neurophysiological correlates of sensory processing.&#xD;
      ERP abnormalities have been widely described in schizophrenia literature: Pre-pulse&#xD;
      inhibition of startle (PPI) in which a weaker pre-stimulus (pre-pulse) inhibits the reaction&#xD;
      to a subsequent strong startling stimulus (pulse) is impaired in schizophrenia. P50&#xD;
      suppression, a measure of sensory gating, is also often absent or reduced in the disorder.&#xD;
      N100; a measure of basic auditory sensory perception; shows significant amplitude reduction&#xD;
      in patients compared to controls. Mismatch negativity (MMN), a measure of automatic deviance&#xD;
      detection and shows characteristic attenuation in schizophrenia. P300, which is involved in&#xD;
      higher-level stimulus evaluation and categorization, also shows abnormalities along the&#xD;
      disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study by Clapp et al., 2005, auditory high frequency stimulation (tetanizing&#xD;
      stimulation) resulted in an increase in auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in healthy&#xD;
      individuals; i.e. an increase in N1 amplitude that persisted even after stimulation. This&#xD;
      augmentation of N1 amplitude was regarded as a result of plastic synaptic potentiation&#xD;
      similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) described after electrical tetanic stimulation in&#xD;
      cellular studies. Similar findings were later replicated by Lei et al., 2017, where they used&#xD;
      pure tones, narrow band noises and white noise to induce stable potentiation and augmentation&#xD;
      of N1 amplitude.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>N100 wave (AEP) amplitude in µv [microvolts]</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>N100 or N1 is a large, negative-going evoked potential measured by electroencephalography. It peaks in adults between 80 and 120 milliseconds after the onset of a stimulus, and distributed mostly over the fronto-central region of the scalp.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>P300 wave amplitude in µv [microvolts] (auditory odd-ball task)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The P300 (P3) wave is an event related potential (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision making. It is considered to be an endogenous potential, as its occurrence links not to the physical attributes of a stimulus, but to a person's reaction to it. More specifically, the P300 is thought to reflect processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization.</description>
