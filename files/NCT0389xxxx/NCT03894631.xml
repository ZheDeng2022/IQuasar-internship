  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of Kahook dual blade over Trabectome in lowering&#xD;
      intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Glaucoma surgery will be performed in conjunction&#xD;
      with cataract surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the Kahook dual blade is as&#xD;
      effective as Trabectome in lowering intra-ocular pressure (IOP), and as safe with a similar&#xD;
      rate of post-operative complications such as hyphema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trabectome is a type of Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) where the Trabectome&#xD;
      handpiece tip uses electrical current to cauterized and remove a strip of trabecular meshwork&#xD;
      and the roof of Schlemm's canal to ease the outflow of aqueous. Kahook Dual Blade (KDB)&#xD;
      procedure is another type of MIGS where the dual blade is used to remove the trabecular&#xD;
      meshwork and Schlemm's canal roof to increase the aqueous outflow but without any&#xD;
      cauterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies have evaluated the clinical outcome of Trabectome over KDB. Though&#xD;
      Trabectome helps to lower IOP, it may remove only a portion of trabecular meshwork and&#xD;
      possibly cause damage to surrounding tissue with leaflets of residual remaining tissue that&#xD;
      may cause blockage of aqueous drainage. Unlike Trabectome, the KDB removes blocks of&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork with no residual tissue leaflets, low rate of fibrosis, no damage to the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue and lower cost. However, research studies have shown that although the&#xD;
      Trabectome and KDB have different surgical techniques and both have surgical related risks as&#xD;
      in any glaucoma surgery, the post-surgical clinical outcome and safety profile of Trabectome&#xD;
      could be favorable to the KDB technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have evaluated the clinical outcome of Trabectome over Trabeculectomy, while few&#xD;
      other studies evaluated Trabectome over phaco-trabectome. Some studies evaluated the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of Trabectome alone while other studies assessed the outcome of KDB alone. Some other&#xD;
      studies compared KDB with iStent while another study compared Trabectome versus KDB in&#xD;
      porcine eye perfusion model. Studies have also shown that Trabectome, when combined with&#xD;
      phaco has a higher success rate than Trabectome alone. However, due to the infancy of KDB&#xD;
      procedure, there are no robust prospective comparison studies comparing the clinical outcome&#xD;
      of KDB over Trabectome when combined with phacoemulsification. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      systematically compare the clinical outcomes of KDB over Trabectome in treating glaucoma&#xD;
