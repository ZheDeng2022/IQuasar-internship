  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre observational prospective study that was planned for assessment the&#xD;
      effectiveness of neurotropic vitamins therapy with Milgamma®/ Milgamma® compositum in&#xD;
      combination with modern NSAIDs (preferential/selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors)&#xD;
      in patients with acute non-specific back pain. Approximately 500 adult out-patients with&#xD;
      acute non-specific low back pain who have been prescribed therapy consisting of (1) modern&#xD;
      NSAIDs (preferential/selective COX-2 inhibitors) or (2) modern NSAIDs (preferential/selective&#xD;
      COX-2 inhibitors) + Milgamma® / Milgamma® compositum will be enrolled in the study. Each&#xD;
      patient will be observed over a period of approximately 94 days. 9 visits/phone contacts are&#xD;
      planned to be conducted during this period. Information about patient's condition, pain&#xD;
      intensity, pain flare-ups, satisfaction with the treatment, patient's disability, therapy&#xD;
      used for acute back pain treatment, data on safety will be collected during these contacts.&#xD;
      Pain intensity will be measured with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), patients' disability will be&#xD;
      evaluated with Roland Morris disability questionnaire, patients' satisfaction with the&#xD;
      treatment will be assessed with 5-point verbal rating scale. Safety assessment will be based&#xD;
      on frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions recorded during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study, neurologists (potential investigators) will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out feasibility questionnaires to identify their individual routine practice regarding&#xD;
      prescription or non-prescription of Milgamma® / Milgamma® compositum. Based on results of&#xD;
      feasibility physicians will be divided to non-prescribers and prescribers of Milgamma® /&#xD;
      Milgamma® compositum to the patients with acute non-specific low back pain. In each medical&#xD;
      institution, such non-prescribers and prescribers will be proposed to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Non-prescribers will be responsible for enrolling group (1) (NSAIDs alone),&#xD;
      prescribers will be responsible for enrolling group (2) (NSAIDs + Milgamma® / Milgamma®&#xD;
      compositum).&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Pain Intensity Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 5 (38 days after the start of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured using 0-10 point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). NRS is 11-step scale for assessment of pain intensity at the moment of patient's examination ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Pain intensity was measured at baseline, at 5, 10, 24 and 38 days after the start of treatment. A mixed model repeated measures was used to analyze change from baseline in pain intensity over time from Baseline to Visit 5 (38 days after the start of treatment) in each group. The model included a random effect for subject and fixed effect terms for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline pain intensity. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors. P-value was calculated for the difference between treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Prescribed and Actual Number of Milgamma® Injections</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 9 (End of Study Visit, 94 days after the start of treatment)/ Early Discontinuation Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Prescribed number of Milgamma® injections was reported at Baseline visit. Actual number of injections was calculated by counting the number of injections administered and reported starting from Visit 2. If the treatment was interrupted, the days patient did not receive Milgamma® injections were not contribute to the total number of injections.</description>

    <measure>Frequency and Severity of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 9 (End of Study Visit, 94 days after the start of treatment)/ Early Discontinuation Visit</time_frame>
    <description>As this was a non-interventional study in which NSAIDs and Milgamma® / Milgamma® compositum were administered and managed within routine medical care, safety assessment was based on frequency and severity of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) recorded during the study.&#xD;
ADR was defined as an adverse event (AE) suspected to be causally related to the medicinal product (Milgamma®, Milgamma® compositum or NSAID). The severity grade (mild, moderate or severe) of ADR was determined based on the investigator's judgement. Adverse events not related to the medicinal product were not monitored in this observational study.</description>

          <title>Pain intensity and patients' disability at baseline</title>
          <description>Pain intensity was measured using 0-10 point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). NRS is 11-step scale for assessment of pain intensity at the moment of patient's examination ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).&#xD;
Patients' disability was assessed using Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ). RMDQ is a 24-item self-administered disability measure in which greater level of pain-related disability is reflected by higher score. The RMDQ score ranges from 0 to 24 with a lower score indicating better function.</description>

NRS is 11-step scale for assessment of pain intensity at the moment of patient's examination ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Pain intensity was measured at baseline, at 5, 10, 24 and 38 days after the start of treatment. A mixed model repeated measures was used to analyze change from baseline in pain intensity over time from Baseline to Visit 5 (38 days after the start of treatment) in each group. The model included a random effect for subject and fixed effect terms for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline pain intensity. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors. P-value was calculated for the difference between treatment groups.</description>
