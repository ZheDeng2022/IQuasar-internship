  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, randomized, crossover, two-period, single-center, comparative study,&#xD;
      where each participant will be randomly assigned to the reference (Lamictal, 100 mg tablets)&#xD;
      or the test (Lamotrigine, 100 mg tablets) formulation in each period of study (sequences&#xD;
      Test-Reference (TR) or Reference-Test (RT)), in order to evaluate if both formulations are&#xD;
      bioequivalent&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish if two formulations of lamotrigine are&#xD;
      bioequivalent. Also monitoring, registration and evaluation of adverse events that can be&#xD;
      performed. The test formulation is Lamotrigine, Tablets 100 mg (Pharmtechnology LLC,&#xD;
      Belarus). The reference formulation is Lamictal®, Tablets 100 mg (GlaxoSmithKlein Trading&#xD;
      CJSC, Russia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 healthy adult volunteers of both genders, with age ranging from 18 to 45 years old, will&#xD;
      be divided into two cohorts with equal number of subjects (14). Each participant in a cohort&#xD;
      will receive single tablet (100 mg of lamotrigine) of the test or the reference products with&#xD;
      200 ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Participants will fast 4 hours&#xD;
      after administration of the study drugs. Next meals will be after 6, 9 and 12 hours after&#xD;
      administration of formulations. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period.&#xD;
      Water will not be accessible to the participants 1 hour prior to administration of the study&#xD;
      drugs and 2 hours after administration of the study drugs in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period blood samples will be collected during 30 minutes before dosing and 0.5, 1.00,&#xD;
      1.5, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.00, 3.5, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 24.00,&#xD;
      36.00, 48.00, 72.00, 96.00, 120.00 hours after dosing (total number: 23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout period will be 21 days. At the bio-analytical stage, a validated High Performance&#xD;
      Liquid Chromatography with tandem Mass Spectrometry detection (HPLC/MS) method will be used&#xD;
      to determine plasma concentrations of lamotrigine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Area Under the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic Curve from the beginning of the study till the time of the last measured&#xD;
      concentration (AUC0-t) and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of&#xD;
      geometric means of the test and the reference products, obtained from the log-transformed&#xD;
      data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval for lamotrigine falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax and&#xD;
      AUC0-t&#xD;
