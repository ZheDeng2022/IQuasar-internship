  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes consume an extra of nutritional supplements every day with the purpose of improving&#xD;
      their athletic performance, sometimes without being aware of their health. Cocoa could be a&#xD;
      good nutritional supplement for athletes without causing them adverse effects. One of the&#xD;
      most common health concerns in athletes are gastrointestinal problems. The cause of these&#xD;
      problems seem to be a compendium of physiological and mechanical causes that are altered due&#xD;
      to nutritional factors. Currently, there is no assay in which a nutritional intervention&#xD;
      study has been proposed over time of training, in order to improve the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      problems associated with the performance of physical exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to investigate the benefits of daily consumption of cocoa in&#xD;
      endurance athletes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Gastrointestinal problems associated with exercise. B) Reinforcement of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal barrier. C) Parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress. D) Sports&#xD;
      performance. E) Body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting hypothesis of this project is based on the fact that daily cocoa consumption&#xD;
      could improve the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with resistance exercise. Cocoa&#xD;
      decreases the symptoms associated with splenic hypovolemia and strengthens the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal epithelial barrier increasing the presence of Lactobacillus spp. and&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium spp. in the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, blinded, parallel placebo controlled intervention study will be carried out in&#xD;
      endurance athletes who train in the sports facilities of the European University of Madrid.&#xD;
      The number of male athletes for the study will be 56 (28 in each experimental group), all of&#xD;
      them aimed at competition with an age between 18 and 40 years and an aerobic power&#xD;
      consumption of oxygen greater than or equal to 55 mL / kg / min). The calculation of the&#xD;
      sample size has been made selecting with a significance level alpha = 0.05 and a power (beta)&#xD;
      of 0.90 for a 2-tailed analysis, taking into account we want to detect a difference of at&#xD;
      least 15% in the improvement of the gastrointestinal symptoms, that the standard detected&#xD;
      deviation in the questionnaire to be used, in previous studies, is 1.5 points out of 9 and&#xD;
      that the expected proportion of losses is 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention, the athletes will do a test in which we will measure their&#xD;
      maximum aerobic capacity. This will be done in the facilities of Europea University of Madrid&#xD;
      where there is available a rolling belt. Also, they will do a second test in which we will&#xD;
      measure the time they spend running a kilometer at the maximum speed. Body composition will&#xD;
      be evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Blood, urine and feces samples will&#xD;
      be required before and after the physical tests. Blood and urine samples will be collected in&#xD;
      the morning while the feces samples will be collected the day before. The biological samples&#xD;
      will be frozen at -80ºC until analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be carried out for 10 weeks. Cocoa or placebo will be provide in a&#xD;
      single daily intake of 5 g of cocoa containing 500 mg of flavanols (dose at which a prebiotic&#xD;
      effect has been demonstrated) or 5 g of maltodextrin.&#xD;
