  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants that undergo permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation can often present with&#xD;
      challenging anesthetic management plans for the anesthesia provider. Typically, these&#xD;
      procedures are performed in electrophysiology labs that are often in remote locations away&#xD;
      from the main operating room suite. This presents the logistic challenges of not having&#xD;
      standard anesthesia machines, equipment and medications readily available for these&#xD;
      cases.Currently, the majority of these cases are done under local anesthesia with light to&#xD;
      moderate sedation. However, when it comes to inserting more complex devices such as&#xD;
      implantable cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices,&#xD;
      participants may not be able to tolerate these more invasive and painful procedures with only&#xD;
      local anesthetic as the primary mode of analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic techniques, in particular the pectoralis nerve blocks&#xD;
      (PEC I and II) and the Transversus Thoracic Muscle plane block (TTP), offer an alternative&#xD;
      mode of analgesia for these participants. PEC I blocks target the lateral and medial pectoral&#xD;
      nerves by injecting local anesthetic in the fascial plane between the pectoralis major and&#xD;
      minor muscles. PEC II blocks supplement the PEC I block by targeting the intercostal nerves&#xD;
      with local anesthetic injected between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles.&#xD;
      The transversus thoracic plane block targets the anterior cutaneous branches of the&#xD;
      intercostal nerves. In combination, these four blocks would provide analgesia of the upper&#xD;
      anterior chest wall.(3)These would provide effective analgesia of the upper anterior chest&#xD;
      wall.(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a paucity of studies on the use of PEC blocks in cardiac pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation procedures. There is a case report from 2014 on a 71 year-old male with an&#xD;
      ejection fraction of 20% undergoing CRTD implantation, which showed that PECs block with&#xD;
      moderate sedation using dexmedetomidine could be safely utilized to provide effective&#xD;
      analgesia for the procedure.11 However, this was not a subcutaneous ICD that required&#xD;
      tunneling of the coils. Thus there are no randomized controlled studies to investigate&#xD;
      whether the use of peripheral nerve blocks as primary anesthetic choice could be a viable&#xD;
      alternative for multiple participants undergoing subcutaneous ICD placement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of PEC I, PEC II,&#xD;
      Transversus Thoracic plane blocks as the primary anesthetic in participants undergoing&#xD;
      subcutaneous implantable defibrillator. There will be two groups; the nerve block group vs.&#xD;
      general anesthesia group. The participants in the nerve block group will receive an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided nerve block in the electrophysiology suite prior to the start of the&#xD;
      procedure. Participants will get a PEC I block with 10ml of 0.375% ropivacaine, PEC II block&#xD;
      with 15ml of 0.375% ropivacaine, 15ml of 0.375% ropivacaine for TTP. PEC I block entails&#xD;
      injecting local anesthesia between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles to&#xD;
      anesthetize the medial and lateral pectoral nerves. PEC II block entails injecting local&#xD;
      anesthetic between the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles to block the upper&#xD;
      intercostal nerves. For Tranversus Thoracic Plane block, local anesthetic will be injected&#xD;
      between the internal intercostal muscle and the Transversus Thoracic muscle. The participants&#xD;
      in the nerve block group will get mild sedation during the nerve blocks (midazolam 1-2mg IV&#xD;
      and fentanyl 50-100mcg IV). After block placement, patient will be given a 0.3mcg/kg bolus of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, then an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.4mcg/kg/hr- 0.7mcg/kg/hr r +/-&#xD;
      propofol 25mcg/kg/min-100mcg/kg/min for sedation. The general anesthesia group of&#xD;
      participants will get the current standard of care with an endotracheal tube with a&#xD;
      combination of IV induction medications and volatile anesthetic. Research assistant will hand&#xD;
      an enclosed envelope to the anesthesiologists with the name of the group consented patient&#xD;
      will be in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, the anesthesiologist will note if supplemental opioids and local anesthetic&#xD;
      was required. Postoperatively, the PACU nurse will be asked to document pain scores according&#xD;
      to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and total dose of opioids given. The distribution of the&#xD;
      sensory block and motor weakness will be documented in the anesthesiologist's PACU discharge&#xD;
      note. For postoperative data collection, opioid consumption totals and the pain scores at 30&#xD;
      minutes after arrival in PACU and at discharge.&#xD;
