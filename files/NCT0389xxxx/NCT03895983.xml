      To compare the ST segment resolution after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)&#xD;
      with and without thrombus aspiration in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction as ST segment resolution is the best indicator for the prediction of the outcome&#xD;
      and MACE&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The idea of an occluding thrombus and its dissolution had been stated since the 1950s.1&#xD;
      Thrombus is present in the infarct-related artery in 88% of patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      artery angiography within the first 4 h of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finding of ST segment elevation in a patient presenting with chest pain allows rapid&#xD;
      identification of those who benefit from emergency reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is now the preferred strategy for emergency&#xD;
      reperfusion in patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombus aspiration (TA) might be an effective procedure for reducing distal embolization and&#xD;
      improving microvascular perfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),&#xD;
      especially in patients with high thrombus burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the class III recommendation for routine Thrombus Aspiration use before balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty or stenting. manual Thrombus Aspiration might still remain a useful strategy for&#xD;
      the interventional cardiologist when treating selected patients with significant thrombus&#xD;
      burden during PPCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombus grading is classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: No angiographic characteristics of thrombus are present. Grade 1: Possible thrombus&#xD;
      is present with a such characteristics as: Reduced contrast density, haziness, irregular&#xD;
      lesion contour Or smooth convex meniscus at the site of total occlusion Suggestive but not&#xD;
      diagnostic of the thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 2: There is a definite thrombus with greatest dimension &lt;1/2 the vessel diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3: There is a definite thrombus but with greatest linear dimension&gt;1/2 but &lt;2 vessel&#xD;
      dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 4: There is a definite thrombus but with greatest linear dimension &gt;2 vessel dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 5: There is a total occlusion (unable to assess thrombus burden due to total vessel&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of ST-segment resolution on the electrocardiogram (ECG) consists of a simple&#xD;
      tool, of easy use and low cost, able to document success of the epicardial reperfusion and&#xD;
      tissue reperfusion after primary PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persistence of ST-segment elevation on the ECG, despite the restoration of a normal&#xD;
      epicardial flow, signifies a poor prognosis; such persistence is known to be associated with&#xD;
      larger infarct size and higher combined rate of severe cardiovascular adverse events.&#xD;
