    <textblock>
      Interdental papilla deficiency leads to food impaction, problems with phonetics and an&#xD;
      unaesthetic appearance. Reconstruction of the deficient papilla is therefore, important.&#xD;
      Perusal of available literature reveals only case reports and case series in the&#xD;
      reconstruction of interdental papilla using subepithelial connective tissue graft and&#xD;
      platelet rich fibrin autologous graft. Therefore, the current randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      study is intended to compare the effect of platelet rich fibrin and subepithelial connective&#xD;
      tissue graft on interdental papilla reconstruction.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The rising concern for aesthetics has led to a change in the way dentistry is&#xD;
      practised. Modern dentistry, no longer is aimed at only restoration of form and function, but&#xD;
      restoration of aesthetics as well. Loss of interdental papilla gives rise to numerous&#xD;
      problems such as retention of food, phonetic problems and an unaesthetic look. Reconstruction&#xD;
      of this lost interdental papilla is one of the most challenging task as the lack of blood&#xD;
      supply is a major obstacle in achieving the desired outcome of any attempts at regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subepithelial connective tissue graft has been used for root coverage predictably. Studies in&#xD;
      the form of case reports and case series have been done utilizing the connective tissue graft&#xD;
      harvested from tuberosity, palate etc with encouraging results in the form of complete or&#xD;
      partial interdental papilla fill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been done to evaluate the usefulness of platelet rich fibrin(PRF) in&#xD;
      regeneration of the interdental papilla. Use of PRF for augmentation of interdental papilla&#xD;
      prevents the need for a second surgical site and thereby, the related complications&#xD;
      associated with creation of a second surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On comprehensive search of literature, no study has been evident comparing the effect of&#xD;
      subepithelial connective tissue graft and PRF for papilla augmentation. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare platelet rich fibrin and subepithelial connective tissue&#xD;
      graft in interproximal papilla regeneration. The null hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      significant difference in the clinical outcome for interdental papilla regeneration by&#xD;
      platelet rich fibrin and subepithelial connective tissue graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative evaluation of the clinical parameters in interdental papilla reconstruction by&#xD;
      using platelet rich fibrin (Test group) and subepithelial connective tissue graft (Control&#xD;
      group) MATERIALS AND METHODS The present prospective, analytical, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      will be conducted in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Post Graduate&#xD;
      Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak This interventional study includes 36 systemically&#xD;
      healthy patients, with class I and class II papillary recession according to Nordland and&#xD;
      Tarnow's classification. These will be divided into two groups equally (n = 18) Test group&#xD;
      -Papilla reconstruction would be done with platelet rich fibrin Control group -Papilla&#xD;
      reconstruction would be done with subepithelial connective tissue graft Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the outpatient department of Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences,&#xD;
      Rohtak Single blinding will be adopted where the investigator analysing the results will be&#xD;
      unaware to which group the patient belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will undergo full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling and root&#xD;
      planing with a combination of hand scalers and curettes (Hu Friedy) and ultrasonic scaler&#xD;
      (EMS Piezon,250, Switzerland). Oral hygiene instructions will be imparted and will be&#xD;
      reinforced at each appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia in the form of xylocaine HCl (2%) will be administered. 2mm coronal to the&#xD;
      mucogingival junction of the involved papilla, a 3-5 mm semilunar incision will be given with&#xD;
      an ophthalmic tunnel blade. Crevicular incisions will be given on the necks of the&#xD;
      neighbouring teeth on the surfaces adjacent to the papilla defects. Through the semilunar&#xD;
      incision given above, free the flap along with papilla from the underlying bone. The tissues&#xD;
      will be completely freed from the bone and root, so that coronal displacement of the flap&#xD;
      will be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST GROUP Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) will be prepared according to the Choukron's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimming of the PRF according to the required size will be done. .PRF will be placed on the&#xD;
      recipient site and suturing will be done with a 5-0 vicryl suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal dressing will be given over the surgical area. CONTROL GROUP Subepithelial&#xD;
      connective tissue graft will be harvested from the maxillary premolars/first molar region.&#xD;
      The graft will be then placed at the recipient site and suturing will be done with 5-0 vicryl&#xD;
      suture. Periodontal dressing will be given over the surgical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the groups post operative instructions will be imparted. Antibiotics and analgesics&#xD;
      will be prescribed for 5 days. All patients will be asked to rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate twice a day for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION METHODS PPD will be measured using UNC 15 periodontal probe at six sites&#xD;
      (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual , distolingual , and median points at buccal and&#xD;
      lingual aspect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI, PI will be measured using UNC 15 periodontal probe at four sites (distolabial,&#xD;
      mesiolabial, labial, lingual gingival margin) Papillary height will be measured from apical&#xD;
      aspect of contact point to tip of papilla with UNC 15 probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Width of Keratinized Gingiva will be measured with the help of UNC 15 probe from the&#xD;
      mucogingival junction to the free gingival margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters will be recorded at different time intervals. Healing Index will be&#xD;
      measured at 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. All the other clinical parameters will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline, 3 months and 6 months and 1 year. The patients will be reinforced with oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Based on data from the previously published study, a difference of&#xD;
      1mm between both test groups (standard deviation: 1.0 mm; significance level alpha: 0.05,&#xD;
      power: 0.8) resulted in a sample size of 16 patients . To compensate for possible dropout, 18&#xD;
      patients per group will be recruited.&#xD;
