      Objective: The objective of the study is to verify and validate the data collected in the&#xD;
      EVEREG Incisional Hernia Surgery Registry between 2012 and 2018 through an audit process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: An audit of registered cases (Incisional Hernia Patients undergoing surgery) from&#xD;
      2012 to 2018, and a descriptive analysis of these data will be performed Expected results:&#xD;
      The study could show that the EVEREG Incisional Hernia Registry is a reliable source of&#xD;
      information, valid for carrying out specific and exhaustive analysis that may lead to high&#xD;
      quality publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The standardization of the data collection is very important to compare outcomes&#xD;
      between different centers. This study will allow us to verify the accuracy of the collected&#xD;
      data&#xD;

      Objective: The objective of the study is to verify and validate the data collected in the&#xD;
      EVEREG Incisional Hernia Surgery Registry between 2012 and 2018 through an audit process&#xD;
      Secondary objective are a descriptive analysis of the registered data and a comparison with&#xD;
      the outcomes published in other studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The high volume of data obtained by well-validated registries allows them to be&#xD;
      considered appropriate for the study of their multiple variables, even when the differences&#xD;
      are small and the variables are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of registries of abdominal wall surgery has been extended in recent years worldwide&#xD;
      and the analysis of their data has already improved the knowledge and treatment of this&#xD;
      pathology of high prevalence. The National Registry of Incisional Hernia (EVEREG), is&#xD;
      promoted by the Section of Abdominal Wall and Sutures of the Spanish Association of Surgeons,&#xD;
      collecting the data prospectively. It began in July 2012. In December 2018 it included data&#xD;
      from 160 Spanish hospitals, and a total of 9780 cases of incisional hernias. Hernias related&#xD;
      to a previous laparotomy are included, primary ventral hernias are not recorded, and the&#xD;
      first analyzes have already been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of any registry is based on the accuracy of the data. For this reason, it is&#xD;
      considered very important to perform the audit in the centers where the data have been&#xD;
      recorded in the EVEREG on-line registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population to study The data of all the patients included in the EVEREG Incisional Hernia&#xD;
      registry will be compiled and analyzed from July 2012 to December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the approval by the corresponding Ethics Committee has been obtained, audits will be&#xD;
      carried out in each center. A group of 2 researchers from a center different from the one&#xD;
      evaluated, will carry out an exhaustive review of the variables previously determined and&#xD;
      collected in the registry. The reviewers will prepare an audit report, previously designed by&#xD;
      the PIs, where the results obtained for each variable studied will be collected. In the last&#xD;
      3 months of the study the statistical analysis and writing of conclusions will be carried out&#xD;
      Study variables The EVEREG registry includes 68 patient parameters divided into sections&#xD;
      corresponding to: patient history , characteristics of the incisional hernia ,&#xD;
      characteristics of the intervention and complications and follow-up of the patient up to 2&#xD;
      years postoperatively They are open variables and agreed by consensus of the group, updates&#xD;
      have been made with the aim of their improvement. Due to the different number of cases&#xD;
      introduced per center and in order to obtain a sufficiently representative sample of the&#xD;
      total number of cases introduced and of the various variables under study, the selection of&#xD;
      the sample has been designed taking into account the total number of cases to be selected and&#xD;
      a minimum of cases of each center to avoid the standard error and the sampling error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selection of the variables to be analyzed was made according to their clinical relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal Background: Age, Size, Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incisional hernia: Type, Trocar, Paraestomal, Pneumoperitoneum preop, Botulinum toxin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Date, Access, Components Separation, Mesh Placement, Mesh Number, Mesh&#xD;
           Type, Mesh Position, Complications, High&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative 1: Date, Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Last Postoperative Control: Date, Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Univariate descriptive analysis will be performed, presenting the&#xD;
      results as means (with standard deviation and range) for the continuous variables and as&#xD;
      numbers and percentages for the categorical variables. In addition, bivariate analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out among the variables of interest to describe their level of correlation and&#xD;
      evaluate the possible differences between them. To evaluate the differences between the&#xD;
      continuous variables, the comparison of means based on the T-Student will be used, and for&#xD;
      the comparison of differences in the categorical variables, the Chi-square test will be used.&#xD;
      Finally, linear regression models and generalized linear models (as appropriate depending on&#xD;
      the response variable) will be used to study the dependence of the variables of interest,&#xD;
      with other factors of study. Statistical analysis will be carried out using the SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) Software (IBM SPSS Statistics 22). All tests&#xD;
      will be bilateral with a level of significance of 5%. 100% of the data recorded from&#xD;
      01/01/2014 to 06/30/2017 will be analyzed, and the proportion of values lost in the variables&#xD;
      of interest will be evaluated.&#xD;
