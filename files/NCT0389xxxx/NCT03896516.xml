      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have trouble controlling their drinking. Medications&#xD;
      can help some people with AUD but are not effective for many others. Researchers want to test&#xD;
      new drugs to better treat the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the investigational drug GLWL-01 is safe to use in people with alcohol problems.&#xD;
      Also, to find out if the drug reduces the urge to drink alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-70 with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 06-DA-N415.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient facility, Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on the&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center for up to 21 days. They may leave the CRU on specified&#xD;
      days pending approval. All their meals will be provided. They cannot drink alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take either the study drug or a placebo by mouth twice daily. They will not&#xD;
      know which they are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete many questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete tasks on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood samples obtained on some study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will taste and indicate their preference for sweet liquids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature and weight, heart&#xD;
      rate and rhythm will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have breath testing to obtain information about smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be exposed to alcohol cues, water, and food cues in a bar-like room. Cues&#xD;
      are things that might make them feel the urge to eat or drink alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in a virtual buffet experiment. They will wear a virtual reality&#xD;
      headset, walk around a virtual room, and select virtual food and drink....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Objective: Acyl-ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that stimulates appetite&#xD;
      and food intake. It is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor&#xD;
      (GHS-R1a). Preclinical studies suggest that acyl-ghrelin increases alcohol intake and&#xD;
      decreases in acyl-ghrelin and GHS-R1a function suppresses alcohol consumption. Furthermore,&#xD;
      previous human studies indicate a positive correlation between endogenous ghrelin levels and&#xD;
      alcohol craving and drinking. In clinical studies conducted by our group with individuals&#xD;
      with AUD, intravenous (IV) acyl-ghrelin administration, versus placebo 1) increased alcohol&#xD;
      craving during alcohol cue-exposure and 2) increased IV alcohol self-administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      as well as decreased latency to first infusion of alcohol and 3) increased brain activation&#xD;
      in the amygdala in anticipation of alcohol reward. Together, this preclinical and human data&#xD;
      suggest that manipulating the ghrelin signal may be a novel and potentially effective&#xD;
      pharmacological approach to treat individuals with alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discoveries of GHS-R1a and acyl-ghrelin, a next step was identifying ghrelin&#xD;
      O-acyltransferase (GOAT) the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of des-acyl-ghrelin (DAG)&#xD;
      to acyl-ghrelin via octanoylation. GOAT is thus the master switch for the ghrelin system , as&#xD;
      acyl-ghrelin, not DAG, is biologically active at the GHSR-1a. GOAT s structure is highly&#xD;
      conserved, is produced by endocrine cells in the stomach and is co-expressed with ghrelin.&#xD;
      Therefore, GOAT is a promising target for manipulating the ghrelin system by altering the&#xD;
      peripheral acyl-to-total ghrelin ratio (where total ghrelin = acyl-ghrelin + DAG). Recently,&#xD;
      the ghrelin system has been investigated as a potential treatment target for AUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, an oral bioavailable GOAT inhibitor offers encouraging potential as a treatment for&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder. GLWL-01 is an existing GOAT inhibitor for which GLWL Research Inc. has&#xD;
      recently and successfully completed a first-in-human safety clinical trial. The goal of this&#xD;
      protocol is to conduct a proof-of-concept human laboratory study to assess a potential early&#xD;
      signal of efficacy of GLWL-01 in relation to alcohol-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Males and females (N = 43) with alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A within-subject, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
      Participants will take GLWL-01 450 mg b.i.d. or matched placebo for a minimum of 4 days&#xD;
      (Stage I). After a minimum 2 day wash-out window, Stage II will take place during which the&#xD;
      counterbalanced study drug will be administered for a minimum of 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: The co-primary aims will be to determine whether: 1) the number of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) experienced differ in the GLWL-01 condition, compared to placebo; and 2)&#xD;
      GLWL-01, compared to placebo, reduces alcohol cue-elicited craving using a validated alcohol&#xD;
      cue-reactivity procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: The main secondary aim will be the effects of GLWL-01 on food&#xD;
      choices using a virtual buffet experimental procedure. We will also monitor a wide range of&#xD;
      behavioral measures including e.g., pain, anxiety, depression, alcohol craving and&#xD;
      withdrawal, and smoking.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to speak, read, write and understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Most recent urine drug test for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine metabolites,&#xD;
             morphine, oxycodone, methadone, amphetamine, &amp; buprenorphine is negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Most recent Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar)&#xD;
             score is less than or equal to 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Males agrees agree to sexual abstinence or to use a reliable method of birth control&#xD;
        during the study and 3 months following the last dose of the study drug. Acceptable methods&#xD;
        of birth control may include: 1) condom with spermicide; 2) diaphragm with spermicide; or&#xD;
        3) female condom with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Women of child-bearing potential may participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if they test negative for pregnancy (based on a urine pregnancy test) prior to&#xD;
             initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they must also agree to use either 1 highly effective method of contraception or a&#xD;
             combination of 2 effective methods of contraception during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective method may include hormonal contraceptives (e.g., combined oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); intrauterine&#xD;
                  device or/ intrauterine system; vasectomy and tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Effective methods may include barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male&#xD;
                  condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women may choose to use a double-barrier method of contraception. Barrier methods without&#xD;
        concomitant use of a spermicide are not reliable or an acceptable method. Thus, each&#xD;
        barrier method must include use of a spermicide. It should be noted that the use of male&#xD;
        and female condoms as a double-barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high&#xD;
        failure rate when these methods are combined.&#xD;

             estrogen receptor modulators, or chemotherapy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  spontaneous amenorrhea for 6 to 12 months and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
