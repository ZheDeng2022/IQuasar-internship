  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a telephone delivered&#xD;
      behavioral change intervention for older Veterans with chronic low back pain (cLBP) and&#xD;
      comorbid depression, and to ultimately assess its effect on cLBP-related pain, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility for&#xD;
      older Veterans with cLBP and depression assigned to receive the behavioral interventions&#xD;
      (n=25) versus waitlist control (n=25). For participants assigned to the intervention arm,&#xD;
      trained health coaches will deliver the intervention via telephone. All participants,&#xD;
      regardless of what group they have been assigned to will undergo several outcome assessments&#xD;
      (pre-screening, baseline, mid-point, final assessments) conducted by a blinded research&#xD;
      assistant. Subjects randomized to the waitlist control group will be offered the same&#xD;
      intervention once the active intervention group has completed the active sessions and&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot RCT, investigators will assess the feasibility for older Veterans with cLBP and&#xD;
      depression assigned to receive the behavioral intervention (n=25) versus the waitlist control&#xD;
      (n=25). Follow-up will also include assessments at 6 months and 12 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Proposed intervention: The behavioral intervention is designed for older Veterans&#xD;
      with cLBP and depression and will include 8 individual telephone sessions delivered by health&#xD;
      coaches over a period of 10-20 weeks (up to 5 months total, accounting for additional time&#xD;
      between sessions if needed). Exceptions may be made for highly motivated subjects who had&#xD;
      unfortunate life circumstances arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the physical activity component of the intervention, investigators will provide an Omron&#xD;
      pedometer to subjects, as previously used in VA research studies. The Omron pedometer will be&#xD;
      set up by the research team (stride length, setting date/time) and will be mailed to the&#xD;
      subject's home in between session 1 and 2. The health coach will remind the subject that this&#xD;
      pedometer will arrive via United States Postal Service mail to their home and to call the&#xD;
      research coordinator when it arrives. The research team will provide technical assistance and&#xD;
      instructions to the subject regarding use of the Omron pedometer (to be worn on the waist&#xD;
      band, daily, all day aside from showers/baths). The research team will also verbally show the&#xD;
      subject how to press the mode and memory buttons to obtain weekly step counts for&#xD;
      documentation/tracking physical activity. The subjects will be prompted by the health coach&#xD;
      or research staff to report out weekly step counts during subsequent coaching sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the assessments outlined later in this protocol, specifically at 12 months,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with ~10-15 participants (8&#xD;
      from both arms of the pilot trial, the health coaches, 2 primary care providers, and 1 mental&#xD;
      health provider) using purposive sampling. The health coach/research coordinator will&#xD;
      identify Veterans who are at higher risk for drop-out, were less engaged, or were&#xD;
      particularly successful at achieving behavioral change. The purpose of this final interview&#xD;
      is to learn about the barriers and facilitators to successful intervention delivery and&#xD;
      participant retention from the Veteran, health coach, and provider perspective.&#xD;
