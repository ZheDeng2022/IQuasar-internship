  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving cessation outcomes for African American smokers through the use of novel,&#xD;
      empirically-based strategies is a national health priority. In the vast majority of smoking&#xD;
      cessation studies and in clinical practice, when smokers are provided a medication to help&#xD;
      them quit, they are expected to continue that medication regardless of how well it is&#xD;
      working. This study will assess whether African Americans smokers respond better if they&#xD;
      continue with a single treatment or if their treatment is changed when that treatment is not&#xD;
      working.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of optimized (OPT) versus enhanced&#xD;
      usual care (UC) treatment for smoking cessation. African American smokers randomized to OPT&#xD;
      (n=196) will receive high intensity smoking cessation counseling, nicotine patch (NP), and up&#xD;
      to two pharmacotherapy optimizations [varenicline (VAR), bupropion (BUP) plus NP, ] based on&#xD;
      verified smoking status at Weeks 2 and 6. African American smokers randomized to enhanced UC&#xD;
      (n=196) will receive the same high intensity counseling and NP with no optimizations in&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy and counseling in both groups will last for 18 weeks with&#xD;
      long-term follow-up through Week 26. The primary outcome is biochemically-verified smoking&#xD;
      status at Week 12.&#xD;
