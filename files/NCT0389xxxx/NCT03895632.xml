  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some cases, strabismus, or squint, is treated with injections of Botulinum toxin (BTX) to&#xD;
      temporarily relax the eye muscle responsible for causing the eye to be pulled to one side.&#xD;
      Due to the deep location of the muscles, electromyogram (EMG) needle guidance is used to help&#xD;
      ensure the toxin is delivered accurately. EMG needle guidance involves listening to the EMG&#xD;
      signal from the tip of the delivery needle - when the needle is in the right place a sound&#xD;
      akin to &quot;rain on a tin roof&quot; is heard and the BTX can be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous research, clearly clinicians want to improve the technology of this procedure&#xD;
      and increase the treatment efficacy and repeatability. After all, the current procedure is&#xD;
      imprecise and subjective for what is a small target, with the eye muscles being around 2.5 mm&#xD;
      to 4.7 mm in diameter. There may also be an increase in the likelihood of side effects such&#xD;
      as droopy eyelids when the toxin spreads beyond the target muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong need for new knowledge to improve EMG needle guidance in this context. It&#xD;
      is hypothesised that the EMG signal could be cleaned and mined for information in real time&#xD;
      during the procedure, thus providing the clinician with better information to guide the&#xD;
      positioning of the needle before injecting. This pilot study will deliver the knowledge&#xD;
      essential to indicate the feasibility of doing this. If feasible, this study will inform a&#xD;
      full study with the aim of benefitting patients by allowing new technology to be developed to&#xD;
      improve the treatment of strabismus with BTX.&#xD;

Welch's periodogram estimator (Hamming window, 256-point FFT, 50% overlap) was applied to each of the three signal segments described above to obtain an estimate of the PSD of the signal. A robust linear model was fit to estimate the α (slope) parameter of each PSD plot.</description>
