      The purpose of this research study is to look at the advantages of using a 3D printed heart&#xD;
      model for surgical planning in children who have been diagnosed with Congenital Heart Disease&#xD;
      (CHD) and clinical heart failure and will undergo a ventricular assist device (VAD)&#xD;
      placement. The investigators want to study the correlation of having a 3D printed model with&#xD;
      improvement in patient outcomes and compare those with patients who have had a VAD placement&#xD;
      without a 3D model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains the most common type of major congenital malformation&#xD;
      and the leading cause of mortality from birth defects [1-4]. Advances in effective treatment&#xD;
      for these lesions have significantly extended the lifespan of affected patients, especially&#xD;
      for the most complex subtypes of disease. However, these patients are at higher risk of heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) secondary to longer life expectancy. This includes patients with a systemic&#xD;
      right ventricle and a single ventricle circulation palliated by a Fontan procedure [5, 6]. HF&#xD;
      has been documented in up to 30% of patients with a systemic right ventricle and 40% of&#xD;
      patients who have had a Fontan procedure [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are implanted in patients with HF to improve cardiac output&#xD;
      and prolong life. They remain underutilized in patients with CHD and HF in part due to the&#xD;
      highly variable anatomy in this population. This is true despite outcomes having been shown&#xD;
      to be the same for VAD placement in patients with and without CHD [8-10]. In the absence of&#xD;
      VAD placement, however, wait list mortality for patients with CHD is higher than for those&#xD;
      patients without CHD [11, 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in imaging techniques have allowed early diagnosis of CHD as well as anatomic&#xD;
      assessment prior to surgical procedures. Given the significant yet often subtle anatomic&#xD;
      differences between CHD patients, it is a substantial challenge to thoroughly depict all of&#xD;
      the components of a complex patient's cardiac anatomy in a two dimensional imaging dataset.&#xD;
      An innovative technology that is being used with more enthusiasm in the medical field, is&#xD;
      three-dimensional (3D) printing. Our research team has previously reported on the best&#xD;
      technique that should be used to create 3D printed cardiac models from MRI and the subtypes&#xD;
      of complex CHD's for which 3D printing should be utilized [13-16]. 3D printing allows&#xD;
      creation of patient specific physical anatomic models from a patient's own imaging data.&#xD;
      These models provide a physical guide to patient-specific anatomic features that often make&#xD;
      VAD and cannula placement challenging in patients with CHD [17]. Factors such as complex&#xD;
      cardiac anatomic malformations, heavy trabeculations or a severely dilated ventricle can&#xD;
      distort the usual anatomic landmarks used to identify the best position for cannula&#xD;
      placement. Our primary goal is to establish the utility of this advanced imaging technique,&#xD;
      which provides a much more comprehensive understanding of complex congenital cardiac anatomy.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that 3D printed models will allow more informed preoperative planning with a&#xD;
      clearer understanding of the best site for inflow and outflow cannula and VAD placement&#xD;
      leading to better surgical preparedness, less operating room time and improved patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To assess if a 3D printed cardiac model improves perceived visualization of VAD and&#xD;
      cannula placement sites in CHD-HF patients as compared to 2D imaging. We will prospectively&#xD;
      enroll CHD-HF patients at multiple centers and randomize to Group A (3D printed models will&#xD;
      be used for pre-VAD planning) or Group B (no model-controls). For both Groups, all of the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgeons at the participating center will complete a questionnaire after&#xD;
      reviewing 2D imaging data. For Group A, a survey will also be administered after reviewing a&#xD;
      patient specific 3D model. Our primary outcome measure will be better perceived visualization&#xD;
      of cannula and VAD sites. We hypothesize that the 3D model will more clearly demonstrate&#xD;
      sites of cannula and VAD placement as compared to 2D imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine if perioperative factors and outcomes improve in CHD-HF patients with use&#xD;
      of a 3D printed model versus traditional imaging in VAD placement planning. Clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be collected at time of enrollment including primary diagnosis and&#xD;
      indication for VAD. After VAD placement, information regarding the intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative course will be collected including surgical cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB)&#xD;
      and need for cannula repositioning. Longer CPB increases morbidity and mortality and is&#xD;
      associated with intensive care readmission in patients after LVAD placement [18-20]. Our&#xD;
      primary measures of improvement will be CPB. We hypothesize that the improved preoperative&#xD;
      planning using 3D models will lead to a decrease in CPB time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skill with which we assess patient specific CHD anatomy for pre-procedural planning must&#xD;
      be improved, especially for the most complex patients. To confirm the clinical benefit of 3D&#xD;
      printed models in pre-surgical planning and justify their use in routine care, multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trials must be conducted. As an expert in the field of 3D imaging in cardiac&#xD;
      disease, I am well poised to lead this body of research. My goal is to become well versed in&#xD;
      conducting high quality multicenter studies and to become facile in survey tool design&#xD;
      through this K23 proposal. I will then design a prospective multicenter study for an&#xD;
      independent R01 proposal focused on assessing the utility of 3D models in pre-procedural&#xD;
      planning for all complex congenital heart diseases. Investigating and reporting on these&#xD;
      findings will result in a paradigm shift in what we consider &quot;standard of care&quot; for advanced&#xD;
      imaging offered to our most complex CHD patients.&#xD;
