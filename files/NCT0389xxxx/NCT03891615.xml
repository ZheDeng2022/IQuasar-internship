  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      EGFR-Mutated Advanced Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are Niraparib and Osimertinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved osimertinib as a treatment option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material&#xD;
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.&#xD;
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells through deadly DNA damage.&#xD;
      PARP inhibition may be a treatment option for participants with this type of cancer due to&#xD;
      altered repair and protection of tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osimertinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this type of&#xD;
      cancer there is a mutation in the EGFR which is allowing the cancer to grow when it is not&#xD;
      supposed to. Osimertinib blocks mutated EGFR, which may cause tumor regression (when the&#xD;
      tumor starts to shrink) and prevent the spread of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether the combination of&#xD;
      niraparib and osimertinib is safe and well tolerated and what the best dose of niraparib is&#xD;
      in participants with EGFR-Mutated Advanced Lung Cancer. The investigators also hope that the&#xD;
      combination of niraparib and osimertinib will stop the cancer from growing and spreading.&#xD;

             abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia,&#xD;
             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the&#xD;
             study or interfere with the patient's participation for the full duration of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Niraparib. In addition, these participants may be at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated, However, HIV testing is not required.&#xD;
