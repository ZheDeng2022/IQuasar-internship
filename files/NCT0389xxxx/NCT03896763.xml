  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a life-threatening and&#xD;
      frequent problem experienced by thousands of children each year. Little evidence supports&#xD;
      current supportive practices during their critical illness. The overall objective of this&#xD;
      study is to identify the best positional and/or ventilation practice that leads to improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes in these critically ill children. We hypothesize that children with severe&#xD;
      PARDS treated with either prone positioning or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)&#xD;
      will demonstrate more days off the ventilator when compared to children treated with supine&#xD;
      positioning or conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROSpect is a two-by-two factorial, response-adaptive, randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      of supine/prone positioning and conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV)/high-frequency&#xD;
      oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). About 45 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), 30 U.S. and&#xD;
      15 international, with at least 5 years of experience with prone positioning and HFOV in the&#xD;
      care of pediatric patients with severe Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PARDS),&#xD;
      that can provide back-up extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, are&#xD;
      participating. Eligible consecutive subjects with severe PARDS will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      four groups: supine/CMV, prone/CMV, supine/HFOV, prone/HFOV. Subjects who fail their assigned&#xD;
      positional and/or ventilation therapy for either persistent hypoxia or hypercapnia may&#xD;
      receive the reciprocal therapy while being considered for ECMO cannulation. Our primary&#xD;
      outcome is ventilator-free days (VFD) through day 28, where non-survivors receive zero VFD.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that children with severe PARDS treated with either prone positioning or HFOV&#xD;
      will demonstrate ≥ 2 more VFD. Our secondary outcome is nonpulmonary organ failure-free days.&#xD;
      We will also explore the interaction effects of prone positioning with HFOV on VFDs and also&#xD;
      investigate the impact of these interventions on 90-day in-hospital mortality and, among&#xD;
      survivors, the duration of mechanical ventilation, PICU and hospital length of stay, and the&#xD;
      trajectory of post-PICU functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Up to&#xD;
      1000 subjects with severe PARDS will be randomized, stratified by age group and&#xD;
      direct/indirect lung injury. Adaptive randomization will first occur after 400 patients are&#xD;
      randomized and have been followed for 28 days, and every 100 patients thereafter. At these&#xD;
      randomization update analyses, new allocation probabilities will be computed based on ongoing&#xD;
      intention-to-treat trial results, increasing allocation to well performing arms and&#xD;
      decreasing allocation to poorly performing arms. Data will be analyzed per intention-to-treat&#xD;
      for the primary analyses and per-protocol received for primary, secondary and exploratory&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;

    <measure>Ventilator-free Days (VFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary research hypothesis is that children with severe PARDS randomized to either prone positioning or HFOV will demonstrate more ventilator-free days. We hypothesize that a superior treatment would improve VFD by at least 2 days, a clinically meaningful difference. VFD is the number of days within 28 days that a patient is alive and free of mechanical ventilation. Improvement in VFD will be considered within the context of patient safety; specifically, patients must also exhibit a similar safety profile.</description>

    <measure>Nonpulmonary organ failure-free days (OFFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary research hypothesis is that children with severe PARDS randomized to either prone positioning or HFOV will demonstrate more more nonpulmonary organ failure-free days. OFFD is the number of days within 28 days that a patient is alive and free of clinically significant non-pulmonary organ failure. Nonpulmonary organ failure-free days will be calculated based on the clinically important nonpulmonary organ systems (neurologic, cardiovascular, renal and hematologic) using nonpulmonary PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-20 scores.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Interaction effects of prone positioning with HFOV on VFDs - number of ventilator-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number of ventilator-free days (VFD) will be compared between children randomized to prone/CMV and supine/HFOV to those randomized to prone/HFOV. VFD is the number of days within 28 days that a patient is alive and free of mechanical ventilation.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>90-day in-hospital mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Deaths from all causes will be monitored through hospital discharge or day 90 (whichever occurs first). The primary and secondary causes of death (as specified on the death certificate) will be recorded to allow us to probe the cause of death in PARDS.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of mechanical ventilation (among survivors)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of mechanical ventilation provides a prospective evaluation of ventilator support independent of mortality. The duration of mechanical ventilation is defined as the time from day 0 (intubation) to the first time the endotracheal tube is continuously absent for at least 24 hours. For subjects with tracheostomies, duration of mechanical ventilation is defined as the time of initiation of assisted breathing to the first time positive pressure is &lt;5 cm H2O (continuous or bi-level) for at least 24 hours. Duration of mechanical ventilation will be considered to be 28 days for subjects still intubated on day 28, and will be calculated for subjects who survive to hospital discharge or day 90 (whichever occurs first).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PICU and hospital length of stay (among survivors)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>PICU length of stay (LOS) is defined as the time from day 0 (intubation) to the time of PICU discharge, while hospital LOS is defined as the time from day 0 to the time of hospital discharge. PICU and hospital LOS will be considered to be 90 days for subjects still in the PICU/hospital on day 90, and will be calculated for subjects who survive to hospital discharge or day 90 (whichever occurs first).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post PICU discharge functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 months post PICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Pre and post PICU functional status will be compared. Functional status will be assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance (PCPC), Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) and Functional Status Scale (FSS) score. The PCPC and POPC quantify short-term cognitive impairments and functional morbidity. Scores range from 1 to 6 for both scales with 1: good, 2: mild disability, and 6: brain death. The FSS is a valid and reliable assessment method to quantify functional status. The FSS includes 6 domains: mental status, sensory functioning, communication, motor function, feeding, and respiratory. Scores for each domain range from 1 (normal) to 5 (very severe dysfunction) with total scores ranging from 6 to 30.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post PICU discharge health-related quality of life (HRQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 months post PICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Pre and post PICU health-related quality of life will be compared using the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and Infant Scales - Acute Version They are 23-item child self-report and parent proxy-report scales with four domains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer problems. The PedsQL Infant Scales consist of 36-45 questions, depending on age, with 5 domains: physical functioning, physical symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, and cognitive functioning. The PedsQL™ Multi-dimensional Fatigue Scale - Acute Version is an 18-item scale that encompasses three domains: General Fatigue, Sleep/Rest Fatigue and Cognitive Fatigue. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL. PedsQL Pediatric Pain Questionnaire is a generic pain instrument. Subjects capable of self-reporting identify a point on a 100 mm line that best shows the worst pain they experienced in the past week.</description>
