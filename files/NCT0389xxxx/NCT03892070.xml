    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in the cirrhotic patient.&#xD;
      Beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite with potential efficacy in&#xD;
      increasing protein synthesis, muscle mass, and its functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effect of nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation with HMB and physical activity both on muscle mass and on muscle function in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Changes in nutritional status are a frequent complication in cirrhotic&#xD;
           patients. The prevalence of malnutrition is related to the severity of the disease and&#xD;
           has been reported by 65-90% in advanced cirrhosis. The most significant component of&#xD;
           malnutrition is a progressive and generalized loss of mass understood as sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several studies have reported that sarcopenia represents a negative prognostic factor&#xD;
           for survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. Other studies have shown that sarcopenia&#xD;
           is an independent predictor of complications of portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For these reasons and being a modifiable condition, identifying and treating sarcopenia&#xD;
           in patients is very important for their prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sarcopenia in liver cirrhosis occurs as a result of an increase in proteolysis or a&#xD;
           reduction in protein synthesis, or a combination of the two mechanisms. The alterations&#xD;
           in the molecular pathways that involve the regulation of these mechanisms are not&#xD;
           entirely known. Recent research has led to the identification of increased expression of&#xD;
           myostatin, member of the transforming growth factor ß superfamily, in skeletal muscle in&#xD;
           animal models of hepatic injury and in the plasma of cirrhotic patients with consequent&#xD;
           inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition, myostatin is able to examine the protein&#xD;
           kinase 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an inhibitor of signaling of mammalian&#xD;
           target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           I populations of non-cirrhotic malnourished patients, the benefits of a therapy aimed at&#xD;
           improving malnutrition are highlighted by reduced mortality, infections, systemic&#xD;
           inflammatory responses and hospital stay. For cirrhotic patients, specific studies in&#xD;
           this regard are limited by the size of the cohort and by the design of the study, and&#xD;
           there are no effective therapies mainly due to the fact that the mechanisms of muscle&#xD;
           loss in cirrhosis are not yet well understood. In addition, the end-points of these&#xD;
           studies are heterogeneous (regain muscle strength, the disappearance of sarcopenia,&#xD;
           mortality, complications of portal hypertension, etc.). In a study that used a&#xD;
           nutritional enteral supplement, the authors observed a modest improvement in nutritional&#xD;
           parameters but found no statistically significant differences in morbidity and mortality&#xD;
           between the two patient groups. Better results have been reported in clinical trials&#xD;
           that used nocturnal nutritional support, in most cases represented by branched-chain&#xD;
           amino acids (BCAA) (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). This type of intervention has&#xD;
           obtained an improvement in the use of energy substrates in the short term and an&#xD;
           improvement of some nutritional parameters in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beta hydroxy-beta-methyl-butyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite with the potential to&#xD;
           increase muscle performance and tropism. Studies conducted in experimental models of&#xD;
           cachexia have reported increased phosphorylation and activation of mTOR secondary to the&#xD;
           use of HMB. Experimental studies performed on cell cultures of myoblasts also showed an&#xD;
           increased expression of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secondary to treatment with&#xD;
           HMB. These findings confirm the anabolic properties of HMB. A role of HMB on the&#xD;
           suppression of proteolysis by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in models of&#xD;
           neoplastic cachexia and an effect on attenuating muscle atrophy secondary to steroid&#xD;
           therapy has also been demonstrated. The association of anabolic properties targeting&#xD;
           mTOR and anti-proteolytic make HMB a potential efficacy supplement for the treatment of&#xD;
           sarcopenia in the cirrhotic patient. There are currently no data in the literature on&#xD;
           the use of HMB in this category of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • evaluate the effect at 3 months (T12) of HMB supplementation for 12 weeks in patients&#xD;
           with liver cirrhosis on the mass and muscle performance compared to a group of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of the impact of supplementation with HMB on the development of&#xD;
                complications (minimal and manifest hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial infections,&#xD;
                ascites, GI bleeding) compared to the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  evaluation of the impact of sarcopenia on the number of admissions and the days of&#xD;
                hospitalization for these complications compared to the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  identification of surrogate markers of sarcopenia through the preparation of a&#xD;
                serum;&#xD;
&#xD;
           This controlled trial is not sponsored by a drug company.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients Patients are enrolled in the study after been informed of the purpose and&#xD;
           protocol of treatment and need to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis, sample size, and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For categorical variables, the Person-Chi-square test or the Fischer test will be used.&#xD;
           For continuous variables, the Mann-Whitney Test will be used. The ANOVA variance&#xD;
           analysis will be applied followed by the &quot;t-test&quot; when significant differences will be&#xD;
           highlighted. Values of p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Block randomization, consisting of 4 individuals per block, was executed in a 1:1ratio&#xD;
           using random numbers generated by an independent statistician (SPSS version 16.0).&#xD;
           Knowledge of the randomization code was limited to the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While there is no evidence of HMB supplementation in cirrhotic patients, based on&#xD;
           previously described variations in muscle mass in the elderly population, we aim to&#xD;
           conduct a pilot study in which will be enrolled 20 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Protocol of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registration will include the main clinical and biochemical data of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional counseling will be provided to all patients to ensure similar caloric and daily&#xD;
      protein intake in the two groups, according to the current guidelines (caloric intake of&#xD;
      20-25 kcal/kg/ die ± 10%, protein intake of 1.2 g /kg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the enrollment and during the subsequent controls the following data will be&#xD;
      recorded :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calorie intake in the week preceding the visit by a three days non-consecutive food&#xD;
           diary;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height, weight, body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis bioimmunoassay (BIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscular function evaluated by 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go test-TUGT), e&#xD;
           l'Hand grip Test (HG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biochemical and metabolic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pharmacological therapy During the study, clinical complications (hospital admissions,&#xD;
           infectious events, the onset of comorbidity) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the tolerability of the supplement (analog-visual scale), adherence to&#xD;
      absorption and any intolerance or secondary adverse effects will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients are randomized to Group 1 - placebo (or control group) and Group 2 -&#xD;
      supplementation (or treatment group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will be 1gr mannitol twice daily. Supplementation will be HMB 1.5 g dissolved&#xD;
      twice daily. Supplementation/placebo will be provided for 12 weeks.&#xD;
