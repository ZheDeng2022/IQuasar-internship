    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in digital hearing aid technology, many hearing aid users continue to&#xD;
      report difficulty understanding speech in challenging listening environments. Remote&#xD;
      microphones have been shown to provide benefit in the most common of these challenging&#xD;
      listening environments: distant speakers, background noise, and reverberation. Despite&#xD;
      demonstrated benefit, there is a low rate of remote microphone use among adult hearing aid&#xD;
      users. One reason for low uptake may be an uncertainty among hearing healthcare providers and&#xD;
      potential users regarding expected clinically relevant benefit. This clinical trial will&#xD;
      attempt the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the range of remote microphone benefit among adults with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
           sensorineural hearing loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine specific individual factors beyond the audiogram that are associated with&#xD;
           greater benefit from remote microphones&#xD;

      2.0 Background / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even when wearing well-fit hearing aids, many individuals with hearing loss continue to&#xD;
      report difficulty communicating in background noise is one of the most common complaints of&#xD;
      individuals with hearing loss. Directional microphones can improve speech perception in&#xD;
      noise, but often fail to provide benefit in cases where the talker is distant from the&#xD;
      listener, where there are multiple or moving noise sources, or in reverberation. Digital&#xD;
      noise reduction may reduce listening effort and improve listening comfort, but has minimal&#xD;
      effect on speech perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placing the microphone in close proximity to the talker reduces the effective distance&#xD;
      between speaker and listener, compensating for the effects of background noise and&#xD;
      reverberation on the target signal. Use of a remote microphone can significantly improve&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thereby improving speech perception in noise and at a distance.&#xD;
      Recent studies demonstrated that remote-microphone devices that utilize adaptive digital&#xD;
      technology (i.e, Roger) provide significantly more benefit for speech understanding in noise&#xD;
      than non-adaptive remote microphones. Those advantages are likely related to the adaptive&#xD;
      nature of the device, whereby the microphone gain varies according to the level of noise in&#xD;
      the environment. In addition, interference is reduced via transmission of short digital&#xD;
      bursts (160 Î¼s) across a range of channels (2.4-2.4835 GHz). Further, the ability to utilize&#xD;
      the hearing aids' onboard directional microphones in conjunction with a remote microphone&#xD;
      gives listeners the benefits of remote microphone use without sacrificing nearfield&#xD;
      intelligibility. The Roger system has also been shown to improve cell phone communication&#xD;
      amongst cochlear implant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite demonstrated advantages, use of remote microphone assistive devices among adults is&#xD;
      low. In a recent study of listeners with severe hearing loss-a group which has substantial&#xD;
      difficulty communicating in background noise, and is likely to receive significant benefits&#xD;
      from remote-microphone devices-less than 10% reported use of a remote microphone. While cost&#xD;
      may be a barrier for some users, even when such systems are available for free (as in the&#xD;
      Veterans Administration), use is still low. One reason may be uncertainty among both&#xD;
      providers and potential users as to expected benefit for a given listener. For example, Lewis&#xD;
      et al. failed to demonstrate a clinically-significant benefit of remote microphone use using&#xD;
      a work-life outcomes scale in a cohort of mostly nonworking (retired) participants. Wolfe et&#xD;
      al. found significant improvements in objective speech recognition on average, but with a&#xD;
      wide range of benefit (from 10% to 60% improvement across individual participants). That&#xD;
      study also suggested that individual factors may affect remote microphone benefit, in that&#xD;
      the magnitude of improved recognition was correlated with the ability to use spatial cues to&#xD;
      improve recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study tasks will take place in the Hearing Aid Lab and/or Northwestern's Center for&#xD;
      Audiology, Speech, Language and Learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When testing in the Hearing Aid Lab, Frances Searle building room 1-451, we will either use&#xD;
      the sound booth or lab space. All hearing related tasks take place in a sound booth which is&#xD;
      a sound treated 8'x 8' room within the larger lab space. When taking histories or cognitive&#xD;
      measures we will use the office space located within the lab or an additional nearby (i.e.&#xD;
      same building) testing room. The additional test room is only used if participant&#xD;
      confidentiality can be maintained (i.e. conversation is not audible to those outside the&#xD;
      room). When using the Center for Audiology, Speech, Language and Learning all tasks will take&#xD;
      place in a sound proof booth, in a clinical Hearing Aid fit room, or the virtual sound&#xD;
      environment (ViSoR). ViSoR is a 16' by 14' by 9' space capable of simulating the acoustics&#xD;
      and background noise properties of any environment by using an array of speakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will use a within-subjects design consisting of baseline assessment (see&#xD;
      assessments), hearing aid with Roger connect fitting, a four week trial period of use in the&#xD;
      participant's everyday environment(s), and outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who qualify for a dome fitting will start their trial the same day as their&#xD;
      baseline assessment. Participants who require a custom mold fitting will have earmold&#xD;
      impressions taken at their baseline assessment and then be fit with the trial devices after&#xD;
      the custom earmold has arrived back in the lab, usually about one week later. During an&#xD;
      earmold impression the ear is visually inspected with an otoscope (magnifying scope with&#xD;
      light). A cotton block and soft material are placed in the ear. The resulting impression&#xD;
      created by the soft material is used to order an earmold for later testing. This is a&#xD;
      standard clinical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A licensed clinical audiologist will perform the assessments, fitting and counseling of&#xD;
      hearing aids and Roger system, and conduct the outcome measures. To ensure appropriate fit&#xD;
      and use by the participants, there will be a follow-up one week after being fit with the&#xD;
      devices. During this appointment participants will be evaluated and their hearing aid logging&#xD;
      will be checked for compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing aid/Roger fitting: Trial hearing aids and clinically-appropriate earmolds or domes&#xD;
      will be provided by Phonak at no charge to the participants for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
      Those aids are expected to be drawn from Phonak's advanced technology level and to provide&#xD;
      datalogging via 7 base programs. Aids will be set to NAL-NL2 targets using probe microphone&#xD;
      measurements. Directional microphones will be enabled and verified via probe-microphone&#xD;
      testing. Roger will be verified via probe-microphone testing, following clinical best&#xD;
      practice. Appropriate hearing aid adjustments (as judged by the study audiologist) will be&#xD;
      permitted to provide acceptable sound quality and loudness. Final REARs will be recorded. The&#xD;
      study audiologist will instruct participants regarding hearing aid and Roger device use.&#xD;
      PHAST-R and a Roger competency questionnaire (to be developed with input from Phonak) will be&#xD;
      used to document understanding of device function at the fitting and one week follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. Participants will then wear the hearing aids and use the Roger system for 1&#xD;
      month in their everyday listening environments. At the completion of the trial, participants&#xD;
      will return to the lab for outcome assessments and to provide spontaneous feedback regarding&#xD;
      their experiences. Hearing aids and remote microphone will be returned to the study site&#xD;
      following completion of the trial.&#xD;

        <description>Self assessment, disability based inventory that is used to document outcomes of hearing aid fittings. The APHAB uses a percentile scale (Percent of Problems). This measure has 4 subscales: Ease of communication (EC), Reverberation (RV), Background Noise (BN), and Aversiveness (AV). A lower score indicates a better outcome. We will look at both the global change (defined as EC, RV, and BN scores improving by at least 5 points each) and individual subscales (For EC, RV, or BN a change in 22 points is considered significant and for AV a change of 31 points is needed to be considered significant).</description>
