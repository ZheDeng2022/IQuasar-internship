    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study which aims to compare oculomotor function and visual&#xD;
      scanning behaviour (VSB) of participants who suffered concussion with healthy controls with&#xD;
      no concussion. This study also aims to investigate the pattern of change in oculomotor&#xD;
      function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) in the participants over a 6-month period.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify differences in oculomotor function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB)&#xD;
           between participant with and without acute concussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate patterns of change and recovery in oculomotor function and VSB in&#xD;
           participants who suffered a concussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To investigate the association between the oculomotor function and concussion-related&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective longitudinal study which aims to evaluate differences in oculomotor&#xD;
      function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) between participants who suffered acute&#xD;
      concussion and healthy controls with no concussion. This study also aims to investigate the&#xD;
      pattern of change in oculomotor function and visual scanning behaviour (VSB) in the&#xD;
      participants over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health information and concussion history: After obtaining informed consents, during the&#xD;
      first visit, participants will be asked about their health history such as past medical&#xD;
      history, medication history, substance use history, and family history. They will also be&#xD;
      asked about their concussion history which includes number of concussions in the past, any&#xD;
      comorbidity with the concussions, mechanism of injury, and any change in their levels of&#xD;
      consciousness at the time of concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported outcomes: During each visit, participants will be asked on the presence or&#xD;
      absence of concussion-related symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms affect their&#xD;
      everyday functioning if present. The symptoms the participants will be questioned using the&#xD;
      Rivermead Post-concussive Symptom Questionnaire (RPQ) as a standardized assessment&#xD;
      (https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx#tab=Data_Standards) at each visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oculomotor function testing and visual scanning behaviour (VSB): During each visit,&#xD;
      oculomotor data will be collected using Visual Attention Scanning Technology (VAST, EL-MAR&#xD;
      Inc.). VAST is a technology that was developed to support advanced eye-tracking research&#xD;
      application. Over the past 10 years the technology has been used in research studies in the&#xD;
      University of Toronto, and University Health Network hospitals. Participants will be seated&#xD;
      65 cm from the monitor, and their binocular gaze positions will be estimated 30 times/sec&#xD;
      with an accuracy of 0.5º in visual angle. Following a calibration procedure, the participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to look at a series of slides presented on the monitor, and their eye&#xD;
      positions will be recorded. The eye positions will be segmented into fixations that are&#xD;
      linked to the displayed images. Oculomotor functions testing includes testing self-paced&#xD;
      saccadic (SPS) eye movements, fixation, anti-saccadic eye movements. Visual scanning&#xD;
      behaviour (VSB) will be assessed using a set of images which require patients to look at the&#xD;
      images and match them according to the instruction at the beginning of each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at baseline (i.e. within 7 days of concussion) and three follow-up&#xD;
      (f/u) visits (i.e. 1, 3, and 6 months after concussion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be assessed at baseline and one follow-up visit (i.e. 6 months after&#xD;
      the baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire assessment in each visit takes 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
