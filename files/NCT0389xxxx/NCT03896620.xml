  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A tissue biopsy is currently the only clinical test or procedure that is able to confirm the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis of soft tissue or metastatic sarcoma and evaluate its progress during&#xD;
      treatment. However, tissue biopsy collection can be challenging (depending on the location of&#xD;
      the tumor), and this procedure poses physical risks to the patient. A tissue biopsy also&#xD;
      needs to be recollected at various time points in order to assess if the patient is&#xD;
      responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigator would like to collect blood samples in addition to the&#xD;
      sample of the tumor that will be collected before treatment is started. The investigator&#xD;
      would like to analyze both blood and tumor, in hopes of identifying new biomarkers of sarcoma&#xD;
      that can help the study doctors better diagnose sarcoma for patients in the future without&#xD;
      needing to collect a piece of their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biomarker is something found in the blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can be used&#xD;
      to measure the progress of disease, how a treatment is working, or its likelihood of being&#xD;
      successful. In this project, the investigator would like to compare ctDNA from blood to the&#xD;
      DNA in the tumor. ctDNA, or circulating tumor DNA, is DNA originating from the tumor that is&#xD;
      present in the blood. It can be assessed by taking an additional sample of blood when it will&#xD;
      be collected for normal laboratory tests. These biomarkers may also help the study doctors&#xD;
      detect how a patient is responding to their treatment or help predict their response to&#xD;
      future treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators wish to prospectively collect blood samples from 25&#xD;
      patients with localized soft tissue sarcomas and 25 patients with metastatic sarcoma (schema&#xD;
      III) at various time points outlined. The presence/absence, as well as the change of ctDNA in&#xD;
      circulation, will then be measured after the therapies administered and correlated with&#xD;
      overall survival, progression-free survival and local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to the subjects enrolled on this study include the general risks of undergoing the&#xD;
      standard procedures, such as blood draws, imaging, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      surgery, which will be discussed prior to the therapies and images each patient undergoes.&#xD;
      The risks of the procedures are not risks of the study with exception to blood draws. There&#xD;
      is also a risk of loss of confidentiality, but the data will be deidentified once acquired.&#xD;
      Thus, this risk is minimal.&#xD;

      In this project, the investigator will do genetic testing on blood and tumor samples. Whole&#xD;
      genome sequencing will be included as part of the genetic testing for this research. Genetic&#xD;
      testing will be done because the study doctor would like to identify new biomarkers of&#xD;
      sarcoma.&#xD;
