      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-adherence to medication among patients on chronic hemodialysis compromises treatment&#xD;
      effects and results in increased morbidity, mortality and extensive costs to the healthcare&#xD;
      system. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the prevalence of non-adherence among&#xD;
      Danish hemodialysis patients using a validated measure of non-adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-adherence among Danish&#xD;
      patients on chronic hemodialysis measured by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second aim was to explore patients' beliefs about medicines and potential associations&#xD;
      between beliefs and non-adherence to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our third aim was to explore the prevalence and severity of physical and emotional symptoms&#xD;
      and potential associations with non-adherence to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre cross-sectional study according to the STROBE statement will be conducted from&#xD;
      May 2019 - April 2021. The study will take place in the outpatient hemodialysis centres at&#xD;
      three large University Hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be invited to participate in the study during their dialysis treatment at the participating hemodialysis outpatient centres. Allocated nurses at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet (MS, AB, LFH, AH), Copenhagen University Hospital, Hillerød (MPL) and Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev (TM) will be responsible for recruitment. Eligible patients will be informed orally and in writing about the study. Participants who wish to participate will be asked to provide informed consent and, following this, complete a paper-based questionnaire during treatment. Patients who have difficulty reading Danish and patients with visual or physical impairments that impinge on their ability to complete the questionnaires will be interviewed using a structured interview approach based on the questionnaires.</description>
