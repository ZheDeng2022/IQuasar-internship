  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of chronic subjective tinnitus is rising with age and associated with maladaptive&#xD;
      oscillatory changes in auditory as well as non-auditory regions of the brain such as the&#xD;
      insula and the anterior cingulate cortex which are known to be key points within the salience&#xD;
      and distress networks of the brain.Thus, we are conducting a clinical trial by implementing&#xD;
      those auditory as well as non-auditory regions into a tomographical neurofeedback Training&#xD;
      (ToNF) -protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to 12 electroencephalography (EEG) -based ToNF-trainings with 36 older participants&#xD;
      using standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Software (sLORETA,&#xD;
      Pascual-Marqui 2002), participants' brains will be measured using structural magnet resonance&#xD;
      imaging (sMRI) in order to identify potential structural markers for training success (e.g.&#xD;
      cortical thickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training success will be measured by oscillatory change via EEG before and after the training&#xD;
      period as well as by means of follow-up measures. Furthermore, a comprehensive battery of&#xD;
      behavioral and psychometric standardized self-report questionnaires will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this multifocal (Insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex &amp; auditory cortex) ToNF we&#xD;
      expect oscillatory changes resulting in decreased tinnitus symptoms such as perceived&#xD;
      loudness and distress.&#xD;
