    <textblock>
      The SUNRISE study is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial in subjects aged 12.0 to &lt;41.0 years diagnosed with T1D, as defined&#xD;
      by American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, and within 5 years of diagnosis. Time of&#xD;
      diagnosis is defined as the first day of insulin administration. Subjects will be stratified&#xD;
      by duration (zero up to 1 year and 1 year up to five years) to ensure balance of disease&#xD;
      duration across treatment and placebo groups in each strata. For analytical purposes, all&#xD;
      subjects12-&lt;41 will be considered cohort A, subjects aged 12-&lt;18 will considered cohort B and&#xD;
      subjects aged 18-&lt;41 will be considered cohort C. For subjects aged 12-&lt;18 (Cohort B), dosing&#xD;
      will be staggered with an initial 6 subjects aged 14-&lt;18 being enrolled with the last subject&#xD;
      a having a minimum of 2 injections with at least 1 week follow-up after the 2nd injection.&#xD;
      Safety data from this cohort will be evaluated before opening the study to subjects 12 and&#xD;
      older. Subjects should be randomized no sooner than 6 weeks after diagnosis, unless glycemic&#xD;
      range is adequately controlled as confirmed by time in glycemic range (70-180 mg/dL) &gt;55% by&#xD;
      CGM recording over 3 or more consecutive or non-consecutive days. Screening assessments will&#xD;
      include a physical examination, a fundoscopic photograph, chemistry and hematology safety&#xD;
      labs, urinalysis, 24-hour urine protein and creatinine, HbA1c, presence of T1D antibodies,&#xD;
      and a 4-hour MMTT. Approximately 99 qualified subjects who meet all selection criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with TOL-3021 or placebo and treated for 52 weeks.&#xD;
      Study drug treatments will be administered via an IM injection into a large muscle every week&#xD;
      for 52 weeks. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be initiated within 5 days prior to&#xD;
      the screening MMTT visit and continued through Week 52. Subjects will agree to diabetes&#xD;
      management during the study with the goal of maintaining HbA1c levels of approximately 7.0%&#xD;
      without frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We recognize that sharing anonymized data and other information from clinical trials can increase the speed and success of biomedical research in addressing unmet clinical need. We are following ongoing discussions among industry, the academic community, and other stakeholders regarding data sharing. Industry and its academic partners have not yet formulated a consensus on the amount, types, and forms of data that will be useful and beneficial to the public, or the process for sharing data. As a small, young company, we await the development of guidances and best practices for industry before issuing a comprehensive data sharing plan. For now, we defer a description of what data will be shared and the process for doing so. The protocol will be shared as part of study publication in a peer reviewed medical journal. The protocol will be available as a supplement to the publication and/or on the website of the publishing journal and upon request to the Sponsor (www.tolerion.bio)</ipd_description>
