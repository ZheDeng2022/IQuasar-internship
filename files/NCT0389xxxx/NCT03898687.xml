    <textblock>
      Background Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a well-established technique for nodal staging of&#xD;
      malignant disease, including breast cancer and malignant melanoma. The sentinel node (SN) is&#xD;
      the first lymph node to receive cancer cells in a given lymph node basin. The status of the&#xD;
      SN is often the most important prognostic factor, and determines potential adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      and follow-up. The SN is detected by injection of a radioactive isotope (Technetium 99m) and&#xD;
      a blue dye around the tumour or the scar following primary resection. This is achieved by a&#xD;
      lymphoscintigraphy which is usually performed the day before surgery which necessitates a&#xD;
      nuclear medicine department. At the time of surgery, a blue dye (Patent blue) is injected at&#xD;
      the same area prior to incision. Thereafter the SN is identified by a handheld gamma-probe&#xD;
      and the dye which colours the sentinel node blue. The so called hot and blue lymph node is&#xD;
      removed surgically and sent to pathology for staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality of cutaneous malignant melanoma is high, especially when diagnosed in an&#xD;
      advanced stage [4]. Accurate staging and prediction of outcome largely depend on the&#xD;
      identification and examination of the SN. SNB is recommended in Sweden for melanomas with a&#xD;
      Breslow thickness more than 1 mm. About 20% of SNs in patients with melanoma are positive,&#xD;
      which affects follow-up and also potentially adjuvant therapies that recently have been&#xD;
      approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SNB is a surgical technique with associated risk for complications, mainly seroma, infections&#xD;
      and lymph-edema. If nodal status could be determined by imaging, the dissection of the&#xD;
      sentinel node biopsy could be avoided. However, current imaging techniques, such as MRI, CT&#xD;
      and ultrasound are not accurate enough to stage the lymph nodes preoperatively. Motomura et&#xD;
      al. recently reported a technique where superparamagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) is injected into&#xD;
      the tumour in patients with breast cancer, followed by MRI scan. They found a 100%&#xD;
      sensitivity and 96% specificity for node staging when being compared to SNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been an increasing interest in using SPIO for identifying the sentinel node in&#xD;
      breast cancer and recent publications showed great accuracy when SPIO was used as the only&#xD;
      tracer. The agent was injected intra tumoral or subcutaneously under the areola before&#xD;
      surgery and the SN(s) was/were detected by use of a handheld probe (Sentimag, Endomagnetics&#xD;
      Ltd). The Sentimag is a magnetometer, which measures the strength of the magnetic field&#xD;
      created by the iron oxide particles in the SPIO. It is a handheld device that signals when it&#xD;
      is close enough to a magnetic field. The method was compared for feasibility and sensitivity&#xD;
      to the current method used for identifying the SN (Technetium and Patent blue) and it was&#xD;
      found to be at least as reliable and accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning melanoma, the SPIO method has not been used except recently when the MELAMAG trial&#xD;
      was published. SPIO was compared to blue dye and radioisotope for identification of sentinel&#xD;
      node in clinically node negative patients with melanoma. 97.7% of patients had a sentinel&#xD;
      node identified with the standard technique, whereas 95.3% were identified with the magnetic&#xD;
      tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of these results, using SPIO as the only tracer to identify the sentinel node, in&#xD;
      melanoma patients, instead of the double technique, could also be feasible. This could also&#xD;
      be combined to SPIO MRI before surgery so as to evaluate this as a non-interventional method.&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the detection rate of SPIO (Magtrace®) in&#xD;
      patients with melanoma of the extremities compared to technetium and blue dye. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of SPIO (Magtrace®)-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN Study Objectives Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate if Magtrace®/Sentimag® can be used to identify SN in malignant melanoma with&#xD;
      the same diagnostically reliability as the currently used method of Technetium 99m and Patent&#xD;
      blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To evaluate if Magtrace®-MRI can predict sentinel node status in&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma of the extremities being candidates&#xD;
      for wide local excision and SNB, will be considered for enrollment. Patients should have a&#xD;
      primary melanoma located to one extremity, without clinically suspected lymph nodes&#xD;
      metastasis on palpation and be planned for a SNB. A total of 20 patients that complete the&#xD;
      study will be included. The study will be presented both by verbal and written means by one&#xD;
      of the investigators. If the patient accepts enrolment, a written informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed by both parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo an MRI of the lymph node basin (axillary or inguinal). Then they will&#xD;
      receive an interstitial injection of Magtrace® with or without local anaesthesia up to a&#xD;
      total of 2 ml divided in 4 doses injected in 4 quadrants around the previous excision scar.&#xD;
      Care shall be taken for the injection not to exceed the excision area and thus cause a&#xD;
      permanent skin discoloration after the wide local excision. After a minimum of 2 hours a new&#xD;
      MRI (Magtrace®-MRI) of the same lymph node basin will be performed. The surgery will be&#xD;
      scheduled within 7 days from the Magtrace® injection. The results of the Magtrace®-MRI will&#xD;
      be evaluated to decide potential SNs and their status with the radiologist prior to surgery.&#xD;
      The SN will be considered non-metastatic (negative) if it shows homogenous, low intensity&#xD;
      signal on T2 weighted images compared to pre- Magtrace® images. A node will be considered as&#xD;
      metastatic (positive) if the whole node or parts of it does not show a low intensity signal&#xD;
      on T2 weighted image or if there is a high signal on water excitation compared to pre-&#xD;
      Magtrace® images.All SNs identified by MRI will be considered for excision if they can be&#xD;
      identified by using the Sentimag® probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lymphoscintigraphy with Technetium-99m will be performed the day before surgery, in&#xD;
      accordance to our current practice. Results will be investigated thoroughly and compared to&#xD;
      the Magtrace®-MRI results, in order to identify discrepancies between the two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, the current double technique, with the gamma probe and the blue dye, will be&#xD;
      combined with the Sentimag, Endomagnetics Ltd probe and the intraoperative findings will be&#xD;
      registered and analysed by the investigators, so as to test the feasibility of the method in&#xD;
      comparison to the double method. All the nodes harvested will be sent to pathology and the&#xD;
      final results will be compared to the Magtrace®-MRI results prior to surgery. CRF will be&#xD;
      completed at the end of surgery and then when definitive pathology report is available. Data&#xD;
      from all 20 patients included in this trial will be analysed at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed according to clinical routine, no specific follow-up is required&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
