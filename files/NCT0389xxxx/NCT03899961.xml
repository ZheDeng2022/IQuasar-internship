  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbetocin has been in clinical use in EU for some years and the efficacy is documented in&#xD;
      several RCTs. Circulatory adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous&#xD;
      injection of oxytocin. Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent&#xD;
      ischemic ECG changes, prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell&#xD;
      death. Previously the investigators have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of&#xD;
      oxytocin and carbetocin. There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects&#xD;
      of oxytocin with carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if&#xD;
      the cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women&#xD;
      have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably&#xD;
      no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning&#xD;
      delivery in pregnant women with heart disease.&#xD;

      Background -Treatment Caesarean delivery is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Uterus&#xD;
      contraction after delivery of the baby is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background - Therapeutic Information Adequate uterus contraction after delivery of the baby&#xD;
      is necessary to avoid excessive bleeding. Prophylactic administration of an oxytocin receptor&#xD;
      agonist is first line practice. Intravenous injection of oxytocin has been the standard&#xD;
      procedure but serious cardiovascular adverse events have been reported. Lowering the dose or&#xD;
      administering the drug as a 5 minute infusion may increase safety. Carbetocin, a synthetic&#xD;
      oxytocin receptor agonist, has significantly longer half life and may reduce blood loss&#xD;
      compared with oxytocin. The hemodynamic vasodilatory effects are comparable to oxytocin, but&#xD;
      potential differences in adverse effects on myocardium are not well described yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Clinical &amp; Clinical Experience with Carbetocin (IMP) and Oxytocin Carbetocin has been in&#xD;
      clinical use in EU for some years and the efficacy is documented in several RCTs. In the&#xD;
      proposed study, carbetocin will be used within the conditions of the marketing authorization.&#xD;
      Oxytocin is the first line treatment and prophylaxis in Norway and most countries in the&#xD;
      world. According to recently published guidelines from EU drug authorities (EMA), oxytocin&#xD;
      should be given as a slow, 5-minute infusion in order to avoid hypotension. This has so far&#xD;
      not been implemented in Norway. The pre-clinical and clinical experience of the two drugs are&#xD;
      summarized in the Summaries of Product Characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study Pregnancy and delivery is a natural process, but for many women this&#xD;
      period is stressful and not without risks of morbidity, and even mortality. Circulatory&#xD;
      adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous injection of oxytocin.&#xD;
      Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent ischemic ECG changes,&#xD;
      prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell death. Previously the&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and carbetocin.&#xD;
      There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects of oxytocin with&#xD;
      carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if the&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women&#xD;
      have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably&#xD;
      no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning&#xD;
      delivery in pregnant women with heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES The aims of this study are to compare 0h (before C-section) plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of Troponin I (high sensitive methods) with a second measurement of plasma&#xD;
      concentration of Troponin I drawn within an interval of 6 to 10 hours after administration of&#xD;
      study drug, in elective healthy C-section patients randomized to oxytocin 2.5 U or carbetocin&#xD;
      100 µg, 1 minute injection immediately after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint Primary outcome measure is the difference in plasma concentration of&#xD;
      Troponin I from baseline (0h) to the second measurement 6-10 hours after test drug&#xD;
      administration, according to treatment allocation. Plasma concentrations will be collected&#xD;
      before C-section, and at an interval of 6-10 h after test drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other myocardial biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterus tone evaluated repeatedly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss (estimated calculated blood loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BP, heart rate and ECG changes&#xD;
