  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study evaluating medical treatment before surgery in HER2-amplified early&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. Patients receive chemotherapy with HER2-targeted antibodies and are&#xD;
      randomised to receive the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab or not.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to investigate whether the rate of pCR, after optimal neoadjuvant&#xD;
      anti-HER2 based systemic therapy, can be increased by addition of atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to assess safety and tolerability of this treatment combination, and to&#xD;
      identify therapy predictive factors for the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and&#xD;
      pertuzumab plus-minus atezolizumab with a backbone of chemotherapy, using modern molecular&#xD;
      biological investigational procedures with analyses by repeated biopsies from an&#xD;
      intra-patient longitudinal study design.&#xD;
