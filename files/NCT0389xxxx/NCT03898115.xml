    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter, cluster randomized, step-wedged design. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization will be the inpatient units admitted critically ill patients, with the&#xD;
      interventions being carried out over 4 months. The study plans to enroll 14 units at 2 sites.&#xD;
      Four sequences will be enrolled into the intervention each month; each sequence will have 3-4&#xD;
      units (see figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Units eligible for the study will have patients that are critically ill admitted and have had&#xD;
      at least 1 CLABSI events over the past 12 months (fiscal year). Given the pragmatic nature of&#xD;
      the study design, there will be limited additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. Prior to&#xD;
      the beginning the study, all nursing staff (RNs and nursing assistants [NAs]) will receive a&#xD;
      survey link (RedCAP) to understand their perceptions of CHG bathing. After all units have&#xD;
      been enrolled (approximately 4 months), nursing staff will be sent a post-survey to see if&#xD;
      their perceptions have improved after the program. Further, the Context Assessment Index&#xD;
      (used with permission; via RedCAP) will also be used to assess the context (i.e., culture) in&#xD;
      which clinicians works and the effect this has on using evidence in practice. This will be&#xD;
      provided to infection prevention champions on each unit one time, at the beginning of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hospitals in the trial will receive access to site-level quality reports on CLABSI data.&#xD;
      The interventions will include a &quot;direct engagement&quot; at the site level; this strategy will&#xD;
      build upon current quality improvement interventions developed from the Agency for Healthcare&#xD;
      Research &amp; Quality for optimization of care for critically ill patients at risk for CLABSIs.&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary teams will include national key opinion leaders in quality improvement&#xD;
      working with local infection prevention specialists and support staff to help healthcare&#xD;
      systems and hospitals design or revise quality improvement plans. Units will receive feedback&#xD;
      on quality improvement efforts, including audit and feedback reviewing their CHG bathing&#xD;
      compliance and CLABSI rates. Duke will serve as the primary statistical center and analysis&#xD;
      will be generated by Duke. The only risk in this study is the possibility of breach of&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of a customized, multifaceted&#xD;
      quality improvement [QI] program on compliance with daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)&#xD;
      bathing per the AHRQ protocol in inpatient units that admit critically ill patients. Further,&#xD;
      we will assess the effect of this program on nursing staffs' perception of the importance of&#xD;
      CHG bathing. The Context Assessment Index (used with permission) will also be used to assess&#xD;
      the context (i.e., culture) in which clinicians works and the effect this has on using&#xD;
      evidence in practice. The secondary objective of this study is to examine the effect of the&#xD;
      QI program on central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      and CLABSI rates will be measured at 12 months to assess sustainability.&#xD;
