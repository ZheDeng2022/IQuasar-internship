      The aim of this study is to measure the effect of a prebiotic (high dose/low dose) mixture at&#xD;
      different doses within a wheat-based instant cereal, on fractional iron absorption (FIA), gut&#xD;
      microbiota and inflammation after three weeks. FIA will be compared with and without three&#xD;
      weeks of pre-feeding with two different doses of the prebiotic mixture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is prevalent in infants and preschool children in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Several studies have been conducted to mitigate IDA. Some of these studies had&#xD;
      adverse effects on the gut microbiome and diarrhea due to the high iron dose administered in&#xD;
      areas of high burden of malaria and other common childhood infections. As a potentially safer&#xD;
      solution, we investigated the effect of lowering the iron dose in the iron supplements and&#xD;
      including 7.5 g galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS). Findings from these studies demonstrated that&#xD;
      in infants, consumption of iron and GOS improved iron status, improved the gut microbiota and&#xD;
      reduced risk of illness. We recently demonstrated that habitual consumption of GOS for three&#xD;
      weeks resulted in improved iron absorption that correlated with a decrease in colonic pH. It&#xD;
      is not known whether other prebiotics or a combination will also result in increased iron&#xD;
      absorption and what the effect of using half the dose of prebiotics would be. The composition&#xD;
      of Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) in breast milk might be an important determinant of the&#xD;
      gut microbiome composition and health of the breastfed infant by determining the composition&#xD;
      of Bifidobacteria species that are the main commensal 'barrier' bacteria in the infant's gut&#xD;
      microbiome. However, little is known about the specific HMOs composition of breast milk in&#xD;
      African populations and the potential impact on the gut microbiota composition of the&#xD;
      breastfed infants. We therefore aim to measure the effect of a prebiotic (high dose/low dose)&#xD;
      mixture at different doses within a wheat-based instant cereal, on fractional iron absorption&#xD;
      (FIA) from a wheat-based instant cereal containing no prebiotic. We will compare the FIA with&#xD;
      and without three weeks of pre-feeding with two different doses of prebiotic mixture. In&#xD;
      addition, we will investigate the effect of two different doses of this prebiotic (high&#xD;
      dose/low dose) mixture on gut microbiota and inflammation after three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In south coast Kenya, we will enroll 195 infants and randomize them into three intervention&#xD;
      groups. Daily for 3 weeks, infants will consume a newly formulated wheat-based instant cereal&#xD;
      (3.6 mg iron with Ascorbic acid (AA)) at home. Group 1 will receive the cereal with 7.5 g&#xD;
      prebiotic mixture; group 2 will receive the cereal with 3 g prebiotic mixture and group 3&#xD;
      will receive the cereal with no prebiotics. In a subset of 70 infants, we will administer&#xD;
      four labelled test meals. Two test meals will be fed 2 weeks before beginning the&#xD;
      intervention study to investigate the acute effect of prebiotics on FIA and the other two&#xD;
      will be fed at the end of the 3 weeks intervention study to investigate the effect of chronic&#xD;
      consumption of prebiotics on FIA. Breast milk samples from the mothers will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed for the composition of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). We hypothesize that: 1)&#xD;
      Infants receiving the new wheat-based instant cereal containing prebiotic (high dose/low&#xD;
      dose) mixture will have a higher iron absorption, and 2) higher fecal Bifidobacteria&#xD;
      abundance than infants receiving the cereal without prebiotics; 3) in infants receiving the&#xD;
      wheat-based instant cereal, the addition of 7.5 g of prebiotic (high dose/low dose) mixture&#xD;
      will result in higher FIA, and 4) in greater ratio of Bifidobacteria to Enterobacteriaceae,&#xD;
      lowest fecal calprotectin, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and lowest&#xD;
      abundances of enteropathogens than the addition of 3 g of prebiotics; 5) the addition of 7.5&#xD;
      g of prebiotic (high dose/low dose) mixture will result in greater FIA when administered&#xD;
      acutely or chronically and these two effects will be additive; 6) the wheat-based instant&#xD;
      cereal will improve iron status, including hemoglobin (Hb), plasma ferritin (PF) and soluble&#xD;
      transferrin receptor (sTfR), and inflammation status, including C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), fecal calprotectin and I-FABP; 7) the wheat-based instant&#xD;
      cereal will decrease fecal pH, thereby providing a less favorable growth environment for&#xD;
      enteric pathogens; 8) Maternal secretor status will affect the infant gut microbiota, with&#xD;
      infants of secretor mothers having higher abundances of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides but&#xD;
      lower abundances of enteropathogens; and 9) Effects of co-provision of prebiotic mixture on&#xD;
      the infant gut microbiota and on iron absorption, will be stronger among infants of&#xD;
      non-secretor mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will generate crucial data for optimizing iron and prebiotic-composition of&#xD;
      wheat-based instant cereal designed for complementary feeding during infancy. This cereal&#xD;
      could potentially be part of continued research on interventions to reduce the burden of IDA&#xD;
      using safer formulations not adversely affecting the infant's gut microbiome.&#xD;
