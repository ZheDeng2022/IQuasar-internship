  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC), is a cancer developing from the inner lining of the&#xD;
      stomach.Approximately half of the gastric cancer cases are diagnosed during advanced stages.&#xD;
      One of the reasons for this is the invasiveness of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening&#xD;
      examinations that leads to patients avoiding necessary tests .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori),which&#xD;
      accounts for 60% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of tools for the early diagnosis of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions&#xD;
      of gastric cancer is important for reducing mortality, increasing survival rates, and&#xD;
      improving quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy and biopsy are the reference standards for diagnosis and screening of gastric&#xD;
      cancer, but their use is limited for population-wide screening due to their&#xD;
      invasiveness.Subsequently, it is necessary to identify novel, simple, cost-effective and&#xD;
      manipulable screening methods for gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human pepsinogens (HP) are proenzymes for pepsin, a digestive enzymes produced by gastric&#xD;
      chief cells,biochemically and immunochemically classified into two groups: pepsinogen I (PGI)&#xD;
      and pepsinogen II (PGII), humen pepsinogens considered promising serological biomarkers for&#xD;
      the screening of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer,serum pepsinogen test provides a&#xD;
      valuable method for detecting gastric cancer and atrophic gastritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The limitation of the pepsinogen test as a non invasive serologic biomarker screening method&#xD;
      is that the optimal cut-off value could be affected by several factors, age, gender, and the&#xD;
      test method itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trefoil factor family (TFF) of peptides comprises small (12-22kDa) molecules that are&#xD;
      secreted by the mammalian gastro-intestinal tract. TFFs constitute a family of three peptides&#xD;
      (TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3) that are widely expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the gastro-&#xD;
      intestinal tract. Trefoil factor family 3 (TFF3) is expressed in the goblet cells of the&#xD;
      small and large intestines as well as the intestinal metaplasia in the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trefoil factor family (TFF) plays a key role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity, and&#xD;
      plays an impotant role in oncogenic transformation, growth, and metastatic extension of&#xD;
      common human solid tumors, including gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SerumTFF3 showed good diagnostic power in both of H. pylori positive and H. pylori-negative&#xD;
      gastric cancer and its serum levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer than that in patients with early gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. pylori organisms live in gastric mucosa, and attach to epithelial cells of stomach&#xD;
      .Because trefoil factor family 3 is not expressed in epithelial cells of the stomach and is&#xD;
      only expressed in the intestinal goblet cells of the metaplasia of gastric cancer , serum&#xD;
      trefoil factor family 3 levels are less influenced by H. pylori infection , eradication,&#xD;
      aging, and sex ,therefore, serum trefoil factor family 3 is a more stable non invasive&#xD;
      biomarker of gastric cancer risk even in early gastric cancer.&#xD;
