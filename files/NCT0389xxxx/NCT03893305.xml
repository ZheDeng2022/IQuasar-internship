      In this study, the investigators attempt to determine the frequency of dermatologic diseases&#xD;
      in geriatric patients, and search for seasonal, age-related, gender-related and socio-&#xD;
      demographic differences in geriatric patients attending the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
      Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Andrology in Assiut University Hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Geriatric health care has become a worldwide concern, but relatively few statistical studies&#xD;
      are available about geriatric skin diseases (liao et al., 2001). There are published studies&#xD;
      regarding skin disorders among the elderly population from different countries such as&#xD;
      Taiwan, USA, Norway, the Philippines and Turkey (Mcfadden and Hande 1989). All of these&#xD;
      studies are about detecting the prevalence or characteristic pattern of skin diseases, or&#xD;
      identifying past or present skin complaints and the dermatologic findings in the elderly&#xD;
      (Tianco et al.,1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no exact age for getting old, 65 years is usually accepted as the beginning&#xD;
      (Blackman et al., 1999). However, life expectancy is increasing all over the world and the&#xD;
      geriatric population is rising dramatically every year as the medical care improves (Beek and&#xD;
      Jones, 2000). Aging is a complex multifactorial phenomenon in which progressive intrinsic&#xD;
      changes in the skin combine synergistically with cumulative environment insults to produce&#xD;
      both structural and functional disturbances (Beauregard and Gilchrest, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of skin aging exist, which may be divided into intrinsic aging, which includes&#xD;
      those changes that are due to normal maturity and occur in all individuals, and extrinsic&#xD;
      aging, produced by extrinsic factors such as ultraviolet light exposure, smoking, and&#xD;
      environmental pollutants (Norman, 2001). Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      accompanying skin aging could constitute the basis for extending the lifespan in good health&#xD;
      (American Geriatrics Society 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequencies of some diseases change with advancing age. Incidence of eczematous&#xD;
      dermatitis gradually decreases with age, may be due to more contact with environmental and&#xD;
      physical factors (Havlik et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population with old aged skin show a decline in the regular functions of skin, including cell&#xD;
      replacement capacity, wound healing, immune responsiveness, decline in appendegeal functions&#xD;
      and DNA repair capacity which may be responsible for the higher incidence of sun-related&#xD;
      diseases and cutaneous malignancies in elderly people. (Yaar and Gilchrest, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pruritic skin diseases are the most common dermatological problem in the elderly. Pruritis&#xD;
      can be psychogenic in origin. However, there are a number of dermatological and metabolic&#xD;
      conditions that involve pruritis. Xerosis is the most common underlying dermatological&#xD;
      condition. (Norman, 2003) Decreased mobility, drug-induced disorders, and increased&#xD;
      incidences of many chronic diseases are among the reasons elderly individuals are at&#xD;
      heightened risk for skin diseases. Atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV), and congestive heart failure are some disease processes that can be detrimental&#xD;
      to skin. These diseases are known to impede vascular efficiency and decrease immune&#xD;
      responses, thereby reducing the body's ability to heal (Norman, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased immune surveillance in the elderly provides more opportunity for the development of&#xD;
      bacterial and viral infections in these patients (Elgart, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreases in personal care, epidermal turnover, and immunologic functions are observed,&#xD;
      possibly responsible for the high prevalence of fungal infections (Havlik et al., 1999).&#xD;
