      of treatment] or with a proven disease relapse) at least 2 previous lines of treatment,&#xD;

      Single arm, prospective, multi-centric, phase II study. Patients with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed follicular lymphoma, in need of a systemic approach and failing (i.e. with&#xD;
      refractory disease [no response or response lasting less than 6 months at any previous line&#xD;
      of treatment] or with a proven disease relapse) at least 2 previous lines of treatment,&#xD;
      including any antibody directed against the CD20 antigen-containing chemotherapy, will&#xD;
      undergo a combined chemo-free treatment with obinutuzumab and idelalisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously at a flat dose of 1000 mg on day 1, 8, 15 of&#xD;
      the first cycle, then repeated on day 1 of each subsequent cycle, for 6 cycles (each cycle is&#xD;
      completed in 28 days). Idelalisib will be given concomitantly with obinutuzumab and on a&#xD;
      daily 150 mg bid schedule. For patients achieving at least a partial response at the end of&#xD;
      induction, a maintenance phase with obinutuzumab is scheduled (on day 1 every two months for&#xD;
      two years or until progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first) If one of the&#xD;
      two drugs has to be permanently discontinued due to any cause, patient may continue treatment&#xD;
      with the other agent if it is judged to be a clinical benefit. Patients with at least a&#xD;
      stable disease will enter the follow-up phase and will be followed with repeated CT scans&#xD;
      every six months for two years or until death/progression occurs (whichever comes firsts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease, whenever progression is documented, will enter a survival&#xD;
      follow up period of two years after PD was documented. These patients are however considered&#xD;
      evaluable for OS.&#xD;
