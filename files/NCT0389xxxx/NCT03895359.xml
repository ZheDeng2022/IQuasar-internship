  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a standard treatment for patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (also called liver cancer). This is where chemotherapy is injected&#xD;
      into the arteries of the liver and liver cancer. Unfortunately, the tumour grows after TACE&#xD;
      in many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new treatment using a specialized radiation procedure called Stereotactic ablative body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) may increase the chance to control liver cancer. SBRT allows radiation&#xD;
      treatments to be focused more precisely, and be delivered more accurately than with older&#xD;
      treatments. The purpose of this study is to find out if TACE alone versus TACE plus SBRT is&#xD;
      better for you and your liver cancer.&#xD;

      HCC tends to remain within the liver and, therefore, cure with preserved liver function is&#xD;
      possible.4 Treatments with relatively high success rates include surgical resection and liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Surgical resection results in 5-year survival rates of approximately&#xD;
      60%-70%.4 Liver transplantation can cure both the cancer and underlying liver disease with&#xD;
      4-year survival for HCC within the Milan criteria (single HCC &lt;5 cm or ≤3 HCC &lt;3 cm) at&#xD;
      70%-85% after transplantation.5 Unfortunately, most patients are not resectable due to the&#xD;
      extent of disease. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment for unresectable HCC. 5,6 TACE is relatively safe due to the liver's unique&#xD;
      vascular supply from the portal vein. HCC on the other hand, is supplied almost entirely by&#xD;
      branches of the hepatic artery.7 In a randomized controlled trial for unresectable HCC not&#xD;
      suitable for a curative intent, transarterial chemoembolisation or TACE were compared to&#xD;
      conservative treatment.8 TACE induced objective responses (complete and partial response)&#xD;
      that were sustained for at least 6 months in 35% of cases. Survival probabilities at 1 year&#xD;
      and 2 years were 82% and 63% for TACE, significantly better than 63% and 27% obtained with&#xD;
      conservative treatment. Overall survival at 1 and 2 years was also significantly better for&#xD;
      the chemoembolization group 57% and 31% vs. 32% and 11%. However, many patients have large&#xD;
      tumours and response rates to TACE decline rapidly with increasing size.9 TACE alone resulted&#xD;
      in 2 year overall survivals of 42%, 0 and 0 for lesions 5-7cm, 8-10cm, and &gt;10cm,&#xD;
      respectively. Therefore, additional locally ablative treatments are being sought. In the same&#xD;
      report, TACE plus radiation resulted in 2 year overall survivals of 63%, 50% and 17% for&#xD;
      lesions 5-7cm, 8-10cm, and &gt;10cm, respectively.9 External beam radiotherapy has long been&#xD;
      considered to have a very limited role in the treatment of liver tumors. This has&#xD;
      historically been because minimum dose required for local ablation exceeded the dose that&#xD;
      would result in liver toxicity.10,11 The technical development of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT), alone or in combination with TACE, renewed interest in radiation for&#xD;
      HCC.12,13 For SBRT, advanced techniques are used to very accurately deliver a high total dose&#xD;
      to the target in a small number of daily fractions while avoiding dose delivery to&#xD;
      surrounding healthy structures. This research in HCC was done mainly by two groups, in&#xD;
      Michigan and Stockholm, who demonstrated that the delivery of high doses of radiation to&#xD;
      limited volumes of the liver had promising results in terms of local control and survival&#xD;
      with acceptable toxicity.14,15 SBRT is offered as an ablative radical local treatment. In&#xD;
      total as of 2015, eleven primary series reported on tumor response and survival of around 300&#xD;
      patients who have been treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy as primary therapy&#xD;
      for HCC (Table A). The reported percentage of objective responses defined as complete and&#xD;
      partial was ≥64% in 7 of 8 series. Median survival between 11.7 and 32 months has been&#xD;
      observed. Toxicity, based on multiple case series trials, indicate that the treatment is&#xD;
      considered safe. The most common CTC grade 3-4 toxicity was elevation of liver enzymes. 16-19&#xD;
      For unresectable cases, both TACE and SBRT have been used safely and with good efficacy as&#xD;
      separate treatments. Particularly for larger lesions that are more commonly seen in London,&#xD;
      the outcome remains suboptimal compared to surgery. Combined treatment case series have shown&#xD;
      dramatic results (Table B), but there has not been any randomized trial to compare the value&#xD;
      of combining the two modalities. Therefore, a clinical study comparing SBRT and SBRT+TACE&#xD;
      will be significant as it addresses a common problem in one of the two most deadly cancers.&#xD;

    <description>Measured using Child-Pugh score to indicate the severity of toxicity. Five variables are considered: presence of ascites, encephalopathy, serum levels of albumin, total bilirubin and prolongation of the clotting time. Each of these variables is assigned a score between 1 and 3 according to its severity or degree of abnormality. The sum of the five scores is used to assign a &quot;Child-Pugh grade&quot; of A, B or C to the patient's clinical condition at that point in time. Grade A indicates a well-functioning liver, Grade B indicates significant functional compromise, Grade C indicates decompensation of the liver.</description>

Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
