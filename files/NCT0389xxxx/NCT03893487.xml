      This trial studies how well fimepinostat works in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or medulloblastoma, or high-grade glioma that have come&#xD;
      back. Fimepinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm penetration of fimepinostat across the blood brain barrier (BBB) in children&#xD;
      and young adults with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), recurrent&#xD;
      medulloblastoma, or recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG) by measuring concentration of&#xD;
      fimepinostat and metabolite in primary tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of fimepinostat in plasma and tumor tissue of children and&#xD;
      young adults with newly diagnosed DIPG, recurrent medulloblastoma, or recurrent HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess pharmacodynamics (PD) of fimepinostat in children and young adults with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed DIPG, recurrent medulloblastoma, or recurrent HGG as measured by phosphorylation&#xD;
      and acetylation in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate acetylation and phosphorylation in tumor tissue with tissue and plasma PK&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of fimepinostat in children and young adults with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed DIPG, recurrent medulloblastoma, or recurrent HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess preliminary efficacy of fimepinostat given as monotherapy after surgery in&#xD;
      children and young adults with newly diagnosed DIPG, recurrent medulloblastoma, or recurrent&#xD;
      HGG, as based on progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fimepinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -2 to 0. Within 2 hours of&#xD;
      receiving fimepinostat on day 0, patients undergo tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive fimepinostat by mouth, once daily for days 1-5 each week.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      for up to 12 months from the time treatment begins. Should patients continue to derive&#xD;
      clinical benefit, and not experience excess toxicity or progression, patients can continue to&#xD;
      receive drug for up to 24 months or longer pending discussion with study chairs and study&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have one of the following histologically confirmed diagnoses (histologic&#xD;
             confirmation from initial diagnosis acceptable, as appropriate):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stratum A: Newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (WHO grade II-IV) -&#xD;
                  this stratum does not require tissue confirmation at time of enrollment, but&#xD;
                  diagnostic confirmation will be required to continue on study after biopsy.&#xD;
                  Patients with newly diagnosed DIPG will be eligible to enroll before or after&#xD;
                  standard of care radiation, but must be eligible for a biopsy. Newly diagnosed&#xD;
                  DIPG stratum should not have received prior therapy before the initiation of&#xD;
                  fimepinostat, with the exception of those patients who received temozolomide&#xD;
                  during radiation therapy or who previously received radiation as per standard of&#xD;
                  care and have not yet undergone a biopsy. All patients who have received therapy&#xD;
                  other than radiation and temozolomide should be discussed with study chair(s)&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment. Patients enrolling after standard of care radiation must be&#xD;
                  enrolled within 14 weeks of completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stratum B: Recurrent medulloblastoma (WHO grade IV), any molecular subtype&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stratum C: Recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG), including anaplastic astrocytoma&#xD;
                  (WHO grade III) and glioblastoma (WHO grade IV)&#xD;

                       arm can have locally recurrent or disseminated disease, provided&#xD;
                       resection/biopsy would still be clinically indicated. Disseminated disease&#xD;
                       can be diagnosed by imaging or Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. Recurrent&#xD;
                       DIPG will be eligible for stratum C; however, eligibility requires&#xD;
                       biopsy/resection is feasible in a region of tumor outside of the pons (i.e.&#xD;
                       cerebellar extension or new metastatic site). These patients should be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients in the medulloblastoma and HGG strata will be allowed to have&#xD;
             undergone prior therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.&#xD;

             before the initiation of fimepinostat, with the exception of those patients who&#xD;
             received temozolomide during radiation therapy or who previously received radiation as&#xD;
             per standard of care and have not yet undergone a biopsy. All patients who have&#xD;
