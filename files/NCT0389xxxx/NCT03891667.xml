  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10-20% of patients experience ongoing symptoms despite having received standard&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Possible explanations for persistent symptoms include&#xD;
      persistent infection and/or post-infectious causes. Recent in vitro studies indicate that&#xD;
      disulfiram is effective at killing both the actively replicating and the more quiescent&#xD;
      persister forms of Borrelia burgdorferi, the microbe that causes Lyme Disease. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators are examining the safety of disulfiram among patients with post-treatment&#xD;
      Lyme disease symptoms. The investigators are also conducting a preliminary investigation&#xD;
      regarding the relative benefit of 4 vs 8 weeks of treatment with disulfiram.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne&#xD;
      illness in the United States. Typically, after being bitten by an infected tick, patients&#xD;
      will notice an expanding rash and flu-like symptoms. Most patients recover fully after&#xD;
      initial treatment with antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin. Some patients,&#xD;
      however, do not recover fully or their symptoms return within a few months after having&#xD;
      completed antibiotic treatment. Common persistent symptoms include fatigue, joint pain,&#xD;
      muscle pain, numbness, tingling, burning pains, and changes in mood, memory or mental&#xD;
      clarity. These symptoms can last months to years after treatment and, when accompanied by&#xD;
      functional impairment, are collectively referred to by the academic community as &quot;Post&#xD;
      Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)&quot;. Patients however typically refer to this&#xD;
      constellation of persistent symptoms as &quot;Chronic Lyme Disease&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several possible explanations for why patients may have persistent symptoms,&#xD;
      including persistent infection and post-infectious changes triggered by the prior infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientists recently discovered that disulfiram is effective in the lab setting at killing the&#xD;
      microbes that cause Lyme disease. Disulfiram is more commonly known as &quot;Antabuse&quot;. It is an&#xD;
      FDA-approved compound used to assist alcoholics in resisting alcohol consumption. Most&#xD;
      remarkable is that disulfiram was effective at killing not only the actively replicating Lyme&#xD;
      bacteria (ie, the ones that are typically killed by several antibiotics) but also the&#xD;
      relatively dormant or quiescent Lyme bacteria (these are called &quot;drug-tolerant persisters&quot;) -&#xD;
      these latter spirochetes are the ones that may account for the development of chronic Lyme&#xD;
      disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial pilot study will focus on patients with persistent symptoms despite having&#xD;
      received the standard antibiotic therapy (or more) for Lyme disease. Because no one has yet&#xD;
      studied the safety of disulfiram for patients with a history of Lyme disease and because the&#xD;
      investigators do not know the optimal treatment duration for disulfiram, the initial effort&#xD;
      will have the primary aims of assessing safety and determining whether a longer course of&#xD;
      daily treatment is more effective than a shorter course of daily treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose therefore a small 14-week randomized placebo-controlled pilot study&#xD;
      enrolling 24 patients with persistent symptoms despite prior antibiotic treatment for Lyme&#xD;
      disease (known as Post-treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome). Among the 24 disulfiram-treated&#xD;
      patients, half will get 8 weeks of disulfiram and the other half will get a shorter duration&#xD;
      of disulfiram for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of matching placebo. After week 8, patients&#xD;
      will be off pills for 2 weeks for the primary week 10 evaluation and then for another 4 weeks&#xD;
      for the week 14 follow-up evaluation. This will be a double-blinded study; neither physician&#xD;
      nor patient will know which treatment group the patient is assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this initial study, the investigators will be able to evaluate the side effects,&#xD;
      tolerability and initial signs of the effectiveness of disulfiram in reducing symptoms among&#xD;
      the 24 patients assessed. The results of this study will guide the investigators regarding&#xD;
      whether a larger definitive randomized trial should be conducted and which treatment schedule&#xD;
      is optimal.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change will be assessed over a 10 week interval</time_frame>
    <description>This is a psychometrically validated self-report measure of fatigue. This measure consists of 11 items inquiring about the severity of fatigue in different situations during the past week. Scores for each item range from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 7 strong agreement. Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change will be assessed over a 10 week interval</time_frame>
    <description>TThe Q-LES-Q - SF is a self-reported questionnaire, with 16 items, that evaluates overall enjoyment and satisfaction with physical health, mood, work, household and leisure activities, social and family relationships, daily functioning, sexual life, economic status, overall well-being and medications. Responses are scored on a 5-point scale ('not at all or never' to 'frequently or all the time'), where higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfaction with life (possible range 14-70). Fourteen summated items create the total Q-LES-Q - SF score. Two last items, about medications and overall life satisfaction, are considered independently.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change will be assessed over a 10 week interval</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 scales are-vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale, the lower the score the more disability and the higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Symptom Questionnaire (GSQ-30)- Assess multisystemic symptom burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Change will be assessed over a 10 week interval</time_frame>
    <description>This is a psychometrically validated 30 item self-report measure of symptom burden. The measure asks participants to rate how bothered they have been with a particular symptom over a 2-week time frame. Responses are made on 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; (scored 0-4); and the total score ranges from 0-120. Higher scores indicate more symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Change will be assessed over a 10 week interval</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 psychometrically validated 29 item self-report measure of 7 domains. These 7 domains are- Depression, Anxiety, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale. There is also one 11-point rating scale for pain intensity. Norm-based scores have been calculated for each domain on the PROMIS measure. High scores represent more of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptom oriented domains of PROMIS-29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance), higher scores represent worse symptomatology. On the function oriented domains (physical functioning and social role) higher scores represent better functioning.</description>
