  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to determine safety, tolerability, recommended dose (RD),&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumour activity of IPN60090&#xD;
      as a single agent (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part B) or paclitaxel (Part&#xD;
      C) in patients with advanced solid tumours and to evaluate food effect (Part D).&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Following an internal portfolio review, Ipsen has made the decision to terminate study&#xD;
    D-US-60090-001. Ipsen would like to highlight that early termination was not due to any safety&#xD;
    or tolerability issues with IPN60090&#xD;
