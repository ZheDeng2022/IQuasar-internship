      Provision of sufficient iron for brain development in children living in malaria-endemic&#xD;
      areas while also protecting them from infection is an unachieved public health goal for &gt;10&#xD;
      years. The 2006 landmark study on malaria-endemic Pemba Island brought the complicated&#xD;
      relationship between iron and malaria to the world stage by reporting universal prophylactic&#xD;
      iron supplementation increases the risk of child hospitalization and death. Treating iron&#xD;
      deficiency in children who have malaria is also an unsolved challenge. In sub-Saharan Africa,&#xD;
      iron deficiency and malaria coexist, frequently causing a multifactorial anemia that is a&#xD;
      primary cause of hospitalization and mortality in children &lt;5 y. The current World Health&#xD;
      Organization standard-of-care regimen of concurrent treatment with antimalarial medication&#xD;
      and iron therapy has been unsuccessful, with frequent reports of subsequent infection,&#xD;
      including malaria, persistent iron deficiency, and unresolved anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution to effectively treat coexisting malaria and iron deficiency is to stagger&#xD;
      interventions, treating malaria first and delaying iron. The inflammatory response against&#xD;
      malaria induces high levels of the protein hepcidin, which reduces intestinal iron absorption&#xD;
      and prohibits release of iron from reticulo-endothelial cells. Iron given orally during or&#xD;
      shortly after a malaria episode is thus not well absorbed or distributed to red blood cells&#xD;
      or the brain. Moreover, unabsorbed iron in the gut may promote the growth of pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria, potentially leading to subsequent infectious morbidity. A pilot study was recently&#xD;
      completed in Ugandan children with malaria and iron deficiency that used iron stable isotopes&#xD;
      to test whether iron given 28 days after (delayed group) or concurrently with (immediate&#xD;
      group) antimalarial treatment was better incorporated into red blood cells (1R03HD074262). It&#xD;
      was found that delayed iron was incorporated twice as well as immediate iron and that iron&#xD;
      status at 56 days was similar between groups. An important finding was that children in the&#xD;
      immediate group had a higher incidence of infections in the 56-day follow-up period. In this&#xD;
      application, the team proposes a large-scale, randomized clinical trial with 12 months follow&#xD;
      up powered to capture long-term differences in iron status, morbidity, and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      development as a function of immediate or delayed iron following treatment for malaria and&#xD;
      iron deficiency. The gut microbiome will be analyzed to elucidate a mechanism of any&#xD;
      differences in incidence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One long-term goal is to develop safe and effective strategies for managing concurrent&#xD;
      malaria and iron deficiency in children, with reduction of infections and optimization of&#xD;
      neurobehavioral development representing successful outcomes. The objective of this&#xD;
      application is to conduct a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to determine&#xD;
      whether iron therapy begun with vs. 28 days after antimalarial treatment in Ugandan children&#xD;
      6-48 months with malaria and iron deficiency leads to better iron status, fewer infections,&#xD;
      and better neurobehavioral development after 12 months. The central hypothesis is that better&#xD;
      iron incorporation and lower incidence of infectious illness observed with delayed iron in&#xD;
      our short-term, physiology-focused R03 study will translate into better long-term iron&#xD;
      status, fewer episodes of infection, and better neurobehavioral outcomes after 12 months. The&#xD;
      rationale is that this study will determine if staggering antimalarial treatment and iron&#xD;
      therapy protects against immediate morbidity while also optimizing long-term neurobehavioral&#xD;
      development. The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Establish the effect of immediate vs. delayed iron treatment on long-term iron status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that delayed iron will result in better iron status 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      treatment for malaria due to better initial iron absorption and utilization as compared to&#xD;
      the immediate iron group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effect of delayed iron treatment on the incidence of infectious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the better absorbed delayed iron will result in fewer infections in&#xD;
      the 6 and 12 months after treatment for malaria due, in part, to a less pathogenic intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Establish the effect of delayed iron treatment on neurobehavioral development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that delayed iron will result in better neurobehavioral outcomes (as&#xD;
      assessed by standardized cognitive and behavioral tests) due to better iron absorption and&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Impact: Untreated iron deficiency may protect a child from malaria and other&#xD;
      infections, but the consequent potentially permanent damage to the developing brain is an&#xD;
      unacceptable alternative. Establishment of methods to effectively ensure brain iron health&#xD;
      while protecting the child from infection will promote attainment of full cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral development for tens of millions of children worldwide suffering from malaria and&#xD;
      iron deficiency.&#xD;
