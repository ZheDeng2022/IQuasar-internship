  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a progressive disease associated with a high&#xD;
      level of disability. Due to the physical and cognitive impairments, fatigue and apathy,&#xD;
      patients frequently experience a decrease in their daily physical activity. Exercise programs&#xD;
      have been recommended for symptomatic control, however, its implementation is still&#xD;
      challenging in terms of acceptability and adherence. Exergames (i.e. exercise based on video&#xD;
      games) have been proposed as a potential, home-based rehabilitation tool to improve PD&#xD;
      patients motor skills and to promote a more active lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an exergames system design&#xD;
      for PD patients' rehabilitation. A mix-methods study, including two focus groups (with&#xD;
      patients and physiotherapists) and quantitative feasibility study, will be performed.&#xD;
      Physiotherapists and PD patients with a Hoehn Yahr Stage ≤ 2 (MED ON), ability to walk&#xD;
      independently without risk of falling and a Mini-mental state score &gt; 24 will be included.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be patients' satisfaction with the games measured through a 7-point&#xD;
      Likert scale. Secondary outcomes will include games difficulty (7-point Likert scale),&#xD;
      perceived effort (modified Borg scale), safety (number of adverse events) and functional&#xD;
      mobility (Time up and Go test).&#xD;

      1. Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder, characterized by the&#xD;
           presence of motor and non-motor symptoms that negatively affects patients' quality of&#xD;
           life. (1,2) Despite optimal medical treatment, patients develop a progressive disability&#xD;
           that usually shapes a sedentary lifestyle, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease, diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, and depression. (1,3,4)&#xD;
           In the past years, physiotherapy and exercise have been recommended for symptomatic&#xD;
           control and as a strategy to reverse PD patients' sedentary lifestyles. (2,5) However,&#xD;
           results from previous studies showed that physiotherapy programs only provide a&#xD;
           short-term benefit and it still a challenge the implementation of unsupervised&#xD;
           home-based exercise. (3,6) Exergames are video games to exercise, based on gross&#xD;
           physical movements of the player, that combine real-time motion detection with engaging&#xD;
           games. (7,8) They have been described as a therapeutic tool that includes functional,&#xD;
           purposeful and appealing exercise, with positive effects in neurological diseases and&#xD;
           older adults. (7,8) Exergames promote an integrated motor and cognitive stimulation,&#xD;
           providing biofeedback, enhancing game performance and learning of the virtual tasks with&#xD;
           transference to real conditions and its home-based characteristics. Based on this,&#xD;
           exergames have been proposed as a complement to physiotherapy programs, in order to&#xD;
           improve PD motor symptoms. (7,8) However, they should be specifically tailored to&#xD;
           address PD functional needs, in order to optimize efficacy, adherence, and safety. (8)&#xD;
           This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an exergames system design for&#xD;
           PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design A feasibility study including two phases, one qualitative and another&#xD;
           quantitative will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the first phase, the qualitative study, two focus groups will be conducted (one with&#xD;
           PD patients and other with a group of physiotherapists), to discuss the accessibility&#xD;
           and usability of the exergames to be tested and the exercise-based computer games for&#xD;
           people with PD. The second phase, the quantitative study, will be a single-center,&#xD;
           open-label, feasibility, and usability study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients recruitment PD patients will be recruited from the Campus Neurológico Sénior&#xD;
           (CNS) institution to participate either in the qualitative phase or in the quantitative&#xD;
           phase. Patients will be included if they were: 1) idiopathic PD patients according to&#xD;
           the UKBB criteria; 2) age between 40-80 years old; 3) with a Hoehn Yahr Stage (HY) 1 or&#xD;
           2 in MED ON; 4) ability to walk independently without risk of falling; 5) a Mini-mental&#xD;
           state score &gt; 24; 6) ability to communicate with the investigator, to understand and&#xD;
           comply with the requirements of the study; and lastly 7) ability to provide written&#xD;
           informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be excluded if they had an atypical parkinsonian syndrome.&#xD;
           Physiotherapists will be also screened and recruited from the CNS institution. The Local&#xD;
           Ethical Committee approved the study (Ref. 9/2017). All included patients and&#xD;
           physiotherapists will provide informed consent, before enrolling in any study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention and assessment The AHA Exergame System consists of a mobile computing&#xD;
           platform running a set of parameterizable exergames purposely designed for elderly&#xD;
           fitness training. The platform is equipped with a 1000 lumens video projector capable of&#xD;
           creating a 2.05m by 1.16m floor projection display and a Kinect V2 sensor to serve as&#xD;
           game controller.(9) The AHA exercise-based computer games have been designed for and&#xD;
           tested with elderly people and were adapted for the functional limitations of PD&#xD;
           patients. The system includes five different games that aim to train patients motor&#xD;
           ability, cardiorespiratory and muscular strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients Focus groups The focus group will be conducted using a semi-structured script&#xD;
           where participants will be asked to discuss their thoughts on Exergames, daily use of&#xD;
           technology and preferences for the style and type of games.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the session, participants will be invited to view and play with the five games to&#xD;
           have their perception of the appropriateness of the games for people with PD. This part&#xD;
           of the focus group will be followed by a member of the IT team and a physiotherapist to&#xD;
           provide support for instructions guidance and to guarantee the participant's safety&#xD;
           while trying the games. In the end, patients will be asked to share their thoughts on&#xD;
           which features they would like to see included in the proposed games.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The focus group will be recorded, with the agreement of all participants, to be&#xD;
           transcribed for inductive thematic qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physiotherapists focus groups The focus group will be developed using a semi-structured&#xD;
           script where the physiotherapists' participants will be asked for their opinion on&#xD;
           Exergames, the usability of this tool during the sessions, advantages, and&#xD;
           disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the focus group, physiotherapists will be invited to play the games to comment on&#xD;
           the features presented and its adequacy to PD patients. At this point, a member of the&#xD;
           IT team will provide support at a technical level and for instructions guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The focus group will be recorded, with the agreement of all participants, to be&#xD;
           transcribed for inductive thematic qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative study Baseline assessment Before any data will be recorded, each patient&#xD;
           reviewed and signed an informed consent form. In order characterize the sample,&#xD;
           demographic data (date of birth, age, gender, height, weight) and medical history (age&#xD;
           of onset, disease duration, medication) will be collected, and three rating scales and&#xD;
           clinical tests (MDS-UPDRS, HY and Time Up and Go (TUG) test) administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Participants will be invited to play the five different Exergames. Before&#xD;
           playing the games, each participant will have a training period, in which the game will&#xD;
           be presented, and the instructions explained. The sequence in which the games will be&#xD;
           played will be randomized using computer software. Each game will be played for a total&#xD;
           time of 5 minutes. In the end, patients will rate their satisfaction with the game and&#xD;
           its difficulty through a 7-point Likert scale and the perceived exertion through a&#xD;
           modified Borg scale. At the end of the intervention, the TUG test followed by the&#xD;
           modified Borg scale will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exergames overview&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grape Stomping (Douro Region) - Cardiorespiratory Training The goal of this Exergame is&#xD;
           to stomp on grapes, pulled from the conveyor belt into the tank by dragging small&#xD;
           virtual grape baskets. To do that, flexion-extension arm movements are needed to drag&#xD;
           the grape bunches into the tanks, once done, the stomping process starts, requiring&#xD;
           users to raise the knees to a pre-defined height to produce the wine. After fill up one&#xD;
           of the tanks, users are asked to move to the others to continue the exercise. The&#xD;
           experience ends once the pre-established training time finalizes, thus screening the&#xD;
           number of tanks filled, the number of litres of wine produced, the number of steps&#xD;
           performed and the number of grape bunches dragged.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rabelos VR (Porto City) - Upper limbs, Muscular Strength Training The goal of this&#xD;
           Exergame is to row along the river collecting several wine barrels located in small&#xD;
           docks at the river banks. Users are encouraged to make circular arm movements simulating&#xD;
           rowing gestures to move the boat forward. For the lateral displacements of the boat,&#xD;
           users can be standing and use lateral movements or trunk leaning; or they can be seated&#xD;
           using trunk leaning. Additionally, to navigate the treacherous rapids, users have to&#xD;
           avoid big rocks randomly located in the riverbed while trying to dock on the margins to&#xD;
           pick up one or multiple wine barrels. To do that, users must turn the trunk to the side&#xD;
           of the dock and make an extension-flexion movement of the elbow to simulate picking up&#xD;
           the barrels. Meanwhile, the boat is stopped until users picked up, one by one, all of&#xD;
           the barrels in the docks and subsequently the users should The Exergame ends with the&#xD;
           countdown of the pre-established time, screening the number of rocks hit, completed rows&#xD;
           and collected barrels as well as the time spent rowing and collecting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Toboggan Ride (Madeira Island) - Balance, Trunk Muscular Strength The main goal in this&#xD;
           Exergame is to successfully collect as much objects as possible in a pre-established&#xD;
           time avoiding crashes with cars and pedestrians. The sledge direction is controlled via&#xD;
           trunk lateral flexions to the right and to the left while the acceleration is controlled&#xD;
           through trunk flexion-extension movements. Flexion movements are used to increase the&#xD;
           acceleration of the vehicle while extensions are used to deaccelerate it. Collecting and&#xD;
           crashing events occur when the virtual vehicle make a collision with each individual&#xD;
           object making specific rewarding/punishment game sounds. The journey finalizes with a&#xD;
           screenshot of metrics encompassing the time of the session and the number of objects&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exerfado (Lisbon City) - Lower Limbs, Muscular Strength Training The main objective is&#xD;
           the user to collect each musical note by positioning him/herself in front of the note&#xD;
           trajectory. Additionally, the user needs to &quot;push&quot; wrong notes that are sliding in the&#xD;
           wrong trajectory and then collect them equally at the right position. Collecting the&#xD;
           right notes at the right position will reward the user by incrementing the percentage of&#xD;
           notes collected. Some notes are special and offer extra bonus, they are identified in&#xD;
           the game with a glowing and sparking effect. The wrong notes are displayed in game with&#xD;
           black color and with a blinking arrow indicating the direction to where needs to be&#xD;
           pushed, if the user is able to perform the correct arm gesture before the musical note&#xD;
           is lost, the wrong note changes to the correct trajectory and to the right color. Notes&#xD;
           are pushed with arm extension which can be predefined as low or high. User has to move&#xD;
           left and right within the projection range. A piano key is represented as &quot;pressed&quot; when&#xD;
           the user is in front of it and indicates that a note coming in that trajectory will be&#xD;
           collected. User position can be tracked by the waist joint or by both feet; in this case&#xD;
           the user will be able to select two piano keys at the same time. Interaction ends when&#xD;
           the music stops playing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To better adapt to each user needs, on the configuration menu is possible to change&#xD;
           settings such as arm extension, joint to be tracked, the percentage of notes, note&#xD;
           sliding time, and musical choice from a list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical methods and data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative Study For the focus group, 5 PD patients will be invited to participate in&#xD;
           the qualitative study. For the physiotherapist approach, 5 participants will be invited&#xD;
           with experience in dealing with PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative Study Assuming this is an exploratory study, there is no rationale to&#xD;
           estimate the sample size, a total of 10 participants will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
           quantitative phase, with the condition they did not take part of the qualitative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Analysis A content analysis will be performed on the qualitative data assuming a&#xD;
           deductive approach. The content analysis will be performed using a descriptive and&#xD;
           interpretative analysis of the focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical analysis for the qualitative phase of the study will be performed using&#xD;
           SPSS® version 21.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL. Data will be described using descriptive&#xD;
           statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As our primary outcome, we will measure patients' satisfaction with the games, through a&#xD;
           7-point Likert scale, at the end of each game and at the end of the intervention (global&#xD;
           perspective).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients level of difficulty with the game measures through a 7-point Likert scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the level of perceived exertion measure at the end of each game and from&#xD;
                baseline to end of all games with the modified Borg scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the TUG test result from baseline to end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety issues and adverse events reporting Adverse events will be collected for the&#xD;
           duration of the study and at the Follow-Up visit. It is not expected that participation&#xD;
           in the study will be associated with risks or will increase the risk of adverse effects.&#xD;
           All therapeutic interventions will be recommended to be kept stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research subjects will be questioned about adverse events during the Clinical Assessment&#xD;
           and follow up visit. All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and any other abnormal&#xD;
           clinical findings will be recorded in the subjects' case report form (CRF). For all&#xD;
           adverse events, sufficient information will be pursued to permit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a determination of a temporal relationship;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an adequate determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event&#xD;
                should be classified as a serious adverse event);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an assessment of the causal relationship between the adverse event and the study&#xD;
                requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An abnormal result finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the&#xD;
           following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The resulting finding leads to discontinuation of subject participation in the&#xD;
                research study;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The resulting finding is considered an adverse event by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Withdrawal of subjects Subjects will be able to withdrawal from the study at any time of&#xD;
           the research study. After withdrawal, no more data will be collected and taken into&#xD;
           consideration for statistical purposes regarding the withdrawal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria will include, for example: adverse events (serious and non-serious), lack&#xD;
      of compliance to testing, subject fails to comply with protocol requirements, subject's&#xD;
      voluntary withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacements will not be considered.&#xD;
