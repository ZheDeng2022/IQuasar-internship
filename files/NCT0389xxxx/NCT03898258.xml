  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two questionnaires (Qualiveen full version and Qualiveen short-form (SF)), the project&#xD;
      information and the consent form will be sent to individuals who are scheduled for an annual&#xD;
      control at the urological out-patient clinic of the Swiss Paraplegic Centre and who fulfill&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria. The patients will be asked to complete the two questionnaires and to&#xD;
      bring the completed questionnaires and the signed consent form to the annual control at the&#xD;
      Swiss Paraplegic Centre. Participants who have consented and completed the two questionnaires&#xD;
      will receive the two questionnaires a second time 14 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to validate the German version of the SF Qualiveen&#xD;
      questionnaire. The secondary objective is to evaluate the measurement properties of the&#xD;
      German SF Qualiveen questionnaire in comparison with the full version.&#xD;

    <description>Total score of the Qualiveen questionnaire is the arithmetic mean of the four sub-scores. The sub-scores are assessed using a five-point Likert scale (minimum score 0, maximum score 4). The total score indicates how much quality of life is affected by bladder problems. The higher the score the more quality of life is affected.</description>
