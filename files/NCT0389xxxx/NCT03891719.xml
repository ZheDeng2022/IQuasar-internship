  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft lip and cleft palate are the most common birth defects of craniofacial development. The&#xD;
      surgical repair of this deformity requires comprehensive management plans and well&#xD;
      cooperating interdisciplinary cleft teams. Secondary cleft rhinoplasty remains one of the&#xD;
      most challenging procedures and aims for restoring nostril symmetry, enhancing nasal&#xD;
      function, and improvement of aesthetic outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the majority of cleft patients, surgeons usually delay secondary rhinoplasty to ages 14&#xD;
      to 16 years for females and 16 to 18 years for males until after completion of nasal growth&#xD;
      Unilateral secondary cleft nasal deformity results from hypoplastic nasal tissue, asymmetric&#xD;
      growth due to impaired growth, and surgical scarring. The most common deformities include&#xD;
      caudal septal deviation, retrodisplacement and under-projection of dome, lateral slumping of&#xD;
      the medial crus of the lower lateral cartilage, alar-columellar web, insufficiency of&#xD;
      vestibular skin and deficiency of nasal floor. Moreover, these deformities have negative&#xD;
      effect on human well-being and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the opinions on how to address the problems, it seems clear that repositioning and&#xD;
      reshaping of the cleft-side cartilages is necessary for restoring form and function. In&#xD;
      general, in order to there are two basic approaches: those techniques that move the&#xD;
      cleft-side lower lateral cartilage from medial to lateral, and those that move the lower&#xD;
      lateral cartilage from lateral to medial. In an effort to correct the vestibular lining&#xD;
      deficiency, easily be adapted to combine Tajima's reverse-U incisions for treatment of alar&#xD;
      hooding, need for other structural grafts, sliding chondrocutaneous flap offers many&#xD;
      advantages. However, in order to improve nasal tip position or columella shape through&#xD;
      modification of either the anterior septal and/or posterior septal angle position and to act&#xD;
      as the fundamental attachment for sliding lower lateral cartilage, Caudal septal extension&#xD;
      and Columellar strut graft play an important role to stabilize the nasal tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, with the aim of making it harmonize better with other facial features, dorsal&#xD;
      augmentation is needed for improving the shape of the nose. Selecting the optimal material&#xD;
      continues to be a challenge. For most surgeons, an autogenous cartilage graft is the first&#xD;
      choice in rhinoplasty because of its resistance to infection and resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assess the functional and aesthetic outcomes based on three criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in nose symmetry and nasal height (Preoperative and postoperative photographic&#xD;
           analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in functional outcomes through subjective and objective measurement (Questionaire&#xD;
           and acoustic rhinometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in Quality of life (Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation Questionaire)&#xD;
