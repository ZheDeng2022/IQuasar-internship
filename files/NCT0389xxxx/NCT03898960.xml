             mm Hg). All patients, in whom intravenous therapy with blood pressure medications is&#xD;

             access to the site of occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intracranial stenosis that prevents access to the site of occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of recent/ fresh&#xD;
             hemorrhage on presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (except small meningioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of dissection in the extra or intracranial cerebral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or&#xD;
             anterior/posterior circulation).&#xD;
