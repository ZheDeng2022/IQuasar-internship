  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity, irritability and compulsivity are cross-disorder symptom domains, which affect a&#xD;
      significant proportion of adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predominately as part of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but also as symptom&#xD;
      domains without a diagnosis of ADHD, impulsivity and irritability cause serious burden.&#xD;
      Furthermore, treatment options and their effects are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies with different study designs assessing micronutrients for the treatment of&#xD;
      impulsivity / ADHD in children and adults have reported positive benefits as well as a very&#xD;
      good tolerability. However, more research is required; in particular controlled studies with&#xD;
      adolescents, cross-disorder approaches and studies investigating long-term effects are&#xD;
      missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of micronutrients on impulsivity,&#xD;
      irritability and compulsivity in children and adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age with&#xD;
      a high level of impulsivity and irritability with or without a diagnosis of attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to include 210 children and adolescents (n=110 in Germany) with a&#xD;
      high level of impulsivity and irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in two phases. An initial 10-week double blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      treatment phase with broad-spectrum micronutrients is followed by a 10-week open-label&#xD;
      treatment phase. The study assessments will be performed during five study visits and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the double-blind placebo controlled (10 weeks) effects of broad-spectrum micronutrients in highly impulsive children and adolescents (10-18 years; N=180 in total) with a high level of impulsivity with or without diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The primary outcome measure is the response rate at the end of the placebo-controlled phase. Response is defined as a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement score (CGI-I, Guy 1976; NIMH 1985) with a focus on impulsivity of 1 or 2 [=very much improved or much improved] plus a reduction in the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI, parent-rated, Stringaris et al. 2012) total score of at least 30% compared to baseline.</description>
