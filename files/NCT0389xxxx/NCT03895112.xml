  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased levels of TGF-β1 were detected in serum, plasma and BM and positively correlated&#xD;
      with both grade of BMF and extent of leukemic cell infiltration in the marrow. TGF-β likely&#xD;
      plays a dual role in promoting myelofibrosis and myeloproliferation, both of which are the&#xD;
      bone marrow morphologic hallmark of MF. AVID200 is a drug that targets TGF-β1 and TGF-β3. The&#xD;
      study team hypothesizes that inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway in MF will decrease the&#xD;
      fibrogenic stimuli leading to myelofibrosis and concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation&#xD;
      and restore normal hematopoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first in human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib trial of AVID200. Patients must&#xD;
      have intermediate-2 or higher primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-essential thrombocythemia or&#xD;
      polycythemia-vera related MF (Post ET/PV MF). This study will enroll up to 24 patients.&#xD;
      AVID200 is delivered by IV infusion on day 1 of each 3 week cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib trial of AVID200. To date,&#xD;
      there is no therapy for MF evaluated in the clinic that clearly demonstrates the ability to&#xD;
      target the malignant HSC and result in effective and reproducible bone marrow morphologic,&#xD;
      cytogenetic and molecular responses. Medicinal therapies that result in disease course&#xD;
      modification are urgently needed in this chronic and progressive myeloid malignancy. TGF-β&#xD;
      likely plays a dual role in promoting myelofibrosis and myeloproliferation, both of which are&#xD;
      the bone marrow morphologic hallmark of MF. The study team proposes that inhibiting the TGF-β&#xD;
      signaling pathway in MF will decrease the fibrogenic stimuli leading to myelofibrosis and&#xD;
      concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation and restore normal hematopoiesis. AVID200 is a&#xD;
      fusion protein containing TGF-β receptor ectodomains fused to a human Fc IgG domain. AVID200&#xD;
      is a potent TGFβ trap with antibody-like properties which has pM potency against two of the&#xD;
      three TGFβ ligands, TGFβ1 and β3.&#xD;
