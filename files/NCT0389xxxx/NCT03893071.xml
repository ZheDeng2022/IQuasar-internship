  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to treatment for NPC-1 after&#xD;
      participation and completion of the Phase I trial CTD-TCNPC-101, when administered at doses&#xD;
      of 1500 mg/kg and 2500 mg/kg by slow IV infusion over a period of 8 to 9 hours every two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study of intravenous HP-β-CD (administered as Trappsol®&#xD;
      Cyclo(TM)) in patients with NPC-1 to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy by providing&#xD;
      continued access to treatment following completion of study CTD-TCNPC-101. Patients will&#xD;
      receive medication at their home or local site under the supervision of a home nurse&#xD;
      professional or at the parent site under the supervision of the site principal investigator.&#xD;
      Patients will visit the parent site for safety and efficacy evaluations after receiving&#xD;
      treatment for 3 months in the extension protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, visits to the parent site will be every 6 months until cessation. The study will&#xD;
      continue until Trappsol® Cyclo (TM) becomes commercially available or study/site/patient&#xD;
      discontinuation. All patients who complete study CTD-TCNCP-101 and pass the screening&#xD;
      criteria will be eligible for this study. The study will be directed from parent site in the&#xD;
      US. Vital signs, AEs Adverse Events (AEs) and concomitant meds will be recorded by the home&#xD;
      nurse professional or deputy at the local site and reported immediately to the parent site&#xD;
      for entry into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and reporting to the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For logistical reasons home infusions will be permitted as long as AEs, infusion details and&#xD;
      concomitants medications are reported directly to the parent site by an authorised deputy&#xD;
      according to local guidelines. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) consisting of an independent&#xD;
      advisor, the medical monitor, and the principal investigator will be established to review&#xD;
      AEs and laboratory data throughout the study.&#xD;
