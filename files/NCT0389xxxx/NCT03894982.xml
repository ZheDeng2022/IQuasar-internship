      I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis: The Family Learning on Asthma Topics (F.L.O.A.T) in the form of a a group&#xD;
           teaching environment for family education stemming from standardized education materials&#xD;
           on asthma, created and taught by nationally certified asthma educators will promote&#xD;
           optimal asthma knowledge, management and quality of life among the individuals with&#xD;
           asthma and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 1: To determine if the availability of educational services outside of regular&#xD;
           clinic hours or admission status could improve asthma outcomes and decrease unnecessary&#xD;
           medical utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim 2: By providing small-group learning environments for families, the investigators&#xD;
           aim to encourage families to learn from each other's experiences and to decrease stigma&#xD;
           around the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent improvements in treatment and the ongoing research in better understanding of&#xD;
      the disease, emergency room visits and hospitalization rates for asthma remain high. The&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data reports that at a national&#xD;
      level, health care use for emergency department services for asthma was 1.6 million in 2013,&#xD;
      and that of 439,435 hospital admissions for asthma 136,669 or 31% are for children below the&#xD;
      age of 18 years of age. The annual cost of asthma on the U.S. economy equates to more than&#xD;
      $80 billion in medical expenses, including days missed from school, work and even death.&#xD;
      Nurmagambetov, et.al. in their study state that the &quot;combined costs of medical care,&#xD;
      mortality, and absenteeism render the total cost of asthma a substantial and serious economic&#xD;
      burden on society. These findings highlight the critical need to support and further&#xD;
      strengthen asthma control strategies through increased provision of guideline-based care,&#xD;
      improvements in self-management, and reduction of environmental asthma triggers to reduce ER&#xD;
      visits, hospitalizations, absenteeism, and mortality&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BÃ¤uerle et al. used a prospective single-center controlled trial to show that by providing&#xD;
      motivating and patient-oriented didactics on asthma, there is a statistically significant&#xD;
      increase in asthma health outcomes and that asthma control can be improved by education&#xD;
      measures. Although it is a key component of all international asthma guidelines, education in&#xD;
      self-management is still insufficiently available in primary care settings. In the ambulatory&#xD;
      setting, there are some families that require more extensive education and time is limited in&#xD;
      a usual care appointment to address all their specific asthma needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing patient education by an experienced asthma educator is an important step in&#xD;
      supporting patients and families as they are diagnosed with asthma and as they adapt to life&#xD;
      with a chronic condition. Educating families about the nature of the disease, triggers,&#xD;
      identification of early signs and symptoms, principles of treatment, and asthma management&#xD;
      can reduce children's use of acute care services. According to Srof et al., asthma management&#xD;
      education programs should be connected to the chronic illness management within the fabric of&#xD;
      the family system. The paradigm of group education supports engagement, promoting&#xD;
      communication among all participants including facilitator to enhance a social construct for&#xD;
      validating personal experiences, empowering caregivers, and solving asthma management&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Outcome Measure(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and systemic steroid use for each child 12&#xD;
      months after completing the three, group classroom educational sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of Population to be Enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will enroll legal guardians and or primary caregiver (18 years and&#xD;
           older) of children 4-17 years of age along with those children/adolescents who have a&#xD;
           diagnosis of asthma, and have documented poor control as evidenced by requiring two or&#xD;
           more systemic steroids, one or more hospitalizations and/or two or more ED visits due to&#xD;
           asthma in the 12 months prior to the asthma clinic or hospital visit. Patients and&#xD;
           caregivers will be English or Spanish speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design and Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients and caregivers will be recruited from the Pulmonary outpatient clinic and&#xD;
           inpatient services at Children's Hospital Colorado. Patients will also be referred to&#xD;
           the Family Learning on Asthma Topic (F.L.O.A.T) program by health care providers&#xD;
           participating in these clinics/inpatient service. Children will be: 1) 4-17 years age,&#xD;
           2) have poor evidence of asthma control based on &gt; 2 systemic steroid courses; &gt; 2&#xD;
           Emergency Room visits; and &gt;1 hospitalization for asthma exacerbation in the preceding&#xD;
           12 months. The investigators anticipate to enroll 75 patients and enrollment to begin in&#xD;
           the Spring 2019 through the Spring 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Family Learning on Asthma Topics classes will aim to emphasize, encourage, and support&#xD;
           teaching methods that include standardized instructions. There will be three topics&#xD;
           lasting approximately 45 minutes: General Asthma Knowledge; Asthma Triggers,&#xD;
           Medications, and Self-Management. These topics were chosen based on the EPR-3 guideline&#xD;
           recommendations to ensure the continuity of messaging. Each class size will be&#xD;
           approximately 8 persons and will be taught by a Certified Asthma Educator (AE-C) and&#xD;
           will be held in the Family Learning Center at the Children's Hospital Colorado. Classes&#xD;
           will be taught in both English and Spanish. An in person Spanish asthma educator will be&#xD;
           available to help teach the classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The materials used for each class were created by the CHCO Health Literacy Team in&#xD;
           collaboration with Asthma Educator Certified members of the Breathing Institute to&#xD;
           ensure that evidence-based information will be communicated effectively to patients and&#xD;
           families. Instead of a lecture style course, each class will facilitate interactive&#xD;
           learning for patients and families to help them prepare for real life problem-solving&#xD;
           and to promote self-awareness regarding medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient and families enrolled will be notified of the class schedule and receive&#xD;
           reminders 1 week and the day before each of their classes either through email, phone&#xD;
           call and or text messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be a general asthma knowledge questionnaire consisting of 12 questions and&#xD;
           the standardized Asthma Control Test (ACT) that consists of 7 standardized questions,&#xD;
           one for children 4 - 11 years of age and one for children 12 years and older, that&#xD;
           participants will fill out at the start of their first class. After each class, there&#xD;
           will be 4 questions to be answered regarding their understanding of that class. Handouts&#xD;
           and visuals will be available in English and Spanish pertaining to information about&#xD;
           that class. Other class materials will include a folder to keep their handouts in and&#xD;
           paper and pencils for note taking. Peak flow meters and their Asthma Action Plans will&#xD;
           also be provided. At the completion of the class series there will be a satisfaction&#xD;
           survey, participants will fill out anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Twelve months following the completion of the class series, the investigators will be&#xD;
           conducting a chart review gathering data on frequency of emergency room visits,&#xD;
           hospitalizations and systemic steroid use for asthma exacerbations along with any&#xD;
           routine follow up visits for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be through pre and post class questionnaires, Asthma Control Test (ACT),&#xD;
      validated Inhaler Technique Assessment Tool (iDAT), and demographic information filled out by&#xD;
      the families and noted in their EMR (EPIC). Information about participant's asthma care&#xD;
      utilization and systemic steroid use will be obtained through EMR/EPIC chart review, 12&#xD;
      months prior to enrollment and 12 months post last completed class. All information will be&#xD;
      entered in to a secure REDCap data base and paper copies will be kept in the locked research&#xD;
      cabinet of study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Potential Scientific Problems: The investigators do not anticipate any scientific problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion requirements will be defined through the electronic medical record based on&#xD;
      inclusion requirements by either the outpatient pulmonary team or inpatient asthma education&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment the following information will be placed into RedCap (HIPPA compliant&#xD;
      database) from the EMR: Childs name, DOB, Race, Ethnicity, Cell phone number, Email, Zip&#xD;
      Code, Sex, Preferred language (caregiver), Pulmonary or Allergy specialist seen within the&#xD;
      previous year, Payer, Hospital visits (ED and hospital visits) 12 months prior to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right after enrollment a pre-knowledge base survey of 12 questions and asthma control survey&#xD;
      of 7 questions will be sent via RedCap to caregivers defined phone and email. The data will&#xD;
      be collected electronically and stored in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 4-month study period, every week an administrative support person will pull&#xD;
      the child's name, caregivers name, designated contact phone number, and email from RedCap&#xD;
      databased to send a text, email, and phone call reminders of upcoming classes and asking the&#xD;
      caregiver to reply electronically if they are planning on attending. The administrative&#xD;
      assistant will review the reply's and notify the educators of the number of class attendees&#xD;
      and their names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completing each of the three classes the instructor will ask for the administrative&#xD;
      assistant to send a post knowledge bases survey of 4 questions out of RedCap to the primary&#xD;
      caregiver. The electronic responses will be electronically entered into RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the 3 classes and/or 4months the administrative assistant will send a&#xD;
      post-knowledge survey consisting of 12 questions, an asthma control test survey of 7&#xD;
      questions, and a satisfaction survey to the primary caregiver. The electronic responses will&#xD;
      be entered into RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each quarter the overview of pre-knowledge base survey results, post-knowledge survey results&#xD;
      and satisfaction survey will be reviewed by the team members to evaluate if any changes need&#xD;
      to be made to the education curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child specific data will be reviewed 12 months after completion of the classes and/or study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By conducting this group focused asthma education series for high risk asthmatics and their&#xD;
      care givers, the investigators anticipate improved knowledge along with retention of&#xD;
      knowledge gained through these classes thereby reducing exacerbations, and need for acute&#xD;
      care interventions. Group centered learning will enhance opportunities to learn from others&#xD;
      who may have similar experiences and will generate discussion and new skills and ideas.&#xD;

    <description>Reviewing asthma is a lung disease. There is no cure, but asthma can be well controlled so that your child can be healthy and join in all their favorite activities.&#xD;
Asthma causes the airways (breathing tubes in the lungs) to get smaller, making it hard to breathe.Common symptoms of asthma are coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and trouble breathing.&#xD;
These symptoms are ongoing and get better with asthma medicines.</description>
