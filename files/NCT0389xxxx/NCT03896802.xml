      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome defined by the association&#xD;
      of an acute onset of hypoxaemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates following a trigger&#xD;
      insult; it is characterized by inflammation of the pulmonary tissue, with subsequent&#xD;
      development of non-cardiogenic edema. The extent of edema may be such that the weight of the&#xD;
      lung may increase up to 2-3 times its original weight. As a consequence, the lung tends to&#xD;
      collapse on itself, more so in the dependent areas, i.e. the posterior/dorsal areas when the&#xD;
      patient in lying supine, with the consequent development of zones of atelectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These areas, when perfused, are the main cause for the development of the severe form of&#xD;
      hypoxemia commonly seen in this condition. Hypoxemia, if severe enough, may bring by itself&#xD;
      to the death of the patient. It has to be noted that, despite the advances in the management&#xD;
      of critically ill patients, mortality attributable to ARDS currently is about 50%, with a&#xD;
      range between 30-70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been reported ever since the first&#xD;
      description of the syndrome, as a tool to manage and correct hypoxemia. PEEP has thus been&#xD;
      used for 40 years, and is an essential part of the management of the syndrome. While the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PEEP in improving the oxygenation of the wide part of critically ill&#xD;
      patients with ARDS it is out of doubt, its efficacy with respect to outcomes such as&#xD;
      mortality has not, so far, been demonstrated. The question is then still open with regards to&#xD;
      the setting of an optimal level of PEEP in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, ARDS is associated with the development of hemodynamic instability and shock, to&#xD;
      the extent that up to 2/3 of patients suffering from the syndrome require the infusion of&#xD;
      catecholamines or show signs of hypoperfusion; circulatory failure seems to be the factor&#xD;
      more strongly associated to mortality in these patients, and the strength of the association&#xD;
      is higher compared to that of the degree of hypoxemia. In ARDS shock is secondary to three&#xD;
      main factors: 1) acute cor pulmonale due to pulmonary hypertension secondary to microvascular&#xD;
      occlusion by thrombi or arteriolar remodeling and/or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; 2)&#xD;
      the deleterious hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation, especially on right cardiac&#xD;
      function; and 3) the possible development of septic myocardial depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and it is associated with poor&#xD;
      outcomes. An increasing body of evidence points to the existence of deleterious interactions&#xD;
      between kidney and lung dysfunctions in a vicious cross-talk. Several studies seem to suggest&#xD;
      that mechanical ventilation and ARDS may have adverse effects on kidney function via three&#xD;
      main mechanisms: 1) positive-pressure ventilation may lead to a reduction in cardiac output&#xD;
      and an increase central venous pressure, thereby diminishing renal blood flow, free water&#xD;
      clearance, and the glomerular filtration rate; 2) changes in arterial blood oxygen (O2) or&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CO2) may influence renal vascular resistance, renal perfusion, or diuresis;&#xD;
      and, finally, 3) emerging data suggest that ventilator-induced lung injury may not only&#xD;
      affect the lung, but may also lead to further systemic inflammation via the systemic release&#xD;
      of inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the hemodynamic effect of PEEP depends on how much of the positive pressure applied&#xD;
      to the alveoli is transmitted to the mediastinal structures (heart and big vessels), and the&#xD;
      effect on renal function depends on how much this interferes with renal hemodynamic. The&#xD;
      transmission of airway pressure, in turn, depends on the mechanical characteristics of the&#xD;
      lung and the chest wall, which are known to be variably and unpredictably affected in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question of this research project deals with the hemodynamic impact of PEEP in&#xD;
      patients with ARDS, in terms of effects on the cardiocirculatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation The hemodynamic effects of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation are mainly secondary to cyclic oscillations in pleural pressure (Ppl) and&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Variations in pleural pressure mainly interfere with inflow of&#xD;
      blood into the right ventricle, and with ejection of blood from the left ventricle. On the&#xD;
      other side, variations in transpulmonary pressure mainly affect the inflow of blood into the&#xD;
      left ventricle and ejection of blood from the right ventricle. While the large vessels of&#xD;
      systemic circulation are surrounded by the constant atmospheric pressure, central vessels of&#xD;
      the pulmonary circulation are surrounded by pleural pressure, which in turn may significantly&#xD;
      vary compared to atmospheric pressure during the whole respiratory cycle. Positive-pressure&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation exerts an effect which is opposed to the physiologic inspiratory&#xD;
      negativisation of pleural pressure. Indeed, the increase in pleural pressure secondary to&#xD;
      positive airway pressure reduces left ventricular afterload, while at the same time it&#xD;
      reduces right ventricular preload. Since the normal pressure gradient which drives blood from&#xD;
      periphery to the right heart lies in the range of 4-8 mmHg, even small increases in pleural&#xD;
      pressure may have a significant impact on venous return. Moreover, the presence of PEEP has a&#xD;
      hemodynamic effect during the whole respiratory cycle. As a rule of thumb, it is generally&#xD;
      estimated that up to about 50% of the variation in airway pressure is transmitted as a&#xD;
      variation in pleural pressure in patients with normally functioning lungs. This effect is&#xD;
      however likely reduced in case of an increased lung elastance (i.e. the presence of stiff&#xD;
      lungs, as in patients with ARDS), given that a reduced amount of airway pressure is&#xD;
      transmitted at the pleural level. However, this depends on the ratio between lung elastance&#xD;
      and respiratory system elastance, which may vary widely in ARDS. Moreover, as the right&#xD;
      ventricle generally displays a high level of compliance despite a limited myocardial&#xD;
      thickness and a reduced contractile force, this may be more affected from increments in&#xD;
      afterload rather than by variations in preload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, the increase in mean airway pressure as a consequence of the application&#xD;
      of PEEP leads to an increase in the size of the lung (increase in end-expiratory lung&#xD;
      volume), mainly through the recruitment of previously closed and derecruited zones. However,&#xD;
      the application of PEEP may also lead to overdistention of already open and ventilated&#xD;
      pulmonary units, leading to a certain degree of vascular occlusion of the critical closing&#xD;
      pressure of those vessels is reached and overcome (as in the case of West zones I and II, in&#xD;
      which alveolar pressure in higher than arterial and venous pulmonary pressure, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic effect of PEEP might then be different, as a function of the amount of&#xD;
      pulmonary units that can be recruited. In conclusion, the knowledge of the effect on the&#xD;
      cardiocirculatory system of the application of a high or low level of PEEP may require the&#xD;
      measure or at least an estimate of the potential for lung recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement and estimate of the potential for lung recruitment The gold standard for the&#xD;
      measurement of the potential for lung recruitment is represented by pulmonary CT scan. This&#xD;
      technique has been used together with quantitative analysis of regional and global lung&#xD;
      aeration by our group since 1987 for the analysis of parenchymal response to PEEP in patients&#xD;
      with ARDS. An estimate of the potential for lung recruitment may be inferred at the bedside&#xD;
      by the assessment of the effect of PEEP on the level of oxygenation, physiologic dead-space&#xD;
      and partitioned lung compliance, to be able to differentiate recruitment from overdistention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis The main hypothesis behind the present research project is that critically&#xD;
      ill patients with ARDS and an elevated potential for lung recruitment will be less affected&#xD;
      by the hemodynamic effects of PEEP than patients with a lower potential for lung recruitment.&#xD;
      If this hypothesis was to be confirmed, the application of PEEP would be less troublesome, at&#xD;
      least for the concerns for the hemodynamic compromise, in patients with ARDS and a higher&#xD;
      potential for lung recruitment. This issue has so far never been investigated, and the&#xD;
      present research might significantly extend our knowledge on the topic.&#xD;
