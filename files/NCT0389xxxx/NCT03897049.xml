      The study is a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial to be conducted with 450 trans women&#xD;
      to assess the effectiveness of the Trans Women Connected mobile app. Those in the treatment&#xD;
      arm will be provided with the Trans Women Connected app, to be downloaded to their own&#xD;
      device, and asked to use it during a three month period. Those in the control arm will be&#xD;
      asked to download a general health app and use it during the same three-month period.&#xD;
      Participants will complete brief online surveys at baseline, immediately following the&#xD;
      app-use period, and at 3- and 6-months following the conclusion of the app-use period. The&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up assessments will collect data on demographic characteristics, measures&#xD;
      related to our primary and secondary outcomes, and psychosocial measures. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are self-reported STI/HIV testing and sex without a condom, with secondary measures&#xD;
      including sexual risk behaviors, health care visits, perceived social support/connectedness,&#xD;
      PrEP use, self-efficacy in negotiation/communication, and comfort with gender identity and&#xD;
      appearance. In addition, process data, such as forum content, and usage data will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 450 trans women to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the Trans Women Connected mobile app. The Trans Women Connected&#xD;
      intervention will address the unique needs of transgender women and the lack of&#xD;
      evidence-based, transgender-specific HIV prevention. It is a mobile app delivered sexual&#xD;
      health promotion program that engages transgender women through a strengths-based approach to&#xD;
      HIV prevention and sexual health that uses the power of social networks to identify and&#xD;
      encourage protective factors that support the health of transgender women. This approach&#xD;
      recognizes the social and structural barriers that transgender women face. In the context of&#xD;
      these barriers, which include stigma and discrimination in a number of interconnected&#xD;
      spheres, individually-focused behavioral interventions are insufficient. This intervention&#xD;
      takes a more comprehensive approach that intentionally targets community strengths and&#xD;
      challenges. The mobile app will include more than 30 interactive activities including&#xD;
      resource maps, PrEP/PEP content, and communication forums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible, participants will be required to self-identify as transgender women; report&#xD;
      having had 2 or more sexual partners in the past 90 days with at least one of those partners&#xD;
      having a penis; be age 18-49 at baseline; own a smartphone; and reside in any state in the&#xD;
      United States. Those in the treatment arm will be provided with the Trans Women Connected&#xD;
      app, to be downloaded to their own device, and asked to use it during a three-month period.&#xD;
      Those in the control arm will be asked to download a general health app and use it during the&#xD;
      same three-month period. Participants will complete brief online surveys at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately following the app-use period, and at 3- and 6-months following the conclusion of&#xD;
      the app-use period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using a variety of methods, including: 1) Regional transwomen&#xD;
      recruitment/retention specialists who are responsible for facilitating recruitment in their&#xD;
      regions, addressing study questions, and maintaining connections with each participant to&#xD;
      support study engagement; 2) Organizations. Organizations from across the U.S., at least one&#xD;
      per state, that serve transgender women will be approached to help recruit participants&#xD;
      through social media and in-person. 3) Google Adwords. Placing study advertisements on Google&#xD;
      based on keyword for participant recruitment has been shown to be effective. 4) Social Media&#xD;
      Advertising including targeted advertising on social media sites (Facebook/Instagram) and&#xD;
      sponsoring study posts with social media influencers in the Transwomen community. Social&#xD;
      media advertising has been shown to be favorable in terms of its cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      usability, and reach, especially with hard-to-reach populations, young adults and LGBT&#xD;
      populations. 5) Participant Recruitment. Once recruited and successfully entered into the&#xD;
      study each participant will receive three digital referral coupons and each coupon will&#xD;
      generate $15 for a successfully screened participant. Participants will complete 4 web-based&#xD;
      surveys and will receive $20 for baseline survey, $20 for an immediate posttest, $40 at&#xD;
      3-month follow up, $60 at final 6-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Because the evaluation is using cluster randomization, the participants will&#xD;
      be randomized by cluster. There will be 150 seeds and the first person in a cluster. Each&#xD;
      will be given 3 referral coupons. Upon completing a baseline survey the seed will be&#xD;
      randomized into treatment or control. Any participant using a referral coupon will be placed&#xD;
      in the same condition as the initial seed with which they are associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation. After randomization, participants in the treatment group, will be granted&#xD;
      access to download and install the Trans Women Connected mobile app. They will have three&#xD;
      months to use the program. Participants will agree to complete core activities and use the&#xD;
      app as often as they can with a target of two times per week. Participants can use the app as&#xD;
      often as they want. Those in the control group will download and install a general health app&#xD;
      that includes some sexual health content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Participants will be surveyed at 4 time points. 1) before randomization, 2)&#xD;
      after using the mobile app for 3 months, 3) three months after completion of the&#xD;
      intervention, and 4) six months after completion of the intervention. Surveys will be&#xD;
      completed online via Survey Gizmo through emailed or texted links. All survey data will be&#xD;
      transferred to SPSS for analysis. Data will also be collected through the app. This includes&#xD;
      usage data, such as what activities participants used and for how long, and process data,&#xD;
      which includes content on the communication forum, text answers in the app, and visual&#xD;
      content such as vision boards. Participants will receive an incentive of $20 for the baseline&#xD;
      and immediate post-intervention survey, $40 for the 3-month follow up survey, and $60 for the&#xD;
      6 month follow up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses. Primary Hypotheses 1 (representing sexual health risk reduction through&#xD;
      engagement in care 1) Women in the intervention group will report more STI testing (higher&#xD;
      rates of STI testing in the prior 90 days) than the comparison group. Primary Hypotheses 2,&#xD;
      women in the intervention group will report fewer acts of receptive condomless anal&#xD;
      intercourse or condomless vaginal intercourse. Secondary Hypotheses (representing other&#xD;
      important sexual health risk, and psychosocial outcomes):1) Participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will report reduced sexual risk taking including fewer acts of receptive condomless&#xD;
      anal intercourse or condomless vaginal intercourse; greater use of condom use at last&#xD;
      intercourse (receptive anal or vaginal); and increased use of PrEP for those that are HIV- 2)&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will engage more with proactive health care and report&#xD;
      more health care visits. 3) Participants in the treatment group will report more&#xD;
      connectedness with other transgender women, including perceived social support and engagement&#xD;
      with a mentor. 4) Participants in the intervention group will report greater efficacy in&#xD;
      having safer sex and in communication both with partners and health care workers. 5) Those in&#xD;
      the treatment group will have greater acceptance of their gender identity/comfort with gender&#xD;
      identity.&#xD;
