  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and dose-response of GSK2831781 in&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. The study consists of a&#xD;
      5-week screening window, 10-week Induction Phase, 30-week double-blind Extended Treatment&#xD;
      Phase (ETP) with 42-week Follow-Up Phase. Non-Responders identified following the Week 10&#xD;
      assessment will be allocated to open label treatment, consisting of Induction (Weeks 12 to&#xD;
      22), an Open label ETP (Weeks 22 to 42) and a follow-Up to Week 54.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in endoscopic assessment of mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis will be determined by adapted Mayo endoscopic score on a scale ranging from 0 (Normal or inactive disease) to 3 (Severe disease or spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). The Adapted Mayo Score is a 9-point scoring system where disease is evaluated based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic appearance (with any friability associated with an endoscopic score of 2 or 3). UCEIS will be used as an additional tool to assess disease activity based on endoscopic vascular pattern, bleeding, erosions and ulcerations. Each item has 3 or 4 levels of severity and is given a score. The scores for each individual item are combined into a total score ranging from 0 to 8. A higher score indicates increased endoscopic severity of Ulcerative Colitis.</description>

             the Medical Monitor's discretion). b) A history of opportunistic infections within 1&#xD;
             year of screening (e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii, aspergillosis or Cytomegalovirus&#xD;
             colitis). This does not include infections that may occur in immunocompetent&#xD;
             individuals, such as fungal nail infections or vaginal candidiasis, unless it is of an&#xD;
             unusual severity or recurrent nature. c) Recurrent or chronic infection or other&#xD;
             active infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might cause this study to&#xD;
             be detrimental to the participant. d) Symptomatic herpes zoster within 3 months prior&#xD;
             to screening. e) History of tuberculosis (active or latent), irrespective of treatment&#xD;
             status. f) A positive diagnostic tuberculosis test at screening (defined as a positive&#xD;
             QuantiFERON test). In cases where the QuantiFERON test is indeterminate, the&#xD;
             participant may have the test repeated once and if their second test is negative they&#xD;
             will be eligible. In the event a second test is also indeterminate, the investigator&#xD;
             has the option to undertake Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) testing. If the PPD&#xD;
             reaction is less than (&lt;) 5 millimeter (mm), then the participant is eligible. If the&#xD;
             reaction is &gt;= 5mm, or PPD testing is not undertaken, the participant is not eligible.&#xD;
             g) Positive Clostridium difficile toxin test during screening. However, rescreening&#xD;
             can be undertaken following successful treatment.&#xD;
