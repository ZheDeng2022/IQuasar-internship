      The purpose of this single center randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate whether&#xD;
      outpatient arthroplasty surgery in a dedicated daycare facility will improve discharge on day&#xD;
      of surgery, as opposed to surgery followed by subsequent stay in the ward and also same day&#xD;
      discharge, without compromizing safety and outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction of fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has&#xD;
      led to a decrease in length of stay without compromising patient safety and clinical outcome&#xD;
      . In recent years outpatient THA and TKA has gained popularity, especially as major focus is&#xD;
      placed on reducing cost and increasing efficiency in all medical treatments . Studies have&#xD;
      shown outpatient arthroplasty to be feasible both for THA and TKA patients , with up to 70%&#xD;
      of unselected patients being potentially eligible for outpatient surgery. Various results are&#xD;
      published on success rate of discharged patients on the day of surgery, ranging from 25% to&#xD;
      99% , depending on patient selection and logistic setup. While the majority of published&#xD;
      studies utilizes a modern fast-track setup with early mobilization and multimodal pain&#xD;
      treatment, the optimal logistic setup remains unknown.&#xD;

    <description>All THA's are performed using a standard posterolateral approach with simple posterior soft-tissue repair. No infiltration anesthesia (LIA) is used in THA's. All TKA's are performed with a standard medial parapatellar approach without the use of tourniquet. Physiotherapy is started as soon as possible after surgery in the dedicated day care facility. Time till first mobilization is recorded as is total time mobilized supervised by a physiotherapist before discharge.&#xD;
Patients are discharged if fulfilling the discharge criteria before 8 pm. Number of hours spent in hospital in total is recorded.</description>
