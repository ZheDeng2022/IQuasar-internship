  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label, two stage study will be conducted in several medical centers&#xD;
      around Taiwan. Stage one determine safety and tolerability in patients with HCC, and stage&#xD;
      two assess anti-tumor activities of GT90001 in combination with nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic HCC. Subjects who fulfill all the entry criteria and have written informed consent&#xD;
      will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on published and first-hand experience with the safety and tolerability of both GT90001&#xD;
      and nivolumab, the proposed dose is GT90001 7 mg/kg in combination with nivolumb 3 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Nivolumab will first be administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes, then 30 minutes&#xD;
      later, give GT90001 intravenous infusion for 1 hour. All participants will receive GT90001 +&#xD;
      Nivolumab until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or loss of clinical benefit as&#xD;
      determined by the investigator.The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of GT90001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with advanced and or&#xD;
      metastatic HCC who were progressed on or were intolerant of first-line and/or second-line&#xD;
      systemic therapy. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and&#xD;
      the PK profile of this combination therapy.&#xD;
