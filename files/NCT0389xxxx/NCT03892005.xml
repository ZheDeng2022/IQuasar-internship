    <measure>Functional outcome based on Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Harris Hip Score is a clinician-based outcome measure consisting of 4 subscales. The first is pain, which measures pain severity (44 points); function, which is made up of daily activities and gait (47 points); the absence of deformity, which is a subscale that measures hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, leg length discrepancy and range of motion measures.(4 points), and range of motion (5 points). The scores range from 0-100 with higher scores representing less dysfunction and better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life based on EQ-5D questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions, namely mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D-3L version was used in the study. Each dimension has 3 responses recording 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). The responses to the EQ-5D dimensions are used to obtain a single EQ-5D index value where 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. The questionnaire also includes a vertical, visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) for the respondents to record their self-rated health where the 2 extreme end of the scale are labelled as 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' respectively.</description>
