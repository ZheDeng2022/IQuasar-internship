  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule of CX-4945 when&#xD;
      administered orally twice daily for 28 consecutive days, in a 4-week (28 days) cycle, in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CX-4945, preliminary evidence of antitumor effect, and the effect of CX-4945&#xD;
      treatment on the Hh signaling pathway will also be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinomas require the hedgehog (Hh) pathway for growth. Hh binding relieves the&#xD;
      inhibitory effect of PTCH1 on Smoothened (SMO). Signal transduction by SMO then leads to the&#xD;
      activation and nuclear localization of GLI1 transcription factors and induction of Hh target&#xD;
      genes, many of which are involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Hedgehog&#xD;
      pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib6 and sonidegib phosphate, target the G-protein-coupled&#xD;
      receptor Smoothened (SMO) and are recommended as first-line treatment for advanced BCC or&#xD;
      mBCC by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. CK2 affects the terminal-most Hh signaling&#xD;
      components. Given the roles of CK2 on the terminal step of the hedgehog signaling pathway,&#xD;
      CK2 inhibition is unlikely to be overcome by downstream mutations within this pathway. These&#xD;
      data thus suggest an immediately practical application of CX-4945 in Hh-driven tumors and&#xD;
      possibly tumors resistant to SMO inhibitors.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed, written IRB-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men and women age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG Performance status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For patients with mBCC, histologic confirmation of distant BCC metastasis (e.g., lung,&#xD;
             liver, lymph nodes, or bone), with metastatic disease that is RECIST measurable using&#xD;
             CT or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
             Phase I Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             If a patient with locally advanced BCC also has a tumor that is not contiguous with&#xD;
             cutaneous BCC, e.g., regional lymph nodes (if confirmed on biopsy as BCC and RECIST&#xD;
             measurable), the patients should be considered as having mBCC and should be enrolled&#xD;
             in the mBCC cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For patients with locally advanced BCC, histologically confirmed disease with at least&#xD;
             one lesion that was 10 mm or more in at least 1 dimension by color photograph that is&#xD;
             considered to be inoperable or medical contraindication to surgery (see below), in the&#xD;
             opinion of a Mohs dermatologic surgeon, head and neck surgeon, or plastic surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acceptable medical contraindications to surgery include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. BCC that has recurred in the same location after two or more surgical procedures&#xD;
                  and curative resection is deemed unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Anticipated substantial morbidity and/or deformity from surgery (e.g., removal of&#xD;
                  all or part of a facial structure, such as nose, ear, eyelid, eye; or requirement&#xD;
                  for limb amputation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Other conditions considered to be medically contraindicating must be discussed&#xD;
                  with the Medical Monitor before enrolling the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For all patients, smoothened inhibitor must have been previously administered for&#xD;
             their locally advanced or metastatic BCC, unless smoothened inhibitor is inappropriate&#xD;
             (e.g., patient has received a smoothened inhibitor but became intolerant to the&#xD;
             therapy). For patients whose BCC has been treated with smoothened inhibitor, disease&#xD;
             must have progressed after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For patients with locally advanced BCC, radiotherapy must have been previously&#xD;
             administered for their locally advanced BCC, unless radiotherapy is contraindicated or&#xD;
             inappropriate (e.g., hypersensitivity to radiation due to genetic syndrome such as&#xD;
             Gorlin syndrome, limitations because of location of tumor, or cumulative prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy dose). For patients whose locally advanced BCC has been irradiated,&#xD;
             disease must have progressed after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4&#xD;
                  weeks) have elapsed between any major surgery and date of registration, and that&#xD;
                  wound healing has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  allowed (except for Smoothened inhibitors). There is no limit to the other prior&#xD;
                  therapies received&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have recovered (to baseline or ≤ grade 1) from all reversible toxicity&#xD;
             related to prior chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  For anti-cancer therapies with half-lives &gt; 8 days, a washout period of at&#xD;
                       least 28 days will be acceptable,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with nevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) may enroll in this study but must&#xD;
             meet the criteria for locally advanced or metastatic disease listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For patients with locally advanced BCC, willingness to consent to biopsy of tumor(s)&#xD;

             targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or photodynamic therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with multiple cutaneous BCCs at baseline that are not designated by&#xD;
                  the investigator as target lesions, treatment of these non-target BCCs with&#xD;
                  surgery may be permitted but must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to&#xD;

               -  For patients with locally advanced BCC whose target lesion(s) is/are inoperable&#xD;
                  at baseline but is/are later deemed potentially operable because of tumor&#xD;
                  response to CX-4945, surgery with curative intent may be permitted but must be&#xD;
                  discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to any surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of&#xD;
             the results of the study or renders the patient at high risk from treatment&#xD;
             complications&#xD;
