  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increased interest of animal-assisted interventions (AAI) can be observed within clinical&#xD;
      practice, even though it is still not entirely clear how the presence of an animal&#xD;
      contributes to the outcome of a treatment. One theory maintains that the presence of an&#xD;
      animal influences the relationship between health-provider and patient, which then in turn&#xD;
      affects the outcome of the treatment. To investigate this theory, this study will combine AAI&#xD;
      with a placebo intervention, as placebo interventions offer the basic form of intervention&#xD;
      working through relationship and expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the presence of a dog will be assessed with a standardized experimental heat&#xD;
      pain paradigm (TSA-II) in a randomized controlled trial in healthy participants (N=128).&#xD;
      After a baseline measurements of heat pain threshold and tolerance, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the following four conditions: a) analgesia-expectation, no dog&#xD;
      present, b) analgesia-expectation, dog present, c) no-expectation, no dog present and d)&#xD;
      no-expectation, dog present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dog will be introduced after randomization. Expectancy will be induced by a deceptive&#xD;
      cream which is said to helps against pain. Afterwards, posttreatment measurements will be&#xD;
      conducted and participants fill in questionnaires about their perceptions of the&#xD;
      experimenter.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon arrival, all participants will be asked to read the study information again and sign to&#xD;
      confirm their informed consent. They will also be asked to complete the sociodemographic data&#xD;
      (SDD) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experiment there will be three points of questionnaire-assessment. The following&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used: expectancy will be assessed with the Expectancy of Relief Scale.&#xD;
      Expectancy of Relief Scale is adapted to the scaling of the primary outcome. Expectancy has&#xD;
      been measured in previous studies. It should detect if participants expectancy changes after&#xD;
      the intervention phase. Further, it would also be interested to examine if the presence or&#xD;
      absence of a dog has an impact on expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, following each pain stimuli participants will be asked to complete two short&#xD;
      questions on pain intensity and unpleasantness. Pain intensity and unpleasantness are adapted&#xD;
      to the scaling of the primary outcome. Subjective pain intensity and unpleasantness are&#xD;
      commonly assessed pain dimensions in heat pain paradigm studies. Intensity entails the&#xD;
      cognitive dimensions of pain, whereas unpleasantness comprises the affective dimension of&#xD;
      pain. Also, after each pain stimuli participants will complete the Counselor Rating&#xD;
      Form-Short (CRF-S) to assess they perception of the experimenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pain measurement, there will be a final assessment, using the credibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the placebo analgesia expectation (CMQ; adapted Version of the Context Model&#xD;
      Questionnaire), as well as the CRF-S and a short questionnaire on participants attitude&#xD;
      towards dogs and pets (AAPL questionnaire). Study factors, dependent variables and schedule&#xD;
      of the study are represented in Tables 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting with the experimental procedures all participants will be introduced to the&#xD;
      TSA-II de-vice and the study procedure. All participants will be assigned to a baseline&#xD;
      assessment of heat tolerance and threshold. Participants will be randomized to the four&#xD;
      experimental conditions (see below) followed by experimentally induced pain using an&#xD;
      established and standardized heat pain paradigm: Heat stimuli will be administered to the&#xD;
      right volar forearm using a 30x 30-mm Peltier device (Medoc, Ramatishai, Israel; TSA-II)&#xD;
      placed at 2/3 of the distance from wrist to elbow. Heat pain threshold will be determined by&#xD;
      the methods of limits. Temperature will be increased from the baseline (32°C) at a rate of&#xD;
      0.5°C /s. Participants are instructed to press the button to determine the turning point from&#xD;
      perceiving warmth to the perception of pain. When the pain threshold has been reached, the&#xD;
      device will resume from its baseline (32 °C) with a rise of 0.5 °C/s. This procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated three times (Locher et al., 2017). Pain threshold will be defined as the average of&#xD;
      the three measurements. Pain tolerance will also be determined by the method of limits:&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to stop the increasing heat stimulus at the moment they cannot&#xD;
      stand the heat any longer. Three measurements will start at 32 °C, with a rise of 0.5 °C/s.&#xD;
      Heat tolerance will be defined as the average of the three measurements. Pain threshold will&#xD;
      always be measured prior to pain tolerance in order to minimize interference between pain&#xD;
      threshold and tolerance. After pain induction, participants will complete in the CMQ and the&#xD;
      CRF-S questionnaires to detect how they perceive the experimenter. All instructions will be&#xD;
      conveyed in a standardized manner to ensure that the participant-experimenter relationship is&#xD;
      comparable in terms of friendliness and attention across all four conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo condition (PL): Participants will receive verbal information that they are&#xD;
           receiving an analgesic cream (i.e. &quot;&quot;Antidolor, containing Lidocain &quot;), which has been&#xD;
           shown to produce significant pain reduction in previous clinical trials. However, they&#xD;
           will receive an inert cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Animal-assisted placebo condition (AAPL): Participants receive the same verbal&#xD;
           information as in the PL condition. Additionally, they will be told that a dog will be&#xD;
           present during the experiment to examine whether animals can be present during&#xD;
           experimental studies or if they are too big of a distraction. Prior to the pain&#xD;
           assessment, participants are allowed to greet the dog. The intensity of interaction will&#xD;
           be documented and be rated on a scale from 1-5 (1=very low degree of interaction, 5=very&#xD;
           high degree of interaction). During the experiment the dog will be lying in the room&#xD;
           with some distance to participants to avoid further physical interaction. The dog will&#xD;
           always be lying at the same spot. Therefore, the distance between participant and dog&#xD;
           will always be the same. However, participants will still be able to see the dog.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dog only condition (DO): Participants will be told that a dog will be present during the&#xD;
           experiment to examine whether animals can be present during experimental studies or if&#xD;
           they are too big of a distraction. Prior to the pain assessment, participants are&#xD;
           allowed to greet the dog. The intensity of interaction will be documented and be rated&#xD;
           on a scale from 1-5 (1=very low degree of interaction, 5=very high degree of&#xD;
           interaction). During the experiment the dog will be lying in the room with some distance&#xD;
           to participants to avoid further physical interaction. During the experiment the dog&#xD;
           will be lying in the room with some distance to participants to avoid further physical&#xD;
           interaction. The dog will always be lying at the same spot. Therefore, the distance&#xD;
           between participant and dog will always be the same. However, participants will still be&#xD;
           able to see the dog. After the introduction of the dog, participant will have the verbal&#xD;
           information that the applied cream only moisturizes the skin to allow accurate pain&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No Dog condition (ND): Participants will participant will have the verbal information&#xD;
           that the applied cream only moisturizes the skin to allow accurate pain measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, pain induction will then be performed for a second time (test phase)&#xD;
      and participants complete the CMQ, CRF-S and AAPL questionnaires. Finally, participants will&#xD;
      be fully debriefed about the real aims of the experiment (delayed informed consent). The&#xD;
      expected study duration will be 70 minutes.&#xD;
