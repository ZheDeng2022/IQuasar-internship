  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have previously shown that eating carbohydrates after protein or vegetables&#xD;
      resulted in reduced glucose and insulin excursions over 180 min in patients with T2DM and in&#xD;
      individuals with prediabetes as well. This is an open label, randomized controlled pilot&#xD;
      study to assess the efficacy of carbohydrate-last food order behavior in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      progression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive diet and lifestyle modifications have been shown to reduce the risk of progression&#xD;
      to T2DM in several randomized controlled trials. Key components of standard nutritional&#xD;
      counseling include reducing calorie intake and glycemic load. Sequential nutrient ingestion&#xD;
      is a novel strategy found to attenuate the glycemic effect of a meal. Investigators have&#xD;
      previously shown that ingestion of carbohydrates after protein or vegetables results in&#xD;
      reduced glucose and insulin excursions over 180 min in patients with T2DM. In addition,&#xD;
      investigators also found that levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin were more suppressed at&#xD;
      the end of 3 hours after a meal. Furthermore, investigators found that the glycemic effects&#xD;
      of food order apply to individuals with prediabetes as well. This study follows previous&#xD;
      research on nutrient order and seeks to determine the metabolic effects of this behavioral&#xD;
      intervention in the real world. The study will include two randomized groups who are&#xD;
      overweight or obese and are diagnosed with prediabetes. The control group will receive&#xD;
      standard nutritional counseling at the start of the study and no instructions to change food&#xD;
      order behavior. The intervention group will receive regularly scheduled food order counseling&#xD;
      over a period of 16 weeks in addition to standard nutritional counseling at baseline.&#xD;
      Anthropometric and metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity, will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at 16 weeks. The primary aim of this study is to determine the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects who achieve 15% or greater improvement in 2 hour glucose on OGTT at 16 weeks. If&#xD;
      shown to be effective, this data will inform the design of larger study focused on diabetes&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
