  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study to determine the reliability and validity of new tests of&#xD;
      orientation and balance, as well as to test the effects of a new treatment for visually&#xD;
      induced dizziness. Tests involve determining vertical alignment. The treatment is task-based&#xD;
      and involves focusing attention on internal body sensations to help improve the sense of&#xD;
      upright. Testing is done twice before and twice after treatment, which is provided&#xD;
      twice-weekly during a three-week period between testing. The total time participants are&#xD;
      involved in the study is approximately six weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a major concern for people living in countries all over the world. Tens of millions&#xD;
      of people who fall are seriously injured and hundreds of thousands of people who fall die&#xD;
      every year. People who are dizzy are far more likely to fall. The investigators are&#xD;
      particularly interested in working with people who have dizziness that is caused by watching&#xD;
      motion or looking at complex patterns (e.g. checkerboard patterns, walking through grocery&#xD;
      store aisles, riding in vehicles, or watching movies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of dizziness or vertigo is typically described as motion sickness or, more&#xD;
      specifically, visually-induced dizziness. This problem affects adults who are healthy and&#xD;
      adults who have a variety of health conditions. No diagnostic tests for this condition exist&#xD;
      at this time and the treatments currently being used may result in worsening dizziness for&#xD;
      some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New tests were created for orientation and balance, as well as a new treatment for&#xD;
      visually-induced dizziness. This is a preliminary study of the reliability and validity of&#xD;
      the tests we developed, as well as whether the new treatment created results in reduced&#xD;
      dizziness, improved balance, and changes in daily functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known whether the new tests of orientation and balance are better, worse, or the&#xD;
      same as existing tests in the ability to detect problems, nor is it known if the new&#xD;
      treatment technique is any better, worse, or the same as existing treatments for dizziness&#xD;
      and imbalance. It is hypothesized that the new tests will be accurate and able to detect&#xD;
      problems in impaired adults. Additionally, that the treatment will result in less dizziness,&#xD;
      better balance, and reduced risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to enroll a total of 30 people in this study, 15 who are healthy and 15 who have&#xD;
      visually-induced dizziness due to a vestibular (inner ear) problem. Each participant will&#xD;
      complete several questionnaires and tests of balance performance before and after undergoing&#xD;
      the treatment. Participants attend 8 visits over 6 weeks. Each study visit lasts&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visits 1 and 2, which is a double baseline phase, the reliability and validity of the&#xD;
      new testing procedures will be assessed. All participants will then enter the treatment phase&#xD;
      (visits 2 through 7) and will attend twice-weekly appointments for three consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      Following the treatment phase, participants will be re-assessed twice, immediately after&#xD;
      (visit 7) and one week after (visit 8) completing treatment. During this phase, the&#xD;
      short-term effectiveness of the treatment will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires that measure the intensity of visually-induced&#xD;
      dizziness, perceived handicap due to dizziness, and the impact of dizziness on daily&#xD;
      functioning. Performance measures include the ability to determine what is upright based on&#xD;
      the internal sense of gravity (verticality), standing upright, and walking-related balance&#xD;
      tasks. The verticality tests are performed while the participant is secured in a harness and&#xD;
      are either standing upright or tilted to the left or to the right. The testing task is to&#xD;
      determine upright based on using internal body sensations. The standing balance test is&#xD;
      performed on a platform that measures balance. The verticality tests and the standing balance&#xD;
      test are experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is task-based and is performed while the participant is supported in a harness&#xD;
      and wearing virtual reality goggles. During the treatment, participants are either standing&#xD;
      upright or tilted to the left or to the right. The treatment involves focusing attention on&#xD;
      internal body sensations to help determine whether an image that is presented in an otherwise&#xD;
      black virtual environment is aligned with gravity. Other visual and sound cues will be&#xD;
      eliminated to prevent the use of these cues from influencing decisions about what is upright.&#xD;
      As the participant becomes more successful at determining what is upright, the difficulty of&#xD;
      the treatment task is gradually increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants symptoms will be monitored throughout the testing and treatment. Participants&#xD;
      are given regular rest breaks and may request to rest at any time. Participation is voluntary&#xD;
      and may be discontinued at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate only mild and infrequent side effects related to testing and&#xD;
      treatment. The results of this study may influence how orientation and balance are assessed&#xD;
      and how visually-induced dizziness is treated.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Rod and Disk Test (RDT) Mean Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 7 (Week 4), and Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>An image of a rod will be shown in the central portion of the visual field. The surrounding virtual environment will be void. A batch of rod angles will be predetermined. This assessment will be completed using an Oculus Rift and without any reference to external visual cues. Only binocular testing will be completed. The average value for performance in each position will be used in data analysis. The mean of absolute value of the error in rod alignment measured in degrees for each body position tested will be used as the measurement variable for this outcome. Mean performance in this population is 0.39 (sd 0.8). Higher scores indicate subjective visual vertical alignment that is farther away from earth vertical.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multisensory Balance Evaluation (MBE) as measured by the Intersection Point Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 7 (Week 4), and Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>This test is designed to assess balance during quiet standing in different sensory conditions. Participants perform one trial (lasting 50 seconds) of each condition. All trials are performed while standing on a force plate with the feet in a self-selected, comfortable position. The force plate samples center of pressure and direction of ground reaction force. The visual environment is controlled using an Oculus Rift. The surface conditions are either non-compliant or compliant. The frequency-dependent height of the Intersection Point (IP) of the ground reaction force is the main outcome. The behavior and shape of the IP curvature will be studied in each test trial. The IP curvature for certain conditions will be compared versus others in order to assess the impact of manipulating specific sensory inputs on the behavior of the IP. The height of the IP at a specific frequency represents how stable a person is during a given test trial. Lower IP height suggests greater stability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Rod and Frame Test (RFT) Mean Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 7 (Week 4), and Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>An image of a rod will be projected inside a tilted frame within the central portion of the visual field. The surrounding virtual environment will be void. The frame will be tilted by +/- 20° in the frontal plane. A batch of rod angles will be predetermined. This assessment will be completed using an Oculus Rift and without reference to external visual cues. Only binocular testing will be completed. The average value for performance in each position will be used in data analysis. The mean of absolute value of the error in rod alignment measured in degrees for each body position tested will be used as the measurement variable for this outcome. Mean performance in this population is 6.51 (sd 7.8). Higher values indicate greater deviations of perceived vertical from earth vertical.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vision-related Dizziness Questionnaire (VRDQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 7 (Week 4), and Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The VRDQ is used to quantify vision-related dizziness. This outcome measure consists of 25 questions comprising two subscales [frequency and severity of symptoms]. The maximum score for each sub-scale is 100 points. The total score is the average of both sub-scales. Higher scores represent greater frequency and severity of symptoms. Test-retest reliability for the VRDQ is well above the good performance level and convergent validity for the VRDQ was demonstrated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Spearman correlation coefficients are 0.75 between the DHI and VRDQ frequency scale and 0.76 between the DHI and VRDQ severity scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Week 1), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 7 (Week 4), and Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI is used to assess the severity of self-perceived disability secondary to dizziness. The tool is comprised of 25 questions which are score as yes = 4 points, sometimes = 2 points, and no = 0 points. The total score has a range of 0 to 100 points. The reliability and validity of the DHI have been established.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefits Questionnaire (VRBQ) Total Score at the end of the trial</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 8 (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The VRBQ was developed to assess outcomes from vestibular rehabilitation. The 22 questions are based on a literature review, participant interviews, and items from other measures. These questions are divided into three sub-scales: dizziness and anxiety (6), motion provoked dizziness (5), and quality of life (11). The total score ranges from 0%-100% and scores &gt; 0% indicate the presence of symptoms, functional loss, or decreased quality of life. See http://www.isvr.soton.ac.uk/audiology/vrbq.htm for more information regarding the scoring methodology. It has been validated against other measures. The VRBQ is designed to measure the difference between the participant's current state of symptoms and quality of life compared to a state that is normal for the individual.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sensory re-weighting</intervention_name>
    <description>During training, sensory re-weighting is driven by priming upregulation of somatosensory cues. Two rounds of training, each lasting 15 minutes and block-randomized in sets of 10 trials, are conducted per training visit. In each training trial, participants must determine the direction of gravity and then indicate if the rod being displayed is aligned with gravity or if it needs to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise for that to be so. Participants will be instructed to pay attention to what they feel from their feet, legs, and gut during training and to use that pressure, stretch, movement, and muscle tension feedback to help them sense gravity. Immediate auditory and non-orienting, visual feedback is provided after each trial. A staircase method is used to adapt the level of difficulty based on response accuracy. After two consecutive correct responses, the difficulty increases. After each incorrect response, the difficulty decreases. This process is repeated in each round.</description>
