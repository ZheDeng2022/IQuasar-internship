  <brief_title>A Study to Test Different Doses of BI 764532 in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer and Other Neuroendocrine Tumours That Are Positive for Delta-Like Ligand 3 (DLL3).</brief_title>
  <official_title>A First -in Human Phase I, Non-randomized, Open-label, Multi-center Dose Escalation Trial of BI 764532 Administered by Repeated Intravenous Infusions in Patients With Small Cell Lung Carcinoma and Other Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Expressing DLL3</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) or the Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE)&#xD;
      and dosing regimen for further development of BI 764532. The MTDs will be defined based on&#xD;
      the frequency of patients experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the MTD&#xD;
      evaluation period in studied regimens. The RDE will be guided by overall safety, efficacy,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives are to document the safety and tolerability of BI 764532, to&#xD;
      characterise pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to evaluate efficacy signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib will further explore BI 764532 in selected patients populations based on data from&#xD;
      phase Ia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase Ib objectives, endpoints and design will be specified in a study protocol amendment&#xD;
      after availability of phase Ia results.&#xD;
