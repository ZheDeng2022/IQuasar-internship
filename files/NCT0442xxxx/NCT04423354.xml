      Objective: To evaluate the safety, feasibility and clinical efficacy of transthoracic&#xD;
      single-hole assisted laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for Siewert Type Ⅱ adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      esophagogastric junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective, single-center, one-arm study will be performed. Patients who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with Siewert type Ⅱ esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma and meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be included in the study and undergo the transthoracic single-hole&#xD;
      assisted laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. The data of preoperative, intraoperative,&#xD;
      postoperative and follow-up will be recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints: The incidences of early postoperative complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study endpoints:(1) Surgery and oncology indicators ;(2) Early postoperative&#xD;
      recovery information ;(3) 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rate;(4) 5-year&#xD;
      disease-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Surgery and oncology indicators,such as length of operation, intraoperative blood loss,&#xD;
           transit thoracotomy or laparotomy rate, length of proximal tumor from esophageal&#xD;
           resection margin, number of mediastinal lymph node dissections and the positive, number&#xD;
           of abdominal lymph node dissections and the positive, tumor type and pathological stage,&#xD;
           etc.;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early postoperative recovery information ,such as time of first exhaust and defecation,&#xD;
           time of leaving the bed, time of recovery of full and half-flow diet, time of removal of&#xD;
           chest drainage tube, time of postoperative hospitalization, etc.&#xD;
