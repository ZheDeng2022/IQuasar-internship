      Investigating the effect of a single intramuscular injection with botulinum toxin (BTX)&#xD;
      compared to NaCl in patients with jaw muscle myalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is designed as an double blind multicenter pilot study for hypothesis&#xD;
      generation on 48 patients with chronic jaw muscle myalgia at four specialist dental clinics.&#xD;
      The subjects visit the clinic on 3 predefined occasions, one telephone call and one scheduled&#xD;
      evaluation by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is primarily to evaluate the change in number of days with pain at two months&#xD;
      following one session of BTX injections of the masseter and temporalis muscles in subjects&#xD;
      with jaw muscle myalgia pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study will serve as a basis for a later randomized controlled trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is the second most common musculoskeletal condition (after&#xD;
      chronic low back pain) and refer to pain and dysfunction in the temporomandibular system and&#xD;
      its muscles, joints, and associated structures. The prevalence of TMD is 4-15% among adults&#xD;
      where myalgia is the most common form of TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for temporomandibular disorders (DC/TMD) was introduced in 2014 and is&#xD;
      used worldwide for classifying TMD. Myalgia is the second group of disorders of DC/TMD and is&#xD;
      defined by pain in a masticatory structure that is modified by jaw movement, function, or&#xD;
      parafunction and familiar pain in masticatory muscle(s) with either muscle palpation or&#xD;
      maximum opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myofacial pain is the most common form of TMD, affecting about half of the patients&#xD;
      presenting in TMD clinics. Myofascial pain is usually treated with conservative treatment&#xD;
      including occlusal, physical and pharmacologic therapies. However, there is no evidence on&#xD;
      which conservative treatment is the most beneficial in treating myalgia pain, mainly due to&#xD;
      lack of randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin A (BTX) is a neurotoxin isolated from Clostridium botulinum. Injected into a&#xD;
      muscle the effect occurs in the presynaptic junction by blocking the release of&#xD;
      acetylcholine, resulting in weakening of the muscular activity by affecting alpha and gamma&#xD;
      motor neurons. The clinical effect occurs after 3-7 days after administration with a duration&#xD;
      of up to 4 months. The BTX-effect diminish when new formation of synaptic connections occur&#xD;
      due to sprouting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional myofascial pain is characterized by the presence of trigger points and BTX, as a&#xD;
      potent neurotoxin, has been used for its treatment. However, a Cochrane review reported&#xD;
      inconclusive evidence to support the use of BTX in the treatment of myofascial pain. In&#xD;
      another Cochrane review on cervical dystonia significant improvements were found with odds&#xD;
      ratio (OR) of 20% in Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score&#xD;
      after four weeks (OR 4.69; 95% CI 2.06 to 10.69) and a weighted mean difference of -5.92 (95%&#xD;
      CI -9.61 to -2.23). Studies investigating the effect of BTX on masticatory muscle myalgia&#xD;
      have been summarized in systematic reviews and with inconclusive evidence to support the&#xD;
      effect of BTX. Meta-analyses were inconclusive due to the heterogeneity of the studies and&#xD;
      methodological flaws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several theories of how BTX may reduce myalgia. Assuming myalgia is caused by&#xD;
      muscle hyperactivity, BTX will reduce hyperactivity and thereby pain. In the presence of&#xD;
      trigger points within the muscle, BTX may eliminate the triggers and then reduce pain. In&#xD;
      case of muscle inflammatory pain, BTX reduces muscle activity and may then facilitate&#xD;
      reduction of inflammation and consequently the pain. This can be caused by blocking the&#xD;
      release of neurotransmitters such as substance P and glutamate. In conclusion, the mechanism&#xD;
      on how muscle paralysis reduces pain is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drawback of BTX-treatment is the potential side effects not found for other treatments of&#xD;
      myalgia pain. Minor complications associated with any intra-muscular injection are pain,&#xD;
      bruising and swelling. Some patients develop severe headache, muscle atrophy and paralysis in&#xD;
      areas adjacent to the injection site causing ptos, difficulty in speaking, swallowing and&#xD;
      respiratory problems. The risk-benefit relation is not established when treating masticatory&#xD;
      myalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden does not recommend the use of BTX for&#xD;
      treating myofascial pain because of insufficient scientific evidence. The key publications on&#xD;
      BTX for the treatment of jaw muscle pain are using reduction of pain intensity as the primary&#xD;
      measure which may be a blunt parameter to evaluate treatment effects of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to explore BTX-treatment effects of jaw muscle myalgia in relation&#xD;
      to side effects using a set of measures to be used for hypothesis generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to help fill one of the knowledge gaps and be a valuable&#xD;
      addition to increasing the quality of treatments made on the group of people diagnosed with&#xD;
      myalgia in the masticatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is targeted to include a total of 48 subjects with the diagnosis myalgia. Half of&#xD;
      the subjects will receive one injection of botulinum toxin type A in their masseter and&#xD;
      temporalis muscles. The other half will be the placebo group receiving NaCl injection on the&#xD;
      same sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection treatment is made bilaterally independent of the presence of bilateral or&#xD;
      unilateral myalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list is generated by computer and each randomization should be balanced with&#xD;
      as many subjects in the treatment group as in the control group. Randomization will be made&#xD;
      in blocks of four. The randomization, which is sealed in individual envelopes, is performed&#xD;
      by a person who is not attached to the project and keeps the randomization list locked up.&#xD;
      The envelopes contain the randomization number and description of the substance to be&#xD;
      injected. The envelope is opened immediately before the treatment and after all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the investigator has checked alignment to the inclusion/exclusion criteria the study&#xD;
      nurse will prepare the syringes in a separate room according to the randomization envelope&#xD;
      information. The opened randomization envelope will then be put in a larger envelope which&#xD;
      will be sealed and stored in the CRF-binder. The syringes will then be provided to the&#xD;
      investigator without her/his knowledge on its content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper-based Case Report Form (CRF) is used for data collection. The investigator must&#xD;
      ensure that data is registered and any corrections in the CRF are made as stated in the study&#xD;
      protocol and in accordance with the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team at each center consists of a dentist and a study nurse. The subjects visit the&#xD;
      clinic on 3 predefined occasions, one telephone call and one scheduled evaluation by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Enrollment, subject information and informed consent. After checking the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria the subject is assigned an enrollment number. Clinical examination is&#xD;
      performed by the dentist. Questionnaires and diaries are handed out and the patient is&#xD;
      instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: This visit will be done 2 weeks after enrollment visit. A baseline clinical&#xD;
      examination is done. Questionnaires and diary are returned. After checking the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria the intervention substance is prepared according to the randomization code&#xD;
      and the dentist performs the injection treatment. The subject is instructed how to complete a&#xD;
      new set of questionnaires. Adverse events are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By mail evaluation: Two weeks (+ 4 days) after visit 2. The patient returns the&#xD;
      questionnaires and diaries by surface-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone evaluation: One month (+ 1 week) after visit 2. Telephone call. Adverse events are&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Two months (+ 2 weeks) after visit 2. The dentist collects questionnaires and&#xD;
      diaries and a clinical examination is made. The subject is then completed within the scope of&#xD;
      the study. Adverse events are registered. If further treatment is required, it is made&#xD;
      outside the study protocol.&#xD;
