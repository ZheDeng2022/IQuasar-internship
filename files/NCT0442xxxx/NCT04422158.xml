      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Nuun electrolyte tablets on hydration&#xD;
      status in young and active men and women. We will follow a similar approach as used by&#xD;
      Maughan and colleagues (2016) to measure the beverage hydration index (the relative amount of&#xD;
      urine passed after consumption of a drink compared to water). It is hypothesized that Nuun&#xD;
      electrolyte tablets will result in a greater hydration status as compared to water only. Due&#xD;
      to the fact that athletes use Nuun tablets at varying dosages, we will evaluate Nuun at both&#xD;
      a single dosage and a double dosage. We maintain a non-directional hypothesis regarding the&#xD;
      potential differences between the two different dosages tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining adequate hydration is essential to optimal health and athletic performance. When&#xD;
      individuals exercise (in particular in a warm environment), they can lose excessive amounts&#xD;
      of fluids through sweating, along with necessary electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium,&#xD;
      chloride). With dehydration, individuals may feel sluggish and can experience impaired&#xD;
      physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many attempts have been made to improve and measure the hydration status of active&#xD;
      individuals. This typically involves the ingestion of fluids leading up to activity&#xD;
      (typically plain water), as well as the ingestion of fluids during the activity itself&#xD;
      (water, along with a diluted carbohydrate/electrolyte beverage). This approach seems to work&#xD;
      well; however, some debate remains over what the best fluid is to consume, in particular&#xD;
      related to the macronutrient type and the specific electrolyte mix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related to the above, it is well-accepted that electrolyte replenishment is of importance,&#xD;
      both during and following exercise-to aid in rehydration for subsequent bouts. The use of&#xD;
      electrolytes (sodium in particular) has been used for decades to aid athlete hydration and&#xD;
      has led to the development of various sport drinks-which also include small amounts of&#xD;
      carbohydrate. However, one problem with carbohydrate ingestion is that some individuals&#xD;
      experience gastrointestinal (GI) upset following carbohydrate ingestion before and during an&#xD;
      event, despite very good physical performance outcomes. Due to this GI upset, some&#xD;
      individuals (in particular recreationally active individuals who are not competing at high&#xD;
      levels) rely solely on water and seek a method to ingest the lost electrolytes. In addition,&#xD;
      some individuals prefer to have both plain water and an electrolyte beverage during their&#xD;
      training/competition sessions and in some activities (e.g., running, cycling), carrying&#xD;
      multiple bottles of fluid is difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solution to the above issues for many athletes is the use of electrolyte tablets. These&#xD;
      can be dropped into plain water and will dissolve into a flavored electrolyte-rich beverage.&#xD;
      They are easy to transport and provide the needed electrolytes to replace those that are lost&#xD;
      through intense and/or long duration exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuun electrolyte tablets provide only 2 grams of carbohydrate and a combination of&#xD;
      electrolytes, provided at a relatively low percentage of the Daily Value (DV). The DV tells&#xD;
      us how much a particular nutrient in a serving of a food product contributes to a daily diet,&#xD;
      based on a standard 2000 calorie diet. Nuun tablets contain: calcium (13mg, 1%DV), sodium&#xD;
      (300mg, 13%DV), potassium (150mg, 3%DV), magnesium (25mg, 6%DV), and chloride (40mg, 2%DV).&#xD;
      These tablets contain a small percentage of the needed total electrolytes but adequate&#xD;
      amounts to replace lost electrolytes as a result of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Nuun tablets are commercially available and have received positive reviews from end&#xD;
      users, there have been no studies to date to evaluate the impact of these tablets on&#xD;
      hydration status. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact of Nuun&#xD;
      electrolyte tablets on hydration status in young and active men and women. We will follow a&#xD;
      similar approach as used by Maughan and colleagues to measure the beverage hydration index&#xD;
      (the relative amount of urine passed after consumption of a drink compared to water). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that Nuun electrolyte tablets will result in a greater hydration status as&#xD;
      compared to water only. Due to the fact that athletes use Nuun tablets at varying dosages, we&#xD;
      will evaluate Nuun at both a single dosage and a double dosage. We maintain a non-directional&#xD;
      hypothesis regarding the potential differences between the two different dosages tested.&#xD;
