  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the primary risk factors for the development of diabetes is obesity. While even&#xD;
      moderate weight loss achieved by dieting can lead to improvements in metabolic health,&#xD;
      reduced-calorie diets are notoriously difficult to sustain. Over the past decade, a number of&#xD;
      groups have shown that low protein diets are associated with metabolic health in both rodents&#xD;
      and humans. In particular, specific building blocks of protein- the branched chain amino&#xD;
      acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine - are associated with insulin resistance and&#xD;
      diabetes in humans. Blood levels of the BCAAs decrease in humans fed a low protein diet, and&#xD;
      we recently showed that reducing either dietary BCAAs or protein rapidly restored normal body&#xD;
      composition and insulin sensitivity to diet-induced obese mice without reducing calorie&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study will test the metabolic role of dietary BCAAs in humans by completing an&#xD;
      adequately powered, randomized controlled study. A total of 132 subjects stratified by gender&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Control; 2) Low Protein; 3) Low BCAA. Subjects&#xD;
      in each group will replace two meals a day (and 2/3rds of their baseline dietary protein)&#xD;
      with meal replacement beverages based on either complete protein powder or a BCAA-free&#xD;
      medical food for two months. Primary outcomes will be weight and fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. A number of secondary outcomes will also be assessed and blood, adipose, and fecal&#xD;
      samples will be collected for integrated transcriptional and metabolomic pathway analysis to&#xD;
      identify and compare the metabolic pathways affected by low protein and low BCAA diets.&#xD;

    <description>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a standard technique for the determination of body composition. DXA results will be used to calculate fat and lean mass composition. Total body Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS) is a minimal risk procedure which enhances DXA as it permits the determination of intracellular water.BIS is used to calculate fat and fat-free mass composition. A formula will be used to combine BIS fat-free mass composition and DXA lean mass composition corrected by limb length, which allows a surrogate measurement of muscle mass.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 (±7)days, 60(-3 to +7)days, 134(+7) days</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin resistance will be measured by HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) method. Insulin resistance reveals the dynamics between the participant's baseline (fasting) blood sugar and the responsive insulin levels.&#xD;
HOMA-IR healthy range: 1.0 (0.5-1.4), less than 1.0 means participant is insulin-sensitive which is optimal, above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance.</description>

    <description>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone which regulate insulin signalling in response to nutritional status. Levels of FGF21 induced in response to low protein diet and fasting will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) assay.</description>
