    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effects of CarnipureTM, a high-quality L-carnitine ingredient, on&#xD;
      long term (5 weeks) recovery, muscle damage, and SOD status in a population of males and&#xD;
      females while training two days per week. The primary outcomes defining recovery were changes&#xD;
      in serum creatine kinase levels and perceptual changes in recovery. Supporting variables&#xD;
      included an assessment of strength and power as a functional indicator of recovery. This&#xD;
      study would be the first to examine the effects of CarnipureTM on long-term recovery. Our&#xD;
      primary hypothesis was that L-carnitine supplementation would reduce muscle damage and&#xD;
      improve perceptual measures of recovery. Our secondary hypotheses were that L-carnitine&#xD;
      supplementation would better sustain strength and power and elevate SOD status.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In totality, the study will last 5-weeks, consisting of supplementation with maintenance&#xD;
      exercise performed 2 days per week, at home. Week 5 will consist of a pre-training&#xD;
      assessment, an intense lower-body strength endurance training day, and subsequent testing&#xD;
      48-hour testing (Post-Week 5). The baseline testing (will be performed on approximately 10&#xD;
      subjects per day over the course of 4 days) and will consist of the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) Body Composition Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force Plate Mechanography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 4 weeks of training, participants will be asked to workout 2 days per week at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Monday of week five, 20 subjects will be assessed on the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary Measures&#xD;

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force Plate Mechanography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Tuesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested on Monday, will go through an intense lower&#xD;
      body, strength endurance protocol, and the leftover 20 subjects will go through the following&#xD;
      assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force Plate Mechanography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Wednesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Monday, will have a day to rest. The 20&#xD;
      subjects that tested Tuesday, will go through an intense lower body strength endurance&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample (for blood lactate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Thursday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will have the day off, while the&#xD;
      20 subjects that tested Monday will be assessed on the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force Plate Mechanography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Friday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will be assessed on the following&#xD;
      measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force Plate Mechanography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will be sought from 80 male and female subjects ranging from 21 to 65 years old&#xD;
      who are active (i.e. 30 minutes per week of moderate activity classified as greater than 50 %&#xD;
      of their heart rate (HR) max 3 days â€¢ week-1). Two cohorts of 40 subjects will be examined in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement will be administered as a dose of 2g of Carnipure (L-carnitine), per day for&#xD;
      the duration of the study. Placebo and treatment conditions will be administered in visually&#xD;
      identical capsules. Statistical analysis will be carried out on the entire study population&#xD;
      and on the female study population independently.&#xD;
