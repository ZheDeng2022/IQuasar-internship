  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly subsidized first-line antimalarials (artemisinin combination therapy or ACT) are&#xD;
      available over the counter in the private retail sector in most malaria-endemic countries.&#xD;
      Overconsumption of ACTs purchased over the counter is rampant due to their low price, high&#xD;
      perceived efficacy, and absence of diagnostic tools to guide drug use. The ultimate goal of&#xD;
      the proposed work is to improve antimalarial stewardship in the retail sector, which is&#xD;
      responsible for distributing the majority of antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa. Through a&#xD;
      combination of diagnosis and treatment subsidies and provider-directed incentives, this&#xD;
      approach will align provider and customer incentives with appropriate case management and&#xD;
      thereby improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study (Aim 2) is to test two key interventions, singly and in&#xD;
      combination, in a random sample of private medicine retail outlets in Nigeria. This will be a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial where the cluster is a private retail outlet that stocks&#xD;
      and sells WHO quality-assured ACTs. This four-arm study will test a 1) provider-directed&#xD;
      incentive for testing and reporting, 2) a consumer-directed intervention in the form of a&#xD;
      diagnosis-dependent ACT subsidy, 3) both the provider and consumer-directed interventions in&#xD;
      combination against 4) a comparison arm. Outlets in all four arms will offer malaria&#xD;
      diagnostic testing to customers who wish to purchase one. Information for the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be collected during exit interviews with eligible customers. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the proportion of ACTs sold to customers with a positive diagnostic&#xD;
      test. The main secondary outcome will be the proportion of suspected malaria cases presenting&#xD;
      to the retail outlet that are tested. Other secondary outcomes include adherence to the RDT&#xD;
      result amongst those tested (defined as taking a quality-assured ACT following a positive&#xD;
      test and refraining from taking an ACT following a negative test) and appropriate case&#xD;
      management for all suspected malaria cases (proportion tested and adhered among all suspected&#xD;
      cases).&#xD;

      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that decision-making in the retail sector is influenced&#xD;
      primarily by price (or profit) supplemented by individual beliefs or preferences. Information&#xD;
      from a diagnostic test, when available, plays only a minor role in the decision-making&#xD;
      landscape. In response to this, the investigators propose to test a scalable, policy-relevant&#xD;
      strategy that integrates testing and treatment subsidies and makes ACT subsidies available&#xD;
      only to customers with a positive malaria test. Differential pricing based on the results of&#xD;
      the diagnostic test will align consumer and provider incentives (price and profit) with&#xD;
      testing and appropriate ACT use. The investigators approach will also ensure that public&#xD;
      subsidies are directed at confirmed malaria cases thereby enhancing the sustainability of&#xD;
      such programs. By allocating subsidy dollars across both testing and conditional treatment&#xD;
      (rather than universal, treatment-only subsidies), the investigators can reduce the cost of&#xD;
      subsidizing malaria treatment and improve targeting of ACTs without compromising access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This goal of the proposed work is to improve antimalarial stewardship in the retail sector,&#xD;
      which has the largest market share of antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study (Aim&#xD;
      2) the investigators will use a cluster randomized controlled trial to measure the impact of&#xD;
      two innovative interventions - a provider-directed incentive for offering malaria rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests to suspected malaria cases and a consumer-directed diagnosis dependent ACT&#xD;
      subsidy (conditional ACT subsidy). The investigators will test both interventions singly and&#xD;
      in combination. The unit of randomization will be the private medicine outlet (cluster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with four arms based on a factorial&#xD;
      design. See Section 4.4 Statistical Design and Power for complete details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Nigeria, a country with high malaria burden. Nigeria has the&#xD;
      programmatic goal of universal access to prompt parasitological confirmation before treatment&#xD;
      and have endorsed the use of malaria RDTs in the public health sector at all levels of care.&#xD;
      However, very high rates of treatment in the retail sector undermine the explicit policy that&#xD;
      all malaria cases should be confirmed by parasitological diagnosis. In Nigeria, the&#xD;
      government has recently permitted retail outlets to conduct RDTs in an effort to reduce&#xD;
      overuse of antimalarials, particularly publicly-subsidized ACTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study site will be Lagos, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete sampling frame of eligible retail outlets will be made for the site. Outlets will&#xD;
      be eligible if they regularly carry quality-assured, subsidized ACTs. Participating retail&#xD;
      outlets will receive an initial small start-up stock of RDTs and will be given contact&#xD;
      information for RDT wholesalers who can provide replenishment stocks on demand. In addition,&#xD;
      all attendants will be trained to use a mobile reporting app that captures basic information&#xD;
      about suspected malaria cases. This app will not be used to assess outcomes, but will be an&#xD;
      important monitoring tool and serve as the conduit for all payments according to the arm&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following training, shops will be randomized to one of the four arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (control): RDTs available at study-recommended price, providers trained on mobile&#xD;
           app&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (provider-directed intervention): providers receive a small reimbursement for each&#xD;
           RDT that they perform and report on the mobile app, RDTs available at study-recommended&#xD;
           price&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (client-directed intervention): ACT subsidy to client conditional on positive RDT,&#xD;
           RDTs available at study-recommended price&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4 (consumer-directed and provider-directed intervention): providers are reimbursed&#xD;
           for each RDT and consumers with a positive test are eligible for a subsidy on a&#xD;
           quality-assured ACT. RDTs are available at study recommended price.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customers who come to a participating outlet in any arm with fever or suspected malaria are&#xD;
      eligible for an RDT at the study-recommended price and, in arms 3 and 4, a conditional ACT&#xD;
      subsidy when the RDT is positive. Attendants will be trained to recognize danger signs and&#xD;
      refer those individuals to a health facility for immediate care. Customers purchasing&#xD;
      medicine on someone's behalf or those who have already had a malaria test will not be&#xD;
      eligible for RDT testing or conditional subsidies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome measures will be collected by interviewing a random sample of customers leaving&#xD;
      participating shops (exit interviews). A team of field interviewers will be trained in each&#xD;
      site and will be assigned to participating outlets on random days in a month. Both the day of&#xD;
      the month and the interviewer assigned to the specific outlet will be randomized in order to&#xD;
      balance data collection across interviewers and arms and to minimize the observer effect.&#xD;
      Each outlet will be visited thrice in a month and the interviewer will enroll eligible&#xD;
      participants in succession until they have completed 3-4 interviews. Eleven-twelve customers&#xD;
      per month per outlet are needed to reach the sample size of 170 interviews per outlet in 15&#xD;
      months of data collection. Exit interviews will capture information about customer&#xD;
      demographics, symptoms of their current illness, whether they had a malaria diagnostic test&#xD;
      at the outlet or elsewhere, how much they paid for the test, the results of the test, and the&#xD;
      drug(s) they purchased. Customers will be eligible to participate in the exit interview if&#xD;
      s/he was seeking drugs for him/herself or their minor child older than one year of age and&#xD;
      the child is physically present, s/he had a febrile illness or suspected malaria, and s/he&#xD;
      agrees to be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study monitoring will be continuous throughout the study period using the mobile app. Study&#xD;
      staff will regularly review reporting data captured by the mobile app. In particular,&#xD;
      pictures of RDTs will be reviewed alongside results reported by outlet attendants to ensure&#xD;
      correct use and interpretation of the RDTs. In addition, exit interviews will be summarized&#xD;
      monthly by outlet and compared to the data submitted via the app. This monitoring step will&#xD;
      allow us to identify major discrepancies between actions reported by the shop and those&#xD;
      reported by the customers such as testing rates, RDT positivity rates, dispensing of&#xD;
      qualified ACTs and prices charged for RDTs and ACTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated power based on a cluster randomized two-sample two-tailed t-test&#xD;
      for the comparison of two proportions. We calculated power for differences in the primary&#xD;
      outcome for each of the three comparisons of interest noted above. With a sample of 170 exit&#xD;
      interviews per outlet (48 outlets in Nigeria), we will have &gt;90% power to detect a minimum&#xD;
      difference between Arms 1 (control) and 4 (combined interventions) in the primary outcome of&#xD;
      25 percentage points. The investigators will also have &gt;89% power to detect a minimum&#xD;
      difference of 14 percentage points for the secondary comparisons of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size estimates correspond to a total of 8160 exit interviews with clients in&#xD;
      Nigeria. Since not everyone interviewed will have purchased an ACT, the estimates account for&#xD;
      the fact that only a subset will enter into the analysis for the primary outcome. The&#xD;
      investigators will have a team of 8 data collectors (one team per site) and each data&#xD;
      collector will conduct approximately 50-60 interviews per month. Exit interviews should take&#xD;
      15 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      See Section 4.4 Statistical Design and Power for comprehensive description of sample size,&#xD;
      power and statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customers leaving the shop will be approached by the field interviewer to ask if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in a short interview. If they agree, then they will be taken to a&#xD;
      private area and the study will be explained to them. Once they provide consent, the&#xD;
      interviewer will record the details of their illness and treatment at the outlet. No&#xD;
      participant identifiers will be recorded in the electronic data collection form. This limits&#xD;
      the possibility of identifying the source of any health information (See Protection of Human&#xD;
      Subjects Section 3.3).&#xD;
