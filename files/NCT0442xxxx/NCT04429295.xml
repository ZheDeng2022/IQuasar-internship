      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the SHAN6™ vaccine to the licensed SHAN5™ given with&#xD;
      bOPV and IPV vaccines when coadministered with PCV and ORV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of the SHAN6™ vaccine 3-dose primary infant&#xD;
           vaccination and that of the control vaccines (SHAN5™ given with bOPV and IPV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to co-administered ORV-1 (Rotarix™) in a subset of&#xD;
           participants from each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response to co-administered PCV-13 (Prevnar 13®) in a subset of&#xD;
           participants from each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the persistence of the antibodies against SHAN6™ antigens following a 3-dose&#xD;
           primary series of SHAN6™ or SHAN5™ given with bOPV and IPV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of SHAN6™ 28 days after the single booster dose&#xD;
           of SHAN6™&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the SHAN6™ vaccine and the control vaccines (SHAN5™&#xD;
           given with bOPV and IPV), when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric&#xD;
           vaccines&#xD;
