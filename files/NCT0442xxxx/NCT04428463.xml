  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tympanic membrane perforations are common medical problem that encounters a lot of patients&#xD;
      in all age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for treatment of perforations is tympanic membrane closure procedure&#xD;
      (tympanoplasty) which is done under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure could be problematic for many patients who are not suitable for general&#xD;
      anesthesia due to their medical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's also time consuming for the patient and for the medical system, since it takes a lot of&#xD;
      time to reach the operation room and hospitalization for at least two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose in this study is to use Tachosil (Fibrinogen based patch) under local anesthesia&#xD;
      to close tympanic membrane perforations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tachosil is in use for hemostasis and for tissue repair after injury. Tachosil is bound to&#xD;
      the tissue and form a waterproof membrane. In the setting of ENT clinic and under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, the investigators will start the procedure with debridement of the tympanic&#xD;
      perforation edges, then they will close the perforation using two pieces of Tachosil under&#xD;
      and above the perforation in the right form (active side to the active side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results will be similar to tympanoplasty results, this method may be used for closure&#xD;
      of tympanic perforation and save time and money for the patient and for the health system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tympanoplasty is the gold standard treatment for tympanic membrane perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is done under general anesthesia in the following form:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incision in the post auricular area, harvesting of fascia and cartilage from the concha of&#xD;
      the pinna .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Trans ear canal approach starting with debridement of the edges of the tympanic membrane&#xD;
      perforation and closing the perforation using cartilage and fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving informed&#xD;
      consent will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include two groups. The first group will be treated with the conventional way&#xD;
      as described above. The interventional group will be treated using Tachosil in the following&#xD;
      order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthesia using Lidocadren (lidocaine and epinephrine) will be injected to the ear&#xD;
      canal using dental needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement of the edges of the tympanic membrane perforation Placing the tachosil under and&#xD;
      above the perforation in the correct order. The patient could be discharged home immediately&#xD;
      after the procedure if no adverse effects are seen (dizziness, nausea or vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one month, similar to the conventional treatment method, the patient will be invited to&#xD;
      the otology clinic, for hearing test and microscopic examuntaion of the tympanic membrane, to&#xD;
      see if the perforation is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the success rate in the two groups and if it will be similar that will&#xD;
      help publish this method and use it in patients who are not suitable to general anesthesia&#xD;
      and in hospitals were waiting time table for operation room is very long.&#xD;
