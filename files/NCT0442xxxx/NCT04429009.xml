  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomized control trial is to analyze by direct comparison the&#xD;
      ZEPHYRx Respiratory Therapy (RT) system and the FDA approved standard of care (SOC) incentive&#xD;
      spirometer (IS), used for FDA approved indications at the University of Rochester Medical&#xD;
      Center (URMC). This comparison will determine subject preferences in terms of usability and&#xD;
      simplicity of each, as well as subject engagement and adherence to the prescribed respiratory&#xD;
      therapy routine. Additionally, the study will analyze the effectiveness of the gamified&#xD;
      spirometry with regards to spirometry volumes, frequency of usage, and pulmonary&#xD;
      complications 30 days post discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lobectomy and wedge resection patients at University of Rochester Medical Center meeting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be screened and consented by members of the research team prior to&#xD;
      surgery at their pre-operative clinic visit. Once a subject meets the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      this study, the subject will be randomly assigned to one of the two arms of this study by a&#xD;
      flip of a coin. To ensure that we meet the predicted 50 subjects in each arm of the study,&#xD;
      every second subject enrolled will be assigned to the opposite arm of the previously assigned&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery or extubation, and once no longer under the influence of anesthesia, the&#xD;
      patient enrolled into the study arm will be provided with a ZEPHYRx incentive spirometer&#xD;
      device connected to an Amazon Kindle Fire HD Tablet. A respiratory therapist, nurse, doctor,&#xD;
      or research team member will teach the subject how to use the device and the tablet, and walk&#xD;
      them through the first series of breaths. A built-in bell reminder in the device will ring&#xD;
      once every hour between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. to remind patients to use the&#xD;
      device, this feature is part of the research and a feature programmed into the device.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects will answer questions on their tablet about pain level on a scale of&#xD;
      0-10 before and after each round of game play. At discharge, the subjects in the study arm&#xD;
      will return their assigned tablet and will be issued a standard incentive spirometer to&#xD;
      continue respiratory therapy at home, per standard of care. Subjects in the study arm will&#xD;
      not be held responsible for lost, stolen or damaged tablets or incentive spirometers. The&#xD;
      subject in the study arm may choose to keep or discard the ZEPHYRx incentive spirometer&#xD;
      device. The device will record subject usage, including number of breaths, number of&#xD;
      sessions, total time the device was in use, inspiratory volumes, and pain level (0-10) before&#xD;
      and after each round of game play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the control arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery or extubation, and once no longer under the influence of anesthesia, the&#xD;
      patient enrolled in the control arm will meet with an RT, nurse, doctor, or research team&#xD;
      member to receive an FDA approved incentive spirometry device and appropriate training thus&#xD;
      initiating the study. Routine respiratory care involves the use of a standard incentive&#xD;
      spirometer that is not a digital device and does not include any built-in reminder. As per&#xD;
      routine care, the nurse or respiratory therapist will remind the subjects in both arms of the&#xD;
      study to perform their respiratory therapy of at least 10 breaths per hour. In order to&#xD;
      obtain data comparable to what the ZEPHYRx respiratory therapy system will collect, similar&#xD;
      data will be collected from subjects in the control arm on a data sheet by an RT, nurse,&#xD;
      doctor, or research team member 3 times a day until the subject is discharged. The only&#xD;
      questionnaire will be the standard of care pain scale questions which the subjects in the&#xD;
      control arm will have to complete in written form. Upon discharge, subjects in the control&#xD;
      arm of the study will be allowed to keep their standard of care incentive spirometer in order&#xD;
      to continue respiratory therapy at home, per standard of care. Subjects in the control arm&#xD;
      will not be held responsible for lost, stolen or damaged incentive spirometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a daily basis, a member of the research team will check that the device(s) is/are working&#xD;
      correctly and will answer any questions the subject may have regarding the study or device.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will be prescribed to use the ZEPHYRx RT device for incentive spectrometer once every hour during waking hours to perform a series of 10 deep breaths. The novel ZEPHYRx RT system consists three components:&#xD;
The Spirobank Smart Spirometer, which is a non-significant risk, FDA-cleared diagnostic spirometer made by Medical International Research (MIR) that connects via bluetooth to an Android tablet.&#xD;
A Samsung 10-inch tablet provided by Pad-in-Motion Inc. that will be connected to the hospital GuestWiFi network.&#xD;
The ZEPHYRx Respiratory Therapy video game application installed on the tablet. This application consists of seven games that have been created to combine traditional IS techniques with playing a breath controlled video game. The application will record data while playing the video games including date/time of use, game played, inhalation duration, and inhalation volume.</description>
