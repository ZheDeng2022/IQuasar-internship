  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of epidural analgesia (EA) has been suggested as an integral part of an enhanced&#xD;
      recovery program for colorectal surgery. However, the effects of EA on postoperative ileus&#xD;
      remain controversial. Some authors suggest that EA has beneficial effects for postoperative&#xD;
      outcome and hospital stay, whereas others have reported that the role of EA in the modern&#xD;
      perioperative care of patients undergoing open colorectal surgery has been limited.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of EA on postoperative outcome,&#xD;
      particularly postoperative ileus and hospital stay in patients with colorectal surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, results of Cochrane review of 22 trials on the efficacy of EA in patients undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery showed that an epidural containing a local anesthetic, with or without the&#xD;
      addition of an opioid, accelerated the return of gastrointestinal transit (high quality of&#xD;
      evidence) and no difference in the incidence of vomiting or anastomotic leak (low quality of&#xD;
      evidence). For open surgery, an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would reduce the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay (very low quality of evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in a recent analysis from American College of Surgeons revealed that the use of EA&#xD;
      did not improve postoperative recovery after elective colectomy in their analysis and was&#xD;
      associated with increased postoperative ileus and prolonged hospital stay after open&#xD;
      colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the efficacy of EA to reduce the&#xD;
      postoperative ileus and hospital stay, as well in the patients undergoing colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      This prospective randomized study planned to include 100 consecutive patients with colorectal&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
