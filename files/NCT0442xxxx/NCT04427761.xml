  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand what types of transitions people with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer face when they receive chemotherapy. Again, this study defines transition&#xD;
      as a change in a life situation or a status that causes a change in a person's identity,&#xD;
      role, behavior, or personal relationships. Examples of transitions include changes in&#xD;
      sleeping habits, anxiety, employment, relationship with a higher power, and treatment goals.&#xD;

    <description>In this prospective longitudinal correlational study, a convenience sample of patients with pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy will be asked to report on their health-illness transition experiences and their level of distress.</description>

    <description>These surveys will take 5-10 minutes to complete at two time-points, T0 (baseline) and T1 (four to six weeks after baseline visit) The patient will again complete the DT and MOT-CA at a chemotherapy treatment or clinic visit, if possible, or via a telephone call with the principal investigator in the event that there are no in-person visits scheduled (Time 1).</description>
