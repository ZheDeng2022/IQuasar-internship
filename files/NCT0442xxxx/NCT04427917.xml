        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female participants must be 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of&#xD;
             signing the ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A Japanese participant is defined as having 4 biological Japanese grandparents who&#xD;
             were born in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and&#xD;
             cardiovascular tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. BMI of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of HIV infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive testing for HIV,&#xD;
             HBsAg, HBcAb or HCVAb. Hepatitis B vaccination (positive HBsAb) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention (Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least&#xD;
             5 minutes of supine rest: If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the&#xD;
             BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used&#xD;
             to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Baseline 12 lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTc&#xD;
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third&#xD;
             degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline&#xD;
             uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the&#xD;
             Fridericia method (QTcF) and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and&#xD;
             reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST or ALT level ≥1.25 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study&#xD;
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1&#xD;
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent &gt;5&#xD;
             cigarettes/day or 2 chews of tobacco per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Investigator site staff or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
             study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective&#xD;
             family members.&#xD;
