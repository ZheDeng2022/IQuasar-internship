      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a nervous system disorder that affects movement. Dopamine is an&#xD;
      important neurotransmitter in the brain. As PD progresses, there is less and less dopamine in&#xD;
      the brain. Researchers think there may be a relationship between differences in attention and&#xD;
      dopamine in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if people with PD that is worse on one side also have differences in how much&#xD;
      attention they pay to the two sides of space on their left and right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking, right-handed people age 35-80 with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical and neurological history and exam, and medicine&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 study visit. It will last 7-8 hours. They will stop taking their&#xD;
      Parkinson medicine 12 hours before the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will do tasks on a computer screen. They will judge the middle of lines, react&#xD;
      to stimuli, and search and identify items that appear on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the brain. During the MRI,&#xD;
      participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner. While inside the&#xD;
      scanner, they will look at a cross on a screen, relax, and think about nothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo prism adaptation. They will sit in front of a board while their&#xD;
      chin rests on a support. They will point to 1 of 2 dots on the board while they wear prism&#xD;
      glasses that shift their vision to the left or right....&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the relationship between Dopamine (DA) function and attention in patients&#xD;
      with asymmetric Parkinson Disease (PD). We hypothesize that the direction of asymmetry in&#xD;
      dopamine (DA) depletion predicts the asymmetry in visual attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - to study attentional asymmetry in patients with PD. We hypothesize that visual attention in&#xD;
      Parkinson will be biased to the visual field contralateral to the least affected hemisphere&#xD;
      (i.e. contralateral to the most affected side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the correlation between feedback learning and visuospatial attention&#xD;
           performance in PD. We hypothesize that feedback learning will also be affected according&#xD;
           to the most compromised hemisphere. Right hemisphere-predominant PD patients (left-motor&#xD;
           predominant), compared to left hemisphere-predominant patients, will exhibit a rightward&#xD;
           visuospatial bias and a relative preference for learning from reward, compared to&#xD;
           punishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the effect of prism adaptation on feedback learning and visuospatial&#xD;
           attention in PD. This objective is exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: visuospatial performance on the Landmark Task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: performance on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posner Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Search Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attentional blink Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visuospatial performance on the Manual Line Bisection Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reward and Punishment Implicit Feedback Learning Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Attentional Scaling Task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional connectivity measured with resting state fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients with asymmetric PD. Any gender, aged 35-80 (inclusive), able to give consent&#xD;
      and without a diagnosis of significant illness affecting the central nervous system other&#xD;
      than PD.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any current major neurological or psychiatric disorder other than Parkinson s disease,&#xD;
             such as, (but not limited to) stroke, dementia, Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia or&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Inability to provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Members of the Behavioral Neurology Unit, NINDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Left-handed per the Edinburgh Handedness scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Primarily axial motor symptoms or symmetrical limb involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Exclusion criteria for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of metal which would make having an MRI scan unsafe, such as pacemakers,&#xD;
                  stimulators, pumps, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, artificial heart valves,&#xD;
                  cochlear implants or shrapnel fragments, or if subject was a welder or metal&#xD;
                  worker, since small metal fragments may be present in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to lie supine comfortably for 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the goals of the study can be accomplished without involving vulnerable population,&#xD;
        we will not include individuals without consent capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since the goal is to characterize visuospatial attention deficits in idiopathic PD which is&#xD;
        a disease of late adulthood, we will not include children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of MRI on fetal development and the health of pregnant women is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therefore, women who are pregnant and breast-feeding will be excluded and women who can&#xD;
        become pregnant will be excluded following a positive pregnancy test, if the optional MRI&#xD;
        is under consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study requires fluency in English in order to completely understand tasks instructions,&#xD;
        thus non-English speakers/readers will be excluded.&#xD;
