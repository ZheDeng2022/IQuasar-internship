    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, multi-center, open-label extension trial will provide CAP-1002 to subjects that&#xD;
      were enrolled in the HOPE-2 trial and completed 12 months of follow-up. The trial will&#xD;
      explore the safety and efficacy of four intravenous administrations of CAP-1002, each&#xD;
      separated by three months. Subjects will undergo a targeted screening during a 30-day&#xD;
      screening period, eligible subjects will then undergo baseline safety and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments on Day 1 prior to their first infusion of CAP-1002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete trial assessments at Screening; Day 1; Months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Safety&#xD;
      and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to CAP-1002 administration at the Day 1,&#xD;
      Months 3, 6 and 9 trial visits, unless otherwise indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CAP-1002 infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site&#xD;
      on Day 1 and Months 3, 6 and 9. Subjects will be observed in the outpatient setting for at&#xD;
      least two hours post infusion and then discharged the same day if medically cleared by the&#xD;
      site Investigator.&#xD;

      This Phase 2, multi-center, open-label extension trial will provide CAP-1002 to subjects that&#xD;
      were enrolled in the HOPE-2 trial and completed 12 months of follow-up. The trial will&#xD;
      explore the safety and efficacy of four intravenous administrations of CAP-1002, each&#xD;
      separated by three months. Subjects will undergo a targeted screening during a 30-day&#xD;
      screening period to determine eligibility based on protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments on Day 1 prior to&#xD;
      their first infusion of CAP-1002. Administration of CAP-1002 (Day 1) should occur within a&#xD;
      maximum of 30 days following confirmation of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete trial assessments at Screening; Day 1; Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (±14&#xD;
      days, each). Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to CAP-1002&#xD;
      administration at the Day 1, Months 3, 6 and 9 trial visits, unless otherwise indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CAP-1002 infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site&#xD;
      on Day 1 and Months 3, 6 and 9. Prior to each CAP-1002 administration, medications will be&#xD;
      administered to the subject as determined by the Investigator based on the pre-treatment&#xD;
      guidelines as outlined in the protocol and/or institutional protocols to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      potential severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Subjects will be observed in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting for at least two hours post infusion and then discharged the same day if&#xD;
      medically cleared by the site Investigator. If clinically indicated, an unscheduled in-person&#xD;
      visit will be performed at the investigative site with targeted assessments based on&#xD;
      presentation of signs and symptoms following any infusion.&#xD;
