  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Ladakh is a region administered by India, covering an area slightly larger than&#xD;
      Croatia; it is part of the larger region of Kashmir and Jammu. Till now, oral health data on&#xD;
      population living in Ladakh are not available. The aim of the present preventive project will&#xD;
      be to record the caries prevalence of schoolchildren living in Ladakh and to implement a&#xD;
      school-based xylitol program using chewing gums in order to reduce caries incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The protocol of the Caries Prevention Xylitol in Children (CaPreXCh) trial is&#xD;
      designed as a triple-blind randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in children&#xD;
      aged 5-14 years. The study will be carried out from August 2021 to August 2024 in Zanskar&#xD;
      Valley (Ladakh). Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: subjects who will&#xD;
      receive a 100% xylitol chewing gum, and those who will receive a 22% xylitol gum. The&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to chew a total of 6 pellets for 5 min divided into 3 intakes a&#xD;
      day (2 in the morning, 2 after the midday meal and 2 in the afternoon) for one school-year.&#xD;
      Clinical examination will comprise an oral examination: caries index (ICDAS scores), bleeding&#xD;
      on probing recording and evaluation of plaque pH fluctuation after sucrose challenge and will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline (t0) and repeated 12 months at the end of the chewing-gum&#xD;
      administration period (t1) as interim examination, after 12 months (t2) and 24 months (t3)&#xD;
      after the end of the experimental period (chewing gum use). The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      caries increment measured both at enamel and dentinal level. Data analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      through Kaplan-Meyer graphs to evaluate caries increment as primary outcome, and the methods&#xD;
      will be compared to each other with Cox regression with shared frailty. The net caries&#xD;
      increment for initial, moderate and severe caries level, using ICDAS (Δ-initial, Δ-moderate&#xD;
      and Δ-severe), will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This is the first clinical trial to assess the effect of chewing gum containing&#xD;
      only xylitol as sweeteners for caries prevention. Moreover, the children object of this study&#xD;
      is a population with special living conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out from August 2021 to August 2024 in Zanskar Valley (Ladakh).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, interventions and outcomes Setting The study will be conducted in the Zanskar&#xD;
      Valley (Ladakh). The subjects (5 to 14 years old) will be randomly selected from a list of&#xD;
      school class in the selected schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining actual caries data, schools with similar numbers of schoolchildren (at least&#xD;
      300 subjects per school) will be selected for the preventive project. The participants will&#xD;
      be randomly taking as cluster the school-class allocated into two groups (Figure 1).&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by one author (G. Campus) using Microsoft Excel for Mac&#xD;
      (version 16.37) in permuted blocks of 2 or 4 with a random variation of the blocking number,&#xD;
      and 2 groups will be created:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the first group (Xyl) will receive sugar-free gums containing 100% Xylitol as sweetener;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the second group (Pol) will receive sugar-free gums containing a polyols mixture plus a&#xD;
           low amount of Xylitol (22%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All chewing gums will be produced and supplied by Perfetti Van Melle SpA (Lainate,&#xD;
           Italy). The xylitol chewing gum is with xylitol (64% w/v) as the only sweetener. The&#xD;
           polyols chewing gum is a sugar-free gum with 22% of Xylitol, 30% Sorbitol, 6% Maltitol&#xD;
           syrup and 4% Mannitol. All types of chewing gums weigh 1.4 g each and will be identical&#xD;
           in colour, shape and taste. The treatment will follow the school year calendar for a&#xD;
           total of nine months of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical examination will comprise an oral examination (caries index, bleeding on&#xD;
           probing recording) and evaluation of plaque pH fluctuation after sucrose challenge.&#xD;
           Bleeding on probing will be used as a proxy of plaque presence, since there is a causal&#xD;
           relationship between bleeding on probing and amount of plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects will be examined using a mouth mirror, a ball ended probe and artificial&#xD;
           light in a dental chair. Caries registration will be performed with regard to the first&#xD;
           and second primary, and first and second permanent, molars. The International Caries&#xD;
           Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) will be use to record caries at tooth level as&#xD;
           initial or moderate or severe lesions, the number of filled teeth and the missing teeth&#xD;
           for caries. Initial caries lesion can be defined as a primary lesion, which has not&#xD;
           reached the stage of an established lesion with cavitation (ICDAS score 1 and 2).&#xD;
           Moderate caries lesions are defined as white or brown spot lesion with localized enamel&#xD;
           breakdown or an underlying dentine shadow without visible dentine exposure (ICDAS score&#xD;
           3 and 4). Severe caries lesions are defined as distinct cavity in opaque or discoloured&#xD;
           enamel with visible dentine (ICDAS score 5 and 6). The bleeding on probing score will be&#xD;
           registered in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plaque-pH measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interproximal-plaque pH will be evaluated using pH indicator strips , which measure a pH&#xD;
           value in the range of 4.0-7.0 (Spezialindikator, pH range 4.0-7.0; Merck, Darmstadt,&#xD;
           Germany). The strips determine changes in plaque pH, discriminating differences at the&#xD;
           level of 0.2-0.5 pH units and they are easy to use. The strips are cut into 4 pieces&#xD;
           (approx. 2 mm in width) in order to get a strip that could be easily inserted into the&#xD;
           interproximal space and held in situ for 10 s, and its colour compared to the colour&#xD;
           index scheme supplied by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each subject, 3 measurements will be carried out in 2 sites, between the 2nd&#xD;
           premolar or the 2nd primary molar, if present, and the 1st molar right and left of the&#xD;
           upper jaw. Measurements will be performed before and at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min&#xD;
           after a mouth rinse with 10% sucrose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calibration of the examiners&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior the start of the examiners that performed all the dental screenings was trained&#xD;
           and calibrated by a benchmark examiner. Baseline training consists in one-day&#xD;
           theoretical course, followed by examination on extracted teeth plus a session of&#xD;
           photographs of extracted teeth. After two days of the theoretical course a clinical&#xD;
           training will be performed. The children were re-examined after 72 h. Inter-examiner&#xD;
           reliability with the benchmark examiner will be evaluated using fixed-effects analysis&#xD;
           of variance and intra-examiner reproducibility assessed as the percentage of agreement&#xD;
           using Cohen's kappa statistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects will be instructed to chew a total of 6 pellets for 5 min divided into 3&#xD;
           intakes a day (2 in the morning, 2 after the midday meal and 2 in the afternoon). Thus,&#xD;
           the total daily intake of xylitol in the Xyl group is fixed in 5.4 g and 1.8 g in the&#xD;
           Pol group. Subjects will be instructed to use the chewing gum immediately after main&#xD;
           meals and snacks. To the parents/guardians will be not requested to make changes in&#xD;
           dietary and oral hygiene habits of their children. Tooth brushing will be not allowed&#xD;
           for at least 1 h after the chewing gum use. All subjects will receive a fluoridated&#xD;
           toothpaste containing 1,450 mg/g NaF and a manual toothbrush to be used during the&#xD;
           experimental period, that will be supplied during the entire experimental period (2&#xD;
           years). All children will be instructed to brush teeth twice a day (after breakfast and&#xD;
           supper) for 2 minutes using vertical movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to evaluate the success of the administration of chewing gum at school,&#xD;
           teachers will receive chewing gums necessary for a single month at a time. Children will&#xD;
           have to return the empty blister packs when receiving those for the following month.&#xD;
           This procedure will be repeated for all experimental (chewing) period (1-year school&#xD;
           calendar/9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be the caries increment measured both at enamel and dentinal&#xD;
           level. The secondary outcomes will be the differences obtained comparing caries&#xD;
           increment and the variation of plaque pH in relation to the treatment decision.&#xD;
           Furthermore, a cost- effectiveness analysis will be performed using as outcome measure&#xD;
           the quality-adjusted life years (QALY).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be recruiting patients from August 2021 to September 2022. Each subject&#xD;
           will be enrolled for 36 months, estimating 9 months (one school year) of treatment and&#xD;
           27 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruitment will occur in Zanskar Valley (Ladakh): in Padum city.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assignment of interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation: sequence generation and concealment mechanism The random list will be&#xD;
           generated using a computer program (Microsoft Excel for Mac); the randomization will be&#xD;
           carried out on a school-class based by G.C. in permuted blocks of 2 or 4 with a random&#xD;
           variation of the blocking number, and 2 groups will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chewing gums will be supplied in plain white containers coded as 'green' or 'blue'&#xD;
           according to the group. The code is sealed by an independent monitor and not broken&#xD;
           until the statistical analysis will be finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
           All examinations of the children enrolled will be done by calibrated examiners. The&#xD;
           clinical examination of the enrolled sample will be performed at baseline (t0) and&#xD;
           repeated 12 months at the end of the chewing-gum administration period (t1) as interim&#xD;
           examination, after 12 months (t2) and 24 months (t3) after the end of the experimental&#xD;
           period (chewing gum use).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
           All personnel involved into the study will be blinded to the participant assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children, parents/caregivers and teachers responsible for the treatment, examiners who&#xD;
           will evaluate the outcomes and statistician who will analyse data will be blind to the&#xD;
           allocation group of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection, management, and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The follow-up assessments will be performed by a pre-calibrated blind examiner. The&#xD;
           clinical data will be recorded on electronic sheets organized on PageMaker and then&#xD;
           transferred to Microsoft Excel Software. The data will be cleaned, deleting those&#xD;
           revealing the participants' identities, will be share in a public repository at the&#xD;
           moment of the submission of the manuscripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data on caries will be based considering the tooth as the unit of analysis; the net&#xD;
           caries increment for initial, moderate and severe caries level, using ICDAS (Δ-initial,&#xD;
           Δ-moderate and Δ-severe), will be calculated in primary and permanent molars.&#xD;
           Differences between groups in terms of the caries increment will be evaluated using the&#xD;
           nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Kaplan-Meyer graphs will be constructed to evaluate&#xD;
           caries increment as primary outcome, and the methods will be compared to each other with&#xD;
           Cox regression with shared frailty. The calculation of sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
           accuracy will consider the results obtained with the indices and the classification of&#xD;
           the presence or not of caries lesion by the proposed reference standard. The&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio will also be verified, considering as effect, the prevention of&#xD;
           the primary outcome. For all tests, two-tailed analyses will be used, considering a&#xD;
           level of significance of 5%. The quality-adjusted life-year index (QALY) will be&#xD;
           calculated to assess the value of the preventive interventions.To determine QALYs, the&#xD;
           utility value associated with a given state of health by the years lived in that state&#xD;
           will be calculated. A year of life lived with no caries increment will be worth 1 QALY&#xD;
           (1 year of life × 1 Utility value].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses will be performed using the statistical package Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp, College&#xD;
           Station, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data monitoring An independent regulation of data collection, management and analysis&#xD;
           will be assumed independently by the authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Harms&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedures performed offer minimal risk to oral health of patients. Side effects of&#xD;
           the administration of both chewing gums will be assessed by means of a questionnaire&#xD;
           administered to the participants' parents after 3 months from the beginning of the&#xD;
           experimental period and a second time at the end of the administration (1 year after the&#xD;
           baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data entered will be conducted by one of the authors of the study. The data will be&#xD;
           weekly inspected. The inconsistencies will be verified, corrected and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethics and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research ethics approval, Consent and Assent&#xD;
&#xD;
           No official Ethical committee is present in the area of the survey. The study proposal&#xD;
           was submitted to the authorities of the Zanskar Tibetan Hospital Health Care &amp; Sowa&#xD;
           Rigpa Research Institute and its coordinator the Lama Zopta gave the approval for the&#xD;
           study. Each school involved in the survey gave also the approval. Due to language&#xD;
           problems and the low literacy rate of the population, verbal approval will be obtained&#xD;
           for children's participation by parents or guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be coded with identification numbers to guarantee confidentiality&#xD;
           during data analysis. Participants files will be stored in a secure room in the&#xD;
           Department of Restorative, Preventive and Pediatric Dentistry, University of Bern.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical trial data will be granted full access via public repository after acceptance&#xD;
           of the manuscripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ancillary and post-trial care&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parents/caregivers of the children participating the trial will receive information&#xD;
           about the children oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dissemination policy&#xD;
