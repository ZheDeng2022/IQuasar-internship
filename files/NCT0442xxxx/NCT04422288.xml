  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal posture and imbalance are known to be related to increased muscle expenditure, with&#xD;
      narrow &quot;cone of economy&quot; of muscle effort defining the most comfortable postures. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that predicting the posture of the lowest muscle effort available for a&#xD;
      patient with a given spinal alignment and body properties will correspond to the posture the&#xD;
      patient will most likely assume. Based on established musculoskeletal models, a model&#xD;
      application was configured to allow prediction of this optimal posture. This study aims to&#xD;
      assess the validity of this approach and the value of using biomechanical modeling for&#xD;
      pre-operative planning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to validate a novel method of post-operative posture&#xD;
      prediction - a full-body biomechanical model based on an established technology and&#xD;
      physiological reasoning. Specifically, the model ability to predict postoperative global&#xD;
      sagittal alignment, including compensatory and reciprocal changes, from pre-operative&#xD;
      radiographic imaging and the information about planned posture correction will be evaluated.&#xD;
      This will be realized by comparing model-predicted radiographic measures and overall balance&#xD;
      to follow-up patient radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having demonstrated model validity to predict postoperative posture will allow to use this&#xD;
      method for simulating various &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios to empower surgical planning by predicting&#xD;
      expected outcomes. This can be used to optimizing preoperative planning, which has a&#xD;
      potential to substantially improved surgery predictability and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, validated model will allow scientific investigation of the principles governing&#xD;
      human posture and biomechanics of the pathological spine. Generated scientific knowledge of&#xD;
      biomechanical factors influencing sagittal posture and surgery outcomes (e.g. number of&#xD;
      levels fused, amount and distribution of posture correction, etc.) can lead to improvements&#xD;
      in clinical management of spinal disorders.&#xD;
