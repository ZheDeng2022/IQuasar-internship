      undergo surgical resection of the primary breast tumor 7-10 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      lenvatinib. Post-operative adjuvant therapies will be at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      oncologist. Post-Surgery Follow-Up information will be collected at assessments at 3 months&#xD;
      post-op and after that every 6 months until 5 years after surgery&#xD;
