      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-64417184,&#xD;
      JNJ-68294291, and JNJ-65201526 after a single oral dose of JNJ-64417184 in adult participants&#xD;
      with various degrees of impaired renal function (moderate [optional], severe renal&#xD;
      impairment, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) not requiring hemodialysis) compared to&#xD;
      participants with normal renal function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with normal renal function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        must have normal renal function defined as: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&#xD;
        greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 milliliter per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73&#xD;
        m^2 (calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital&#xD;
             signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be&#xD;
             included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with moderate or severe renal impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        must meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study: must be&#xD;
        otherwise healthy except for the renal impairment and its underlying disease states and&#xD;
        mild comorbidities and participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical&#xD;
        examination, medical history, vital signs, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical&#xD;
        laboratory tests performed at screening. If there are abnormalities or results outside the&#xD;
        normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges&#xD;
        the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be&#xD;
        appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be&#xD;
        recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD): must have a hematocrit at screening&#xD;
             of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not smoke more than 10 cigarettes or 2 cigars or 2 pipes per day from within 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening until the end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any illness (unrelated to renal impairment or its underlying disease, as&#xD;
             appropriate) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of&#xD;
             the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the participant.&#xD;
             This may include but is not limited to history of relevant drug or food allergies,&#xD;
             history of cardiovascular or central nervous system disease, history or presence of&#xD;
             clinically significant pathology, chronic skin disease, or history of mental disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64417184 or any of its&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (example, extrasystole,&#xD;
             tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome&#xD;
             (example, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of clinically significant heart block or bundle branch block at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by&#xD;
             antibodies) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hepatitis A, B, or C infection, or current hepatitis A infection (confirmed&#xD;
             by hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection&#xD;
             (confirmed by hepatitis B surface antigen), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection&#xD;
