  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, crossover study enrolling experienced dual cannabis-tobacco smokers&#xD;
      (N=18) to describe the differences in THC and toxicant exposure, examining pharmacokinetic,&#xD;
      subjective, and cardiovascular effects from smoking and vaping dry herb cannabis. This study&#xD;
      will also examine the differences in toxicant exposure and cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      between smoking cannabis and smoking tobacco cigarettes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experienced dual cannabis-tobacco smokers will participate in a within-subject crossover&#xD;
      study with three blocks: smoked cannabis (purchased by participants from a local dispensary),&#xD;
      dry herb cannabis vaporizer, and usual brand tobacco cigarette. Each block will consist of 2&#xD;
      consecutive days on an inpatient research ward. The first inpatient day of each block will&#xD;
      comprise of two sessions: (1) The first session will be a standardized bout to compare&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and subjective effects of cannabis and tobacco use; (2) after 6&#xD;
      hours of abstinence, the second session will be ad libitum access to the assigned product for&#xD;
      2 hours to compare subjective effects (reward, satisfaction, craving reduction) and use&#xD;
      patterns. The second inpatient day will consist of ad libitum use of the assigned product&#xD;
      from 8:00 in the morning to midnight. An abstinence day will be added after the second day of&#xD;
      the last block to assess exposure and effects biomarkers during a period of abstinence from&#xD;
      cannabis (smoked/vaped) or tobacco.&#xD;
