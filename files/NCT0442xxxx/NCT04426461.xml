  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety disorders rank in the top ten causes of years lived with disability.&#xD;
      Less than 50% of patients experiencing long-lasting improvements to current gold-standard&#xD;
      treatments. Two gold-standard behavioral interventions include behavioral activation, focused&#xD;
      on enhancing approach behavior towards meaningful activities, and exposure-based therapy,&#xD;
      focused on decreasing avoidance and challenging negative expectations. While these&#xD;
      interventions have divergent treatment targets, there is little knowledge to inform which&#xD;
      strategies should be used in the frequent case of comorbid anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      Approach-avoidance decision-making paradigms focus on assessing responses when faced with&#xD;
      potential rewards and threats, tapping into processes important for both anxiety and&#xD;
      depression as well as behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, investigators will recruit individuals reporting both anxiety and depression&#xD;
      symptoms and randomize them to one of three different interventions: (1) behavioral&#xD;
      activation, (2) exposure-based therapy, and a non-specific therapy approach (3) supportive&#xD;
      therapy. Participants will complete clinical, self-report, behavioral, and functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments before and after therapy. Investigators will&#xD;
      use a computational approach to model factors that may influence one's behavior during&#xD;
      approach-avoidance decision-making, including drives to avoid threat versus approach reward&#xD;
      and confidence versus uncertainty in one's decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will accomplish the following aims (1) Determine how changes in brain and&#xD;
      behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict relate to changes in mental health&#xD;
      symptoms with the different therapy approaches, (2) Determine the degree to which baseline&#xD;
      brain and behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict predict response to the&#xD;
      different therapy approaches, above and beyond the influence of demographics and baseline&#xD;
      symptom severity. In addition, by including peripheral blood draws and measures of grace&#xD;
      matter volume, the project will also accomplish the following aims: (1) Determine whether&#xD;
      kynrenine metabolites measures peripherally may be beneficial as a biomarker of treatment&#xD;
      response and (2) determine whether there is an association between change in kynurenine&#xD;
      metabolites and changes in gray matter volume with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will enhance understanding of how different psychotherapy approaches (behavioral&#xD;
      activation, exposure-based therapy) may impact brain responses and decisions when faces with&#xD;
      potential reward versus threat and approach versus avoidance drives. In addition, results&#xD;
      will have important implications concerning the potential for a more personalized approach to&#xD;
      psychotherapy, enhancing knowledge of which types of therapy strategies may be most&#xD;
      beneficial for which individuals.&#xD;
