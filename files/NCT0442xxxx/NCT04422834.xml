  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empathy, which can be briefly defined as understanding and feeling of one's thoughts upon&#xD;
      experiences. It has been gaining importance in health care. A great majority of the&#xD;
      literature has been focusing on the aspect of physician and health care provider yet recently&#xD;
      establishing or measuring empathy has been performed with the undergraduate students. Since&#xD;
      empathy and its related dimensions are important to integrate a better skill to provide in&#xD;
      health care, measuring empathy gained attention. However, there might be lacking some tools&#xD;
      which assess empathy directly such as the Empathic Tendency Scale and the Empathic Skill&#xD;
      Scale in the Turkish language, yet these were discussed as cannot be quite modifiable to some&#xD;
      specific sub-groups such as health sciences students. Thus, this study is aimed to study for&#xD;
      the reliability, validity, and cross-cultural adaptation of the Turkish version of the&#xD;
      Jefferson Scale of Empathy for undergraduate health care students.&#xD;

      The research has been aimed at studying translation, validation, a cross-cultural adaptation&#xD;
      of the Turkish version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy for Health Professional Students&#xD;
      (JSE-HPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research was planned as a descriptive study. The research is planning to be performed&#xD;
      between May 2020 and October 2020. The students who are currently studying in the Faculty of&#xD;
      Health Sciences will be asked to participate in this study. Since ethical board approval was&#xD;
      taken in February 2020 and study was planned to start in March or April 2020. However, due to&#xD;
      the Covid-19 pandemic, the research in which test and re-test protocols should be performed&#xD;
      by students was re-planned by doing these protocols via internet-based forms. Before the&#xD;
      study, all participating students were informed about this study. To achieve their consent in&#xD;
      regard to participate in this study, a &quot;tick-box&quot; was placed prior to the questionnaire in&#xD;
      which whether they accept that participating in this study voluntarily. The primary target&#xD;
      for sample size was set as 300 students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive data will be gathered by using the Jefferson Scale of Empathy for health&#xD;
      professional students (JSE-HPS), the Turkish version of Empathic tendency scale (ETS), and&#xD;
      sociodemographic form in which age, gender, and other information will be requested to fill&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JSE-HPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      JSE-HPS was originally developed by Jefferson University. It consists of 20 items each scored&#xD;
      according to the seven-point Likert type scale in which 1 means &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; while 7&#xD;
      means &quot;Strongly agree&quot;. The minimum and maximum scores range from 20 to 140. Higher scores&#xD;
      indicate a better empathic aspect or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empathic Tendency Scale (ETS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETS was originally developed in the Turkish language in 1988. Turkish validation and&#xD;
      reliability of ETS were also conducted and found to reliable according to the Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha value is 0.82. ETS consists of 20 items each scored according to the five-point Likert&#xD;
      type scale in which 1 equals &quot;Completely contradictory&quot; while 5 means &quot;Completely proper&quot;.&#xD;
      Each item is related to some ideas which are quite common in daily life. 20 and 100 are&#xD;
      minimum and maximum scores, respectively. Higher scores indicate a better empathic aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation and Cross-cultural Adaptation Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The permission was granted from the copyright Holder of JSE-HPS in order to study the&#xD;
      reliability, validity, and adaptation of the Turkish version of JSE-HPS. The cultural&#xD;
      adaptation was performed according to the protocol explained by Beaton et al. Steps and a&#xD;
      detailed explanation of this protocol can be found in the literature. Briefly, an expert&#xD;
      committee consists of study researchers separately translated the original version of the&#xD;
      JSE-HPS into Turkish. The final version of the Turkish translated JSE-HPS was created&#xD;
      according to the separately translated ones. This final version was re-translated to English&#xD;
      by a native English speaker who is also capable to talk Turkish language. The expert&#xD;
      committee eventually made a final version to which can be applicable to the participants.&#xD;
