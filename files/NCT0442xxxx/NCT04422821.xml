  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance diagnosed for the first time in&#xD;
      pregnancy. According to literature GDM affects 3-10% of pregnant women and is a risk factor&#xD;
      for multiple maternal and fetal complications. During pregnancy GDM significantly increases&#xD;
      the risk of fetal macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, birth trauma and Cesarean section.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the long-term complications of GDM include increased risk of development of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus type 2 in the mother, as well as increased risk of obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome occurrence in their children. It has been well-documented that the risk of&#xD;
      above-mentioned complications increases with the level of maternal hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper glycemia control is one of the key elements in the effective treatment of GDM. Until&#xD;
      recently, glucose monitoring was solely performed using glucose meters, which required&#xD;
      multiple fingerpricks. Nowadays, due to the glycemia monitoring systems development, such as&#xD;
      flash glucose monitoring (FGM), glucose levels may be measured less invasively through&#xD;
      subcutaneous sensor application. As shown in one of the studies, FGM due to the ease of use,&#xD;
      was 3 times more often applied as a method of glycemia control than SMBG. As a result,&#xD;
      patients from FGM group had significantly better blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of our study is to evaluate the impact of new method of glycemia control&#xD;
      (FGM) on the efficacy of treatment of GDM. By analyzing results of this study, such as mean&#xD;
      glycemia levels, number of women requiring insulin therapy and maternal-fetal perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes the investigators will provide a scientific basis for more common use of FGM in the&#xD;
      population of pregnant women affected by GDM.&#xD;

      This is a randomized controlled trial performed at the 1st Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology of Medical University of Warsaw. The study will recruit 100 women at 24-28 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation . Women diagnosed with GDM, who will meet the inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      individually randomized to Flash Glucose Monitoring (n=50) or Self-Monitoring of Blood&#xD;
      Glucose (n=50) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will obtain instruction for using Freestyle Libre app to measure and collect&#xD;
      glycemia results using a mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be informed about proper use of glucose meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be obliged to measure fasting and 1-h postprandial glucose&#xD;
      concentrations in a daily manner, together with once per week midnight measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will obtain dietary recommendations for gestational diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      recommendations about daily physical activity in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess daily physical activity all participants will obtain a wristband allowing&#xD;
      for footsteps measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of patient's dietary habits will be based on Eating Assessment Test prepared by&#xD;
      the Polish National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory results of the mother and their newborns will be collected for&#xD;
      analysis during the course of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, at the follow-up visit research staff will retrieve maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes from patients medical history.&#xD;
