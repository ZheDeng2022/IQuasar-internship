  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, most assisted reproduction laboratories attempt to maintain as much as possible ex&#xD;
      vivo culture conditions comparable to those in vivo. Various culturing condition such as&#xD;
      temperature and pH parameters have been adjusted according to in vivo values in order to&#xD;
      improve in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Embryos of most mammals, including that of&#xD;
      humans, are not exposed to oxygen concentration higher than 8%. Thus, embryos and gametes&#xD;
      should be kept in a low oxygen environment during manipulation in assisted reproduction&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culturing embryos in low oxygen concentrations is now a general practice in IVF laboratories.&#xD;
      However, there are still laboratory procedures when the oocytes/embryos are exposed to&#xD;
      atmospheric oxygen. In most laboratories, oocytes retrieval is performed under atmospheric&#xD;
      oxygen concentration. Oocyte is very sensitive to environmental changes, for instance,&#xD;
      transient cooling to room temperature can cause irreversible disruption of the meiotic&#xD;
      spindle in human oocytes and oocyte in vitro maturation can lead to the decline of energy&#xD;
      metabolism in human oocytes. Whether oocyte exposed to atmospheric oxygen during oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval has detrimental effect on embryo development and IVF outcomes is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that low oxygen tension during embryo culture improved implantation&#xD;
      rate and clinical outcomes, but embryo quality was not affected. In other studies, embryo&#xD;
      quality was improved but overall pregnancy was not affected. The reason for the discrepancies&#xD;
      could be because the oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo manipulation was not under well&#xD;
      control. For instance, oocyte retrieval, fertilization check and embryo grading were&#xD;
      performed under atmospheric oxygen. It is difficult to predict how these factors negatively&#xD;
      impact the IVF outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators hypothesize that lower oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo&#xD;
      manipulation improves IVF outcomes.&#xD;

      In the experimental group, oocyte pickup will be performed in a lower oxygen tension&#xD;
      environment (5% oxygen, 89% nitrogen, 6% carbon dioxide); oocyte pickup will be performed in&#xD;
      a special workstation with reduced oxygen tension environment while fertilization check and&#xD;
      embryo grading will be performed in conventional and time lapse embryo culture system. The&#xD;
      time lapse culture system can provide a constant lower oxygen tension culture environment to&#xD;
      the embryos. In the control group, oocyte pickup, fertilization check and embryo grading will&#xD;
      be performed in atmospheric oxygen environment. Under this arrangement, the difference&#xD;
      between the 2 groups is the oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo manipulation. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that a solid conclusion can be drawn about whether lower oxygen tension&#xD;
      environment can benefit IVF outcomes.&#xD;
