  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between the large trochanter and the muscles adhering to it, trochanteric bursa and several&#xD;
      other bursa may be found. Trochanteric bursitis can be alone or together with tendinitis of&#xD;
      other bursa and adhering muscles. The first is called trochanteric bursitis, the second is&#xD;
      called hip periarthritis, which is difficult to distinguish clinically. It is more common in&#xD;
      women of middle age. The main complaint is the large trochanter and pain on the side of the&#xD;
      thigh. Pain is aggregated by walking abduction and external rotation by walking, lying down&#xD;
      with hip movements. The palpation is sensitive to the top of the large trochanter. There may&#xD;
      also be tenderness in the muscles in the lateral of the thigh. On plain radiographs, slight&#xD;
      irregularities or peritrocanteric calcifications can be seen in the large trochanter. Bone&#xD;
      scintigraphy shows local increased involvement. In differential diagnosis, stress fractures,&#xD;
      local infection and bone and soft tissue tumors should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest is recommended in treatment. Activities such as running, standing for a long time are&#xD;
      prohibited. Ice application can be given in the acute period. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      (SOAI) drugs, analgesics, TENS can be used for pain relief. In cases where conventional&#xD;
      treatments are insufficient, that is, the patient's pain is still continuing and functional&#xD;
      recovery is inadequate, some alternative methods are also applied. These treatments include&#xD;
      ozone, prolotherapy injection applications, dry needling, acupuncture, hirudotherapy,&#xD;
      phytotherapy, mesotherapy, balneotherapy, kinesiobanding, etc. d. In our study, we aim to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of ozone injection in patients diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis&#xD;
      and to compare steroid injection with the application of ozone therapy.&#xD;

      60 patients with trochanteric bursitis will be taken to the first and second groups by random&#xD;
      number generator method. Ozone therapy is planned for 30 patients in the first group, and&#xD;
      steroid injection is planned for the second group in 30 patients, and the study period is&#xD;
      planned to be 4.5 months. Patients between the ages of 18-75 will be admitted and no&#xD;
      difference will be made in terms of gender. The child will not be sick. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the doctor who made the injection. All patients will also be evaluated before&#xD;
      the first injection (T0), after treatment (T1) and after the first month (T2) after&#xD;
      treatment. VAS (visual analog scale), Nottingham Health Profile and Harris Hip Evaluation&#xD;
      Form will be used to evaluate patients. Our study is a randomized controlled prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment to be applied to patients will be selected randomly. Steroid injections will be&#xD;
      administered to patients in a single dose, while ozone injection will be applied in three&#xD;
      doses (1, 4, 7, 10 days), with a total of 4 doses. In ozone injection applications, while 1st&#xD;
      dose 25 gamma, 2nd dose 20 gamma, 3rd and 4th dose 15 gamma 10 cc ozone will be injected; 1ml&#xD;
      betamethasone will be used for steroid injection. The evaluation of the patients will be done&#xD;
      by a different physician than the physician who made the injections. The financial burden of&#xD;
      the treatment applied will be borne by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled prospective clinical trial. The sample size is 60&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

            <description>The patients in the ozone injection (OI) group received injections on the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th days. A gas mixture containing 10 cc of 5% O3 and 95% medical O2 at a concentration of 25 μg/ml in the first application, 20 μg/ml in the second application, and 15 μg/ml in the third and fourth applications was used. It was the same physician who prepared and administered ozone. Experience has shown that a single dose of ozone application is not sufficient, it must be applied in sessions for a strong effect. Therefore, we used 4 doses of OI instead of a single dose in our study.</description>

The solution to be administered to the CSI group was obtained by mixing 1 ml of 2% lidocaine and 1 ml of betamethasone (Diprospan 2 mg/1ml+5 mg/1ml). It was the same physician who prepared and administered the solutions. In the studies, it was generally applied as a single dose and mixed with local anesthetic (LA). Therefore, in our study, we also applied it as a single dose by mixing it with LA.</description>

            <description>The patients in the ozone injection (OI) group received injections on the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th days. A gas mixture containing 10 cc of 5% O3 and 95% medical O2 at a concentration of 25 μg/ml in the first application, 20 μg/ml in the second application, and 15 μg/ml in the third and fourth applications was used. It was the same physician who prepared and administered ozone. Experience has shown that a single dose of ozone application is not sufficient, it must be applied in sessions for a strong effect. Therefore, we used 4 doses of OI instead of a single dose in our study.</description>

It was the same physician who prepared and administered the solutions. In the studies, it was generally applied as a single dose and mixed with local anesthetic (LA). Therefore, in our study, we also applied it as a single dose by mixing it with LA.</description>
