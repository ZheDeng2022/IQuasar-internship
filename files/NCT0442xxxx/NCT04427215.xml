      mainly depression and anxiety, which can persist over years after completion of treatment.&#xD;
      These psychological impairments can aggravate symptom burden and can seriously affect&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Likewise, the diagnosis of cancer has not only a significant&#xD;
      impact on the affected patients, but also on their families, and may cause emotional&#xD;
      responses of shock, doubt, anxiety, and depression.&#xD;

      country claim for guidelines researches and to test the effectiveness of this practice to&#xD;
      support the use of some CAM therapies on mental health of patients as well as their families.&#xD;

      and Physical Activity ) on mental health and recovery of cancer patients as well as on&#xD;
      caregiving experiences and mental health of partners of cancer patients, it will be of great&#xD;
      value to improve and provide a more effective service and the quality of caring in this&#xD;
