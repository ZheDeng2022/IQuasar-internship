      Swallow disorders or dysphagia related to mechanical ventilation affects between 1,300 and&#xD;
      2,000 patients in Danish intensive care units every year and increases aspiration, pneumonia&#xD;
      and risk of dying. In intensive care units, dysphagia may vary around the clock as fatigue&#xD;
      and fluctuating alertness play an important role for the patients' ability to swallow&#xD;
      effectively without aspiration to the airway. For this reason, ICU nurses must be able to&#xD;
      assess dysphagia in the ICU patient day and night, but guidelines are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the simplest and most sensitive methods is the Yale Swallow Protocol, however, this&#xD;
      protocol requires translation and validation before it can be implemented in Danish intensive&#xD;
      care units. This project aims to translate and validate the Yale Swallow Protocol for use in&#xD;
      Danish intensive care units. Furthermore, this project will explore nurses' perceptions and&#xD;
      management of dysphagia in the intensive care unit as well as feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of the Yale Swallow Protocol.&#xD;

      Introduction Dysphagia caused by intubation and mechanical ventilation affects between 1.300&#xD;
      - 2.000 patients in Danish intensive care units (ICU's) every year. Dysphagia increases the&#xD;
      risk of aspiration, pneumonia, repeated mechanical ventilation and mortality. Despite this,&#xD;
      national and international guidelines for treating dysphagia in the ICU are lacking. In ICU&#xD;
      patients, dysphagia may vary around the clock as fatigue and cerebral status plays an&#xD;
      important role for the patients' ability to swallow effectively without aspiration. For this&#xD;
      reason, ICU nurses must be able to assess dysphagia in the ICU patient day and night. This&#xD;
      will be an important addition to assessments made by occupational therapists usually only&#xD;
      available in the morning hours. However, for nurses to be able to assess dysphagia in the ICU&#xD;
      patients; development and validation of screening procedures are highly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a validated screening procedure to detect dysphagia in ICU patients will&#xD;
      furthermore pave the way for the developing and testing nursing interventions aiming at&#xD;
      improving dysphagia in ICU patients. This may reduce complications and improve quality of&#xD;
      life in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia related to mechanical ventilation and intensive care The swallow function depends&#xD;
      on a complicated interplay between more than 30 muscle pairs, cranial nerves and areas in the&#xD;
      cortex and the medulla oblongata. Causes for dysphagia in ICU patients are only partially&#xD;
      understood, however, the following factors have been suggested as significant: 1) Trauma to&#xD;
      the pharynx caused by intubation (placing a tube for mechanical ventilation in the airway),&#xD;
      2) Neuromyopathy resulting in muscular weakness, 3) Decreased level of consciousness caused&#xD;
      by medication, delirium or critical illness. Moreover, these factors may cause dysphagia in&#xD;
      ICU patients to vary from day to night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia is a serious complication to critical illness, potentially increasing mortality.&#xD;
      Despite this, research shows that nursing practice varies greatly. Nurses have different&#xD;
      views on what constitutes safe swallowing. Nonetheless, it often falls upon nurses to assess&#xD;
      patients swallowing function and determine whether to offer the patient something to eat and&#xD;
      drink or not. Thus, developing valid screening methods that can be used by ICU nurses may&#xD;
      improve patient safety and reduce complications due to dysphagia caused by intubation,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing dysphagia using FEES Dysphagia can be diagnosed using instrumental methods such as&#xD;
      the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). This method is considered a gold&#xD;
      standard in assessing dysphagia. FEES may be performed bed-side by physicians or occupational&#xD;
      therapists by testing different foods and consistencies, but some patients find the FEES&#xD;
      disagreeable. A clinical examination by occupational therapists is another way to diagnose&#xD;
      dysphagia, however, silent aspiration without choking or coughing is difficult to detect in a&#xD;
      clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (NOTE: In Denmark, the speech language therapist is usually an occupational therapist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for dysphagia Screening for dysphagia in general hospital populations is possible&#xD;
      by using different screening methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most rigorously validated tests is the Yale Swallow Protocol (YSP). The YSP is a&#xD;
      three-step method consisting of an assessment of the patient's awareness, the patient's&#xD;
      ability to follow simple instructions and finally the patient's ability to drink 90 ml water&#xD;
      from a cup or by straw without stopping, choking or coughing. The YSP has high sensitivity of&#xD;
      0.96, thus effectively identifying patients who may safely begin oral feeding and drinking.&#xD;
      The specificity 0.5 indicates that patients who fail the YSP will need a specialized&#xD;
      assessment before eating and drinking is commenced. The clinical importance of this is that&#xD;
      nurses may employ the YSP at all hours to identify patients at risk, and thereby be able to&#xD;
      prevent aspiration detrimental to patient recovery. Moreover, patients not at risk can begin&#xD;
      oral feeding earlier, which may improve nutritional status and wellbeing in the patient.&#xD;
      However, dysphagia in ICU patients varies from other hospital patients because of intubation,&#xD;
      muscle weakness and alternating level of consciousness. Therefore it is necessary to validate&#xD;
      a translated version of the YSP on ICU patients to determine its predictive abilities. In&#xD;
      addition, skilled clinicians' uptake of a new screening method is a complex process.&#xD;
      Therefore, the feasibility and acceptability of the YSP in a Danish ICU needs to be explored&#xD;
      before the YSP can be recommended for implementation on a greater scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is systematic screening of dysphagia in ICU patients using the Yale Swallow protocol&#xD;
           feasible and acceptable to clinicians and patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can the Yale Swallow Protocol, administered by ICU nurses bed side 24 hours a day,&#xD;
           identify dysphagia in ICU patients? What are the predictive abilities compared to FEES&#xD;
           (gold standard)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Feasibility study. The aim of this study is to explore feasibility of implementing&#xD;
      and evaluating the YSP in a regional ICU and acceptability among clinicians and patients.&#xD;
      This includes exploring barriers and facilitators to screening ICU patients for dysphagia,&#xD;
      fidelity to the YSP and FEES methods and fidelity to recommendations for oral intake of food&#xD;
      and drinks based on the YSP and FEES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four-phased feasibility study will address feasibility of both the YSP and research&#xD;
      methods for study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective observational study, which will be adjusted based on the feasibility&#xD;
      study (study 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Screening 2-4 hours after extubation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability to swallow is assessed by an ICU nurse using the YSP. If the YSP is negative, the&#xD;
      patient may start oral feeding and drinking. In case of a positive YSP, the screening may be&#xD;
      repeated within the next 24 hours provided the patient improves clinically. If YSP continues&#xD;
      to be positive the patient is referred to assessment by a speech language pathologist (SLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Screening within 24 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate YSP against the FEES, the patient undergoes 1) YSP performed by an ICU nurse&#xD;
      followed by 2) FEES performed by an occupational therapist (until PAS&gt;6 (aspiration on any&#xD;
      food consistency on the Penetration Aspiration Scale). The occupational therapist will be&#xD;
      blinded to the assessment made by the ICU nurses. Patients will follow recommendations for&#xD;
      oral feeding and drinking as given by the occupational therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients, the following data will be recorded: time and results of the initial YSP&#xD;
      screening 2-4 hours post extubation, recommendation for oral feeding and drinking, time and&#xD;
      results of the YSP and the FEES performed within 24 hours of extubation and recommendation&#xD;
      for oral feeding and drinking. In addition, sex, age, diagnosis, Simplified Acute Physiology&#xD;
      Score (SAPSIII) , Charlson Comorbidity Index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, length&#xD;
      of stay in hospital, length of stay in ICU, time on mechanical ventilation, new pneumonia&#xD;
      following extubation, FOIS (Functional Oral Intake Scale) and death within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinicians performing the YSP and FEES, the following data will be recorded: age, sex,&#xD;
      profession, experience in years, and ICU experience in years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Given a prevalence of dysphagia among acute ICU patients of 18 %; a sensitivity&#xD;
      of YSP of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.5, then inclusion of 25 patients will be able to show a&#xD;
      negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.1 [95 % CI 0,00; 5,74], which means that almost all&#xD;
      patients passing the YSP will be without dysphagia. Estimating the attrition rate to be 25 %,&#xD;
      35 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Screening by YSP and assessment by FEES with 24 hours will be tabulated in a 2x2&#xD;
      table, calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative&#xD;
      predictive value of YSP compared to FEES. Correlations between patient characteristics will&#xD;
      be calculated using Pearson and Spearman correlation statistics as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants receive written and oral information about the purpose of the study and give&#xD;
      signed, informed consent. Relatives of patients are informed about the study. In case a&#xD;
      participant is affected adversely by participation, support will be offered by nurses and&#xD;
      physicians from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved by the Health Research Committee of Region Central Jutland. The study&#xD;
      is registered with Danish Data protection Agency and data will be stored in REDCap hosted by&#xD;
      Aarhus University and Midt-X, a research data site hosted by the Central Denmark Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be anonymized before shared or published; all data will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      If screening with the YSP can identify dysphagia in the critically ill patients, this will&#xD;
      allow oral feeding and drinking in many patients, leading to improved nutritional status and&#xD;
      increased patient satisfaction with no compromise of patient safety. Moreover, an effective&#xD;
      screening method for dysphagia may pave the way for developing nursing interventions to&#xD;
      prevent dysphagia from developing in the intensive care patient. In turn, this may reduce&#xD;
      complications, human suffering and costs.&#xD;
