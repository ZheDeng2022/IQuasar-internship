    <textblock>
      Assessing the changes in the brain-gut axis after weight loss surgery and their relationship&#xD;
      with weight loss and changes in eating behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese women undergoing weight loss surgery will be recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      These individuals will undergo a screening visit and 4 study visits. The study visits will&#xD;
      occur before, and at 1-, 6- and 12 months after the weight loss surgery. Each study visit&#xD;
      will include evaluation of brain function (fMRI), anthropometrics, blood and stool samples&#xD;
      and eating behaviors questionnaires.&#xD;

      before, and at 1-, 6- and 12 months after the weight loss surgery. Each study visit will&#xD;

      cytokines, metabolomics ) and stool samples (16S RNA and Metabolomics) and eating behaviors&#xD;
      questionnaires (YFAS, TFEQ, food cravings/preferences scales, 3-day food food intake records)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: weight loss after surgery and changes in eating behaviors scales (YFAS,&#xD;
      TFEQ) , metabolomics, appetite related hormones and gut microbiome (16S RNA) Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: changes in brain function (fMRI/MRS), diet (3-day food intake records) and&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire score at 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and 6-months after the bariatric surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a validated scale that is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I), disinhibition (Factor II), and hunger (Factor III). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint (better), uncontrolled (worse), or emotional eating (worse).</description>
