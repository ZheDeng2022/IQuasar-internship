  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II, single-arm, biomarker multi-institutional pilot study. Men&#xD;
      with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been&#xD;
      treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and at least one prior second generation&#xD;
      AR-targeted therapy (either abiraterone or enzalutamide) will be enrolled in this study. All&#xD;
      patients will receive treatment with testosterone cypionate 400 mg, intramuscular, every 28&#xD;
      days for a maximum of 3 cycles or limiting toxicity, if it occurs before the end of the&#xD;
      scheduled therapy. After 3 cycles of BAT (12 weeks), patients may continue receiving this&#xD;
      therapy off study at the discretion of the treating physician, if clinical/radiographic&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, patients will have plasma collected for cell-free tumor DNA analysis&#xD;
      and CTC ARV7 status and also will perform 68Gallium-PSMA PET at baseline and then every 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

             to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any uncontrolled major infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant&#xD;
             systemic disease, or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 12 months) myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
