  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer are still increasing in both developing&#xD;
      and developed countries. The number of women ≥70 years who are affected by breast cancer (BC)&#xD;
      worldwide is also on the increase. Based on the largest population and increasing aging, BC&#xD;
      is also rapidly increasing among the elderly in China. According to the epidemiological&#xD;
      profile data regarding BC in China, the second onset age peak of BC morbidity occurred after&#xD;
      70 years old and in 2020, the proportion of patients older than 65 is expected to exceed&#xD;
      one-fifth and reach 27.0% by 2030. However, some controversies remain to be resolved due to&#xD;
      the lack of high quality evidence. The tumor biological behavior, treatment choice and&#xD;
      treatment tolerance among the elderly prominently differ from their young counterparts.&#xD;
      Besides, they are rarely enrolled in large-scale randomized clinical trials or prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies and the results are obtained mainly from retrospective studies. Also, frequent&#xD;
      deviations from the standard guidelines lead to insufficient or excessive treatments, though&#xD;
      the so-called standard guidelines are based on the clinicopathological characteristics and&#xD;
      research findings among the younger BC patients. Studies focusing on the global population&#xD;
      confirmed that the biological behavior of tumors among elderly patients was more favorable&#xD;
      compared with younger patients but did not transform into survival benefits eventually.&#xD;
      Numerous prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated that breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      (BCS), consisting of segmental mastectomy and radiation treatment with or without axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection (ALND), is equivalent to mastectomy in terms of overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      and disease free survival (DFS) for patients with early stage breast carcinoma. Presentation&#xD;
      of the ACOZOG-Z011 study results in 2011 resulted in a downward trend in the use of a&#xD;
      completion axillary lymph node dissection in early breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive&#xD;
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), treated with wide local excision (WLE) and whole breast&#xD;
      irradiation. However, there is little evidence regarding the optimal axillary treatment in&#xD;
      elderly breast cancer patients, since these patients are often excluded from clinical trials.&#xD;
      We had done a retrospective study of breast cancer in the elderly, which demonstrated that&#xD;
      those who with complex comorbidities receiving wide local excision merely were about 1.5&#xD;
      times more than those who without (71.2% vs 46.0%, p&lt;0.001). However, it is paradoxical that,&#xD;
      on the one hand, the risk of dying from breast cancer may increase if patients do not receive&#xD;
      the standard treatment; on the other hand, they could not live long enough to benefit or even&#xD;
      suffer more from the standard treatment. The key is to figure out who they are. Given the&#xD;
      high proportion of patients treated only with WLE, we believe that it is important to compare&#xD;
      the effects of different surgical procedures on prognosis among the elderly BC patient in a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study, to be more specific, comparing the WLE versus any other surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
