    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of selinexor in combination with standard of care (SoC) therapy for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) or recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 phases: a Phase 1a dose finding study followed by Phase 1b (dose expansion)&#xD;
      and a Phase 2 randomized efficacy exploration study and will independently evaluate 3&#xD;
      different combination regimens in 3 treatment arms in patients with nGBM (Arms A and B) or&#xD;
      with rGBM (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: evaluating the combination of selinexor with radiation therapy (S-RT) in nGBM&#xD;
           participants with uMGMT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: evaluating the combination of selinexor with radiation therapy and temozolomide&#xD;
           (TMZ) (S-TRT) in nGBM participants with&#xD;
           methylated-O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (mMGMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: evaluating the combination of selinexor with lomustine (or carmustine, if&#xD;
           lomustine is not available) (S-L/C) in rGBM participants regardless of MGMT status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm D: evaluating the combination of selinexor with bevacizumab in rGBM participants&#xD;
           regardless of MGMT status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm E: evaluating the combination of selinexor with tumor treating fields (TTField) in&#xD;
           rGBM participants regardless of MGMT status&#xD;
