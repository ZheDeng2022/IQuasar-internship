  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of pain and change in pain between each time point will be assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES scale with use of thermomechanical device delivering stimuli, without delivering stimuli, and with use of ethyl chloride skin refrigerant spray.</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to treatment, immediately after the needle insertion, during infiltration and 5 seconds after needle extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be self-reported, using the Wong-Baker FACES (0-10, with 0 representing absence of pain and 10 unbearable pain). Participants will be questioned about their level of pain in their nail prior to treatment, immediately after the needle insertion, during infiltration, and 5 seconds after needle extraction</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with at least one adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed for 3 days following their nail injection</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will only include those that are determined to be related to the study device</description>
