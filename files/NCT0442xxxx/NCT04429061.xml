  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;SKILLZ,&quot; is a mixed methods evaluation of the Grassroots Soccer (GRS) SKILLZ Package based&#xD;
      in Lusaka, Zambia. The package is made up of three football-based programs: (1) SKILLZ-Girl -&#xD;
      implemented in schools as part of a 10-week program culminating in a tournament event; (2)&#xD;
      SKILLZ-Club - implemented as an ongoing extra-curricular activity after the completion of&#xD;
      SKILLZ-Girl; (3) SKILLZ-Plus - a clinic based football group targeted at girls that are&#xD;
      HIV-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programs work together to build a continued support system which encourages uptake of&#xD;
      Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) and HIV services, while facilitating ART adherence (for&#xD;
      HV-positive participants) and continued engagement with health services over the long-term&#xD;
      (whether to contraceptive methods, HIV prevention services, HIV repeat testing, and/or HIV&#xD;
      treatment and care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team has developed an enhanced SKILLZ-Girl offering, which will include a&#xD;
      comprehensive module on HIVST, contraceptives and PrEP, access to a nurse during the&#xD;
      implementation of sessions and the additional offering of HIVST and contraceptive services at&#xD;
      the event along with ongoing engagement through the SKILLZ-Club program (Enhanced Arm) , The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that this enhanced curriculum will increase HIV testing and&#xD;
      contraceptive uptake compared to the standard SKILLZ curriculum &amp; standard event (SOC Arm).&#xD;
      The investigators further hypothesize that the intervention in the enhanced arm will&#xD;
      positively and directly affect a number of mediating factors including attendance at soccer&#xD;
      events where community-based SRH services are offered, SRH knowledge, empowerment,&#xD;
      self-confidence, and perceptions of gender balance, and (reduced) stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For girls found to be HIV-positive, the follow-on SKILLZ intervention (SKILLZ-Plus) has been&#xD;
      designed to facilitate linkage to HIV care and treatment, reduce HIV-related stigma, increase&#xD;
      disclosure to family and partners, increase feelings of social support, empowerment,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and ultimately adherence to ARVs, viral load suppression (VLS) and retention&#xD;
      in HIV care and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in up to 32 secondary schools that GRS currently serves in the&#xD;
      Lusaka Urban District.&#xD;

      Research aim(s)/General Objective and Specific Objectives Aim 1: (a) Assess the impact of&#xD;
      SKILLZ over two years on HIV testing and (b) SRH-related prevention services uptake among&#xD;
      adolescent girls aged 16-19 in up to 23 intervention schools (with enhanced HIVST, PrEP, and&#xD;
      contraceptive method offerings) compared to up to 23 control schools using a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: (b) Describe linkage to care and treatment, and viral load suppression and retention&#xD;
      at 6, 12, and 18 months for girls who are identified to be HIV+ during the study, using&#xD;
      qualitative, programmatic, and administrative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be achieved by i) using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach that&#xD;
      compares girls aged 16 and over in approximately 23 SKILLZ control schools compared to&#xD;
      approximately 23 schools where SKILLZ will be delivered with the enhanced HIVST and a variety&#xD;
      of contraceptive method offerings; and ii) through a cohort model using pre-existing&#xD;
      SmartCare data on HIV+ individuals in care to match to adolescent girls aged 16 and over from&#xD;
      the same district (Lusaka) who are identified to be HIV+ at any time during SKILLZ-Girl or&#xD;
      SKILLZ-Club participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine how the intervention works including lessons learned for future implementation&#xD;
      by&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conducting a process evaluation to identify mediators, predictors, and barriers to&#xD;
           uptake of the SKILLZ-Girl, Club, and Plus curricula both quantitatively through&#xD;
           mediation and moderation analyses and qualitatively through a sequential explanatory&#xD;
           approach using focus groups discussions, interviews and observation with coaches and&#xD;
           girls; and by&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. monitoring fidelity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Estimate the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness and return on investment of the&#xD;
      SKILLZ Girl, Club, and Plus curricula for improving health outcomes for adolescent girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed-methods evaluation of the SKILLZ intervention using the following approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental cohort of school-aged 16-year-old and over females to be followed for a&#xD;
      period of 18 month will be evaluated with a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to&#xD;
      estimate HIV testing uptake and sexual/reproductive health services use. Primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be measured at several timepoints longitudinally across up to 23&#xD;
      schools offering the SKILLZ-Girl and SKILLZ-Clubs program and up to 23 schools offering the&#xD;
      &quot;standard of care&quot; (SOC) and SOC Clubs. Recruitment is anticipated to take 6 months on a&#xD;
      rolling basis. The order in which schools will be selected will be random. Participants will&#xD;
      be clustered at the school-level; a random sample of girls will be enrolled from each&#xD;
      participating school, aged 16-years at the commencement of SKILLZ-Girl and who are in a grade&#xD;
      where GRS is offering the SKILLZ-Girl curriculum All enrolled girls will be followed over the&#xD;
      18 months' time period to assess SRH service uptake, including HIV testing. It is estimated&#xD;
      that the majority (~98%) of girls testing for HIV will likely be HIV-negative, based on&#xD;
      estimates from programmatic GRS data. While HIV-positive girls will continue to participate&#xD;
      in the school-based SKILLZ-Girl and Clubs activities and followed for SRH use, they will also&#xD;
      be offered contemporaneous enrolment into SKILLZ-Plus upon infection; retention in care and&#xD;
      Viral Load Suppression (VLS) at 6, 12, and 18 months will be measured for this subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation: A process evaluation will be conducted to better understand the casual&#xD;
      pathways and effect mediators and moderators using mixed methods approaches, including&#xD;
      supplemental qualitative data collection. To investigate reasons why the program components&#xD;
      (SKILLZ-Girl, Club &amp; Plus) might fail or succeed in different schools or communities and&#xD;
      assess intervention effect mediators and moderators for HIV testing and contraceptive use&#xD;
      uptake we will use a mixed methods approach involving: (1) quantitative analyses of baseline&#xD;
      survey data for testing how variables can moderate the observed impact of the intervention,&#xD;
      and (2) qualitative data collected from a subset of SKILLZ participants in the evaluation&#xD;
      cohort and their coaches to further understand potential mediating pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity monitoring: The study includes measures to monitor fidelity of the intervention&#xD;
      implementation, including receptivity to and understanding of the intervention amongst&#xD;
      participants, the perceived appropriateness and relevancy of the intervention for adolescent&#xD;
      girls in school, and the extent to which the intervention was delivered per protocol in&#xD;
      different communities and schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation: Time permitting (given the uncertainty of delays due to COVID), the&#xD;
      study will estimate the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness and return on investment of&#xD;
      SKILLZ for improving health outcomes for adolescent girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection plan and tools SmartCare electronic data: All antiretroviral therapy services&#xD;
      offered as part of the study will be captured in the National EMR, SmartCare, which permits&#xD;
      measuring of utilization and clinical outcomes (i.e., Linkage to Care, VLS) at soccer events,&#xD;
      mobile clinics, and public clinics in Lusaka. VLS is defined as below detection, i.e., less&#xD;
      than 50 copies/ml. Retention in care will also be measured using SmartCare data on pharmacy&#xD;
      visits and defined as accessing pharmacy within a 90-day window of visits. Consent will be&#xD;
      requested from all participants as part of the consent process to access their SmartCare&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth-Friendly services electronic data: Depending on the location of the school, the girl's&#xD;
      residential address and/or her own personal preferences, participants will be referred to&#xD;
      either the PEPFAR Funded DREAMS houses or the M.A.C. funded youth-friendly spaces based in&#xD;
      local MOH clinics in order to access ongoing SRH services not provided by the coaches in&#xD;
      their CBD role (this will include accessing PrEP, STI testing and long-term contraceptive&#xD;
      methods). All interactions with the DREAMS houses or M.A.C centres (including meeting with&#xD;
      counsellors, referral and uptake of services) are captured in their respective electronic&#xD;
      databases. Consent will be requested from all participants as part of the consent process to&#xD;
      allow researchers to access either DREAMS or M.A.C data should they chose to access either of&#xD;
      these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey at baseline: A baseline survey will be administered to approximately 50 girls per&#xD;
      school randomly selected to participate in the evaluation to collect information on school&#xD;
      characteristics, sexual behaviour, age, HIV knowledge, maternal education, baseline HIV&#xD;
      status, and sexual/reproductive health uptake and retention. These variables will be used as&#xD;
      covariates and moderators for service uptake and retention. The target sample of&#xD;
      approximately 1380 girls will respond to a survey self-administered using ODk software upon&#xD;
      informed consent. The survey will be available in English, Nyanja and Bemba. Coaches and&#xD;
      study staff will on site be help girls navigate the survey. If during baseline, it appears&#xD;
      that there has been sufficient time to measure change, or the full SKILLZ-Girl curriculum was&#xD;
      not administered, the baseline survey may be re-administered to assist with validation of&#xD;
      responses (as opposed to implementing the follow-up survey provided below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey post-SKILLZ-Girl event, 6-, 12-, and 18 months: A total of approximately 30 girls per&#xD;
      school (regardless of HIV status) will respond to a ODK survey to collect information on&#xD;
      sexual behaviour, HIV knowledge, maternal education, sexual/reproductive health uptake and&#xD;
      retention. Post-SKILLZ-Girl survey data will be used to assess the effect of SKILLS Girl and&#xD;
      SKILLZ-Club on the outcomes of interest. In schools selected to offer SKILLZ-Club, surveys&#xD;
      will be conducted during club attendance approximately 6 months after the SKILLZ-Girl&#xD;
      community soccer event. Surveys will be completed individually by the participant on a secure&#xD;
      tablet physically or via phone. Study staff will be available to assist participants to&#xD;
      navigate the survey if they request assistance. If a participant has opted to not attend the&#xD;
      clubs or has since left or changed schools, the coaches and study staff will attempt to trace&#xD;
      participants in the community in order to complete the follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where a participant is contacted for follow-up and it is discovered that she has left Lusaka,&#xD;
      Chilanga, Chongwe and Kafue districts and it is not possible for study staff to arrange a&#xD;
      visit to meet with her, a personalized survey link will be sent to her via email or WhatsApp&#xD;
      (based on the participant's preference). She will then be invited to complete and submit the&#xD;
      survey online. Alternatively, if the participant prefers study staff will complete the survey&#xD;
      with the participant over the phone and enter their responses directly into ODK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the schools selected not to offer SKILLZ-Club, GRS will arrange for a 2-hour meeting&#xD;
      session with all participants still enrolled at that school, where all participants will&#xD;
      complete the surveys. If a participant opts to not attend the meeting or has since left or&#xD;
      changed schools, the coaches and study staff will attempt to trace participants in the&#xD;
      community in order to complete the follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual-level data will be collected on clinical, laboratory, and demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, including retention in care and VLS at 6, 12 and 24 months. Using case&#xD;
      reporting forms (CRFs), the team will collect study-specific data, including information&#xD;
      obtained directly from participants, routine programmatic data from GRS and abstract routine&#xD;
      clinical data from paper-based medical records, the SmartCare Electronic Management Records&#xD;
      (EMR), CIDRZ Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and DREAMS electronic management&#xD;
      system. Routinely collected individual-level clinical data are first written onto forms in&#xD;
      the paper medical record and then entered into the SmartCare EMR. SmartCare serves as a&#xD;
      repository of clinical data for HIV-infected individuals and includes such data fields as:&#xD;
      ART initiation date, ART regimen, visit dates, and laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRS will collect programmatic data through a combination of paper and electronic data entry&#xD;
      via tablets, with all data stored securely in RedCap. Where paper files are used for&#xD;
      programmatic management, data will be manually entered by study staff directly into the&#xD;
      RedCap database. De-identified data will made available to GRS co-investigators to enable&#xD;
      review of key fidelity and quality indicators in order to monitor implementation in real&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper study files will be stored in secured, locked cabinets located in locked rooms&#xD;
      available to study staff only. A secure server will be used to store encrypted study data,&#xD;
      including the study database. All personal identifiers will be removed prior to generating&#xD;
      the analytical dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be obtained using digital audio recorders. Recorded data will be transferred on&#xD;
      to a lockable computer kept by the co-principal investigator leading the qualitative&#xD;
      research. Transcripts will go through a QA/QC process where researchers will cross check&#xD;
      randomly selected transcribed verbatim with the recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan The primary outcome is the probability of testing for HIV at any time&#xD;
      during the period when SKILLZ is delivered through to 24 months after the final soccer event.&#xD;
      The primary analysis for Aim 1 will follow a difference-in-difference (DID) effect between&#xD;
      study arms. The outcome of interest will be regressed on an indicator of study arm assignment&#xD;
      interacted with a dichotomous variable POST which indicates the outcome after the&#xD;
      intervention is implemented; this differentiates baseline and end-line for each study arm,&#xD;
      controls for any time dependent variables that might confound the effect, as well as any&#xD;
      time-invariant observed or unobserved confounders that might differ between study arm&#xD;
      schools. Clustering by school will be accounted for by a generalized estimating equation&#xD;
      approach. Intention-to-treat (ITT) will be evaluated by including all girls in the evaluation&#xD;
      cohort assigned to each arm rather than all girls who actually participated in SKILLZ.&#xD;
