  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative disease. Patients present with&#xD;
      involuntary movements of the body and cognitive symptoms like behavioral problem, difficulty&#xD;
      in planning tasks, etc. No effective treatment is currently available for them apart from&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy. Currently, studies are going on the effectiveness of noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (NIBS) in neurodegenerative diseases. It is a mode of brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      where current is delivered into the brain by placing electrodes into their scalp.&#xD;
      Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) is a new modality of noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation. It is a device that generates electrical impulses. The current generated from&#xD;
      this device can stimulate underlying brain areas. The investigators have planned to study the&#xD;
      feasibility of non-invasive brain stimulation via tPCS in these patients of Huntington's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, the investigators will rate their involuntary body movement by a standard scale,&#xD;
      assess arm movements by a robotic device, assess speech with standard protocol, assess brain&#xD;
      electrophysiology by electroencephalography (EEG) and will also do gait (walking) analysis.&#xD;
      Next, the investigators will give them 2 week (20 min/day) stimulation via real tPCS (active&#xD;
      stimulation) or placebo (sham stimulation). After 2 weeks of stimulation, the investigators&#xD;
      will re-assess the patient using the same tools mentioned pre-stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive real and placebo stimulation with a 1-month gap in between. They&#xD;
      will not know whether they are receiving real stimulation or placebo. Assessment will be done&#xD;
      before stimulation, after 2 week real stimulation and after 2 week sham stimulation.&#xD;

      The investigators have planned to study the feasibility of non-invasive brain stimulation via&#xD;
      Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) in patients of Huntington's disease. Anodal&#xD;
      stimulation will be given to the brain area based on quantitative electroencephalography&#xD;
      (qEEG) findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed clinically by standard rating scale (UHDRS) and by qEEG, KinArm and&#xD;
      Gait - before and after 2 week (20 min per day) stimulation via tPCS or sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have planned to assess-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Speech&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upper limb movement via KinArm. Standard KinArm testing protocol will be used which is&#xD;
           used universally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gait via Gait Carpet (Zeno Walkway)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Scale for Huntington's disease (UHDRS) tPCS will be delivered through a pair of&#xD;
           saline-soaked (0.9% NaCl) surface sponge electrodes. Anode will be placed on the scalp&#xD;
           over the area based on qEEG findings. Participant's speech will be recorded using a&#xD;
           head-mounted microphone (AKGc520) and a digital recording device (Zoom H4nPro) while&#xD;
           performing the following calibrated tasks (Calibration involves a sound level meter&#xD;
           placed at 15cm from the mouth while talker says 'ah' at 70dBA) - a. Prolonged 'ah'. b.&#xD;
           Rapid repetitions of the sounds &quot;puh&quot;, &quot;tuh&quot;, and &quot;kuh&quot;. c. Two productions of a&#xD;
           sentence with selected speech sounds (s, sh, p, b, t, i, a, u, ae, ai). &quot;She saw Patty&#xD;
           buy two poppies.&quot; d. Two times louder production of a sentence with selected speech&#xD;
           sounds. &quot;She saw Patty buy two poppies.&quot; e. Repetition of a continuous vowel at normal&#xD;
           and fast rates. 'eye-eye-eyeeye- eye' without making any voice breaks or pauses&quot;. f.&#xD;
           Read aloud a section of a standard passage - standard rainbow passage g. Monologue. Talk&#xD;
           for two minutes about an interesting vacation (or an interesting hobby or activity). The&#xD;
           Zeno walkway will be used in conjunction with the ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis&#xD;
           Software (PKMAS) . The walkway contains a series of pressure sensors to detect&#xD;
           footfalls. These data will be captured and collated via the PKMAS software, resulting in&#xD;
           numerous spatial, temporal and pressure-related gait parameters. Timed-up-and-go (TUG)&#xD;
           task will be used, consisting of rising from chair, walking across the 20-foot gait&#xD;
           carpet, turning around off the carpet, walking back and sitting down. This will be&#xD;
           performed over 3 trials. Gait analysis provides various parameters as output such as&#xD;
           stride length, line of progression, step length, toe-offs and other temporal and spatial&#xD;
           parameters for analysis. Neurophysiological EEG signals will be recorded, eyes-closed,&#xD;
           no-task, using g.Nautilus g.tec wireless system. The g.tech system uses earclip&#xD;
           reference sensors. The subject will be in a quiet place with less light or&#xD;
           electromagnetic perturbations. During the resting state recordings, patients are seated&#xD;
           in a comfortable arm chair and will be instructed to keep relaxed, with their eyes&#xD;
           closed for 5 min. A paired t test will be used to compare baseline data and post tPCS&#xD;
           data. Descriptive analysis of the neurological examination findings will be provided.&#xD;
