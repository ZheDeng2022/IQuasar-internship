      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is one of the most complex, prevalent, debilitating neurologic disorder in the&#xD;
      world. In clinical experience, there are limitation over western medicine for migraine,&#xD;
      especially some extra adverse effects. In traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), there are some&#xD;
      reviews and clinical practice point out acupressure at PC6 could relieve nausea/ vomiting and&#xD;
      pain while migraine. Recent researches also mention Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)&#xD;
      and Neurokinin A (NKA) in some degree correlated with the mechanism of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGRP and NKA play vital roles of migraine. In comparison with oral medication only and PC6&#xD;
      acupressure via oral medication, if there were better effect for migraine control. In&#xD;
      addition, investigators evaluate the plasma CGRP and NKA level before and after study to&#xD;
      figure out if any positive value and any correlation with acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial, total of 56 patients with migraine&#xD;
      were divided equally into acupressure group (modern routing standard therapy plus PC6&#xD;
      acupressure) and control group (modern routing standard therapy). Before intervention, the&#xD;
      participants needed to finish the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire&#xD;
      evaluation. After 6 weeks, investigators will evaluate the severity, frequencies of headaches&#xD;
      and pain-killer consumption as primary outcome. In addition, investigators will investigate&#xD;
      if there were change of serum CGRP/NKA level after 6 weeks and the score changes of MOS&#xD;
      36-Item Short-Form Health Survey as secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that PC6 acupressure may not only reduce severity, frequencies and&#xD;
      duration of headaches but also reduce the dose of NSAIDs. In addition, the PC6 acupressure&#xD;
      also may reduce levels of serum CGRP and NKA, and improve the quality of life meanwhile.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is one of the most complex, prevalent, debilitating neurologic disorder and the&#xD;
      prevalence higher in female group. In general, there are many kinds of therapy for migraine&#xD;
      nowadays including of acute abortion oral drugs such as triptan, ergotamine, non-steroid&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and preventive agents such as calcium channel blocker&#xD;
      (Flunarizine), anti-epileptic drugs (valproic acid, Topiramate, Pregabalin), beta&#xD;
      adrenergic-blocker (Propranolol), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors(SSRI), anti-emetic&#xD;
      agents (Prochlorperazine) and other injection therapy such as Onabotulinum Toxin A or CGRP&#xD;
      (Calcitonin gene-related peptide) antagonist etc. The CGRP plays an important role of&#xD;
      trigemino-vascular responses in migraine. The serum CGRP levels elevated while migraine&#xD;
      attack and chronic migraine, therefore, CGRP is a potential biomarker. In recent studies,&#xD;
      higher plasma CGRP level during interictal phase of migraine or chronic migraine is indicated&#xD;
      the better response for Onabotulinum Toxin A and reduced plasma CGRP level can relieve the&#xD;
      discomfort of migraine. Neurokinin A (NKA) levels of venous blood are significantly higher in&#xD;
      responders than these nonresponse before the rizatriptan treatment, whereas reduced the&#xD;
      levels of both CGRP and NKA one hours after the treatment . The headache is associated with&#xD;
      nausea in about 80% of episodes, vomiting in about 30% in patients with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PC6 is belong to pericardium meridian locates the anterior aspect of forearm between the&#xD;
      tendons of the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis, 2 cun proximal to the wrist&#xD;
      transverse stripes just on the median nerve . The antiemetic is lower for preventing&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting in the combination PC6 acupoint stimulation than these&#xD;
      patients with antiemetic only. Acupuncture at the PC6 is an effective alternative treatment&#xD;
      to conventional pharmacological treatment and resulted in almost immediate cessation of&#xD;
      intraoperative nausea and vomiting. Therefore, acupressure at PC6 is an effective and safety&#xD;
      method for nausea and vomiting. In addition, stimulation at PC6 can activate hypothalamic&#xD;
      orexin neurons, and that release orexins to induce analgesia. Taken together, PC6 stimulation&#xD;
      can produce effect of both analgesia and antiemetic effects. The present study suppose&#xD;
      stimulation at PC6 is beneficial for the treatment of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators designed a single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of acupressure at PC6 on headache in patients with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) Participants The patients with migraine were enrolled from the outdoor patients (OPD) of&#xD;
      neurological department, Yunlin branch of National Taiwan University hospital. The basic&#xD;
      laboratory data including peripheral blood cells, Na/K/Ca/Mg, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),&#xD;
      creatinine, iron/total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)/ferritin to exclude extremely abnormal&#xD;
      metabolic disturbance or liver/renal functional impairment which may cause secondary&#xD;
      headache; and the awake electroencephalography (EEG) and brain image including computer&#xD;
      tomography (C-T) or magnetic resonance image (MRI) also were done to rule out any&#xD;
      intracranial structure lesion prior to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The migraine was diagnosed according to clinical manifestation and criteria from beta version&#xD;
      of the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3). In&#xD;
      addition, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as episodic way while&#xD;
      migraine attack and Propranolol (Inderal R) is used as preventive way no matter when migraine&#xD;
      attack. In addition, the participants needed to finish the Migraine Disability Assessment&#xD;
      (MIDAS) questionnaire evaluation of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Study design: Single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. (C) Assessment time:&#xD;
      before PC6 acupressure (V1), two weeks after acupressure (V2), four weeks after acupressure&#xD;
      (V3) and six weeks after acupressure (D) Statistical analysis : Categorical data will be&#xD;
      displayed in numbers and percentages, whereas continuous variables will be given as means Â±&#xD;
      standard deviations or median (Q1, Q3). Differences in categorical variables will be tested&#xD;
      using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test and differences in continuous variables will&#xD;
      be tested using the two sample independent t test or Mann-Whitney test between groups. The&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to compare the change of primary outcomes&#xD;
      over time (the four time points (V1-V4)) between two groups. A p value of less than 0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      SPSS Statistics 24or R version 3.4.4 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the present study predicts that PC6 acupressure may reduce severity of&#xD;
      headaches, the frequency of headache attacks and duration of headache, and also reduce the&#xD;
      dose of NSAID. In addition, the PC6 acupressure also may reduce levels of serum CGRP and NKA,&#xD;
      and also may improve the quality of life.&#xD;
