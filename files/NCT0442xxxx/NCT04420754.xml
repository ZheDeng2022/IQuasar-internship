      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and determine the recommended dose of&#xD;
      AIC100 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory poorly&#xD;
      differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and determine the recommended&#xD;
      dose of AIC100 for phase II study in patients with relapsed/refractory poorly differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancer and in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer that are BRAF wild-type, or&#xD;
      BRAF mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer after failure of BRAF-mutant specific therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis for collection of autologous&#xD;
      lymphocytes. The autologous T cells will be transfected and expanded in-vitro to generate the&#xD;
      AIC100 product. After lymphodepleting therapy, AIC100 will be infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, AIC100, consists of autologous CAR T cells containing the I domain of&#xD;
      lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and targeting its over-expressed&#xD;
      physiological ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on thyroid cancer. AIC100&#xD;
      cells also express the transmembrane domain of CD8 alpha and intracellular domains of the&#xD;
      co-stimulatory receptors CD28 and 41BB, and the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the T cell&#xD;
      receptor associated CD3. In addition, AIC100 cells express the somatostatin receptor subtype&#xD;
      2 (SSTR2), which should enable CAR T cell imaging in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment with AIC100 is a single dose infusion. However, additional infusions may be&#xD;
      administered if the following conditions are met: (1) patient shows stable disease or partial&#xD;
      response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 after 30 days, (2)&#xD;
      the investigator has deemed it is in the best interest of the patient, (3) patient did not&#xD;
      experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and (4) there are cell doses available from the&#xD;
      already manufactured cell product. The cell dose for subsequent infusions will be similar to&#xD;
      that of the initial dose. In individual cases and only with the explicit approval of the Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a higher dose&#xD;
      could be administered. This would typically be justified by efficacy and toxicity data&#xD;
      generated in other participants. Prior to additional infusions, lymphodepleting chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be staggered so that each patient will be followed for at least 30 days prior&#xD;
      to enrollment of the next patient for the initial Dose 1 cohort. This is a dose escalation&#xD;
      study using cohorts of 3 patients. Patients will receive a flat dose of 1 x 10e7, 1 x 10e8 or&#xD;
      5 x 10e8 viable CAR T cells with a dose -1 Cohort of 1 x 10e6&#xD;
