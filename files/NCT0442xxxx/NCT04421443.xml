  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot study with a multiple baseline experimental desing will verify the&#xD;
      feasibility and clinical utility of the Unified Protocol, applied in an online group format&#xD;
      in a mental health setting of the Spanish national health system to patients waiting for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery with diagnosis or symptoms of Emotional Disorders&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently becoming a serious global public health problem due to the high&#xD;
      prevalence and the large increase in recent years. This condition is associated with&#xD;
      different health problems, including physical and mental diseases. The presence of anxiety or&#xD;
      depression disorders among candidates for bariatric surgery it is very high and predicts&#xD;
      worse results. The present study aims to explore the feasibility and clinical usefulness of&#xD;
      an online group format application of the Unified Protocol, a transdiagnostic emotion-based&#xD;
      intervention for patients waiting for bariatric surgery with at least one emotional disorder&#xD;
      diagnosis or emotional symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pilot study with a repeated single case experimental design (multiple&#xD;
      baseline design) in a public mental health service. The sample will consist of 45&#xD;
      participants who will be randomized to three baseline conditions: 8, 12 or 15 evaluation days&#xD;
      before the intervention. Depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnostic criteria will be the&#xD;
      primary outcome measures. Secondary measures will include evaluation of affectivity,&#xD;
      personality traits, general fit, quality of life, and different body image and eating&#xD;
      outcomes. An analysis of treatment satisfaction will be also performed. Assessment points&#xD;
      include baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-ups every three months until two&#xD;
      years after post-treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the present investigation, all consecutive patients who have been selected to undergo bariatric surgery and present anxiety or depressive symptoms or at least one diagnosis of emotional disorder, are asked to participate. Once inclusion criteria are accomplished, each patient will be randomly assigned to one of the multiple baseline groups: 3, 5 or 8 evaluation days before the intervention. The study includes eleven assessment points (baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment and eight follow-ups, one every three months until two years after treatment completion).</intervention_model_description>
