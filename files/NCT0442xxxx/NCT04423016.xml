  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transitional period, defined as the first 72 hours after preterm birth, is often&#xD;
      characterized by a significant hemodynamic instability and may also be associated with an&#xD;
      impairment of cerebral autoregulation, with relevant clinical implications. The moving&#xD;
      correlation coefficient between cerebral oxygenation and heart rate, also defined as TOHRx,&#xD;
      has been previously proposed as a marker of cerebrovascular reactivity and provides an&#xD;
      indirect estimation of cerebral autoregulation in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether different antenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors may&#xD;
      influence cerebrovascular reactivity in very preterm infants during the transitional period.&#xD;

      The transitional period, defined as the first 72 hours after preterm birth, is often&#xD;
      characterized by a significant hemodynamic instability and may also be associated with an&#xD;
      impairment of cerebral autoregulation, with relevant clinical implications. The moving&#xD;
      correlation coefficient between cerebral oxygenation and heart rate, also defined as TOHRx,&#xD;
      has been previously proposed as a marker of cerebrovascular reactivity and provides an&#xD;
      indirect estimation of cerebral autoregulation in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study aims to evaluate whether different antenatal, perinatal,&#xD;
      and postnatal factors may influence cerebrovascular reactivity in very preterm infants during&#xD;
      the transitional period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants &lt;32 weeks' gestation are enrolled within 12h from birth. A simultaneous monitoring of&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation (CrSO2) by near-infrared spectroscopy and of heart rate (HR) by pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and electrical velocimetry is performed continuously over the first 72h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The moving correlation coefficient between CrSO2 and HR is calculated using the ICM+ software&#xD;
      (Cambridge Enterprise Ltd) using 5-min, 30-point epochs. Time periods with evidence of major&#xD;
      artefacts, or with a missing data proportion &gt;50% are excluded from this calculation.&#xD;
      Positive TOHRx values will be interpreted as markers of impaired autoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening echocardiogram is routinely performed at the time of enrollment and repeated 6-12&#xD;
      hourly in the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or 12-24 hourly if there is no&#xD;
      evidence of PDA. Based on echocardiographic features, the ductal status is classified as&#xD;
      follows: no evidence of PDA, restrictive PDA (restrictive shunt pattern and left atrium to&#xD;
      aortic root ratio [LA:Ao] ratio &lt;1.5), hemodynamically significant PDA (pulsatile shunt&#xD;
      pattern, LA:Ao ratio â‰¥1.5 or presence of reversed end-diastolic flow either in the descending&#xD;
      aorta or in the anterior cerebral artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concomitant cerebral ultrasound scan, aimed at evaluating brain parenchyma and the&#xD;
      occurrence of prematurity-related complications, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, is also&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, the following antenatal and neonatal data are tracked down on a&#xD;
      specific case report form: gestational age (GA); birth weight (BW); non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure; antenatal steroids (complete course vs. incomplete course or not given); evidence&#xD;
      of reversed end-diastolic flow at antenatal umbilical Doppler (uREDF) (present vs. absent);&#xD;
      ventilatory status over the first 72 hours of life (mechanical ventilation, continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure [CPAP], nasal cannulas or self-ventilating in air [SVIA]);&#xD;
      surfactant administration; development of IVH over the first 72 hours of life; ongoing&#xD;
      inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal clinical variables and TOHRx is&#xD;
      going to be evaluated using generalized linear mixed models or generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations.&#xD;
