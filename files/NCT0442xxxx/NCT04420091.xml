  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory, non-comparative, multi-centric trial in 30 free-living healthy&#xD;
      male and female subjects with moderate knee joint discomfort and loss of functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to determine whether oral administration of Cartidyss, a&#xD;
      concentrated fish cartilage extract, can contribute to the improvement of knee joint&#xD;
      functionality and discomfort in adult population&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients will be enrolled during a 4-month period in 3 investigational sites and each&#xD;
      patient will undergo 3 visits (V0: Inclusion visit at baseline, V1: Follow-Up Visit after 1&#xD;
      month ± 3 day and V2: End Visit after 3 months ± 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether oral administration of Cartidyss,&#xD;
      a concentrated fish cartilage extract, can contribute to the improvement of knee joint&#xD;
      functionality and discomfort in adult population, using a specific self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of Cartidyss&#xD;
      on knee function and pain at rest and while walking, with patient global assessment and&#xD;
      quality of life at each time point. The tolerance, compliance, satisfaction, rate of&#xD;
      responder to the supplementation and pain killer's consumption would be also evaluated as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;

The KOOS outcome score is a 42-item self-administrated questionnaire comprising 5 subscales: Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Sports and Recreation function, and Quality Of Life. A separate score ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the best result, will be calculated for each subscale. A global score will be calculated by summing the score of each subscale.</description>

The SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported questionnaire that covers eight health domains: physical functioning (10 items), bodily pain (2 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (4 items), emotional well-being (5 items), social functioning (2 items), energy/fatigue (4 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>
