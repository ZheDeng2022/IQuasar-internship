      Primary teeth are the valuable assets of a child. In children, milk teeth/primary teeth play&#xD;
      a vital role for eating, phonetics and esthetics. Primary teeth are also essential in the&#xD;
      development of the mouth. They maintain the arch length within the jaw and provide guides for&#xD;
      the eruption pathway of the permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems in primary teeth in the form of pain and swelling can cause distress to the child,&#xD;
      leading to inability to chew or speak properly and even may affect the appearance of a child.&#xD;
      Premature loss of primary teeth can cause an earlier eruption of permanent successors and&#xD;
      interfere with the harmony of adult dentition resulting in crowding caused by shifting and or&#xD;
      drifting of the teeth toward the extraction space. Moreover, psychological, morphological and&#xD;
      functional problems may result from premature loss of primary teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most parents are unaware of the role a pediatric dentist plays in their child's life, and the&#xD;
      importance of dental visits at an early age is underestimated as most believe that the milk&#xD;
      teeth are going to exfoliate and it not worth paying much attention to. Even if a parent is&#xD;
      recommended to take the child to a pediatric dentist, many may not consider doing the same&#xD;
      since awareness of importance of primary teeth is less.&#xD;
