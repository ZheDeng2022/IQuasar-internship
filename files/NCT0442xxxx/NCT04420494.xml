      Immune-related hematocytopenia is a type of immunity Inflammatory cytopenia-mediated&#xD;
      diseases, hormones and immunosuppressants are its first-line treatment. However, conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressants are ineffective or have a high recurrence rate. And some patients are not&#xD;
      effective for these treatments, due to infection of blood cells, bleeding, decreased quality&#xD;
      of life, and even severe death. There is currently no effective method for such patients.&#xD;
      This study intends to recruit IRIC patients, give cord blood infusion, observe its efficacy&#xD;
      and safety, and detect changes in inflammation-related indicators before and after treatment.&#xD;

      Immune-related hematocytopenia (IRC- autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), Evans syndrome,&#xD;
      acquired acquired pure red aplastic anemia (PRCA), autoimmune disease with cytopenia, etc.)&#xD;
      is a type of immunity Inflammatory cytopenia-mediated diseases, hormones and&#xD;
      immunosuppressants are its first-line treatment. However, conventional immunosuppressants are&#xD;
      ineffective or have a high recurrence rate, known as refractory immune-related cytopenia&#xD;
      (IRIC). Subsequent other second-line treatments such as other immunosuppressive agents, CD20&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, anti-human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG ), And even splenectomy have&#xD;
      problems such as high side effects, high price, slow onset of effect, and low efficiency. And&#xD;
      some patients are not effective for these treatments, due to infection of blood cells,&#xD;
      bleeding, decreased quality of life, and even severe death. There is currently no effective&#xD;
      method for such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that certain factors induce the loss of autoimmune tolerance in IRC&#xD;
      patients, and the autoantigens of bone marrow hematopoietic cells are presented by dendritic&#xD;
      cells, stimulating T cells, resulting in B cell activation and hyperfunction to produce&#xD;
      specific autoantibodies; among them, helper T cells ( Th) Abnormal activation of 17 and&#xD;
      follicular helper T cells (Tfh), the negative regulatory function of regulatory T cells and&#xD;
      regulatory B cells weakens, and also promotes the production of autoantibodies. However, the&#xD;
      bone marrow hematopoietic function caused by autoantibodies destroying or inhibiting&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells is low or ineffective. Studies have pointed out that hematopoietic&#xD;
      therapy is the key to curative treatment. At present, the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood in the treatment of malignant / non-malignant hematological diseases&#xD;
      have been confirmed and are widely used. In non-myeloablative therapy, the common adverse&#xD;
      reactions of umbilical cord blood transfusion are increased body temperature, hemoglobinuria&#xD;
      and DMSO side effects, and these adverse reactions can be adjusted by themselves and can be&#xD;
      eliminated within 48 hours. Umbilical cord blood is rich in hematopoietic stem / progenitor&#xD;
      cells, NK, regulatory T cells, and MSC can all have therapeutic effects on IRC to varying&#xD;
      degrees, and the immune cells in cord blood are mostly naive, immature immune cells,&#xD;
      Therefore, the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after clinical&#xD;
      application of unrelated umbilical cord blood are low, avoiding a series of complications and&#xD;
      high costs caused by complex GVHD prevention and treatment technology. At the same time,&#xD;
      regulatory T cells (Treg) in umbilical cord blood account for about 10% of all lymphocytes.&#xD;
      They are a group of lymphocytes with negative regulatory immune responses. They usually play&#xD;
      an important role in maintaining self-tolerance and avoiding excessive immune responses to&#xD;
      damage the body. Function, its infusion can directly treat IRC. The number of NK cells in IRC&#xD;
      patients is reduced, the immune monitoring effect is weakened, the homeostasis of the immune&#xD;
      system cannot be maintained, and the immune cell function is hyperactive, leading to&#xD;
      morbidity. However, CD16 + CD56 + NK cells are abundant in cord blood, and the amount of CD3&#xD;
      + T cells is the same as that in bone marrow. Most researchers believe that NK cells play an&#xD;
      important role in immune surveillance in the body's immune system. They can regulate&#xD;
      downstream immune cells by secreting cytokines or cytotoxicity, and thus play a protective&#xD;
      role in autoimmune diseases. In addition, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) contained in cord&#xD;
      blood are another type of stem cells with high self-renewal and multi-directional&#xD;
      differentiation potential, which can differentiate into a variety of tissue cells other than&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells and have hematopoietic support , Immunomodulation, tissue repair and&#xD;
      other functions are conducive to the restoration of bone marrow function in patients with&#xD;
      hematopoietic disorders; at the same time, MSCs also have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and tissue repair functions, which can reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other&#xD;
      transplant-related complications. Umbilical cord blood has the advantages of quick access,&#xD;
      convenient source, no harm to donors, low HLA matching requirements, low incidence of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and low degree, making the clinical application of cord&#xD;
      blood more and more widely , Its clinical treatment advantages have become increasingly&#xD;
      prominent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On May 1, 2009, the General Office of the Ministry of Health issued a notice on the first&#xD;
      batch of the third category of medical technology that allows clinical application,&#xD;
      clarifying that umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cell therapy technology is approved&#xD;
      for clinical application as a third category of medical technology. In addition, the&#xD;
      Technical Specification for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation clearly states that cord&#xD;
      blood hematopoietic stem cells for clinical application should be provided by the cord blood&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell bank approved by the National Health and Family Planning Commission.&#xD;
      On July 4, 2019, the National Health and Welfare Commission issued a document that clearly&#xD;
      stated that there are currently 7 cord blood hematopoietic stem cell banks that have passed&#xD;
      the national acceptance practice, namely Shandong Bank, Beijing Bank, Tianjin Bank, Shanghai&#xD;
      Bank, Zhejiang Bank, Guangdong Bank and Sichuan library.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to recruit IRIC patients, give cord blood infusion, observe its efficacy&#xD;
      and safety, and detect changes in inflammation-related indicators before and after treatment.&#xD;
      There are no relevant reports at China and abroad. This study can provide new treatment&#xD;
      options for patients with IRIC. If it proves effective, it may rewrite the treatment&#xD;
      guidelines for such diseases; in addition, this study may also provide a theoretical basis&#xD;
      for expanding the application of cord blood in the future.&#xD;
