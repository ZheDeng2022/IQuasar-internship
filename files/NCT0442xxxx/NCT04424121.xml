  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;DATASET-PRECISE&quot;, a 3-arm parallel randomized study, aims to provide new insights in&#xD;
      risk stratification of patients with suspected CAD in the Greek population. The convergence&#xD;
      of information derived from exercise ECG stress test, CACS, CCTA and metabolomic profiling in&#xD;
      artificial intelligence algorithms describes in brief the main objective of this protocol.&#xD;
      The design of the present proposal is based on current state-of-the-art literature,&#xD;
      incorporating, however, additional innovative elements. It is about the first randomized&#xD;
      study to be conducted in Greece, investigating the role of CCTA and CACS in CAD diagnosis and&#xD;
      risk assessment. Moreover, the present protocol aims to integrate information on patients'&#xD;
      metabolomic profiling. The process of the whole information by using artificial intelligence&#xD;
      technology will lead to the development of new risk stratification algorithms, promoting&#xD;
      further personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Regarding Greece, this is the first&#xD;
      prospectively enrolling medical database of this scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptom-based pre-test probability (PTP) scores that estimate the likelihood of obstructive&#xD;
      CAD in stable chest pain have moderate accuracy. Appreciating and integrating the myriad risk&#xD;
      predictors in an individual patient is a challenge for the clinician. To date, efforts to&#xD;
      improve risk-stratification by using CCTA have largely relied upon luminal stenosis severity.&#xD;
      The emphasis placed on this variable over others is in alignment with prior studies using&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography but ignores an array of other parameters important in the CAD&#xD;
      pathogenic process, including coronary artery geometry, coronary calcium content, plaque&#xD;
      composition, and plaque burden. As an increasing number of CCTA variables along with all&#xD;
      clinical and metabolomic variables affecting risk need to be considered, the complexity of&#xD;
      assessment increases, making it more difficult for a clinician to draw an overall conclusion&#xD;
      regarding risk in an individual patient. Furthermore, the potential influence of unexpected&#xD;
      interactions between several weaker predictors in an individual patient is often overlooked.&#xD;
      In this study, we are seeking to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model,&#xD;
      utilizing clinical and metabolomic risk factors, serum biomarkers, CCTA imaging biomarkers,&#xD;
      coronary artery calcium score and ECG stress testing variables, to predict the presence and&#xD;
      the complexity of CAD. Moreover, we are trying to introduce an easy to use, cost-effective,&#xD;
      clinical decision supporting tool. In clinical practice, the utilization of such an approach&#xD;
      could improve risk stratification and help guide downstream personalized management. Briefly,&#xD;
      the research objectives of the study are: 1. predict the risk of obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, 2. quantify the burden and complexity of coronary atherosclerosis, 3. evaluate the&#xD;
      prognostic risk in individual patients with suspected CAD, 4. provide more accurate diagnosis&#xD;
      and risk stratification, 5. provide an easy to use, cost-effective clinical decision support&#xD;
      tool, 6. improve decisions in low to intermediate risk patients regarding the need for&#xD;
      further testing such as cardiac SPECT and invasive coronary angiography, as well as for the&#xD;
      need for preventive therapies and finally, compare three diagnostic strategies in patients&#xD;
      with suspected CAD in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;DATASET-PRECISE&quot; is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, 3-arm parallel randomized&#xD;
      study. Following clinical consultation, participants will be approached and randomized 1:1:1&#xD;
      to receive standard care plus ECG-stress testing or standard care plus ECG-stress testing and&#xD;
      CACS or standard care plus â‰¥ 64-multidetector CCTA and CACS (Collaborating Organizations: 1st&#xD;
      Cardiology Department of AUTH, 1st Cardiology Department of NKUA, Lefkos Stavros-The Athens&#xD;
      Clinic &amp; Affidea Kozani Cardiac Imaging Center). Randomization will be conducted using a&#xD;
      web-based system to ensure allocation concealment. The trial will enroll consecutive patients&#xD;
      with stable symptoms and suspected CAD admitted to study clinical sites over a period of 12&#xD;
      months. Patients with a previous history of CAD and/or prior revascularization will be&#xD;
      excluded. Subjects will undergo screening during the first day of examination, a 5ml blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected one minute prior examination for metabolomic analysis (collaboration&#xD;
      with the Lab. of Bioanalysis &amp; Toxicology, School of Medicine, AUTH) and will be followed for&#xD;
      18 months afterwards. The overall recruitment period is expected to last 12 months. The&#xD;
      estimated total duration of the study from first patient screened to last patient last visit&#xD;
      is 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies for 80% power at a two-sided P value of 0.05, we will need to&#xD;
      recruit about 250 patients per group to detect a relative reduction in the combined MACE rate&#xD;
      (cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization or chest-pain&#xD;
      rehospitalization) of 10% in the CCTA arm. A sample size of N = 900 patients is a pragmatic&#xD;
      approach for such a first clinical study in the Greek population. Health service costs will&#xD;
      be assigned to the type and intensity of resource use, measured by the number of diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic procedures or interventions, medications, hospital clinic attendances and&#xD;
      hospitalization episodes from randomization to 18 months of follow-up. Costs will be&#xD;
      attributed to the need for: 1. additional invasive or noninvasive imaging, 2. drug therapy,&#xD;
      3. coronary revascularization and 4. hospitalization for chest pain.&#xD;
