  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of tissue homologous recombination&#xD;
      repair (HRR)-related gene mutations (positive/negative/Variant of uncertain significance&#xD;
      (VUS)), clinical outcome such as prostate-specific antigen-progression free survival&#xD;
      (PSA-PFS), overall survivals (OS) and treatment pattern in mCRPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Methods&gt; Study design: multi-center, prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 155 patients (expected recruitment patients: maximum 205 patients) will be&#xD;
      enrolled from approximately 20~30 sites in Japan. Study Population: mCRPC patients who&#xD;
      diagnosed between 2014 and 2018. Exposure(s): N.A Outcome(s): Prevalence of tissue&#xD;
      HRR-related gene mutations, clinical outcomes such as Over survival and PSA-PFS, Treatment&#xD;
      pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is 155 patients based on the prevalence of HRR-related genes (BRCA1,&#xD;
      BRCA2 and ATM) which is reported in previous global study (PROfound study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not intended to verify specific hypotheses, and the results are evaluated&#xD;
      descriptively. There is no plan of interim analyses before the final analysis.&#xD;

      An archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sample, ten slides and 10 μm in thickness&#xD;
      on uncharged slide be used for HRR-related gene mutation testing in principle. And also, ten&#xD;
      10 μm slides is sent to Myriad with one 3-5 micron on a charge slide for the HE&#xD;
      staining(Hematoxylin and eosin staining) which is continuous with the slice for HRR-related&#xD;
      gene mutation. These contents include with a sample of &gt;25 mm2 in section area containing a&#xD;
      ≥30% tumor nuclei preferred (≥20% tumor nuclei accepted). If patients have some tumor samples&#xD;
      at multiple points, the latest sample is preferred to use HRR-related gene mutation testing.&#xD;
      And other tumor sample is acceptable to use HRR-related gene mutation testing if test is&#xD;
      failed.&#xD;

        The target population is mCRPC patients who diagnosed between 2014 and 2018 and be&#xD;
        confirmed to be succeeded HRR-related gene mutation analysis with archived primary or&#xD;
        metastatic tumor sample. As median of expected overall survival of mCRPC is 2.5 to 3 years&#xD;
        from diagnosis, follow up period is enough to measure outcomes including survival. The&#xD;
        baseline period is set to calculate overall survival and to detect clinical outcome at&#xD;
        least half. The patients will be enrolled consecutively to this study.&#xD;
