      This trial is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 0 trial that will enroll up to 20&#xD;
      participants with recurrent high-grade glioma with FGFR1 K656E or FGFR3 K650E mutation or&#xD;
      FGFR3-TACC3 translocation which are scheduled for resection. In the lead-in cohort, a total&#xD;
      of 20 participants will be enrolled into the proposed phase 0 clinical trial. Participants&#xD;
      will be administered infigratinib prior to surgical resection of their tumor.&#xD;
