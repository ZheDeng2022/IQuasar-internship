    <textblock>
      There is a critical need to disseminate efficacious psychosocial treatments for mental&#xD;
      disorders as there is a significant gap between evidenced-based approaches and common&#xD;
      clinical practice. One example of the need to improve dissemination and implementation of&#xD;
      psychosocial treatments is for adolescent Anorexia Nervosa (AN), a serious mental disorder&#xD;
      with an incidence rate of about 1% that can become life-threatening. Based on outcomes from a&#xD;
      series of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the first-line treatment for adolescent AN is&#xD;
      Family-based Treatment (FBT); however, very few therapists are trained to use FBT for AN.&#xD;
      Further, while approximately 45-50% of US mental health outpatient providers are in private&#xD;
      practice, little attention has been paid to how best to train this group. Care for adolescent&#xD;
      AN, in particular, is provided in private practice at high rates, because specialist programs&#xD;
      in non-private settings are few and not readily accessible. Motivations, incentives, and&#xD;
      rationale for learning evidence-based treatments (EBTs) differ in this group compared to&#xD;
      therapists embedded in an organization or health care system. In this application, we propose&#xD;
      to use an online training strategy to study the adoption of FBT to better understand factors&#xD;
      that limit or enhance uptake and implementation of this treatment in private practice. We&#xD;
      developed and piloted a self-directed enhanced online training (ET-FBT) aimed at improving&#xD;
      therapist skills and knowledge related to key components of FBT for AN that predict patient&#xD;
      outcome in a group of therapists of which 64% were in private practice. We propose to build&#xD;
      on these findings to examine the feasibility of new methods to retain therapists during&#xD;
      supervision, assess fidelity, and collect patient outcomes from clinicians in private&#xD;
      practice. Thus, our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The overall aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing two implementation strategies (online training vs webinar training)&#xD;
      for training clinicians in private practice in FBT for AN. We predict that those randomized&#xD;
      to online training will be retained, receive supervision, and provide patient data at higher&#xD;
      rates than those who receive webinar training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Patient outcomes (reflecting therapist effectiveness) will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      patient weight gain from session 1 to 4 of FBT before and after training (target for training&#xD;
      effect) and compared between randomized groups. We predict a moderate efficacy signal&#xD;
      difference favoring those who are received the online training. because of increased training&#xD;
      in key components in the online training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Validate training effect by examining the association between therapist fidelity to&#xD;
      FBT and patient outcomes. We predict that fidelity will be correlated (target validation)&#xD;
      with patient outcome. The effects of therapeutic alliance, participation in supervision, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy on both fidelity and patient outcome will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Explore BL factors associated with implementation processes (e.g. prior training,&#xD;
      experience, family work).The primary significance of this study is its potential to increase&#xD;
      the availability of FBT--the most effective treatment for adolescent AN. Increased&#xD;
      availability of FBT will decrease cost, hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and chronicity&#xD;
      of the disorder.&#xD;

    <description>10 lectures that are self-paced with a maximum of three months to complete with each lecture bundle comprising of 5-8 short (about 4 minutes in length), didactic videos that discuss the treatment model and provide mock therapy session video clips (modeling FBT with a typical adolescent AN case), as well as supplementary readings and videotaped role-plays. Enrollees complete each lecture bundle and complete the assignments as they move through the training at their own pace, but to have completed all within the 3-month time frame. When the training is completed, therapists will proceed to schedule post-online supervision for a minimum of 1 case and a maximum of 2 cases over the course of 3 months.</description>

    <description>1-hour weekly webinar lectures that essentially is the FBT training that is conducted in person, just recorded. There will be lectures discussing the scientific evidence supporting FBT, how therapists set up treatment for FBT, main interventions used in FBT during each phase, and recorded role-plays illustrating interventions throughout the 3 phases. Enrollees watch each webinar video as it is released weekly over a 12 week (3 month period). When the training is completed, therapists will proceed to schedule post-online supervision for a minimum of 1 case and a maximum of 2 cases over the course of 3 months.</description>
