  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is currently a standard procedure for a wide&#xD;
      range of blood-oncological diseases and genetic disorders. Recent improvements in transplant&#xD;
      technologies, infection prevention and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) management procedures&#xD;
      have significantly reduced the transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, approximately 50%&#xD;
      of pediatric patients may develop liver dysfunction before HSCT and 74% to 85.5% after HSCT,&#xD;
      with a TRM related to liver dysfunction reaching 46%. The liver and pancreas complications&#xD;
      still remain too high for the difficulties and diagnostic inefficiencies and, consequently,&#xD;
      for the lack of targeted and safer therapies. The diagnostic problems can be summarized in 3&#xD;
      major points: a) the histological examination of liver and pancreas parenchyma cannot be&#xD;
      routinely performed because of the organ anatomy and the relative risk of the bioptic&#xD;
      procedures; b) the lack of specific biomarkers or advanced imaging techniques appropriate for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of HSCT complications; c) the multifactorial causes of organ complications, as&#xD;
      well as drug toxicities, GVHD, siderosis, ductopenia (considered as an index of hepatic&#xD;
      GVHD), the accumulation of potentially toxic substances favored by siderosis and ductopenia.&#xD;
      In more than 50% of HSCT patients, siderosis and/or ductopenia may represent common&#xD;
      pathological conditions. Furthermore, international guidelines issued by onco-hematology and&#xD;
      transplantation scientific societies recommend a chelating treatment with deferasirox in all&#xD;
      hematological and oncological patients undergoing an intense transfusion regimen. However, in&#xD;
      the presence of siderosis and marked ductopenia, patients receiving deferasirox may&#xD;
      experience both severe renal and hematological toxicities and lack of effectiveness of the&#xD;
      chelating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the principal aim of the present retrospective study will be the evaluation of the&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality (TRM) in patients requiring a chelation treatment according to&#xD;
      the Italian guidelines in pediatric patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present retrospective study will be conducted at the Bone Marrow Transplant Center, IRCCS&#xD;
      Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy. All pediatric patients who underwent one or more allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCTs between 2010 and 2018 will be enrolled according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected in a retrospective manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data on the underlying disease (diagnosis, therapeutic protocol, transfusion regimen,&#xD;
           possible relapses, type of transplant, conditioning regimen, infectious complications,&#xD;
           immunosuppressive treatment, including use of steroids);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-transplant liver and pancreatic function, as well as quantification of iron content&#xD;
           by nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-transplant histological evaluation of liver parenchyma in case of pre-existing liver&#xD;
           disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-transplant liver and pancreatic function and the evaluation of parenchymal&#xD;
           accumulation of Fe+;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length and doses of DFX treatment, and corresponding drug plasma concentrations as per&#xD;
           routine drug monitoring protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment tolerability according to CTC-AE grading V5.0, November 27, 2017 The&#xD;
           post-transplant data will be collected within 2 years from HSCT (or the last HSCT when&#xD;
           more than one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data entered in an appropriate anonymous database will be processed by descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and uni- multivariate statistical analyses according to study endpoints. DFX&#xD;
      plasma concentrations will be analyzed by means of to a nonlinear mixed effect modeling&#xD;
      approach to elaborate a population pharmacokinetic (POP/PK) model. POP/PK findings will be&#xD;
      further analyzed together with clinical and laboratory data.&#xD;
