      The PERSEUS protocol is a new approach to the resuscitation of highly monitored patients with&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. It aims at the optimization of all the available physiological parameters and&#xD;
      the full exploitation of both the &quot;cardiac pump&quot; and &quot;thoracic pump'. This protocol will help&#xD;
      to titrate chest compressions, ventilation, and vasopressor dosing to physiological&#xD;
      parameters, increasing survival after cardiac arrest with favorable neurological outcome&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2000, resuscitation guidelines remain uniform across all cardiac arrest patients,&#xD;
      focusing on the delivery of chest compressions to a standardized rate and depth and&#xD;
      algorithmic vasopressor dosing. Although the concept of goal-directed hemodynamic&#xD;
      optimization as a treatment strategy to improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients&#xD;
      has been tested since the 1980s, no human study has established that prospectively targeting&#xD;
      hemodynamics during CPR improves outcomes until now. Nevertheless, individualizing&#xD;
      resuscitation to the appropriate hemodynamic and ventilatory goals rather than a standard&#xD;
      Bone-size-fits-all treatment seems a promising new therapeutic strategy that can be applied&#xD;
      during resuscitation attempts in highly monitored patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERSEUS protocol is a new approach to the resuscitation of highly monitored patients with&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. It has been developed based on our experience and the observation that the&#xD;
      most important determinant of survival is the optimization of all the available physiological&#xD;
      parameters and the full exploitation of both the &quot;cardiac pump&quot; and &quot;thoracic pump'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological and pathophysiological aspects of cardiac arrest Cardiac arrest interval&#xD;
      Immediately after the abrupt loss of effective blood flow, the hypotension-induced baroreflex&#xD;
      withdrawal with the net increase in the vascular resistance maintains an impaired antegrade&#xD;
      and pulmonary blood flow. The systemic and pulmonary blood flow continue for at least 30-60&#xD;
      s, until the pressure gradient between the aorta and the right side of the heart, as well as&#xD;
      between the pulmonary artery and the left atrium, has been completely dissipated, resulting&#xD;
      in a rapid increase in the volume of the right ventricle and the extrapericardial component&#xD;
      of the pulmonary veins. When arterial and systemic venous pressures reach equilibrium, the&#xD;
      mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) is approximately 6-12 mmHg. The coronary blood flow&#xD;
      declines to zero, but CPP remains positive because of the retrograde coronary flow. However,&#xD;
      this diminishes the removal of norepinephrine from the interstitial spaces, which together&#xD;
      with the formation of cardiac edema prolongs vasoconstriction and enhances myocardial&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, cerebral perfusion decreases while the damage of fatty acids of the&#xD;
      neuronal cell membrane by reactive oxygen species leads to a progressive increase in membrane&#xD;
      permeability and severe derangements of intracellular electrolytes, resulting in cell&#xD;
      swelling and brain edema formation. This, together with venous congestion, increases&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) and damages the neuropil and synaptic structures and/or contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERSEUS personalized physiology-guided resuscitation protocol Recognizing cardiac arrest&#xD;
      in highly monitored areas can be more difficult than in other hospital areas, such as the&#xD;
      ward. Considering that the vast majority of alarms from sensors are false alarms, cardiac&#xD;
      arrest should be recognized and confirmed by the combined assessment of the rhythm, the&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure and waveform, the abrupt decrease of ETCO2, and the loss of carotid&#xD;
      pulse. Once cardiac arrest is confirmed, CPR should be initiated without delay with&#xD;
      high-quality chest compressions according to the recent resuscitation guidelines. However,&#xD;
      the effectiveness of chest compressions is depending on the venous return, which is&#xD;
      proportional to the pressure gradient between Pmsf and CVP, and particular attention is&#xD;
      needed by the rescuers to determine Pmsf within the first 5-7.5 s of cardiac arrest and prior&#xD;
      to the onset of chest compressions. The Pmsf is a quantitative measurement of the patient's&#xD;
      volume status and represents the tone of venous reservoir, indicating the pre-arrest&#xD;
      &quot;vasoreactivity&quot; status of the patients. Therefore, optimizing Pmsf during CPR is paramount&#xD;
      for increasing survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first cycle of CPR, the resuscitation efforts must maintain a relaxation DAP of ≥&#xD;
      40 mmHg (calculated at the time of full chest decompression). In patients with a lower DAP,&#xD;
      administration of epinephrine or vasopressin should be based on the pre-arrest value of Pmsf&#xD;
      and/or systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and is anticipated to be beneficial in those with&#xD;
      Pmsf &lt; 6 mmHg and/or SVR &lt; 800 dynes·sec·cm-5, enhancing volume recruitment from the&#xD;
      unstressed compartment and increasing the stressed volume. In all other patients, the&#xD;
      vasoreactivity will be maintained for some time provided that intravascular volume and chest&#xD;
      compressions are sufficient. Therefore, circulatory volume should be increased in patients&#xD;
      with a pre-arrest CVP &lt; 2 mmHg using a fluid bolus and/or the passive leg-raising maneuver.&#xD;
      However, it should be noted that rapid and liberal fluid administration during CPR may lead&#xD;
      to an excessive increase in RAP, aggravating venous return and CPP, especially when&#xD;
      administered via a jugular or subclavian central venous catheter. At the onset of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest, ventilatory parameters should be changed to tidal volume 6 ml/kg, respiratory rate 10&#xD;
      min-1, I:E 1:2, PEEP 0 cm H20, and FiO2 100%. During this cycle, all other treatment efforts&#xD;
      must follow current recommendations for standard CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the onset of the second cycle of CPR, the resuscitation efforts should be continued as&#xD;
      above while assessing ETCO2. As stated previously, ventilation during CPR by using currently&#xD;
      recommended chest compression rates may take place entirely below functional residual&#xD;
      capacity and may not provide adequate blood oxygenation due to small airway closure,&#xD;
      increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and impairing gas exchange. Therefore, mean airway&#xD;
      pressure should be maintained 40-45 cmH2O in patients with DAP ≥ 40 mmHg and ETCO2 &lt; 10 mmHg&#xD;
      to facilitate gas exchange. On the contrary, all patients with DAP &gt; 40 mmHg and ETCO2 &gt; 15&#xD;
      mmHg should be assessed for hypercapnia, and if present, they should be treated by increasing&#xD;
      the ventilatory rate by up to 50% (or less if necessary to maintain DAP ≥ 40 mmHg). Also,&#xD;
      severe acidosis should be treated immediately because it causes vasodilatation which may&#xD;
      decrease venous return and CPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the third cycle of CPR, the resuscitation efforts should be continued as above while&#xD;
      assessing ScvO2, which should be maintained 65-80%. In patients with ScvO2 &lt; 65%, transfusion&#xD;
      of red blood cells should be initiated when Hb is ≤8 g/dl to improve oxygen delivery. In&#xD;
      patients with Hb &gt; 8 g/dl, a fluid bolus should be given to improve circulatory flow provided&#xD;
      that DAP is maintained ≥ 40 mmHg. In patients with DAP ≥ 40 mmHg and a ScvO2 value of &gt; 80%,&#xD;
      hypothermia should be excluded and treated aggressively if present, the FiO2 should be&#xD;
      decreased in case of hyperoxemia (PaO2 &gt; 200 mmHg), and a low-dose vasodilator may be&#xD;
      considered when microcirculatory shunting and loss of hemodynamic coherence between macro-&#xD;
      and microcirculation can be directly assessed or possible (e.g., DAP ≥ 40 mmHg, Hb &gt; 8 g/dl,&#xD;
      PaO2 &gt; 200 mmHg, ScvO2 &gt; 80%, and mixed venous oxygen tension ≤ 26 mmHg (if available), with&#xD;
      or without hyperlactatemia). In patients with normal ScvO2, trend cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      monitoring (near-infrared spectroscopy - NIRS) should be used because it focuses more on the&#xD;
      amount of change from the pre-arrest baseline cerebral oxygenation value. Decreasing FiO2&#xD;
      until PaO2 is 200 mmHg can be considered when NIRS is &gt; 50% of the prearrest value, while&#xD;
      HUP-CPR (30°) should be considered in patients with NIRS ≤ 30% of the pre-arrest value and&#xD;
      signs or known increased intracranial pressure. The resuscitation efforts may be considered&#xD;
      as adequate in patients who have reached the pre-defined targets and have a NIRS of 30-50% of&#xD;
      the pre-arrest value, and should be continued by repeating the approach from the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERSEUS resuscitation protocol is a new approach to the resuscitation of highly monitored&#xD;
      patients with cardiac arrest and may help to titrate chest compressions, ventilation, and&#xD;
      vasopressor dosing to physiological parameters. The aim of this double-center study is to&#xD;
      investigate if resuscitation with the PERSEUS protocol can increase survival after cardiac&#xD;
      arrest with favorable neurological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a prospective observational study designed in accordance with the declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki. The study will be register at Clinical Trials.gov and has been approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital of Larisa, under the reference number&#xD;
      2670/3-2-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient eligibility All intubated and mechanically ventilated adult patients (≥ 18 years of&#xD;
      age) with a CPR event requiring chest compressions in a highly monitored area [Operating&#xD;
      Room, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or Emergency Department] will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
      Each patient will be allocated into two groups; patients in group A will be resuscitated with&#xD;
      the PERSEUS protocol, while patients in group B will receive standard CPR according to the&#xD;
      latest European Resuscitation Council guidelines on resuscitation. Random allocation will be&#xD;
      carried out by a researcher who will not be involved in data collection using the sealed&#xD;
      envelope technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Monitoring Data analysis will be based on predefined data points on a&#xD;
      prospective data collection form. The staff will be blinded to measurements until the end of&#xD;
      the study and all data are analyzed. Clinical monitoring throughout the study will be&#xD;
      performed to maximize protocol adherence, while an independent Data and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      research staff will monitor safety, ethical, and scientific aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the Utstein-style templates for in-hospital cardiac arrest data. Return of&#xD;
      spontaneous circulation will be defined for all rhythms as the restoration of a spontaneous&#xD;
      perfusing rhythm for more than 20 minutes. Survival with a favorable neurological outcome&#xD;
      will be defined as a cerebral performance category (CPC) score of 1, 2 or no change from&#xD;
      baseline. The CPC scoring system assesses functional outcomes among survivors of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest and has been extensively validated and shown to reliably predict functional&#xD;
      neurological disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management The goal of the clinical data management plan is to provide high-quality data&#xD;
      by adopting standardized procedures to minimize the number of errors and missing data, and&#xD;
      consequently, to generate an accurate database for analysis. Remote monitoring is performed&#xD;
      to signal early aberrant patterns, issues with consistency, credibility and other anomalies.&#xD;
      Any missing and outlier data values will individually revised and completed or corrected&#xD;
      whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination The study will be performed according to national and international&#xD;
      guidelines. The present research investigation was reviewed by the IRB at the Larisa&#xD;
      University Hospital and determined to be IRB exempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competing interests None declared.&#xD;
