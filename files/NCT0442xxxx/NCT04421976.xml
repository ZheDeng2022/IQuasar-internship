  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of driving pressure (DP)-guided positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on early&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary ventilation is to be determined for patients undergoing neurosurgery.&#xD;
      Patients are recruited to receive volume controlled ventilation with either a fixed PEEP&#xD;
      (5cmH2O) or DP titrated PEEP. Early postoperative regional distribution of lung ventilation,&#xD;
      expressed as global inhomogeneity (GI) is evaluated by electrical impedance tomography (EIT),&#xD;
      a noninvasive, radiation free modality. Center of ventilation (COV) by EIT, as well as the&#xD;
      lung ultrasonography（LUS), perioperative ventilatory parameters, arterial oxygenation index&#xD;
      (PaO2/FiO2) , serum indicators and postoperative pulmonary complications are secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After screened for preoperative risk factors, 44 patients undergoing elective neurosurgery&#xD;
      and planned to be extubated in the operating room are randomly assigned to two groups: (1)&#xD;
      PEEP = 5cmH2O; (2) driving pressure (DP)-guided PEEP. The ventilation protocol consists of&#xD;
      volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (Datex Ohmeda S/5 Advance; General Electric Company&#xD;
      Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) at a tidal volume (VT) of 8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW),&#xD;
      fresh gas of 2 litre /min, inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:2, and a respiratory rate&#xD;
      adjusted to normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure between 35 and 45 mmHg).&#xD;
      For group 2, trial for the lowest DP was started 10 min after position adjustment by&#xD;
      increasing PEEP from 2 to 10 cm H2O incrementally. DP was calculated as &quot;plateau pressure -&#xD;
      PEEP&quot;. Each PEEP level was maintained for 10 respiratory cycles, with DP in the last cycle&#xD;
      recorded. Then the PEEP level producing the lowest DP was identified and maintained&#xD;
      intraoperatively. A plateau pressure of no more than 30 cmH2O is targeted in each group.&#xD;
      Early postoperative distribution of regional ventilation global inhomogeneity (GI) is the&#xD;
      primary endpoint evaluated by EIT (electrical impedance tomography), which was performed by a&#xD;
      trained technician who is blinded to randomization. Center of ventilation (COV) by EIT, lung&#xD;
      ultrasonography（LUS) , and arterial blood gas are evaluated, with inflammatory and oxidative&#xD;
      mediators tested from venous sample. Brain relaxation will be scored by the neurosurgeon.&#xD;
      Postoperative pulmonary complications within 3 days are also recorded.&#xD;
