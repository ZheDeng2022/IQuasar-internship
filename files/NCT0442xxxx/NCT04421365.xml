  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a neurological disorder, which causes involuntary, sustained muscle contractions,&#xD;
      resulting in uncontrollable twisting, repetitive movements, and abnormal postures. Selective&#xD;
      impairment of the motor control of highly skilled and goal-oriented behaviors is the defining&#xD;
      feature of task-specific focal dystonias. Among these, laryngeal dystonia (LD) is&#xD;
      characterized by involuntary spasms in laryngeal muscles, which selectively occur during&#xD;
      speaking but not whispering, crying, or laughing. As speech communication is a vital part of&#xD;
      our daily existence, LD symptoms have a deeply pervasive effect on the quality of life of the&#xD;
      affected individual, often extending beyond speech motor deficits and causing significant&#xD;
      occupational disability, psychiatric comorbidities, long-lasting stress, and social&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the chronic, debilitating impact of LD, its clinical management remains stagnant. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel design, phase 1 clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a&#xD;
      neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm in LD patients that acts upon and&#xD;
      modulates the disorder pathophysiology. The rationale for the proposed studies is that&#xD;
      delineation of task-specific neural alterations for their feasible utilization as a&#xD;
      pathophysiological target of therapeutic intervention will establish a robust scientific&#xD;
      foundation for the development of novel strategies for LD treatment, inform the conduct of&#xD;
      the next phase of the clinical trial, and directly contribute to closing the existing&#xD;
      critical gap in the clinical management of this disorder.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients will have clinically documented isolated adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD)&#xD;
             without any other forms of dystonia or tremor. ADLD causes involuntary spasms during&#xD;
             vocal fold adduction, leading to voice breaks predominantly on vowels and strained,&#xD;
             strangles quality of voice, predominantly affecting voice production during the&#xD;
             speaking. Only patients with the ADLD form of disorder will be recruited to minimize&#xD;
             the impact of heterogeneity of voice symptomatology on the outcome of these phase 1&#xD;
             studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy controls will be healthy individuals with a negative history of any&#xD;
             neurological, psychiatric, or laryngeal problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age from 18 to 80 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Native English speakers. Non-English-speaking subjects will not be recruited because&#xD;
             brain activation and neural network organization are different between native and&#xD;
             non-native English speakers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Right-handedness (based on Edinburgh Handedness Inventory). Left-handed subjects will&#xD;
             not be recruited because brain activation and neural network organization are&#xD;
             different between right and left-handed individuals;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Normal cognitive status (based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent will be excluded from the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women until the time they are no longer pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. All women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             will undergo a urine pregnancy test, which must be negative for study participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as&#xD;
             stroke, movement disorders (except for ADLD in the patient group), brain tumors,&#xD;
             ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases; (b) psychiatric&#xD;
             problems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder;&#xD;
             (c) larynÂ¬geal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, carcinoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with impaired hearing, vision, and speaking abilities (except for ADLD), as&#xD;
             these would most typically have a neurological origin;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have dystonia symptoms at rest in order to avoid the potential confound&#xD;
             of dystonic spasms occurring during the asymptomatic task production;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who are not symptomatic due to the treatment with botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
             into the affected muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin varies&#xD;
             from patient to patient but lasts on average for 3-4 months. All patients will be&#xD;
             evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic and are at least three months&#xD;
             post-injection prior to study participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central&#xD;
             nervous system, all subjects will be questioned about any prescribed or&#xD;
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial screening. Those who are on&#xD;
             medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with implanted deep brain stimulators will be excluded from the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries,&#xD;
             particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal&#xD;
             denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation. Because both&#xD;
             brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function&#xD;
             re-organization, all subjects with a history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study.&#xD;
