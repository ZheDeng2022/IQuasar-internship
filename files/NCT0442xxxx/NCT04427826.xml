  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are a major source of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality for patients and cost to the society. In case of acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure with hypercapnia and acidosis, Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is preferred as a first&#xD;
      line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV failures are not uncommon, from 15% in intensive care to 25 - 30% in emergency&#xD;
      departments. They most often occur at the start of the NIV or in the hours that follow. There&#xD;
      are many reasons for these failure. Among these are; dyspnea, discomfort, the pain related to&#xD;
      the exacerbation and also to the NIV are frequently noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of certain drugs with anxiolytic, hypnotic and/or analgesic properties could also be&#xD;
      useful. Some sedatives and opioids have already been studied in this indication but without a&#xD;
      therapeutic trial and satisfactory methodology. Among the molecules of interest, Morphine&#xD;
      seems interesting . It's administration could reduce the ventilatory rate, intensity of&#xD;
      dyspnea, pain and anxiety as well as dynamic hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that morphine administration will decrease the rate of early NIV&#xD;
      failure by improving comfort (decreased dyspnea and pain) and ventilation (decreased&#xD;
      respiratory rate and increase in tidal volume) in patients with exacerbations of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before considering a randomized phase III efficacy study, it is necessary to&#xD;
      determine the optimal dose of morphine in this indication, through a phase I/II dose-finding&#xD;
      study taking into accounts both the efficacy and toxicity of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study, is to determine the optimal dose of morphine administered&#xD;
      at the initiation of NIV in patient with acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD), which is defined as the maximum gain function combining the probability of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity with PaCO2.Therefore, the impact of morphine administration on the&#xD;
      physiological parameters of NIV- COPD exacerbation patients will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in this dose-finding study will be enrolled consecutively after consent and&#xD;
      verification of the selection criteria, with a minimum of 24 hours after completion of&#xD;
      previous patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the administration of morphine, the following exams will be performed: clinical,&#xD;
      paraclinical and biological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV will be started and performed in BiPAP pressure mode with facial mask. A Tidal Volume&#xD;
      (Vt) to the maximum of 6 - 8ml/kg, an expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 5cm H2O&#xD;
      and the FiO2 set at 35%. The settings will be adapted according to the SpO2 (88%≤SpO2≤92%)&#xD;
      and the clinical tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the patients included will receive a single open-label injection of morphine (T0)&#xD;
      at the dose closest to that defined by the model (estimation by Bayesian method) from among&#xD;
      the following 4 doses: 0.02; 0.04; 0.07 and 0.1mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double check of the preparation of the dose administered will be carried out by a physician&#xD;
      and a nurse in an emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each result is aimed to refine the gain function which will be used to estimate the optimal&#xD;
      dose for the next patient. The dose to be administered to the next patient will be determined&#xD;
      by the Clinical Investigation Centre based on the data of the previous patient. It will be&#xD;
      determined using a gain function whose objective is to represent the best compromise between&#xD;
      efficacy and safety. It assigns a value to the patient representing the benefit: in case of&#xD;
      toxicity this value will be 0; otherwise it will be equal to the decrease in PaCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant monitoring for up to 4 hours will be done as part of this study to detect the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events. In particular, the following will be monitored: disturbances of&#xD;
      consciousness, vomiting or secretions requiring airway protection; hemodynamic instability;&#xD;
      restlessness and/or inability to keep the mask on. Therefore, ongoing monitoring for routine&#xD;
      patient care may be extended at the discretion of the clinical physician in charge of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of patients will be done in 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours (or NIV stop) and 24 hours.&#xD;
      Clinical, paraclinical, biological parameters and the occurrence of adverse events will be&#xD;
      performed in 15 minutes, 1 and 4 hours follow-up. During 24 hours only the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse event will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial shall be concluded when the maximum number of patients is reached (N=24), or when a&#xD;
      sufficiently accurate estimate of the dose maximizing the benefit-risk balance is obtained&#xD;
      while remaining within the toxicity limit set at a 30% probability of DLT. The precision of&#xD;
      this estimate will be measured by the ratio of the upper and lower bounds of the confidence&#xD;
      interval. If this ratio is less than 5, the precision is considered to be sufficient to stop&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups of data will be collected at different times: biological parameter, clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical parameters as well adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameter: demographic variable (gender, age), weight, height, BMI, Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation- Sedation Scale, Visual analog scale of dyspnea (Borg scale), numerical rating&#xD;
      scale for pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraclinical parameter: Vital parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
      ventilatory rate, SpO2, NIV settings, EPAP, IPAP and Tidal Volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological parameter: Blood count, arterial blood gas, chemistry panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      outcome measure: Optimal dose is defined as the dose associated with the maximum of gain&#xD;
      function, used to determine the best compromise between efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It combines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The probability of dose - limiting toxicity (DTL), defined as the occurrence of one or&#xD;
           more of the following criteria occurring within 4 hours of morphine administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory Rate ≤ 10/min;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) &lt; -2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Naloxone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy and toxicity defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PaCO2 1 hour after morphine injection, according to the hormetic dose-response&#xD;
                model (&quot;J-curve&quot;: efficacy first increases with the dose, then reach a maximum and&#xD;
                decreases in case of excessive bradypnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of enrollment: Up to 24 participants. The calculation of the sample size was&#xD;
      carried out by simulating several scenarios based on the prior to be used in the study. The&#xD;
      simulated scenarios are as follows: one with low toxicity (5% at 0.02 mg/kg and 30% at 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg), one with high toxicity (10% at 0.02 mg/kg and 40% at 0.04 mg/kg) and one where the&#xD;
      toxicity is identical to the prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation results showed a number of subjects required up to 24, with a median of 6 to 11,&#xD;
      according to the scenario. The investigators therefore chose to define a maximum number of&#xD;
      patients to 24, which is higher than the average of the worst-case scenario and corresponds&#xD;
      to the maximum number of patients required among the 100 simulations of the worst-case&#xD;
      scenario. However, it is very likely that the inclusions will be stopped earlier, when the&#xD;
      accuracy is satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method used will be an adaptive Bayesian dose-finding procedure for a binary response&#xD;
      (DLT), and a continuous response (PaCO2 used as a biomarker of efficacy and toxicity,&#xD;
      following a hormetic response), using a gain function which objectively represent the&#xD;
      compromise between efficiency and safety. The investigators will use a function already&#xD;
      described in the literature .&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis planned for this study.&#xD;
