  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination therapy of 3 drugs as possible treatments for&#xD;
      recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three drugs being used in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (MK3475)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase Ib/II trial of Pembrolizumab, Ibrutinib and&#xD;
      Rituximab in participants with recurrent Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also&#xD;
           tries to define the appropriate dose(s) of the investigational intervention to use for&#xD;
           further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
           intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. The&#xD;
           dose of investigational intervention in Phase II will depend on the results from Phase&#xD;
           Ib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab,&#xD;
                ibrutinib or rituximab for recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma&#xD;
                (PCNSL) but these have been approved for other uses including other types of&#xD;
                non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of&#xD;
                cancer, and information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab may be&#xD;
                beneficial in this type of cancer. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal&#xD;
                antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a&#xD;
                foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against&#xD;
                infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating&#xD;
                patients; an antibody that is made in the lab is also known as humanized monoclonal&#xD;
                antibody that is designed to block the action of the receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to&#xD;
                help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now several approved&#xD;
                antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is believed to block a&#xD;
                type of protein called a kinase that helps lymphoma cells live and grow. By&#xD;
                blocking this, it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop&#xD;
                them from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rituximab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common&#xD;
                type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies&#xD;
                attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Rituximab works with the&#xD;
                immune system and has shown evidence for clinical activity when administered in&#xD;
                combinations to treat lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The three drugs being used in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pembrolizumab (MK3475)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years as long as they do not have&#xD;
           serious side effects and their disease does not get worse. Once off study, participants&#xD;
           will be followed every 3 months for the rest of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I Enrollment: Approximately 9 to 12 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II Enrollment :Approximately 25 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Merck &amp; Co., Inc, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing&#xD;
      funding for the research study and the study drug, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of PFS6 will be estimated as a binomial response proportion. The efficacy analysis population will include all evaluable patients (subjects will be considered evaluable for efficacy as long as they have received at least 75% of the planned doses for the 1st 6 weeks of treatment). Patients missing 6 months progression evaluation (for any reason) will be counted as progressors. For the primary analysis, the proportion of progression free patients at 6 months will be evaluated and 95% exact binomial CI will be provided. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used as a secondary approach to evaluate the PFS6 based on the recorded times to progression for each patient, with patients without progression or lost to follow-up being censored at their last follow-up date.</description>

                       interview.&#xD;

               -  Postmenopausal female:A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12&#xD;
                  months without an alternative medical cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range&#xD;
                       may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal&#xD;
                       contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence&#xD;
                       of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the&#xD;
                       postmenopausal range is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use&#xD;
                  one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to&#xD;
                  continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to&#xD;
                  allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP; see definition above), must agree to use a&#xD;

                       contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual&#xD;
                       partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an&#xD;
                       additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.&#xD;

                       method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during&#xD;
                       the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The&#xD;
                       reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                       duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                       participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTES:Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of&#xD;
                  contraceptive methods for participants of clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Typical use failure rates are lower than perfect-use failure rates (i.e.&#xD;
                       when used consistently and correctly).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to&#xD;
