  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      one-centered, open, prospective, non-randomized, controlled clinical study will be aimed at&#xD;
      creating remote monitoring system for patients' condition and the development of&#xD;
      methodological approaches and its usage for conducting patients, who had myocardial&#xD;
      infraction and who has a very high risk of developing an unfavorable outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will involve patients, who had myocardial infraction and who has the high level&#xD;
      of potential adherence to treatment, which will be determined by the usage of Russian generic&#xD;
      questionnaire for evaluation of compliance to drug therapy. At the end of a 12 month&#xD;
      observation with the registration of unfavorable cardiovascular occasions (death from&#xD;
      cardiovascular reasons, nonfatal myocardial infraction, cerebral stroke, necessity for&#xD;
      repeated revascularization of the coronary arteries) based on the analysis of non-genetic and&#xD;
      genetic factors (polymorphism of genes Thr174Met and Met235Thr in gene angiotensinogen,&#xD;
      Arg389Gly and Ser49Gly in gene adrenoceptor beta 1, Ser447Ter in gene lipoprotein lipase and&#xD;
      Leu28Pro in gene apolipoprotein E, Trp212Ter and G681A in gene cytochrome P450 family 2&#xD;
      subfamily C member 19) factors of unfavorable prognosis will be identified and considering&#xD;
      which group of patients requires the use of remote monitoring system will be formed. From one&#xD;
      group of patients we will form two comparable groups, one group will use this remote&#xD;
      monitoring system and another will not. The effectiveness of the remote monitoring system&#xD;
      will be evaluated after 6-month's observation based on the registration of the unfavorable&#xD;
      cardiovascular occasions (death from cardiovascular reasons, nonfatal myocardial infraction,&#xD;
      cerebral stroke, necessity for repeated revascularization of the coronary arteries, frequency&#xD;
      of hospitalizations).&#xD;
