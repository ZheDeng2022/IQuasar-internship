  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that YouTube is a poor source of high-quality medical&#xD;
      information. This is likely because there is no regulation of the content on YouTube and&#xD;
      relatively little of the content is posted by qualified medical professionals. It is known&#xD;
      that up to 30% of patients use the internet to research the procedure they will be having and&#xD;
      given the increasing popularity of YouTube we suspect many patients are using YouTube or&#xD;
      similar sites as a source of information prior to elective surgery. There are likely a number&#xD;
      of patient factors that contribute to patients seeking out videos as a source of&#xD;
      pre-operative medical information. Patient age, which is generally inversely correlated to&#xD;
      computer literacy, may have a role. Patient anxiety and pre-operative worrying may cause a&#xD;
      patient to turn to the internet to search for information, and the poor overall quality of&#xD;
      the content available may worsen pre-operative anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing patients with a reliable,&#xD;
      high-quality video about their condition and operation prior to surgery reduces pre-operative&#xD;
      anxiety. Secondary aims are to determine the percentage of patients that independently seek&#xD;
      out videos online as a source of medical information prior to elective hand surgery, identify&#xD;
      patient attributes that are associated with this behavior, and understand if introducing high&#xD;
      quality pre-surgical videos has an impact on post-operative patient outcomes and/or patient&#xD;
      engagement. The investigators hypothesize that providing patients with high-quality&#xD;
      pre-operative videos will reduce pre-operative anxiety. Its is also expected that patients&#xD;
      who seek out videos on their own for pre-operative medical information will be younger and&#xD;
      have higher anxiety levels and pain catastrophizing scores. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients who watch high-quality pre-operative videos may have better short&#xD;
      term post-operative outcomes and greater engagement in their care than their counterparts&#xD;
      that did not watch videos or who sought out videos on their own.&#xD;
