  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the fact that a high incidence rate (14.2%) of rare tumor (incidence rate&#xD;
      &lt;2.5/100,000) as defined in this study according to the National Cancer Registry data from&#xD;
      National Cancer Center of China, as well as the current status of lacking guidelines and&#xD;
      consensus of rare tumor treatment. We proposed this study &quot;A Phase II, open label,&#xD;
      non-randomized, multiple-arm, single-center clinical trial in patients with advanced rare&#xD;
      solid tumors who failed to standard treatment&quot;, aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      targeted drugs of specific tumor-driven genes in patients with advanced rare solid tumors&#xD;
      with corresponding actionable alterations, as well as the safety and efficacy of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitors in patients with advanced rare solid tumors without actionable&#xD;
      alterations. Patients with advanced rare tumors who failed to standardized treatment carrying&#xD;
      actionable alterations as &quot;EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion mutation, L858R replacement&#xD;
      mutation), ALK gene fusion, ROS-1 gene fusion, C-MET gene amplification or mutation (D1010&#xD;
      mutation, 14 exon mutation, y1003 mutation), BRAF mutation, CDKN2A mutation, BRCA1/2&#xD;
      mutation, HER-2 mutation, HER-2 over expression/amplification, C-KIT mutation&quot;, will enroll&#xD;
      targeted therapy arms and be given corresponding targeted drugs (Dacomitinib, Crizotinib).&#xD;
      And patients without targeted alterations mentioned above will enroll PD-1 inhibitor arm and&#xD;
      to be treated with Sintilimab. After acquired resistance patients treated with olaparib and&#xD;
      palbociclib will receive combination treatment with durvalumab. After acquired resistance&#xD;
      patients treated with vemurafenib will receive combination treatment with atezolizumab. The&#xD;
      statistics of current study adopts Simon's two-stage Minimax design: In the first stage of&#xD;
      clinical research, 12 subjects will be observed. If the number of CR + PR is less than 1, the&#xD;
      trial will be terminated, otherwise, the group will continue to expand to 16 subjects.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the first stage, there are 12*5/(1-10%)=54 patients of targeted treatment group&#xD;
      and 126 patients in the immunotherapy group, 180 patients totally in the first stage. If they&#xD;
      all enter the second stage, the final target treatment group is 16*5/(1-10%) = 72 patients&#xD;
      and the immunotherapy group which has 168 patients which brings to a total of 240 patients.&#xD;
      The sample size of the study shall be adjusted according to the interim analysis. Primary&#xD;
      Endpoint of this study is objective response rate (ORR) in immunotherapy group and targeted&#xD;
      therapy group assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and investigator.&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints are Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the targeted treatment group&#xD;
      assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and investigator; PFS (RECIST 1.1) and iPFS&#xD;
      (iRECIST) in the single drug immunotherapy group assessed by Blinded Independent Central&#xD;
      Review and investigator; Duration of Response (DoR) in the targeted therapy and single&#xD;
      immunotherapy groups assessed by the investigator; Durable Clinical Benefit (DCB) in the&#xD;
      single drug immunotherapy group; Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) in subjects ect.&#xD;
