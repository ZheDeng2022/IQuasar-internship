    <arm_group_label>Dose Expansion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>If the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) for Venetoclax during induction is established, then the dose-expansion cohort would continue to test venetoclax in both induction and maintenance. Participants would be administered non-continuous induction therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-I/induction RP2D), Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1, Carboplatin (5mg/mL/min) on Day 1 and Etoposide (100mg/m^2) on Days 1-3 followed by continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1. If significant toxicity and DLTs in induction precluded identification of an RP2D for venetoclax in induction treatment, then the safety and efficacy of venetoclax would only be investigated in dose-expansion in the maintenance setting. Participants would be administered continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1.</description>

          <title>Dose Escalation (Arm B2) (Induction + Maintenance)</title>
          <description>Cohort B2: Participants with ES-SCLC were to be administered non-continuous induction therapy with Venetoclax (400mg) once daily (QD) from Day 1 to 7, Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1, Carboplatin (5mg/mL/min) on Day 1 and Etoposide (100mg/m^2) on Days 1-3. Participants who tolerated study treatment without excessive toxicity, and had not undergone disease progression were to be then proceeded to maintenance treatment with venetoclax plus atezolizumab. The venetoclax dose for the maintenance setting in Arm B will be the dose that has been cleared in the maintenance only arm (Arm A) of the study (maintenance RP2D, RP2D-M).</description>

          <title>Dose Expansion</title>
          <description>If the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) for Venetoclax during induction is established, then the dose-expansion cohort would continue to test venetoclax in both induction and maintenance. Participants would be administered non-continuous induction therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-I/induction RP2D), Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1, Carboplatin (5mg/mL/min) on Day 1 and Etoposide (100mg/m^2) on Days 1-3 followed by continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1. If significant toxicity and DLTs in induction precluded identification of an RP2D for venetoclax in induction treatment, then the safety and efficacy of venetoclax would only be investigated in dose-expansion in the maintenance setting. Participants would be administered continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1.</description>
