  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies on resistance training (RT) associated with blood flow restriction (BFR) is an&#xD;
      alternative method of gaining strength and hypertrophy muscle. However, there is a gap&#xD;
      correlated to autonomic repercussion of BFR and performance. Thus, it becomes relevant to&#xD;
      investigate this type of training in post-exercise. Objective: investigate and compare&#xD;
      autonomic and performance responses of 6 weeks of eccentric RT with different intensities&#xD;
      associated or not to BFR in healthy youngsters. Method: This is a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      including 60 healthy men aged 18-35 years, divided into four groups according to exercise&#xD;
      intensity and BFR: 80% without BFR, 40% without BFR, 80% with BFR and 40% with BFR. Exercise&#xD;
      intensity will be determined by the peak of excentric torque on the isokinetic dynamometry&#xD;
      method and by the BFR, as being 40% of the intensity required for the complete examination of&#xD;
      the blood flow evaluated by Doppler. Participants will do an eccentric femoral quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle exercise session on the isokinetic dynamometer according to the previously randomized&#xD;
      group. For recovery analyzes, it will be used: the root-mean-square of the successive normal&#xD;
      sinus RR interval difference (rMSSD); high frequency (HF) ms²; HF(nu) and the standard&#xD;
      deviation of instantaneous beat-to-beat interval variability (SD1). For performance, it will&#xD;
      be used the single leg hop test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis of the population profile, the descriptive statistical method will be used&#xD;
      and the results will be presented with values of means, standard deviations, median and&#xD;
      confidence interval. Initially, participants from all study groups will be dichotomized at&#xD;
      each performance outcome (muscle strength test on the isokinetic dynamometer and vertical&#xD;
      jump test) as &quot;improvement&quot; or &quot;without improvement&quot; in order to demonstrate the behavior of&#xD;
      the responses obtained during the training, that is, whether the individual responded to the&#xD;
      RT or not. It is worth mentioning that this qualitative analysis will be performed&#xD;
      considering the data obtained from the initial, intermediate and final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dichotomization of the results of the functional tests will be performed by the typical&#xD;
      error of the sample measurement for each test. It will be considered as &quot;improvement&quot; if the&#xD;
      participant presents gains in tests above the typical error of the measure. The values&#xD;
      obtained from the initial, intermediate and final evaluation will be analyzed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the weekly average of the vagal indices (rMSSD, HF and SD1) will be performed&#xD;
      in the baseline moment and after 6 weeks of RT moment of each study group. In the sequence,&#xD;
      the performance parameters will be correlated with the autonomic parameters in the respective&#xD;
      groups. Pearson or Spearman correlation test will be used according to the normality of the&#xD;
      data. The level of significance will be p &lt;0.05 for all tests. The statistical program SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) will be used for the analyzes.&#xD;
