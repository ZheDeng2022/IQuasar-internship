  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 15,000 Veterans are treated by the VA for stroke each year. A stroke means that part of&#xD;
      the brain dies. Many people who have a stroke have difficulty with moving their arm, using&#xD;
      their hand, and they have pain. Virtual reality is a video-game based treatment that may help&#xD;
      people with stroke improve in these areas. Virtual reality involves using a computer and&#xD;
      goggles to make a person feel like they are in a different world with new sights and sounds,&#xD;
      relaxing on a beach where there is no pain, or playing the piano. In virtual reality, stroke&#xD;
      patients can practice movement in a safe and motivating environment. For example, a person&#xD;
      with stroke who has weakness in his/her arm can safely reach for plates in a virtual&#xD;
      cupboard. In a virtual environment, the plates can't break. This study will help&#xD;
      investigators to determine if people with strokes who are treated with virtual reality like&#xD;
      it, and if they have less pain and better movement.&#xD;

      Background. Over the last decade, Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge&#xD;
      technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of user-computer interface that&#xD;
      implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via&#xD;
      multiple sensory modalities. VR interventions in a stroke population have been shown to be&#xD;
      equivalent to usual care therapies and to enhance motor recovery when utilized as an adjunct.&#xD;
      Significance/Impact/Innovation. This research will advance knowledge in rehabilitation&#xD;
      research by testing state-of-the-art immersive 3-dimensional VR technology with the&#xD;
      post-acute stroke Veteran population. The proposed project addresses: (1) the RR&amp;D goal of&#xD;
      maximizing functional recovery, (2) interest in non-pharmacological activity-based&#xD;
      interventions for pain, and (3) supports modernization of the Veterans' Health Administration&#xD;
      by incorporating technology-assisted rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims. (1) Determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR&#xD;
      platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) Estimate the&#xD;
      initial clinical efficacy, or effect size, associated with the VR platform using APPS for&#xD;
      distraction and upper extremity exercise for Veterans post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Prospective within-subject pre-post pilot and survey study designs will be used.&#xD;
      The target populations are (1) clinical staff who work on the Comprehensive Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Inpatient Rehabilitation Program (CIIRP) at the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVH) in&#xD;
      Tampa (sample size N=10) and Veterans who are inpatients in the CIIRP (sample size N=10). The&#xD;
      VR intervention consists of wearing a head mounted display that plays APPs ranging from music&#xD;
      and nature views for pain distraction to more challenging strengthening and coordination&#xD;
      activities such as playing the piano virtually. The intervention will last four weeks. The&#xD;
      analytic approach will use descriptive statistics and qualitative methods. Aim 1 will&#xD;
      administer a survey with open and closed ended questions to clinicians to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of successfully integrating a VR intervention into the flow of usual care.&#xD;
      Feasibility constructs include adaptability (can VR intervention be adapted to an inpatient&#xD;
      unit), patient need (do Veterans like and benefit from the intervention), and staff&#xD;
      comments/impressions. Responses for each construct will be entered into an excel spreadsheet,&#xD;
      one tab for each construct. Responses will then be grouped by similar content. Results will&#xD;
      be reported as themes and subthemes. Aim 1 will also track patient VR tolerability by&#xD;
      documenting and discussing patient complaints and adverse events. Tolerability data will be&#xD;
      extracted from meeting minutes and grouped by similar occurrences. Results will be reported&#xD;
      as themes and subthemes. Aim 2 will estimate effect sizes and degree of precision for upper&#xD;
      extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain outcomes measured pre and post VR&#xD;
      intervention. Neurologic recovery is measured with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor&#xD;
      Recovery after Stroke-Upper Extremity, dexterity is measured with the Action Research Arm&#xD;
      Test, and pain is measured with the Pain Outcomes Questionnaire-VA. Because standard scores&#xD;
      do not necessarily translate to meaningful clinical differences (improvements), the&#xD;
      investigators will identify the proportion of subjects who experience the minimal clinically&#xD;
      important difference (MCID). Metrics will also be compared across outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next Steps/Implementation. Our next step is to work with our Program Partner in the Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation Office to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will&#xD;
      incorporate the lessons learned from this feasibility pilot study to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home evironments.&#xD;
