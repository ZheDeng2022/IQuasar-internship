    <textblock>
      Objectives of Study：This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with lenvatinib as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) exceeding Milan criteria before liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study are that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is&#xD;
      superior to regularly waiting in the list with respect to: 1) recurrence-free survival (RFS)&#xD;
      as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR); and 2) Objective Response Rate&#xD;
      (ORR).The investigators design a clinical study to explore whether the combination above as a&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment in patients with advanced HCC before liver transplant could reduce&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence and to analyze potential immune biomarker of therapeutic response.&#xD;

      Participates would be randomly assigned (1:1) to experimental or Comparator/Control by&#xD;
      computer-generated allocation based on the envelope method and the hierarchical block&#xD;
      randomization method(hierarchy: BCLC stage and AFP level). The envelopes are sealed opaque,&#xD;
      and sequentially numbered.Randomization is performed by the trial coordinator.The random&#xD;
      number table and the block assignment number table will be kept confidential by the full-time&#xD;
      secretary of this project.Center-stratified block-permuted randomization is used in this&#xD;
      trial. Then permuted block randomization is used for each stratum with a block size of 4.&#xD;
