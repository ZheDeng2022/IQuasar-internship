  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BOLD-100 is an intravenously administered sterile solution containing the ruthenium-based&#xD;
      small molecule. BOLD-100 has been shown to preferentially decrease the expression of GRP78 in&#xD;
      tumour cells and ER stressed cells when compared to normal cells. BOLD-100 will be combined&#xD;
      with cytotoxic FOLFOX chemotherapy in this study, with a dose escalation cohort to ensure&#xD;
      tolerability and safety, followed by a cohort expansion phase.&#xD;

             BOLD-100, or its clinical or laboratory assessment, e.g., Coumadin therapy, due to&#xD;
             high competitive protein binding. Subjects taking ANY supplemental IRON, i.e.,&#xD;
