      Acutus Medical's AcQBlate Force Ablation Catheter when used in combination with the Qubic&#xD;
      Force Sensing Module (AcQBlate Force System), is indicated for cardiac electrophysiological&#xD;
      mapping, delivery of diagnostic pacing stimuli, and radiofrequency ablation of sustained or&#xD;
      recurrent atrial arrhythmias.&#xD;
