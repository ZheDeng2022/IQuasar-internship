    <measure>Proportion of patients with clinical benefit 2 years after initiation of tofacitinib treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>The definition of clinical benefit is independent of the discontinuation or not of tofacitinib treatment during the observation period.&#xD;
Clinical benefit at 2 years is defined as a modified partial Mayo Score of 0 or 1 with rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1&#xD;
-Patients who died or who had a colectomy or used another biologic/anti-JAK/immunosuppressant will be considered to be non-responders, as well as patients who used:&#xD;
More than one oral or topical corticosteroid with systemic effects for UC for more than three months during the first 18 months&#xD;
Oral corticosteroids for UC, between 18 and 24 months (whatever the duration of treatment),</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with short-term clinical response for patients still treated with tofacitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately week 8 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction in partial Mayo score ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% with respect to baseline, with a concomitant reduction in rectal bleeding sub-score ≥ 1 point (absolute sub-score of 0 or 1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with biological response during the observation period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 104</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Week 8, 16, 24, 72, 52 and 104</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical loss of response is defined by a recrudescence of the symptoms that lead to a systemic therapeutic intervention (return to previous dose of tofacitinib or corticosteroid therapy, or an immunosuppressant or biologic/other anti-JAK)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
