  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The post-operative delirium picture is a serious and common complication seen after any major&#xD;
      surgery, including hepatic resection. Patients who will be planned to undergo donor&#xD;
      hepatectomy for liver transplantation will be included in the study. Basic clinical and&#xD;
      demographic information of patients undergoes donor hepatectomy will be recorded before&#xD;
      surgery. The anatomical parameters such as liver volume, medications performed during the&#xD;
      surgery, complications, bleeding amounts, fluids given, blood and blood products, vital signs&#xD;
      during surgery, fluid balance, duration of surgery, recovery length at post-operative period,&#xD;
      complications after surgery, approaches to complications, analgesics and other medications&#xD;
      used, hemogram and other biochemical parameters (electrolytes, albumin, liver frontier tests,&#xD;
      etc.), weight status, vital signs, duration of intensive care, post-operative VAS scores,&#xD;
      drainage and information such as length of stay, length of hospital stay, the healing time of&#xD;
      the wound will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hospitalization, the delirium status of the patients will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      delirium evaluation scale by consultant doctor. Blood will be taken for the measurement of&#xD;
      S100β, NSE, and GFAP levels one day before donor hepatectomy and following day of&#xD;
      hepatectomy, 3rd day, and 7th day in the post-operative period. The plasma of the blood taken&#xD;
      will be separated and stored at -80 0C until working. Laboratory values are taken from the&#xD;
      patients before the operation will be recorded over the system. The relationship between the&#xD;
      results obtained and the delirium evaluation scores performed on the days followed will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to analyze the delirium incidence and post-operative early S100β, NSE, and&#xD;
      GFAP levels within the first week following the hepatectomy performed in live donors for&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;

      The postoperative delirium picture is a serious and common complication seen after any major&#xD;
      surgery, including hepatic resection. Delirium is an acute state of confusion characterized&#xD;
      by impaired consciousness, reduced ability to focus on attention, changes in cognitive&#xD;
      functions, a perceptual disturbance development, and an uncomfortable sleep-wake cycle.&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium has an acute onset and has a fluctuating course. This complication&#xD;
      results in a long recovery period, a longer stay in the intensive care unit, higher&#xD;
      complication rates, extra nursing care, and higher costs. Therefore, appropriate methods are&#xD;
      needed to prevent and treat postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of delirium is thought to be due to many reasons. Examined in titles:&#xD;
      Changes in the electrolyte and fluid balance, nutritional imbalance (low serum&#xD;
      protein/albumin level, hypovitaminosis, especially cobalamin deficiencies (B12), folate (B9),&#xD;
      niacin (B3, pellagra), thiamine, age (&gt; 65) and gender (m&gt; f), hyperthermia and hypothermia,&#xD;
      major surgical procedures, endocrine disorders, drug use, anemia, anoxia, hypoxia and low&#xD;
      perfusion/oxygenation states, postoperative pain and painkiller medication, end-organ&#xD;
      failure, social isolation, decreased intellectual stimulation (long-term intensive care&#xD;
      therapy), sleep disorders and changes in the circadian rhythm, metabolic disorders (acidosis,&#xD;
      alkalosis, hyperammonemia, hypersensitivity reactions, glucose, and acid-base disorders,&#xD;
      limitations, and inactivity. Cases are exposed to these predisposing causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium is a type of delirium that is exposed to surgical procedure and&#xD;
      anesthesia, usually seen between the 1st and 3rd days after surgery. Postoperative delirium&#xD;
      can be seen at rates ranging from 9 to 87% depending on the age of the patient and the type&#xD;
      of surgery. Although its etiology is not yet understood, it is probably thought to be&#xD;
      multifactorial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100β is secreted by astrocytes in brain damage. S100β rises while brain damage starts, so it&#xD;
      can be used in the diagnosis of early brain damage. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) acts as an&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic enzyme, and serum levels are increased in neuron damage. The glial fibrillar&#xD;
      acidic protein (GFAP) is the intermediate filament cytoskeleton protein in astrocytes. It&#xD;
      originates from the same root structure as S100β. After hepatectomy, the donor candidates are&#xD;
      exposed to physiological changes that include the central nervous system due to surgical&#xD;
      stress as well as the functional change of the remaining liver tissue. Determining the&#xD;
      increase in serum level of biomarkers specific to the central nervous system mentioned before&#xD;
      the development of cognitive disorders such as delirium may prevent the complications that&#xD;
      may arise during the postoperative period. It also helps to provide treatment in the&#xD;
      postoperative period as well as evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the delirium incidence and postoperative early S100β,&#xD;
      NSE, and GFAP levels within the first week following the hepatectomy performed in living&#xD;
      donors for liver transplantation.&#xD;
