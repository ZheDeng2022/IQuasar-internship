  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot facility-based direct-to-pharmacy PrEP refill delivery to streamline care&#xD;
      pathway in Kenyan public health HIV facilities implementing PrEP. Data on up to 500 PrEP&#xD;
      users will be evaluated to understand delivery efficiency and in-depth interview with users&#xD;
      and delivery key informants will be conducted to identify barriers and facilitators of&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, pilot implementation evaluation of patient-centered differentiated care&#xD;
      service. The core components of the multifaceted implementation strategy include: 1)&#xD;
      3-monthly refills, 2) direct-to-pharmacy refill visits, 3) HIV self-testing (HIVST) while&#xD;
      waiting for refills, 4) Rapid risk assessment for ongoing risk, adherence, side effect, and&#xD;
      acute HIV symptoms. Clinics will implement either: 1) current PrEP patient flow without any&#xD;
      change or 2) a pilot differentiated pharmacy-based follow up PrEP care pathway. Clinics will&#xD;
      implement only one delivery model thus eliminating risk for confusion in the clinic about&#xD;
      delivery models and permitting a full-scale test of the system, since the efficiency in PrEP&#xD;
      delivery is in part at the system level, above and beyond the individual client encounter.&#xD;
      For this pilot project designed to primarily test delivery efficiency, feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of direct-to-pharmacy care pathway at systems level using existing public&#xD;
      health infrastructure, pilot and control clinics will be of comparable size selected to&#xD;
      reflect the implementation nature of the design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate whether a differentiated care model improves the efficiency of PrEP&#xD;
      delivery while resulting in equivalent or better: 1) patient waiting time, 2) early PrEP&#xD;
      continuation, and 3) adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct mixed-methods study to understand patient and provider perception, experiences&#xD;
      , feasibility and acceptability of a differentiated PrEP delivery model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the efficiency, cost and cost-effectiveness of a facility-based differentiated&#xD;
      PrEP care.&#xD;

        HIV uninfected men and women accessing PrEP services at public health HIV clinics in Kenya.&#xD;
        Data on up to 500 persons who initiate PrEP will be evaluated, both newly initiating PrEP&#xD;
        and those continuing on PrEP (up to 250 at up clinics implementing current practice and up&#xD;
        to 250 at clinics implementing direct-to-pharmacy PrEP refill visits). PrEP is standard of&#xD;
        care at these clinics, recommended by Kenyan guidelines, and demand creation, PrEP&#xD;
        eligibility assessment and provision are all performed by the facility staff following the&#xD;
        Kenya Ministry of Health PrEP guidelines.&#xD;
