      Single-center, observational registry study with a prospective and retrospective arm to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of multidisciplinary CLI teams and protocol on amputation rates, vascular&#xD;
      studies, revascularization, in-hospital and long-term outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known from large Medicare and National Inpatient Sample databases that vascular&#xD;
      evaluations in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and at risk for amputations remains&#xD;
      extremely low. However, this data is largely pulled from the early 2000s with a scarcity in&#xD;
      studies from this recent decade. A recent study showed that Medicare patients from 2011&#xD;
      showed that 23% of patients received primary major amputation. In a recent retrospective&#xD;
      analysis preformed at this institution, all amputation patients from 2011-2017 were evaluated&#xD;
      for vascular work up and long-term mortality. This cohort included 698 patients with 1009&#xD;
      amputated specimens (major and minor). This means that this institution is preforming around&#xD;
      140 amputations per year, which can be considered unacceptably high. Only 50% received any&#xD;
      form of vascular study (ankle-brachial index, doppler ultrasound, and computed tomography&#xD;
      angiography) within the year prior to amputation. Furthermore, only 30% of patients received&#xD;
      an angiogram within the year prior to amputation. In addition, all major amputations received&#xD;
      histopathological analysis, which confirmed that 62% the specimens were graded with severe&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Even in this present decade, with the knowledge that CLI patients are not&#xD;
      receiving proper evaluation and treatment leading to amputation which is associated with&#xD;
      extreme mortality rates and a large economic burden, health care facilities are not improving&#xD;
      their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary teams are a recommendation from the American Heart Association/American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology guidelines for managing peripheral vascular disease. Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team approaches in other cardiovascular diseases, such as structural heart disease, has long&#xD;
      been validated. Literature regarding the implementation of &quot;CLI Teams&quot; remains scarce and not&#xD;
      widely adopted. However, institutions that have implemented a CLI Team that engages with&#xD;
      specialists from multiple disciplines have shown successful decrease in amputation rates and&#xD;
      increases in vascular evaluations and revascularization in these patients. The goal for this&#xD;
      study is to establish a hospital-based, physician and nurse led, multidisciplinary team to&#xD;
      deliver comprehensive care to CLI patients. We believe it is important to document the&#xD;
      experience of building a CLI Team and care protocols to provide insight and validated data&#xD;
      for other programs to implement. The multidisciplinary team will include vascular&#xD;
      interventionalists, hospitalists, podiatry, wound care, infectious disease, nephrology,&#xD;
      orthopedics, pharmacists, emergency department physicians, mid-level providers, nursing&#xD;
      staff, and vascular technologists. The ultimate goal is amputation prevention and wound&#xD;
      healing through comprehensive vascular care and data driven patient outcomes.&#xD;
