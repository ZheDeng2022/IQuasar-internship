&#xD;
          5. Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer based on local testing on the most&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Cohort 1 and 3: HER2 positive status&#xD;

               -  Cohort 4: HER2-low expressing status&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 2 and 5: both HER2 positive and HER2-low expressing status&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: According to the 2018 ASCO-CAP guidelines, HER2- positive status is defined as HER2&#xD;
        immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, in situ hybridization (ISH) ≥ 2.0, or average HER2 copy&#xD;
        number ≥ 6.0 signals. HER2-low expressing status defined as IHC 2+ / ISH-negative or IHC 1+&#xD;
        (ISH-negative or untested).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: Central confirmation of HER2 is not required for study entry. However, tissue&#xD;
        blocks, or slides, must be submitted to confirm BC subtype by a Sponsor-designated central&#xD;
        laboratory retrospectively.&#xD;

        positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology (study cohort 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study cohort 1: History of BM that are non-progressing after WBRT and/or SRS and or&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;

             intervention (WBRT and/or SRS and/or surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study cohorts 3 and 4: Evidence of new and/or progressive BM following previous WBRT&#xD;
             and/or SRS and/or surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
             8. Previous treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For HER2-positive patients have been previously treated with a taxane and at least one&#xD;
             HER2-targeted therapy in the advanced scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For HER2-low-expressing patients that also are endocrine receptor negative must have&#xD;
             been previously treated with at least one chemotherapy regimen. If endocrine receptor&#xD;
             positive, patients must have been previously treated with at least one chemotherapy&#xD;
             and one endocrine regimen in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Patients must agree to collection of blood samples at the time of inclusion, at&#xD;
             cycle 2 of treatment, and upon progression or study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: In study cohort 5: Patients must agree to perform spinal taps or must be willing to&#xD;
        have an Ommaya reservoir placed for CSF assessment, at baseline, every three weeks for 12&#xD;
        weeks (corresponding to the first 5 cycles of treatment) and every six weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Willingness and ability to provide tumor biopsy (if feasible) from metastatic lesions&#xD;
        or breast primary tumor both at the time of the inclusion and after disease progression in&#xD;
        order to perform exploratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: If feasible, patients should provide a tissue sample at baseline from metastases&#xD;
        amenable to biopsy (at sites of locoregional recurrence [skin, chest wall, breast or lymph&#xD;
        nodes], or distant recurrence [bone, liver, lung or abdomen]) or as alternative from breast&#xD;
        primary tumor, that will be obtained between progression to the prior regimen and inclusion&#xD;
        in the study. Patients for whom tissue sample cannot be obtained (e.g., non-measurable&#xD;
        disease, inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit an archived metastatic&#xD;
        tumor specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. If feasible, an additional tissue&#xD;
        sample should be collected at the end of treatment visit for patients who discontinue&#xD;
        treatment due to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Patients should have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% by either an&#xD;
