  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether the study drug (capmatinib) helps to control&#xD;
      lung cancer better compared to a single agent chemotherapy (docetaxel) and whether it is safe&#xD;
      when given to patients suffering from a particular type of lung cancer. This type of cancer&#xD;
      is called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with certain specific genetic alterations&#xD;
      (called mutations) of a gene called MET, within a specific part of the gene called exon 14.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 people with advanced or metastatic lung cancer, with these specific&#xD;
      mutations in the MET gene but without changes in their epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes, will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to get either capmatinib or docetaxel in a 2 to 1&#xD;
      ratio. The randomization will be stratified by prior lines of systemic therapy received for&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic disease (one line vs. two lines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, visits will be scheduled every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, the respective treatment (either with capmatinib or docetaxel) may be&#xD;
      continued beyond initial disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 (as assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator and confirmed by BIRC) if, in the judgment of the investigator, there is&#xD;
      evidence of clinical benefit, and the participant wishes to continue on the study treatment.&#xD;
      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety evaluations&#xD;
      during the safety follow-up period, and the participant's status will be collected every 12&#xD;
      weeks as part of the survival follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to docetaxel treatment will be eligible to crossover to receive&#xD;
      capmatinib treatment after BIRC-confirmed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease and after&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criteria prior to crossover.&#xD;
