  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that the usage and delivery of energy to the brain, known as&#xD;
      brain energetics, is altered in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). This project will&#xD;
      explore whether exercise has a positive impact on brain energetics using functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scanning in PD&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD subjects will be scanned before and after a supervised exercise program to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of exercise on brain energetics. In a separate study, the investigators will also scan&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to compare brain energetics in the healthy brain with the brain energetics&#xD;
      data in PD subjects acquired in this study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous work has investigated the link between decreased brain energetics (through&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction), though an investigation in-vivo has never been feasible due to&#xD;
      technology constraints. Furthermore, recent work has suggested exercise may help reduce the&#xD;
      effect of mitochondrial dysfunction. There is thus compelling evidence to investigate brain&#xD;
      energetics/mitochondrial function in-vivo, in health, at different stages of disease and the&#xD;
      relationship to exercise. While such measurements are intrinsically difficult, a useful&#xD;
      measure is expected to be derived from the ratio between the cerebral metabolic rate of&#xD;
      oxygen (CMRO2) and the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu), if they are measured&#xD;
      simultaneously. The simultaneous aspect of the two measurements is extremely important as&#xD;
      diurnal variations in CMRO2 can be as high as 20%, while those in CMRGlu as high as 38%.&#xD;
      Fortunately, given recent advances in measurement technique and instrumentation development,&#xD;
      such studies are now becoming possible: CMRO2 can be obtained using very advanced functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques with respiratory manipulations, while CMRGlu can&#xD;
      be estimated by positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG-PET). A lower-than-normal ratio between CMRO2 and CMRGlu coupled with a decrease in&#xD;
      CMRGlu in any brain area is taken to be indicative of locally impaired brain energetics,&#xD;
      related to altered mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (i) brain energetics, measured as the ratio CMRO2/CMRGlu&#xD;
      is altered early in Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to age-matched healthy controls (HC)&#xD;
      and continues to be altered as disease progresses; and (ii) exercise will positively affect&#xD;
      alterations in brain energetics in PD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit up to 30 PD subjects who are not habitual exercisers and up to&#xD;
      10 PD subjects who are habitual exercises. The 30 non-exercisers will undergo a supervised&#xD;
      six month exercise intervention in groups, with PET/MRI scans before and after. The 10&#xD;
      exercisers will only be scanned once (for observational comparisons with the non-exercisers&#xD;
      at baseline) and will not undergo the exercise intervention. In a separate study, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit up to 30 HCs to compare to compare their brain energetics metrics&#xD;
      with those of the PD subjects at baseline to test hypothesis (i). Of the 30 non-exercisers,&#xD;
      half will be assigned to start the exercise intervention immediately after their baseline&#xD;
      scan, and the other half will have a six month delayed start to the intervention. During the&#xD;
      delay, subjects will perform passive exercise in groups, to control for social interaction&#xD;
      and possible placebo effects. Longitudinal comparisons of the non-exercisers before and after&#xD;
      the intervention will test hypothesis (ii).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are twofold: to (i) investigate a disease-initiating mechanism&#xD;
      (abnormal mitochondrial function and impaired cellular bioenergetics), which could constitute&#xD;
      a novel therapeutic target; and to (ii) study the effects of the intervention: while this&#xD;
      will be a pilot study, involving limited exercise regimens, any knowledge gained about the&#xD;
      impact of exercise on brain energetics will have a tremendous impact on the design of&#xD;
      neuroprotective therapies and personalized treatment.&#xD;
