  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to find whether the study drug BAY1817080 has an effect on&#xD;
      the electrocardiogram (ECG). 40 healthy male or female participants with the age of 18 to 65&#xD;
      years will be enrolled into this study. The ECG of the participants will be monitored closely&#xD;
      by the researchers to detect any change after intake of the study medication.&#xD;
