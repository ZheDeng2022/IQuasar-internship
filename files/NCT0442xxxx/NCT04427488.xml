      Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by partial insulin deficiency or insulin&#xD;
      resistance in peripheral tissue. Type 2 diabetes, which has a very high prevalence worldwide,&#xD;
      is a socially serious health problem. Exercise has beneficial effects on the glycemic&#xD;
      profile, such as decreased glycemic hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, increased maximum oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2max) and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetes patients. When the&#xD;
      literature is examined, it is seen that exercise is also effective in improving metabolic&#xD;
      health. Although the metabolic benefits of exercise have been shown, there is no study of&#xD;
      which type of exercise is more beneficial in what time of day in individuals with Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Circadian rhythm plays an important role in clarifying this issue because the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm is impaired in the glucose metabolism of individuals with type 2&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by partial insulin&#xD;
      deficiency or insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. Type 2 diabetes, which has a very high&#xD;
      prevalence worldwide, is a socially serious health problem. Complications seen with the&#xD;
      disease negatively affect human health. Physical activity and regular exercise are shown in&#xD;
      the first place with pharmacological treatment and diet approaches in the treatment of Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Exercise has beneficial effects on the glycemic profile, such as decreased glycemic&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, increased maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in diabetes patients. When the literature is examined, it is seen that exercise&#xD;
      is also effective in improving metabolic health. Although the metabolic benefits of exercise&#xD;
      have been shown, there is no study of which type of exercise is more beneficial in what time&#xD;
      of day in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Circadian rhythm plays an important role in&#xD;
      clarifying this issue because the circadian rhythm is impaired in the glucose metabolism of&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of structured exercises given in&#xD;
      accordance with the circadian rhythm of individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: 30 people with Type 2 diabetes in accordance with the criteria for inclusion in the&#xD;
      Department of Endocrine and Metabolism Diseases of Medipol University Hospital in Istanbul&#xD;
      will be included in this study. Individuals who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      between the ages of 35-65, who have body mass index between 25 and 30, who have HbA1c value&gt;&#xD;
      6.5%, who have fasting blood glucose&gt;126 mg/dl, who have Type 2 diabetes between 5-10 years,&#xD;
      who have inactive physical activity, who independently can walk and volunteer to exercise for&#xD;
      at least 3 days a week will be included in our study. Type 1 diabetes individuals, diagnosed&#xD;
      with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), having diabetic Ketoacidosis coma,&#xD;
      orthopedic or surgical problems to prevent walking and exercising, foot ulcers, individuals&#xD;
      have any neurologıcal problem and individuals with cardiac, pulmonary or systematic diseases&#xD;
      that will cause contraindications will not be included in the study. Blood sample&#xD;
      evaluations, circadian rhythm evaluation, 6-minute walking test, 30-second sit to stand test,&#xD;
      quality of life assessment with Ferrans&amp;Powers Quality of Life Index of the individuals&#xD;
      included will be carried out at the beginning of the study (T0) and at 6 (T1), 12 (T2) and 18&#xD;
      (T3) weeks after the study started Participants will be divided into two groups, morning (MC)&#xD;
      and evening chronotypes (EC), according to their circadian rhythms. In both groups, there was&#xD;
      a 6-week control period in which the participants continued to their routine treatment and&#xD;
      did not perform any specific exercises. In the MC group, exercises were applied in the&#xD;
      morning hours for the first 6 weeks and in the evening hours for the next 6 weeks. The EC&#xD;
      exercises were applied in the evening hours for the first 6 weeks and in the morning hours&#xD;
      for the next 6 weeks. A structured exercise program with aerobic and strengthening exercises&#xD;
      was carried out in both groups for 3 days a week over 12 weeks. . Individuals were evaluated&#xD;
      in terms of the blood test, functional capacity and quality of life at the baseline, 6 weeks&#xD;
      before the exercise, 6 and 12 weeks after the exercises.&#xD;
