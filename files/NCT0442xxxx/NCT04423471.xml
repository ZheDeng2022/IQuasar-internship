      Objectives: To identify peripheral neuroinflammatory markers in patients suffering from major&#xD;
      depression or psoriasis in relation to affective symptoms (anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      irritability), fatigue and cognitive symptoms; and their change after specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Observational prospective cohort study in patients diagnosed with major&#xD;
      depression and patients with plaque psoriasis, who naturalistically undergo different&#xD;
      treatments (systemic or biological for psoriasis, antidepressants for depression). Forty-one&#xD;
      patients with major depression attending psychiatric consultations and 82 patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis attending dermatology consultations at Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol&#xD;
      aged 18 to 65 years old will be selected for inclusion. All of them will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and after 4 months treatment through a series of demographic and clinical variables,&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnosis, psychopathological scales and immunological and biochemical variables&#xD;
      after blood draw for obtaining serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and extraction&#xD;
      of total RNA. Investigators will analyze the correlation between immunological markers and&#xD;
      affective and cognitive symptoms at baseline, as well as their variation after treatment.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a bivariate comparative analysis will be carried out, where statistically&#xD;
      significant or marginally significant variables associated with psychopathological variables&#xD;
      will be used to construct a multivariate model of binary logistic regression.&#xD;

      Design This is a prospective observational study of cohorts with patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      major depression or psoriasis and subjected to different treatments with systemic or&#xD;
      biological drugs in the case of psoriasis, and with antidepressants in the case of major&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of study The subjects that will participate in this study will be outpatients&#xD;
      treated in the Dermatology Consultations and the Psychiatric Consultations of the Germans&#xD;
      Trias i Pujol University Hospital (Badalona, Spain), clinically diagnosed with psoriasis or&#xD;
      major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 18 and 65&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of 1) In the psoriasis group: diagnosis of plaque psoriasis made by a&#xD;
           dermatologist, lasting at least 6 months; 2) In the major depression group: clinical&#xD;
           diagnosis of major depression according to DSM-5 criteria made by a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving systemic or biological treatment for psoriasis, or antidepressant for&#xD;
           major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous treatments for psoriasis: narrow band ultraviolet B radiation (NBUBR)&#xD;
           phototherapy in the last 2 weeks; Psoralene+ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy in the&#xD;
           last 4 weeks; conventional systemic treatments in the last 4 weeks; biological&#xD;
           treatments in the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous antidepressant treatments in the last 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antipsychotic or eutimizing treatments in the last 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of concurrent psychotic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol or drug use disorders, with active consumption during the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious and / or unstable medical disorders, Addison or Cushing's disease, Rheumatoid&#xD;
           arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - psoriasis patients who will receive systemic treatment (mainly methotrexate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - psoriasis patients who will receive a biological treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 - patients with major depression who will receive an antidepressant treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample's size calculation The required sample size has been calculated based on the possible&#xD;
      differences in the biomarkers: C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin IL-6, etc. Accepting an&#xD;
      alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of less than 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, 41 subjects are&#xD;
      needed in each of the three groups to detect a difference equal to or greater than 2/3 of the&#xD;
      standard deviation. A follow-up loss rate of 10% has been estimated. Therefore, a total of&#xD;
      123 patients will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Data collection and analysis All outpatients with the diagnosis of psoriasis attended in the&#xD;
      Dermatology Consultations of the Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, as well as all those&#xD;
      patients with the diagnosis of major depression treated in the Psychiatric Consultations of&#xD;
      the same center, will be evaluated for the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment visit: It will be performed by one of the dermatologists (in the psoriasis&#xD;
           group) or by one of the psychiatrists (in the major depression group) participating in&#xD;
           the study. The patient will be informed about the study and their written consent will&#xD;
           be requested. Subsequently, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed, and&#xD;
           all demographic and clinical variables will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline visit: A blood collection will be performed to collect serum and PBMC&#xD;
           (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Serum samples will be centrifuged at 1750 rpm for&#xD;
           10 minutes, the supernatant will be collected and frozen at -20 ° C in the Immunology&#xD;
           Laboratory of the Germans Trias i Pujol Institute. For PBMC, Ficoll gradient&#xD;
           centrifugation of blood samples with anticoagulant will be carried out. Once the PBMCs&#xD;
           are separated, they will be frozen with 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in Roswell Park&#xD;
           Memorial Institute (RPMI) culture doctor with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) and stored in&#xD;
           liquid nitrogen in the Cryobiology Platform of the Germans Trias i Pujol Institute.&#xD;
           Blood samples will also be obtained for the total extraction of RNA with 3 ml of&#xD;
           Paxgene® tubes, processed and frozen at -80 ° C in the immunology laboratory / Also in&#xD;
           this baseline visit, one of the psychiatrists will visit the patient and apply the&#xD;
           interview semi-structured clinic and psychopathological evaluation questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visit after 16 weeks of treatment: Clinical variables will be collected and&#xD;
           the same procedures as during the baseline visit will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis First, a descriptive analysis of the sample will be carried out.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages, while quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be described with the mean and standard deviation if they have a normal&#xD;
      distribution, or the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the correlation between the severity of psoriasis (PASI) at the baseline visit (in&#xD;
      all patients) and the different scores of the psychopathological scales will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Since the PASI does not follow a normal distribution, it will be carried out with the&#xD;
      Spearman linear correlation test (Spearman rho).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, a bivariate comparative analysis between the analytical and psychopathological&#xD;
      variables will be carried out. Categorical variables will be compared with Fisher's square or&#xD;
      exact Chi test, according to the application conditions, and quantitative variables with the&#xD;
      Student's T test for independent data or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The&#xD;
      statistically significant or marginally significant variables (P &lt;0.01) associated with&#xD;
      psychopathological variables in the bivariate analysis will be used to construct a&#xD;
      multivariate model of binary logistic regression, in order to evaluate the joint factors with&#xD;
      greater discrimination capacity of each of the psychopathological variables. For the model,&#xD;
      the odds ratio will be displayed along with its 95% confidence intervals and the model&#xD;
      calibration will be evaluated with the Hosmer and Lemeshow test and its ability to&#xD;
      discriminate using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. In all cases, P values&#xD;
      below 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      with the SPSS 22.0 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study The study is conducted in a tertiary referral hospital, so the&#xD;
      sample of patients with psoriasis or major depression may not be representative of the&#xD;
      general population of patients with these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychopathological measures are carried out through fully validated questionnaires in Spanish&#xD;
      in different population samples, including populations with comorbid medical conditions, but&#xD;
      not specifically in patients with psoriasis, except for DLQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psoriatic arthritis, although with high levels of inflammation, are likely to&#xD;
      be on chronic treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs that may affect the results. In any&#xD;
      case, the use of these treatments will be used as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects The project will be submitted to the Ethical Research Committee (ERC)-Germans&#xD;
      Trias i Pujol University Hospital for approval. Subjects will be included once they have&#xD;
      given their informed consent. The ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (Fortaleza, 2013), the Standards of Good Clinical Practice, the legislation on biomedical&#xD;
      research (Law 14/2007), the obtaining and processing of biological samples and biobanks (RD&#xD;
      1716) will be respected. / 2011) and clinical trials with medications (RD 1090/2015). The&#xD;
      data will be processed in accordance with Organic Law 15/1999, on the Protection of Personal&#xD;
      Data.&#xD;
