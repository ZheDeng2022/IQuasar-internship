  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety, determine the recommended phase 2 dose,&#xD;
      and assess preliminary clinical activity of GEN1044 in subjects with solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of GEN1044. The trial consists of two&#xD;
      parts: a dose escalation part (phase 1) and an expansion part (phase 2a). The expansion part&#xD;
      of the trial will be initiated once the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) has been determined&#xD;
      from phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is terminated due to MTD was reached. End of-trial and safety follow-up visits are&#xD;
      in progress.&#xD;
