  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study, both using a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation design： I.&#xD;
      Single-Dose Study There will be a total of 6 dose cohorts. Each cohort will include 10&#xD;
      subjects, of which 8 receives HEC96719 tablets and 2 receives placebo, regardless of gender.&#xD;
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort. Each cohort will be divided into 2&#xD;
      group. The first group consists of 2 sentinels, one receiving active and one placebo. The&#xD;
      second group will consist of the remainder of the cohort (7 active and 1 placebo) and,&#xD;
      following review of the available safety data, will be dosed 48 hours after the sentinel&#xD;
      group. Subjects can leave the pharmacy after their biological samples are collected on day 3.&#xD;
      The last safety follow-up visit is to be performed on day 7±1 via telephone. Subjects in each&#xD;
      cohort will receive a single dose of HEC96719 or placebo in the fasted state on day 1, and&#xD;
      safety evaluation is to be performed on day 3 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Multi-Dose Study There will be a total of 3 dose cohorts. Each cohort will consist of 12&#xD;
      subjects, of which 10 receive HEC96719 tablets and 2 receive placebo, the dose regimen will&#xD;
      comprise no less than once a day and will not exceed 4 times daily dosing for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days (study doses, administration method (fasted or fed), dosing frequency, and dosing period&#xD;
      are all to be determined based on data from the single-dose study and multiple-dose study).&#xD;
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort. Subjects will reside at the pharmacy&#xD;
      from the day before dosing (D-1) to 96 h after the last dose. Subjects can leave pharmacy&#xD;
      after their biological samples are collected. The last safety follow-up visit is to be&#xD;
      performed 168±24 h after the last dose via telephone.&#xD;
