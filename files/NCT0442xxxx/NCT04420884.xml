  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that TAK-676, when given on its own or given with pembrolizumab will eventually&#xD;
      help people with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to check if people with advanced solid tumors have side effects&#xD;
      from TAK-676, and to check how much TAK-676 they can receive without getting side effects&#xD;
      from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants will receive&#xD;
      TAK-676 slowly through a vein (infusion). This will happen on 3 different days during a&#xD;
      21-day cycle. Different small groups of participants will receive lower to higher doses of&#xD;
      TAK-676. Some participants will receive TAK-676 by itself and others will receive TAK-676&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the clinic or hospital for 24 hours after each infusion of TAK-676&#xD;
      in the first cycle of treatment. Sometimes the study doctor will carry out a physical exam&#xD;
      before the participant goes home. Participants will be given an emergency card to carry with&#xD;
      them at all times. The card has information about the study including contact details and a&#xD;
      24-hour emergency number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants, who receive TAK-676 and are willing and able, will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      removable patch on their chest to record vital signs for 21 days in the first cycle of&#xD;
      treatment. Also, in the first cycle of treatment, participants will record their oral&#xD;
      temperatures twice a day for 21 days in a diary when they go home after each infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout treatment, the clinic will regularly telephone the participants to check on their&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

    <description>A severity grade is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Grade 1 scales as Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated); Grade 2 scales as Moderate (minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living [ADL]); Grade 3 scales as Severe (severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL); Grade 4 scales as Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated, and Grade 5 scales as Death related to Adverse Event (AE).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT will be defined as any of the TEAEs, but not limited to, those that occur during Cycle 1 and are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to TAK-676 as a single agent (SA) or in combination with pembrolizumab. TEAEs meeting DLT definitions occurring in Cycle 2 or later will be considered in the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-676, both in the TAK-676 SA and the combination with pembrolizumab arms. Toxicity will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0.</description>
