  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to disentangle the role of host immune resistance and disease tolerance in&#xD;
      afebrile malaria infections, with the goal of guiding context-adapted tactics to target this&#xD;
      hidden reservoir, as well as to develop new approaches to clear malaria infection and reduce&#xD;
      its severity through host-directed therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infections debilitate the health of affected&#xD;
      population while representing a hidden source of parasite transmission that can compromise&#xD;
      elimination efforts. The lack of consensus on the best strategy to deal with this&#xD;
      asymptomatic reservoir is partly due to the poor knowledge on the biological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying these subclinical infections. Preliminary results in Mozambique show that afebrile&#xD;
      adults with a Pf infection detected by rapid diagnostic tests can progress to fever (10%),&#xD;
      clear the infection (20%) and stabilize at low-density (50%) or high-density (20%)&#xD;
      parasitemias. The study hypothesis is that these four main trajectories are driven by&#xD;
      antibodies against Pf variant antigens, codified by the var gene family and expressed on the&#xD;
      surface of infected erythrocytes, which would clear the infection unless the parasites&#xD;
      develop immune evasion mechanisms, and by tolerance factors that minimize parasite-induced&#xD;
      pathology and sustains host homeostasis.With the overarching goal of identifying key&#xD;
      biological factors sustaining afebrile malaria infections, this project will establish a&#xD;
      cohort of afebrile Mozambican adults followed during one month to identify subjects who can&#xD;
      reduce pathogen load and eventually clear the infection, those who maintain infections at&#xD;
      high-density and afebrile levels (tolerant), and those who fail to establish disease&#xD;
      tolerance and progress to fever. Circulating and overall parasite biomass will be quantified,&#xD;
      and new infections will be identified during follow-up using next-generation sequencing.&#xD;
      Clinical samples from individuals with low and high parasite densities will be used to test&#xD;
      whether parasitological trajectories of afebrile Pf infections correlate with host antibody&#xD;
      immunity against erythrocyte surface antigens and the transcription of Pf var genes involved&#xD;
      in cytoadhesion and immune evasion. Cytometry by time of flight and global mass spectrometry&#xD;
      will be applied on clinical samples from afebrile individuals with high parasite densities&#xD;
      (tolerant) and those progressing to fever (non-tolerant) to identify leukocyte populations&#xD;
      and metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of inflammation, tissue damage and&#xD;
      normoglycemia that support host-parasite relationships at afebrile levels. The expected&#xD;
      outcome of this project is the identification of key molecular drivers of afebrile Pf&#xD;
      infections for a better understanding of the relevance of these infections in different&#xD;
      transmission setting which may require context-specific control approaches, as well as for&#xD;
      the development of new tools to achieve sterilizing immunity and enhance disease tolerance.&#xD;
