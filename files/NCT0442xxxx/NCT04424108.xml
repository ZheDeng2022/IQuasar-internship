  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women suffer from cardiovascular diseases 10 years later than men, therefore female sex has&#xD;
      been considered as a 'protective factor'. However, the risk of cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      women increases rapidly after menopause and the declining levels of endogenous estrogen is&#xD;
      thought to be the causative factor. Furthermore, Postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT)&#xD;
      decreases the severity and intensity of menopausal symptoms and improves women's quality of&#xD;
      life. Until the last 10 years, based on the results of observational studies, postmenopausal&#xD;
      HT may protect women against cardiovascular events and decrease the risk of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease by 35-50%. However, recent randomized primary and secondary prevention trials did not&#xD;
      support the cardioprotective effect of HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of hormone therapy on serum ischemia modified&#xD;
      albumin (IMA) levels. Thirty surgical menopausal women who admitted to Karadeniz Technical&#xD;
      University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology during 1-year period&#xD;
      and diagnosed as menopause and planned to have hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms were&#xD;
      enrolled for this prospective study. The serum Ä°MA levels were recorded before and after (3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 12 months later) hormone treatment (2 mg Estradiol Hemihidrat).&#xD;

        Within 10 months of the study period, estradiol hemihydrate for all patients who underwent&#xD;
        TAH + BSO for gynecology and obstetrics in our clinic and evaluated with the diagnosis of&#xD;
        surgical menopause in the postoperative period (6th week) was prescribed. These cases were&#xD;
        evaluated in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria after they were determined to be&#xD;
        volunteers to participate in the study.&#xD;
