  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes data for&#xD;
      the commercially available MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses used in primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and prospective, multi-centre, post-market clinical follow-up study&#xD;
      involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in TKA and experienced implanting the devices included&#xD;
      in this study. Patient demographic and operative information will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively. Postoperative clinical outcome, radiographic assessment and adverse events&#xD;
      will be collected prospectively starting from the first year of postoperative follow up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects have undergone routine preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their&#xD;
      THA, and implanted MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses in accordance to indications and&#xD;
      intended use, and appropriate surgical technique(s) will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study at their first year of postoperative follow up visit, and sign ICF.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions, namely mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D-3L version was used in the study. Each dimension has 3 responses recording 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). The responses to the EQ-5D dimensions are used to obtain a single EQ-5D index value where 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. The questionnaire also includes a vertical, visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) for the respondents to record their self-rated health where the 2 extreme end of the scale are labelled as 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' respectively.</description>

        The study population for primary statistical analysis will consist of patients who have&#xD;
        already underwent their surgery with MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses for their&#xD;
        primary TKA and satisfy eligibility criteria outlined in this section. In order to avoid&#xD;
        potential selection bias, each investigator will offer study participation to each&#xD;
        consecutive eligible patient presenting as a candidate for primary TKA using the MPS-Flex®&#xD;
        Total Knee Joint Prostheses.&#xD;
