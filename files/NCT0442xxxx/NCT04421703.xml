  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the processes by which a previously proven&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention (the Med-South Lifestyle Program) can most effectively and efficiently&#xD;
      be translated into public health and clinical practice to positively impact chronic disease&#xD;
      risk reduction among mostly minority, rural, and medically underserved populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Although lifestyle behavior change interventions are widely recommended to improve&#xD;
      health, they are not being implemented sufficiently or equitably on a national scale,&#xD;
      particularly in rural communities. The research team has developed and tested multiple&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, which have culminated in the Med-South Lifestyle Program (MSLP), an&#xD;
      evidence-based behavior change intervention that translates the PREDIMED (Mediterranean)&#xD;
      dietary pattern for a Southeastern US population and includes support for increased physical&#xD;
      activity. In this research the investigators propose to identify the most effective and&#xD;
      efficient way to scale-up the MSLP for use in public health and clinical practices settings&#xD;
      so that it reaches minority, rural, and medically underserved populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, the investigators will develop, pilot test, and refine implementation strategies&#xD;
      that will be used to take the MSLP to scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Phase I participants include up to 80 participants who will receive the MSLP&#xD;
      and for whom the study team will collect baseline and follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): An evidence-based framework for scaling-up health interventions will be&#xD;
      used to guide Phase I activities. The initial phase involves refining the &quot;scalable unit&quot;&#xD;
      which includes the lifestyle program (MSLP), implementation strategies for the sites that&#xD;
      will give the program, and strategies UNC will use to train sites on implementing the&#xD;
      program. To refine the scalable unit the investigators will apply a descriptive, qualitative&#xD;
      design to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the MSLP's intervention and&#xD;
      implementation strategies (i.e., what the investigators will scale-up in Phases 2 and 3). In&#xD;
      Phase 1, the study team will recruit 2 local health departments and 2 federally qualified&#xD;
      health centers as participating sites. Each site will form an implementation team of 2-4&#xD;
      individuals who will go through training on intervention delivery and implementation. Sites&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive training either through a distance (webinar) or&#xD;
      in-person/collaborative format. Each site will recruit up to 20 participants (for a total of&#xD;
      80 across all sites) to receive the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change Number of Fruit and Vegetable Servings Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The mean difference in fruit and vegetable servings per day (baseline servings/day - follow-up servings/day) as measured by the Block Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener.&#xD;
The Block Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener is a 10-item scale with responses ranging from: (1) Less than 1/week to (5) 2+ a day. Higher scores reflect a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Minutes of Physical Activity Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in minutes of physical activity per week (baseline activity in minutes/week - follow-up activity in minutes/week) as measured by the validated modified RESIDE questionnaire. The RESIDE questionnaire is a 21-item self-administered instrument in which participants recall the frequency, duration, and destination of their walking (for transport and recreation) within and outside of their neighborhood, and cycling activity in a usual week. Higher scores indicate more minutes of activity.</description>
