  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart muscle condition&#xD;
      affecting up to 1 in 200 of the general population. It results from mutations in genes&#xD;
      encoding components of the contractile apparatus in the heart muscle cell (myocyte). These&#xD;
      mutations result in increased energy cost of force production for the myocyte which then&#xD;
      cumulatively causes a myocardial energy deficit. This myocardial energy deficit is then&#xD;
      thought to lead to cardiac hypertrophy ('left ventricular hypertrophy' or LVH) in HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVH leads to impairments in heart muscle function, heart muscle oxygenation and microvascular&#xD;
      blood flow and is the chief driver of patient symptoms in HCM. These symptoms consist of&#xD;
      chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting episodes or palpitations. Occasionally,&#xD;
      the disease may cause sudden cardiac death (SCD). HCM is the most common cause of SCD in&#xD;
      young people including competitive athletes. In addition, HCM has been found to result in&#xD;
      significant global deterioration in health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of HCM has focused on relief of symptoms by drugs such as ß-blockers which slow the&#xD;
      heart rate and improve heart function. However, symptom relief is often incomplete and there&#xD;
      is no evidence on the benefit of ß-blockers or related medications to reverse LVH.&#xD;
      Perhexiline, a potent carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor shifts myocardial&#xD;
      metabolism to more efficient glucose utilisation and rectifies impaired myocardial&#xD;
      energetics. It is currently used to treat angina in patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      There is some preliminary evidence that Perhexiline may aid in the improvement of symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with HCM. However, the effect of any form of therapy on potential regression of LVH&#xD;
      in HCM remains unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will use state of&#xD;
      the art cardiac imaging, principally advanced echocardiography and Cardiovascular Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance (CMR) to study the effects of perhexiline on LVH, cardiac function, and oxygenation&#xD;
      in symptomatic patients with HCM. The investigators hypothesize that perhexiline will&#xD;
      favourably reduce LVH and improve myocardial oxygenation by improving myocardial energetics,&#xD;
      and that these putative morphological and functional changes can be accurately measured&#xD;
      utilizing echocardiography and CMR. If this pilot study supports the hypothesis, then it will&#xD;
      pave the way for a major randomised controlled trial to definitely determine the role of&#xD;
      Perhexiline in HCM.&#xD;

    <description>All eligible and consented patients will be randomised to initiation of perhexiline 100mg once daily or identical placebo. After 4 days of treatment, a blood sample will be collected to determine plasma perhexiline concentrations: timing of the sample need not be &quot;trough&quot; in view of the long-acting nature of perhexiline. Depending on the blood results, patients might require as little as 50mg/week (slow metabolisers) or as much as 600mg/day (ultra-rapid metabolisers). The initial sample will be utilized primarily to detect presence of hydroxylated metabolite: patients in whom perhexiline is detected in the absence of metabolite will be designated &quot;slow metabolisers&quot; and will have their dosage reduced to 50 mg/week in the first instance. Repeat assay at 30 days will be utilized for individual finer dose titration based on dose adjustment table. Paired dosage adjustment in placebo-treated patients will be performed to avoid unblinding.&#xD;
Compliance will be assessed by capsule count.</description>
