  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized, open-label, 2-arm active-controlled phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      conducted at a single study site (UAMS). Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2&#xD;
      treatment arms and stratified by size of index lesion and number of brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively compare preoperative (neoadjuvant) SRS/SRT to&#xD;
      postoperative (adjuvant) SRS/SRT in patients undergoing surgical resection for brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that neoadjuvant SRS/SRT prior to surgical resection of brain&#xD;
      metastases will result in improved freedom from Central Nervous System (CNS) events when&#xD;
      compared to adjuvant SRS/SRT after surgical resection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior histopathological diagnosis of cancer other than small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer, lymphoma, and germ cell histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MR imaging of the brain with findings strongly suggestive of metastatic tumor(s) as&#xD;
             assessed by the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seen by a neurosurgeon or radiation oncologist and judged to be appropriate for&#xD;
             participation in this study, including the ability to tolerate both surgery and&#xD;
             SRS/SRT, e.g., the ability to lie flat in a stereotactic soft head frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1-2 index lesion(s) appropriate for resection, not previously treated with SRS/SRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Index lesion(s) should be &gt; 2 cm and &lt; 5 cm in largest dimension, and require resection.&#xD;
        Alternatively, patients with a diagnosis of melanoma and a lesion &lt; 1.5cm in largest&#xD;
        dimension may also be included. o All other brain lesions must be appropriate for SRS/SRT&#xD;
        alone and treated according to physician preference. Prior neurosurgery and/or prior&#xD;
        SRS/SRT at a non-overlapping location are permitted at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
        physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - MRI confirmed 1-10 lesions, 1-2 of which are the index lesions undergoing surgery.&#xD;

        Each non-index lesion (up to 10) must measure ≤ 3.0 cm in maximal extent on contrasted MRI&#xD;
        scan, and not otherwise require resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical indication and plan for stereotactic radiosurgery to all known brain lesions&#xD;
             requiring treatment (≤ 10 metastases).&#xD;
