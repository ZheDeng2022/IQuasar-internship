      This study is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study with a consecutive&#xD;
      parallel-group efficacy expansion study, designed to determine the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of DF6002 as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Dose-escalation as a monotherapy using a 3+3 design, with Phase 1 Cohort Expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b: Dose-escalation as a combination with nivolumab using a 3+3 design, with Phase 1b&#xD;
      Cohort Expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Efficacy Expansion using a group sequential design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, DF6002 will be evaluated as a monotherapy in the following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2A: Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2B: Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, DF6002 will be evaluated in combination with nivolumab in the following&#xD;
      indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2C: Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2D: Advanced (unresectable or metastatic) NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study phase, patients will receive DF6002 on Day 1 every 4 weeks (Q4W). Patients will&#xD;
      receive DF6002 until confirmed progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity (ie,&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity [DLT]), or any reason for withdrawal from the study or Investigational&#xD;
      Medicinal Product (IMP) occurs.&#xD;
