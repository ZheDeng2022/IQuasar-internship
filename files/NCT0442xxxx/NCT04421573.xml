  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a chronic mental health condition that drastically reduces an individual's quality of&#xD;
      life Dextrose injection with a small needle has been used for chronic pain patients and&#xD;
      observational results have shown it to be effective in reducing anxiety, brain fog, and&#xD;
      depression in patients with PTSD. This randomized trial will compare dextrose injection with&#xD;
      a delayed/usual treatment control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a well-recognized debilitating mental health condition associated with previous&#xD;
      trauma exposure. It is part of the DSM-5 Trauma and Stressor related disorders category.&#xD;
      Treatments for PTSD normally involve a multi-disciplinary approach. First-line treatments&#xD;
      include psychotherapy and serotonergic reuptake inhibitors. Many patients fail&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Unilateral stellate ganglion block performed favorably for&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD in a recent RCT, based upon an expectation that the cervical sympathetic&#xD;
      system is neuropathically upregulated in PTSD. However, inclusion of lidocaine requires the&#xD;
      presence of an emergency response team due to the potential for inadvertent intravascular&#xD;
      injection with generalized seizures or hypotension, and inadvertent laryngeal or phrenic&#xD;
      nerve block. Perineural injection of peripheral nerves, plexi, or sympathetic ganglia with&#xD;
      dextrose 5% in water (D5W), has performed well empirically in the treatment of post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder. No lidocaine is utilized, which allows for avoidance of lidocaine toxicity&#xD;
      risk, or any risk of nerve block. Because of that, bilateral procedures are feasible, and&#xD;
      these procedures can be performed in any outpatient office with ultrasound availability, as&#xD;
      emergency team backup is not necessary, making the procedure readily accessible. A cumulative&#xD;
      benefit has been observed, as well. The effects of BHDCP with D5W as a stand-alone treatment&#xD;
      for PTSD has not been formally evaluated. The primary objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the short term effects of BHDCP with D5W on anxiety and longer-term effects on the Post&#xD;
      Traumatic Stress Disorder Check List for Civilians (PCL-C), The primary hypotheses are that&#xD;
      BHDCP with D5W will outperform a waiting/usual care group in both anxiety reduction and PCL-5&#xD;
      score improvement. A study size of 120 is planned, based on power analysis subject to&#xD;
      modification after the first 20 participants complete the initial 3 month treatment period.&#xD;
