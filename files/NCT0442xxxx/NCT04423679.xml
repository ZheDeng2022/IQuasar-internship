  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is primarily caused by Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). Testing for HPV in&#xD;
      cervical samples is now an option for cervical cancer screening. HPV can also be tested from&#xD;
      self-collected samples which may help to improve access to screening, since it does not&#xD;
      require a doctor visit. However, many women will test positive for HPV who are not at high&#xD;
      risk for cervical cancer. Therefore, additional (&quot;triage&quot;) tests are needed to determine&#xD;
      which women testing HPV-positive require additional clinical workup. For self sampling, a&#xD;
      triage test that could be measured from the same initial sample without requiring a follow-up&#xD;
      visit to the doctor would be an ideal strategy. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether a new HPV test that measures changes in HPV DNA can be used to triage HPV-positive&#xD;
      women using self collected samples. This study will enroll 1,000 women who are undergoing&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening at the George Washington University. Women will be asked to take a&#xD;
      self-collected sample prior to their clinic visit. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical accuracy of the new HPV triage test in self-collected samples and compare the&#xD;
      accuracy of the test in samples collected by the clinician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer and fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer deaths among women, with the greatest burden occurring in low-resource settings that&#xD;
      lack effective screening and treatment. Even in the United States (U.S.), where Pap cytology&#xD;
      screening has resulted in dramatic declines in cervical cancer incidence and mortality,&#xD;
      thousands of new cases and related-deaths still occur every year, most commonly among&#xD;
      underserved women who face barriers to accessing screening and/or treatment. The recent&#xD;
      implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as a primary strategy for cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening has the potential to alleviate these disparities by improving the&#xD;
      sensitivity for cervical precancer detection compared to Pap cytology, while providing&#xD;
      greater long term reassurance following a negative HPV test. Moreover, HPV testing can be&#xD;
      successfully performed on self-collected specimens, offering the possibility of expanding&#xD;
      access to cervical cancer screening among hard-to-reach, underserved women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the many advantages of primary HPV screening, the current challenge is optimizing&#xD;
      triage testing to determine who among the many women testing HPV positive are at high-risk&#xD;
      and require immediate colposcopy referral or treatment, while avoiding unnecessary harms&#xD;
      among women at low-risk. A molecular triage test that can be conducted from the same primary&#xD;
      screening sample (i.e., reflex testing) is particularly attractive for both high-and&#xD;
      low-resource settings, particularly if it works from self-collected samples. Previously, DNA&#xD;
      methylation of candidate host cell genes has been evaluated in self-collected samples and&#xD;
      achieved acceptable performance for triage of HPV-positive women. In studies using clinician&#xD;
      collected samples, there is a suggestion that methylation of carcinogenic HPV genotypes has&#xD;
      better clinical performance (higher sensitivity/specificity) compared to host gene&#xD;
      methylation; however, HPV methylation has not been evaluated in self-collected specimens.&#xD;
      Because HPV DNA is present in only a small subset of infected cells in the lower genital&#xD;
      tract, particularly in cervical precancers, it is likely that the signal-to noise ratio in&#xD;
      self-collected samples is better for HPV compared to host gene methylation, resulting in&#xD;
      improved specificity for cervical precancer detection. Evaluating the feasibility of HPV DNA&#xD;
      methylation testing from self-collected samples is essential for determining the extent to&#xD;
      which this assay can address the critical need for HPV triage in high- and low resource&#xD;
      settings. In collaboration with the Cancer Genome Research Laboratory, a high-throughput,&#xD;
      low-cost next-generation bisulfite sequencing assay that detects methylation of the 12 most&#xD;
      carcinogenic HPV genotypes has been developed. Further, this assay includes a panel of host&#xD;
      genes, including those that have been previously evaluated in self-collected specimens. The&#xD;
      proposal is to test this assay in paired self and clinician-collected samples from 1,000&#xD;
      women enrolled in an ongoing prospective study of women undergoing cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      and colposcopy at the George Washington University (GWU). The hypothesis is that HPV and host&#xD;
      DNA methylation will show non-inferior sensitivity and specificity for detection of cervical&#xD;
      precancer in self-collected compared to clinician-collected samples and that HPV methylation&#xD;
      will have higher absolute specificity compared to host methylation in both sample types.&#xD;

        Women undergoing routine screening with Pap cytology and HPV testing or colposcopy at the&#xD;
        George Washington University (GWU). From this population, a representative subset of 1000&#xD;
        women for self-sampling and methylation testing (400 cases and 600 controls). Most controls&#xD;
        will come from the screening population, where we expect 85% to have negative HPV and&#xD;
        cytology results. The majority of cases will come from the colposcopy referral population.&#xD;
        Cases of cervical precancer will include women diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
        grades 2 or 3 (CIN2/3) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). If any women are diagnosed with&#xD;
        cancer in the study, they will be included in the case group (CIN2+); however, we will also&#xD;
        perform sensitivity analyses excluding these women. Non-cases will include those with less&#xD;
        than CIN2 on colposcopy/biopsy and women who did not have an indication for colposcopy&#xD;
        (because of negative screening).&#xD;
