  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The comparator drug (Zoladex 3.6 mg) is approved for use as a thinning agent for the&#xD;
      endometrium prior to endometrial ablation. The dosing recommendation is one or two depots&#xD;
      with each depot given four weeks apart. When two depots are administered, surgery should be&#xD;
      performed within two to four weeks following administration of the second depot.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of a generic formulation&#xD;
      of goserelin 3.6 mg as compared to Zoladex ® 3.6 mg on endometrial thinning prior to surgery.&#xD;
      The study is an open label, multicenter, prospective, parallel group randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind for Sponsor, ultrasound assessment, testing labs and statistician, the study will be&#xD;
      performed in premenopausal women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) eligible for&#xD;
      endometrial ablation. Patients will be randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive either the&#xD;
      Peptigroupe test product (Pepti 3.6 mg) or Zoladex® 3.6 mg for a treatment of 8 weeks (two&#xD;
      injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonic measurement of endometrial thickness will be performed on screening and on days 0&#xD;
      (pre-injection), 28 (pre-injection) and 42 (pre surgical procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacodynamics profile will be tabulated at the end of the study on the basis of the&#xD;
      following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estradiol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LH and FSH as additional information on hormone response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goserelin safety profile will be assessed throughout the study on the basis of the following&#xD;
      assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment-emergent AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12-Lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory parameters (i.e., biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis)&#xD;
