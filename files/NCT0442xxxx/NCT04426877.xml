    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months duration self-applied online program,&#xD;
      composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy lifestyle habits (healthy eating and&#xD;
      increased physical activity), on obese or overweight adults with hypertension. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public hospital. These patients will be&#xD;
      randomized allocated into two interventional groups: experimental group will receive&#xD;
      audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist doctor, and the control group&#xD;
      from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include: body composition (BMI), blood&#xD;
      pressure, levels of physical activity, functional capacity, fall risk, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and obesity or overweight related, even other associated comorbidities, involve&#xD;
      a worrying public health problem. The evidence shows that healthy eating and regular physical&#xD;
      exercise, monitored by different means (internet, face to face, exercise diaries), play an&#xD;
      important prevention role to maintain health while ageing. In this way, Information and&#xD;
      Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been demonstrated as a useful tool to promote health,&#xD;
      working on barriers at the same time, such as low motivation and difficulties to maintain&#xD;
      regular exercise or healthy eating habits. ICTs also allows to reach a wider audience at a&#xD;
      lower cost, due to their good cost-benefit relationship and the possibility of increasing the&#xD;
      efficiency of interventions. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months&#xD;
      duration self-applied online program, composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle habits (healthy eating and increased physical activity), on obese or overweight&#xD;
      adults with hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public&#xD;
      hospital. These patients will be randomized allocated into two interventional groups:&#xD;
      experimental group will receive audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist&#xD;
      doctor, and the control group from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include:&#xD;
      body composition (BMI), blood pressure, levels of physical activity, functional capacity,&#xD;
      fall risk, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Fall risk perception (measured with FES Questionnaire). The 'Falls Efficacy Scale' (FES) directly evaluate the impact of fear of falling on social life. This scale has excellent reliability, is correlated with measures of balance and gait, and predicts future falls and decline in functional capacity. The 16 items of the FES are rated according to &quot;how concerned you are about the possibility of falling&quot;, using the following responses (score in parentheses): not at all (1), somewhat (2), fairly (3), and very concerned (4). Thus, the total score ranges from 16 to 64 points. Higher values indicate less fall-related self-efficacy (and more concern about falling).</description>
