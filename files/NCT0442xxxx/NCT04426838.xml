  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disturbed sleep is stressful to persons living with dementia (PLwD) and their caregivers. It&#xD;
      contributes to earlier placement of the PLwD in nursing homes and increase the risk for many&#xD;
      psychological and cognitive health issues and poor quality of life for both the PLwD and the&#xD;
      caregivers. Given the potential harmful side effects of medications, non-medication&#xD;
      alternatives, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi), may be safer to&#xD;
      improve disturbed sleep in this population. CBTi which includes stimulus control, sleep&#xD;
      compression, relaxation, sleep hygiene, and cognitive restructuring, is effective and has&#xD;
      durable and sustained effects on sleep outcomes over the long-term. CBTi has improved sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in PLwD and their caregivers, separately. Since disturbed sleep in the&#xD;
      PLwD-caregiver dyad is bidirectional and interdependent, targeting the pair as a unit for&#xD;
      intervention has the potential to lead to improved sleep and health outcomes for both&#xD;
      persons. There is no current published research on CBTi when the PLwD and their caregivers&#xD;
      receive the intervention at the same time; as a result, the researchers will examine the 1)&#xD;
      feasibility; 2) acceptability; and 3) preliminary efficacy of 4-week CBTi intervention for&#xD;
      community-dwelling PLwD and their caregivers who are both experiencing sleep disturbances.&#xD;
      Forty PLwD-caregiver dyads will receive CBTi via videoconferencing sessions. Preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention will be assessed using objective (actigraphy) and subjective&#xD;
      sleep quality measures. In addition, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to examine&#xD;
      the acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 71% of the persons living with dementia (PLwD) and 70% of their caregivers experience&#xD;
      sleep disturbances, which are distressing for both the PLwD and their caregivers.&#xD;
      Specifically, PLwD often experience restlessness and fragmented sleep, which in turn can&#xD;
      affect caregivers' sleep patterns leading to multiple nightly awakenings, shorter sleep&#xD;
      duration, and/or inconsistent sleep-wake times. These disturbances increase the risk for a&#xD;
      myriad of psychological, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological health issues and poor&#xD;
      quality of life for the dyad. Given the interdependence of the dyadic sleep disturbances and&#xD;
      the negative health consequences of sleep disturbances on the dyad, there is a critical need&#xD;
      to develop and provide effective interventions to improve their sleep. Pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatment often results in potential harmful side effects like falls and cognitive decline;&#xD;
      therefore, non-pharmacologic approaches are recommended for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), a non-pharmacologic intervention that has&#xD;
      demonstrated effectiveness for improving sleep disturbances in multiple populations, is&#xD;
      delivered in various formats including face-to-face and videoconferencing. Individually, PLwD&#xD;
      and caregivers have successfully deployed behavioral sleep techniques, resulting in improved&#xD;
      sleep quality. However, there is no current published research on CBTi completed&#xD;
      simultaneously by the PLwD-caregiver dyad, and that is exactly what the researchers of this&#xD;
      study seek to do with early-stage individuals and their caregivers. The researchers premise&#xD;
      this effort on the notion that a dyadic intervention can use early-stage individuals'&#xD;
      retained capacity for communication and comprehension to establish in-the-moment agreements&#xD;
      about strategies the caregiver can employ to enact and facilitate positive sleep behaviors in&#xD;
      the PLwD and to pair that with acquired strategies to engender his/her own positive sleep&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project seeks to gather formative and preliminary data on CBTi delivered simultaneously&#xD;
      to the PLwD-caregiver dyad. The researchers will use a quantitative, descriptive approach to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-session CBTi&#xD;
      intervention administered to 40 PLwD-caregiver dyads via videoconferencing sessions who will&#xD;
      receive the intervention as a unit. Objective and subjective sleep, depressive symptoms, and&#xD;
      cognitive health data will be collected at baseline, and 1 week and 3 months post-completion&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In community-dwelling PLwD and their caregivers where both persons in the dyad self-report&#xD;
      sleep disturbances, the specific aims for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the feasibility of a video conferencing dyad-based CBTi intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the acceptability of a video conferencing dyad-based CBTi intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the preliminary efficacy of video conferencing CBTi intervention on sleep&#xD;
           quality outcomes including sleep efficiency and perceived sleep quality.&#xD;
