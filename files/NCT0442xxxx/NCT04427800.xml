  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes symptoms and potential loss of independence. These&#xD;
      effects are increased as the disease progress to endstage renal disease (ESRD), particularly&#xD;
      when external intervention (i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      dialysis) is used to keep these individuals alive. The combined effect of ESRD and its&#xD;
      treatment has a significant impact on an individual's life, potentially causing reduced&#xD;
      employment time, reduced social time and increased anxiety/stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact that CKD/ESRD have on an individual's&#xD;
      life. Specifically, this study is focused on giving an insight into the psychosocial impact&#xD;
      that CKD/ESRD and different forms of renal replacement therapy have upon these individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 4% of the UK population, with approximately 118 per&#xD;
      million population commencing treatment for end-stage kidney disease each year (UK renal&#xD;
      registry, 2017). As enal function deteriorates, these individuals become progressively&#xD;
      symptomatic and require renal replacement therapy (RRT). CKD is split into five stages,&#xD;
      classified by their glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), with stages G4 and G5 representing&#xD;
      advanced disease preceding end-stage renal failure (Levey et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with diminished physical ability, cognitive function and quality of life (QoL) have&#xD;
      also been shown to deteriorate within this population (Abdel-Kader, Unruh, &amp; Weisbord, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous findings have shown that individuals with renal disease, particularly advanced&#xD;
      CKD/ESRD have a reduced QoL and substantial symptom burden, defined as a loss of functional&#xD;
      abilities along with psychological suffering affected by the impact of their symptoms (Gill,&#xD;
      Chakraborty, &amp; Selby, 2012). Of note, this seems to become particularly notable at the&#xD;
      initiation of RRT (Pagels, SÃ¶derkvist, Medin, Hylander, &amp; Heiwe, 2012). This supports&#xD;
      previous findings by Davison &amp; Jhangri (2010) and findings by Lowney et al (2015) who found&#xD;
      that individuals undergoing in-centre haemodialysis (HD) had a substantial symptom burden&#xD;
      which was associated with a reduced health-related QoL. This is significant because in-centre&#xD;
      HD (ICHD) is currently the most common form of RRT globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no research has qualitatively examined the burden of other forms of RRT, such as&#xD;
      home haemodialysis (HHD), which is typically undertaken at home more frequently and for&#xD;
      shorter durations than ICHD; and peritoneal dialysis (PD), where the peritoneum is used as a&#xD;
      membrane through which excess fluid and toxins are removed from the body. A recent&#xD;
      investigation by Jones and colleagues (2018) explored the perceptions of UK-based individuals&#xD;
      undergoing ICHD within the National Health Service (NHS). Interestingly, several common&#xD;
      themes were identified; including fluctuations in their QoL and well-being over the course of&#xD;
      their HD therapy and restrictions in their social lives, due to HD scheduling and the heavy&#xD;
      emotional impact on themselves and others. These were shown to often be overlooked in the&#xD;
      literature, however, these factors have the potential to negatively impact an individual's&#xD;
      QoL and sense of self, defined as one's sense of purpose in life. Importantly, higher rates&#xD;
      of depression and anxiety have also been reported in individuals with CKD (Chen et al., 2010;&#xD;
      Semaan, Noureddine, &amp; Farhood, 2018). For example, Barros et al. (2016) found that greater&#xD;
      than 30% of individuals had depressive symptoms and reduced QoL. Furthermore, those found&#xD;
      with depressive symptoms tended to have a lower survival rate at the 2-year evaluation&#xD;
      period. It has been postulated that this increased prevalence in depressive symptoms could be&#xD;
      due to some significant psychosocial implications of CKD such as, reductions in employment,&#xD;
      social and personal time and interpersonal relationships (Finnegan-John &amp; Thomas, 2013),&#xD;
      supported by a recent (currently unpublished) investigation conducted by the research team&#xD;
      for this study at the Wessex Kidney Centre (WKC). During this study, it became clear through&#xD;
      informal discussions with people with ESRD and the treatment of this impacts their lives&#xD;
      greatly and that qualitative markers of QoL had the potential to be very insightful into the&#xD;
      impact of ESRD. Given the above, this study aims to investigate the QoL of adults at the&#xD;
      advanced stages of CKD (CKD stage G4 and G5) and those on all modalities of RRT (ICHD, HHD,&#xD;
      PD, and transplantation).&#xD;
