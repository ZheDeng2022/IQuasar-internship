      The relapsing nature of substance use disorder is a major obstacle to successful treatment.&#xD;
      About 70% of those entering treatment will relapse within one year. To improve treatment&#xD;
      outcome, new interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of relapse vulnerability&#xD;
      hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health problem. This study is&#xD;
      testing a new intervention, namely tDCS-Augmented Cognitive Training, to engage these brain&#xD;
      biomarkers to improve cognition and improve treatment outcomes.&#xD;

      The relapsing nature of substance use disorder is a major obstacle to successful treatment.&#xD;
      About 70% of those entering treatment will relapse within one year. To improve treatment&#xD;
      outcome, new interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of relapse vulnerability&#xD;
      hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data: Using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we have&#xD;
      identified brain biomarkers that support long-term abstinence. Our cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal findings provide evidence that higher FC, particularly between NAcc and DLPFC,&#xD;
      is a potential brain biomarker that supports abstinence. Long-term abstinent alcoholics (7&#xD;
      years of abstinence) have higher resting FC between NAcc and DLPFC when compared to controls.&#xD;
      Short-term abstinent alcoholics (11 weeks of abstinence) have intermediate FC (lower than&#xD;
      long-term abstinent alcoholics and higher than controls) (Camchong, Stenger, &amp; Fein, 2013b,&#xD;
      2013c). Further, lower FC between NAcc and DLPFC at 11 weeks of abstinence can be a predictor&#xD;
      of subsequent relapse (with 74% accuracy) (Camchong, Stenger, &amp; Fein, 2013a). Moreover, in a&#xD;
      pilot longitudinal FC study examining resting FC of NAcc at 5 and 13 weeks of abstinence in&#xD;
      individuals with stimulant use disorder, we found that FC between NAcc and DLPFC decreased&#xD;
      from 5 to 13 weeks of abstinence in subsequent relapsers, while it increased in subsequent&#xD;
      abstainers (Camchong et al., 2014). Based on the above, we believe that long-term abstinence&#xD;
      is supported by a compensatory mechanism that mediates proper executive function over reward&#xD;
      (mediated by DLPFC-NAcc FC), a potential brain biomarker that could be an intervention&#xD;
      target. These findings provide a compelling case to explore whether this brain biomarker can&#xD;
      be modulated to enhance patients' ability to remain abstinent. Based on the above literature,&#xD;
      there is a need to investigate non-invasive methods that can be used to increase FC between&#xD;
      DLPFC and NAcc both in stimulant use disorder and alcohol use disorder. Because stimulant use&#xD;
      and alcohol use are a very common incidence in the USA and both are a high burden on society,&#xD;
      the current protocol will recruit both individuals with alcohol and stimulant use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing Literature: Executive functioning, the ability to change maladaptive behavior,&#xD;
      depends on DLPFC input to NAcc (Gruber, Hussain, &amp; O'Donnell, 2009). DLPFC transmits reward&#xD;
      representations to NAcc through glutamatergic projections that guide goal-directed behavior&#xD;
      (Ballard &amp; Knutson, 2009). If DLPFC fails to activate when required, a common observation in&#xD;
      substance use disorder, target neurons in the NAcc core do not receive critical information&#xD;
      needed to select the appropriate outcome, causing acquired maladaptive response patterns to&#xD;
      persist (e.g. drug consumption) (Gruber et al., 2009). Higher FC between DLPFC and NAcc may&#xD;
      be achieved by stimulating DLPFC while subjects perform engaging executive functioning tasks.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      that can modulate brain connectivity. DLPFC stimulation may increase input to NAcc to&#xD;
      facilitate proper selection of goal-directed behavior and may also decrease craving in&#xD;
      individuals with substance use disorder (Boggio et al., 2008). Genetics and treatment&#xD;
      response: A source of treatment response variability could stem from differences between&#xD;
      participants in baseline genetic profiles or epigenetic changes over the course of treatment.&#xD;
      Genetic polymorphisms, especially in genes important for neuroplasticity, may also mediate&#xD;
      neuroplastic changes underlying the effects of tDCS (Chhabra et al., 2016), as has been&#xD;
      demonstrated with gene BDNF (Antal et al., 2010; Fritsch et al., 2010). In light of these&#xD;
      genetic influences on key tenants of our study - i.e. treatment response in alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder and physiological effects of tDCS - we will collect genetic samples from&#xD;
      participants to determine whether genetic or epigenetic variations may affect response to the&#xD;
      cognitive training and tDCS intervention. This information may help inform the development of&#xD;
      more individually-tailored treatment protocols in the future. As this is a secondary aim,&#xD;
      participants will be given the choice in the Consent Form to opt in or out of the genetic&#xD;
      sampling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome: In a double-blind randomized design, 80 abstinent (3 weeks&#xD;
      abstinent) individuals, 40 with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and 40 with Stimulant Use Disorder&#xD;
      (SUD) recruited from addiction treatment facilities will receive 10 sessions of either (i)&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to PFC or (ii) sham-tDCS. All subjects will&#xD;
      perform executive functioning tasks during each tDCS intervention (active or sham) to prime&#xD;
      the engagement of the NAcc-PFC brain circuit. We have unpublished preliminary data indicating&#xD;
      that the additional 5 treatment sessions (10 vs. 5) will likely improve outcomes and result&#xD;
      in larger effect sizes. Follow-up interviews will be conducted monthly out to 4 months post&#xD;
      intervention cessation (exact timepoint depending on participant availability) to query&#xD;
      relapse status. We are expanding follow up visits out to 4 months because we have reason to&#xD;
      believe that treatment effects could last up to 6 months post treatment. Tracking outcomes&#xD;
      out to 4 months will be necessary to demonstrate durability of treatment benefits. Dependent&#xD;
      variables will be (i) change in cognitive performance between pre- and post-intervention, and&#xD;
      (ii) relapse status after study participation. The Specific Aims are to determine if the&#xD;
      intervention: (A1) is feasible and safe in individuals with SUD and AUD, (A2) induces&#xD;
      cognitive performance changes, and (A3) is related to relapse status in the months following&#xD;
      study completion. A fourth exploratory aim is to examine relationships between genetic&#xD;
      variants, epigenetic changes and (A2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate feasibility (A1), withdrawal and retention policies are described in Section&#xD;
      12.0. To evaluate safety (A1), we will use the Treatment Side Effects Questionnaire to record&#xD;
      intervention side effects. Based on our previous alcohol tDCS study and studies from other&#xD;
      research groups, we hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate cognitive performance changes (A2), we will compare cognitive performance change&#xD;
      from pre-intervention to post-intervention) between active tDCS and sham groups. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the active tDCS group will have a larger improvement in cognitive&#xD;
      performance than the sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate relapse status at all monthly follow-up visits, we will administer the Timeline&#xD;
      Follow Back (Sobell and Sobell 1996), questionnaire and saliva/urine samples at each&#xD;
      follow-up. Based on our alcohol pilot study and literature on the effects of tDCS in other&#xD;
      addictions (Lupi et al. 2017; Batista et al. 2015), we hypothesize that the active tDCS group&#xD;
      will have lower relapse rates and longer abstinence periods than the sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): To determine generalization and durability of&#xD;
      cognitive training, patients will be asked to complete the following tasks at&#xD;
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 2 monthly follow up visits to examine&#xD;
      generalization and durability effects of training: D-KEFS Trail Making Test, D-KEFS Verbal&#xD;
      Fluency, D-KEFS Color Word, Digit-Span (WAIS), and Digit Symbol (WAIS).&#xD;
