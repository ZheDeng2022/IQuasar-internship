  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a home-based study in adults with depression. People who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder can participate in the study. Participants can take part if they&#xD;
      are being treated for their depression but still have symptoms. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to find out whether a medicine called BI 1358894 helps people with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 2 months and do not need to visit a study site during&#xD;
      this time. All study visits are conducted at participant's home by a mobile study nurse, by&#xD;
      videoconference, and by phone calls. Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group&#xD;
      takes BI 1358894 tablets. The other group takes placebo tablets. Placebo tablets look like BI&#xD;
      1358894 tablets but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants answer questions about the symptoms of their depression. We then compare the&#xD;
      results between the BI 1358894 and placebo groups. The doctors and nurses also regularly&#xD;
      check the general health of the participants.&#xD;
