  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2009 IOM recommendation value for weight gain during pregnancy is widely used. Due to the&#xD;
      unclear relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus and weight gain during pregnancy&#xD;
      when formulating this recommendation value, pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      were excluded from the study population. Control of appropriate weight gain and control of&#xD;
      blood glucose stability is an important part of GDM management in pregnant women. The&#xD;
      incidence of GDM in China is about 15%-20%, and the number of pregnant women with GDM ranks&#xD;
      first in the world. For the sake of the current and long-term health of maternal and infant,&#xD;
      it is of great significance to explore the appropriate weight gain range and formulate the&#xD;
      recommended value for GDM pregnant women as an independent population. This project intends&#xD;
      to use prospective cohort study of combining the observation of pregnant women with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes blood sugar and weight changes, through the comparison of normal&#xD;
      pregnant women suitable scope of weight gain, analyzes its influence on adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, increased the weight of gestational diabetes women recommended value is put&#xD;
      forward, and combined with the Delphi expert consultation method for evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is a prospective cohort study designed to investigated the changes in blood&#xD;
      glucose and body weight in women with gestational diabetes during pregnancy. The study aimed&#xD;
      to enroll 4000 participants, using health management app in addition to routine prenatal&#xD;
      care. Researchers screen subjects strictly according to the exclusion and inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and those who interested sign the informed consent. participants completed baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and dietary questionnaire at app under the instruction of researchers. Pregnant&#xD;
      women come back for follow up-visit every 2 weeks until delivery. If anyone doesn't upload&#xD;
      the weight data for a week and doesn't respond to the phone call from the researchers, she&#xD;
      will be regarded as lost follow-up,the number of lost follow-up cases are supplemented by&#xD;
      increasing the enrollment. Data analysis and result output finally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, part of the study conducted in Beijing has some special points which don't exsit in&#xD;
      large cohort study: participants equipment dynamic blood glucose monitor for glycemic control&#xD;
      and their blood samples and stool samples will be collected at 24-28, 32 and 36 gestational&#xD;
      weeks,respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the description of weight gain range of pregnant women with normal blood glucose,&#xD;
      the influence of weight gain on adverse pregnancy outcome was analyzed, and the recommended&#xD;
      weight gain value for women with gestational diabetes was proposed in combination with Delphi&#xD;
      expert consultation method.&#xD;
