      This phase I trial studies the side effects of BO-112 when given together with nivolumab&#xD;
      before surgery in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that can be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (resectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Immunotherapy with BO-112, may induce changes in body's immune system and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab and BO-112&#xD;
      before surgery may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma compared to&#xD;
      nivolumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the safety of BO-112 in combination with nivolumab in soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy, as assessed by the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version&#xD;
      (v)4.0 toxicity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the change in T cell infiltration at surgical resection from baseline as&#xD;
      measured by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess treatment effect (necrosis score) of BO-112 in combination with nivolumab in soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma patients receiving preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy, compared to&#xD;
      patients treated on a recently completed phase 2 study of preoperative hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the 2-year rate of local and distant metastasis of BO-112 in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with localized resectable soft tissue sarcoma receiving preoperative&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy, as compared to historical patients receiving preoperative&#xD;
      radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the dynamics of the intratumoral T cell phenotype. II. Assess the capacity to&#xD;
      grow ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from patients treated with BO-112 in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Analyze changes in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between baseline, post-treatment, and ex vivo&#xD;
      cultured tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BO-112 intratumorally on days 1, 8, and 15 and nivolumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 30-60 minutes on days 8 and 22 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also undergo standard of care radiation therapy on days 8-12 for a total&#xD;
      of 5 fractions. Patients then undergo standard of care definitive surgical resection on day&#xD;
      26 to 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, and&#xD;
      between 6-12, 12-18, and 18-24 months.&#xD;

          -  Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in specimen banking for future&#xD;
             research&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use either two adequate&#xD;
             barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of contraception to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy, or to abstain from heterosexual activity (complete abstinence) throughout&#xD;
             the study, starting with visit 1 through 5 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy. Approved contraceptive methods include intrauterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, female condoms with&#xD;
             spermicide, or oral contraceptives. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to&#xD;
             adhere to highly effective contraception during active participation in study&#xD;
             treatment and for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used&#xD;
                  consistently and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are&#xD;
                  WOCBP, are expected to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
                  listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of&#xD;
                  the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to&#xD;
                  using contraception with their partner. Contraception methods are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing&#xD;
                  combined estrogen + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided&#xD;
                       that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and&#xD;
                       that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the&#xD;
                       surgical success&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of heterosexual&#xD;
                       intercourse&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study&#xD;
                       drugs and must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus&#xD;
                       5 half-lives of the investigational drug plus 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete&#xD;
                       abstinence is elected&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy&#xD;
                       tests, as specified&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be&#xD;
                       discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete&#xD;
                       abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to&#xD;
                       the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                       the subject&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is&#xD;
                  not the primary mode of action&#xD;
&#xD;
