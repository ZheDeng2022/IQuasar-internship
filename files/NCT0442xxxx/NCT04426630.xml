  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure affects more than 38 million people globally. It is responsible for high rates&#xD;
      of hospitalization and premature mortality, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Heart failure&#xD;
      causes multiple debilitating and distressing symptoms. These symptoms can often be managed by&#xD;
      patients themselves but only when they are able to identify symptoms and select appropriate&#xD;
      actions. Self-care, a World Health Organization-endorsed intervention for chronic conditions&#xD;
      like heart failure, is greatly underutilized in lower and middle income countries, including&#xD;
      Uganda. Self-care refers to the ability of patients, caregivers and communities to maintain&#xD;
      health, prevent disease, and manage illness, with or without a healthcare provider. Mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) offers a promising platform to address this need gap in lower and middle&#xD;
      income countries. mHealth takes advantage of the widespread usage of mobile phones to offer&#xD;
      patients individualized self-care tools such as education, healthy lifestyle prompts, and&#xD;
      support with making decisions. Since 2016, this multidisciplinary, international research&#xD;
      team has been designing Medly Uganda, an mHealth application to improve self-care among&#xD;
      Ugandan patients with heart failure. This application began as a smartphone but was adapted&#xD;
      for the low-cost feature phones used widely throughout the country. It was also integrated&#xD;
      into an mHealth system endorsed by the Ugandan Ministry of Health. When patients log in they&#xD;
      are prompted to report on specific heart failure symptoms. The application then generates&#xD;
      self-care instructions based on those symptoms. If a patient reports serious symptoms the&#xD;
      application triggers an alert to the research nurse, who then consults with the patient,&#xD;
      caregiver, and if needed, cardiologist, to establish a plan of care. This study proposes that&#xD;
      an mHealth intervention tailored specifically to the local context will improve healthcare&#xD;
      quality of life for patients with heart failure. The research team hypothesizes that heart&#xD;
      failure patients who use the program will report improved scores on the Self-Care in Heart&#xD;
      Failure Index. These scores will be assessed at baseline, three-month, and six-month visits.&#xD;
      The researchers will also measure changes in patients' clinical conditions, including the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction, and frequency of acute care visits.&#xD;
      Finally, the researchers will conduct qualitative interviews with patients and providers to&#xD;
      understand their experiences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to initiate self-care sessions using the Medly Uganda application.&#xD;
      They will dial the sub-code and enter a unique PIN to access the system. They are asked to do&#xD;
      this every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning for six months, as well as anytime that they&#xD;
      experience concerning symptoms. If a participant has not initiated a session by 11:00am on&#xD;
      the designated days, the application will generate an SMS reminder. Each interactive session&#xD;
      will present a series of symptom-based questions to the participant. These questions will be&#xD;
      followed by a tailored SMS message. While session content will not remain on the&#xD;
      participant's phone, the SMS messages will. This allows participants to retain and review&#xD;
      messages, thereby reinforcing educational content. There are four status categories: Stable,&#xD;
      Fluid Overload, Urgent, and Critical. If Stable, participants will be sent one of six&#xD;
      encouraging and educational messages. If Fluid Overload, Urgent or Critical, patient&#xD;
      participants will be sent a message that identifies the symptom and recommends an action and&#xD;
      the on-duty nurse will be sent an accompanying alert. Urgent and Critical alerts will also be&#xD;
      sent to the on-duty doctor. The nurse is expected to call the patient for Urgent and Critical&#xD;
      alerts within 60 and 15 minutes, respectively. Nurse phone call interactions will be guided&#xD;
      by a standard operating manual. One nurse and one doctor will be designated rotating&#xD;
      'on-duty' responsibility to monitor clinician alerts and the dashboard seven days a week. The&#xD;
      doctor will be available to provide clinical supervision to the nurse as needed and they will&#xD;
      have a daily in-person or by-phone.&#xD;

    <description>Patients' functional capacity will be assessed using the Six-Minute Walk Test, a widely-used, reproducible exercise test that serves as a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Outcome is measured as a distance in meters. Possible range is 0-700m. Healthy range is considered 400-700m but may not be normative for all populations, including people with chronic diseases. In this study difference in distance (meters) will be examined across visits, with a lower score reflecting worse function.</description>
