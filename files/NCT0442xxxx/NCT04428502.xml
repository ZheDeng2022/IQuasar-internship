    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) Score at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>DAPSA assessed the joint domain of PsA and was derived from the sum of the following components: tender joint count (0-68), swollen joint count (0-66), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]), participant assessment of pain (0 to 10 centimeter [cm] visual analog scale (VAS), 0= no pain, 10= worst possible pain), and participant's global assessment of disease activity on arthritis (0 to 10 cm VAS, 0= excellent and 10= poor). A higher DAPSA score indicated more active disease activity. The assessment did not have a score range with an upper or lower bound. The outcome measure compared response between anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative participants.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) Score at Month 12</measure>

    <description>DAPSA assessed the joint domain of PsA and was derived from the sum of the following components: tender joint count (0-68), swollen joint count (0-66), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]), participant assessment of pain (0 to 10 centimeter [cm] visual analog scale (VAS), 0= no pain, 10= worst possible pain), and participant's global assessment of disease activity on arthritis (0 to 10 cm VAS, 0= excellent and 10= poor).

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Score 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28 ESR) at Month 1, 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 ESR was calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, ESR (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and participant's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated high disease activity). DAS 28 ESR =0.56*sqrt (PJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.70*In (ESR) + 0.014*PtGA; ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root of. DAS28 ESR less than equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 ESR greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity. The outcome measure compared response between anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative participants.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Score 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28 ESR) at Month 1, 6 and 12</title>
        <description>DAS28 ESR was calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, ESR (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and participant's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated high disease activity). DAS 28 ESR =0.56*sqrt (PJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.70*In (ESR) + 0.014*PtGA; ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root of. DAS28 ESR less than equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 ESR greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity. The outcome measure compared response between anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative participants.</description>
