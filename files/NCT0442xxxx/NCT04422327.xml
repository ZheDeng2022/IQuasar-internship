    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the impact of consumption of COMBO, a combination product of two&#xD;

      This is an open label study designed to assess the impact on stress, mood and bowel symptoms&#xD;
      &amp; safety of COMBO, a combination of Bifidobacterium longum 35624® and Bifidobacterium longum&#xD;
      1714™ strains, when consumed once daily for 8 weeks, in adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS). Volunteers will be screened according to the selection criteria in order to identify&#xD;
      up to 40 female subjects, with recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort and mild to moderate&#xD;
      stress/mood status. The study will involve 6 visits over an 18 to 20-week period [Screening&#xD;
      period (Visit 1: week-2), Intervention period (Visit 2: week 0, Visit 3: week 4, Visit 4:&#xD;
      week 8), and Follow-up/ Washout period (Visit 5: week 12, Visit 6: week 16)]. Participants&#xD;
      will fill in daily and weekly eDiary from 1st visit onwards. Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered from visit 2 to visit 6. Research blood and saliva will also be collected at&#xD;
      these time points. Stool sample will be collected at Visit 2, 4, 5, 6.&#xD;
