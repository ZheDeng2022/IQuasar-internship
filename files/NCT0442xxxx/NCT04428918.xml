      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a procedure in which a person gets stem&#xD;
      cells from a donor in order to treat their disease. Researchers want to collect samples from&#xD;
      people who have had or will have HCT. They will perform tests on the samples to study the&#xD;
      immune system and its response to infections and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect biological samples from people who have had or are planning to have HCT to treat&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiencies, blood cancers, or disorders of T-cell proliferation and/or&#xD;
      dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 8 years and older who have undergone or are planning to undergo HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical chart review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo apheresis. For this, a needle will be placed into an arm vein to&#xD;
      take blood. A machine divides the whole blood into parts. The sample cells are taken out and&#xD;
      the rest of the blood is returned through a second needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. For this, the hipbone will be&#xD;
      numbed. A needle will be put into the hipbone. Bone marrow will be taken out through the&#xD;
      needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a tumor or other abnormal tissue biopsy. For this, a tissue sample is&#xD;
      obtained using a needle and syringe. They will sign a separate consent form. They may have a&#xD;
      body scan or ultrasound to help locate the tumor during the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts for as long as participants choose to give samples.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogenic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for&#xD;
           some patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and hematological cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCT for PID looks to restore defects in cells of hematopoietic origin allowing for&#xD;
           eradication of protracted or recurrent viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The curative potential of allogenic HCT for hematologic malignancies is mediated by the&#xD;
           allogeneic immune system through a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of the immunologic landscape in patients with successful eradication of&#xD;
           viral infections and hematologic malignancies following allogenic HCT requires further&#xD;
           investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To collect and bank blood, apheresis products, tumor, body fluids, and other biospecimens&#xD;
      from patients with allogenic HCT and perform immunological landscape studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients age greater than or equal to 8 years of age and have undergone or are planning to&#xD;
      undergo HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may undergo sampling of blood, apheresis products, tumor, effusions, ascites,&#xD;
           urine, bone marrow, skin, mucosa, saliva, stool, sputum, spinal fluid, or other tissues&#xD;
           or fluids for banking and laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.&#xD;
