      Diagnostic pathways for children with possible autism. Which work best, for whom, when, and&#xD;
      at what cost? Autism is a complex neuro-behaviour condition. People with autism have&#xD;
      difficulty with social interaction and in communication with others. They may struggle with&#xD;
      change, and repeat actions over and over. Life may be very anxious or stressful. The signs of&#xD;
      autism can occur at any age but often appear in the first two years of life. There is no one&#xD;
      type of autism, but many, so the condition is now called autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
      Autism is lifelong but this study is only about children. Caring for a child with autism can&#xD;
      be difficult and can sometimes be tough on the whole family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to guide the people who plan services for families and children. Different&#xD;
      teams and services that do autism assessments will help us. The investigators will ask teams&#xD;
      and services: What speeds up diagnosis? What delays diagnosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be in four work packages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will review research in the UK and abroad to find evidence and ideas&#xD;
           that will help speed up diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will survey professionals who work for the specialist teams who&#xD;
           diagnose autism. The survey will be about each step in the process and ask which&#xD;
           professionals get involved. The investigators will ask about the number of children they&#xD;
           see and the time it usually takes to reach a diagnosis. This will give us a picture of&#xD;
           the national situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After the national survey, the investigators will select around six or eight teams.&#xD;
           These teams will be using different and innovative approaches. The investigators will&#xD;
           study those approaches. The investigators will talk to clinical staff, managers,&#xD;
           referrers, parents and young people. Parents and young people will have gone through the&#xD;
           diagnostic process. The investigators will ask parents and young people about their&#xD;
           experiences and views. The investigators will review the steps in the diagnosis process&#xD;
           for about 70 children in each service. The investigators will find out how long each&#xD;
           assessment takes, how much clinical time it takes, and how much it costs. The&#xD;
           investigators will compare findings across teams and services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigators will have national meetings with autism experts and patient groups.&#xD;
           The investigators will show them our findings. These groups will agree recommendations&#xD;
           for practice. Clinical teams, service managers, commissioners, parents' groups, and NHS&#xD;
           England will receive recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team has specialist expertise in autism, health services, economics, and&#xD;
      statistics. The team includes public and NHS England partners. This will ensure the&#xD;
      investigators take account of the needs of families and the investigators send the findings&#xD;
      to people who plan services.&#xD;

      Scientific Summary (following Rameses 2 reporting guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Title&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Realist Evaluation of Autism ServiCe Delivery (RE-ASCeD): Which diagnostic pathways work&#xD;
      best, for whom, when, and at what cost?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question Which autism diagnostic pathways work best, for whom, in what&#xD;
      circumstances, and at what cost when providing timely and high quality diagnostic services?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors underpin timely diagnosis service delivery success or failure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What needs to be in place to identify the needs and create individualized, holistic&#xD;
           pathways of diagnosis for the child and their family?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The NHS England Long Term Plan states: &quot;Children and young people with suspected&#xD;
      autism wait too long before being provided with a diagnostic assessment. Over the next three&#xD;
      years the investigators aim to test and implement the most effective ways to reduce waiting&#xD;
      times…achieving timely diagnostic assessments in line with best practice guidelines...(and)&#xD;
      to support children with autism and their families, throughout the diagnostic process.&quot; Set&#xD;
      against a background of increasing demand for diagnostic assessment, and the need, as&#xD;
      recommended by the NICE guidelines, for a multidisciplinary approach to assessment, taking at&#xD;
      least 13 hours of professional time and £800 per child, evidence is needed to identify models&#xD;
      of diagnostic assessment to achieve timely diagnoses, and how families can best be supported&#xD;
      through this process. The NHSE Long Term Plan aims to reduce the wait time for diagnosis, and&#xD;
      the aim of this project is to find ways/models to directly address that need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives This study aims to examine existing models of Autism diagnostic service&#xD;
      delivery, and to investigate which approaches offer the most timely, cost-effective, high&#xD;
      quality and child and family friendly solutions, and in line with realist thinking, to&#xD;
      identify the factors that are likely to underpin their success, or failure, if rolled out&#xD;
      more generally across providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use Realist Evaluation methodology, which enables evaluation of complex&#xD;
      interventions in health care by building on existing research, to identify &quot;what works, for&#xD;
      whom and in what circumstances&quot;. Mixed methods, including Rapid Realist (literature) Review,&#xD;
      survey of current practice, and case studies of centres delivering promising approaches, will&#xD;
      be used to build a picture in an iterative manner, to identify underlying Contexts and&#xD;
      Mechanisms that contribute to the desired Outcomes (CMO configurations) of improved Autism&#xD;
      diagnostic service delivery and user experience, that in turn can provide plausible&#xD;
      explanations of why the service models work or do not in certain circumstances. Data analysis&#xD;
      from each phase of the study will be synthesised through a realist evaluative process&#xD;
      comprising of four stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Articulation of programme theories and propositions from WP1 of the study (rapid realist&#xD;
           review). Identification of candidate CMO configurations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection from WP4 (case studies) of the study to test and refine propositions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Map the outcomes of each model across the cases; interrogate what contexts and&#xD;
           mechanisms explain the pattern of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Through stakeholder consolidation (WP5), refine explanatory CMO configurations to&#xD;
           evaluate what works best and in what circumstances to deliver timely and cost-effective&#xD;
           diagnostic services that meet the needs of children with possible Autism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Programme Theory (Based on NICE principles) If there is an MDT assessment by a team&#xD;
      with competencies in child neurodevelopment and mental health (context), then Autism will be&#xD;
      recognised as a complex condition that relies on detailed history and observation across&#xD;
      settings (mechanism) to diagnose it, leading to an accurate diagnosis, recognition of&#xD;
      associated comorbidity such as ADHD and intellectual disability (outcome), and the ruling out&#xD;
      of complex differential diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will also create - whilst not an explicit part of this project - accurate pictures of&#xD;
      child strengths and needs to inform individualized packages of support and intervention&#xD;
      through health, education and social care (outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package One (months 1-7). Rapid Realist Review. Evidence will be sought from published&#xD;
      studies and evaluations of Autism diagnostic services, including controlled trials,&#xD;
      uncontrolled studies, cost-effectiveness studies, process evaluations, grey literature and&#xD;
      qualitative studies, including unpublished information about locally implemented Autism&#xD;
      services. The purpose will be to refine or develop initial programme theories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package Two (months 1-6): National/International Survey of Current Diagnostic Practice:&#xD;
      An electronic survey will be sent to UK CDCs, CAMHS teams, and tertiary centres, delivering&#xD;
      Autism diagnostic services. This will ask teams to describe current challenges to, and any&#xD;
      new models of diagnostic service delivery they are using. Analysis will use both qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative methods, to identify common themes, and services using novel approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package Three (months 7-9): Purposive Sampling Frame. The findings of WP 1 &amp; 2 will be&#xD;
      used to develop a matrix of the key features of service delivery, plus other contextual&#xD;
      factors such as lower SES, rural, urban etc. This will be used as a sampling frame. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that 6-8 service delivery models will be purposefully selected as case studies&#xD;
      across the matrix to ensure the investigators have a full range of delivery models and&#xD;
      population characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package Four: Case studies (months 10-29): In-depth exploration of individual service&#xD;
      models will be carried out to determine the interrelationship of context, intervention,&#xD;
      mechanisms and outcomes as they occur in their natural setting. Data will be gathered within&#xD;
      case studies using mixed methods at two levels: (i) service model and (ii) individual child/&#xD;
      family. Methods will include semi structured realist Interviews, focus groups, and document&#xD;
      reviews to assemble a comprehensive description of the service and model. Interviewees will&#xD;
      include commissioners, service managers, clinicians, referrers, parents and young people.&#xD;
      Interviews will be recorded and transcribed, proceeding to qualitative analysis based on&#xD;
      components of the programme theory. Regular team meetings will discuss coding, address&#xD;
      inconsistencies, and refine collective understanding of coding framework. Coded data will be&#xD;
      collated using NVivo software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each case study the journeys of at last 58 children completing the diagnostic pathway&#xD;
      will be recorded from case notes to measure pathway, hours of professional input and time to&#xD;
      diagnosis. Costs incurred by families for example travel to clinic, loss of earnings, will be&#xD;
      collected by interview. Associations between service use costs and characteristics of the&#xD;
      child and model will be assessed by regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package Five: Consolidation event, Months 27-28 : The investigators will run two&#xD;
      iterative national consensus workshops, inviting key stakeholders including NHSE and&#xD;
      parents/young people, to refine and confirm the context-mechanism-outcome configurations, and&#xD;
      salient actions required to deliver timely, reliable and costed diagnostic services that meet&#xD;
      the needs of children with possible Autism. This will lead to dissemination of models to&#xD;
      inform the ongoing development of service models within the NHSE Long-Term Plan,&#xD;
      commissioning guidelines and local service development.&#xD;
