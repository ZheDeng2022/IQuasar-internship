  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, randomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-dose study for subjects with&#xD;
      mild to moderate ALS. The protocol is designed to determine whether ALZT-OP1a treatment will&#xD;
      positively impact neuro-inflammatory biomarkers and slow down or arrest functional decline in&#xD;
      subjects with mild to moderate ALS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Phase IIa study is designed as a randomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-dose study&#xD;
      for subjects with mild to moderate ALS. The study will evaluate 1) safety, 2) tolerability,&#xD;
      3) changes in physical function measured using the ALSFRS-R, 4) two doses of ALZT-OP1a in&#xD;
      order to determine an optimal and effective dose that could positively impact&#xD;
      neuro-inflammatory biomarkers, and 5) to demonstrate preliminary evidence if this treatment&#xD;
      could potentially slow down or arrest functional decline in subjects with mild to moderate&#xD;
      ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 evaluable subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: Group I&#xD;
      (n=40) will consist of low dose ALZT-OP1a, administered via dry powder inhalation; OR Group&#xD;
      II (n=40), which will consist of high dose ALZT-OP1a, administered via dry powder inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will dose for 12 weeks and will be asked to return to the site for scheduled visits&#xD;
      and biomarker collection at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12.&#xD;
