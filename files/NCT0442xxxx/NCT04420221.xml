    <textblock>
      Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of GSK S. aureus candidate vaccine (GSK3878858A) when&#xD;
      administered to healthy adults (dose-escalation) and to adults 18 to 50 years of age with a&#xD;
      recent S. aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). In the dose-escalation safety lead-in&#xD;
      phase in healthy adults safety and immunogenicity of 4 different compositions is assessed.&#xD;
      After safety has been shown in this phase, in the second phase, proof of principle (PoP)&#xD;
      phase of the study in adults with a recent SSTI safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the&#xD;
      final composition of the vaccine is assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main reasons for Protocol Amendment 2, dated 09-04-2021, have been to simplify the study&#xD;
      procedures for the PoP phase, including those related to the screening of subjects and to&#xD;
      outline specific measures related to an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public&#xD;
      health threat (e.g.: a pandemic) that may be applicable during the subjects' participation in&#xD;
      the study. Additionally, some minor corrections have been made as well.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must satisfy all the following criteria at study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up&#xD;
             visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written or witnessed informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performance&#xD;
             of any study specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject satisfying screening requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, after the nature of the study has been explained to them, have shown&#xD;
             adequate comprehension of the study procedures and knowledge of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male or female between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of first&#xD;
             vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
             Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation or occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy or post-menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the&#xD;
             subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of enrolment, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period&#xD;
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria only for subjects to be enrolled in the dose-escalation&#xD;
        safety lead-in screening epoch:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Healthy subjects as established by medical history, clinical examination and laboratory&#xD;
        assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria only for subjects to be enrolled in the PoP screening epoch:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before&#xD;
        entering into the study with an ongoing SSTI suspected to be caused by S. aureus, as&#xD;
        diagnosed by investigator (before randomization subjects have to be treated until clinical&#xD;
        resolution of culture confirmed SSTI caused by S. aureus). SSTI must be amenable to&#xD;
        microbiological culturing per standard clinical practice (i.e. recovery of drainage sample&#xD;
        from abscess or suppurative cellulitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR - Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before&#xD;
        entering into the study with an ongoing S. aureus SSTI (i.e. S. aureus is the most likely&#xD;
        cause), as confirmed by a S. aureus positive culture performed outside the study procedures&#xD;
        and not earlier than 14 days prior to Informed Consent Form signature. Before randomisation&#xD;
        subjects have to be treated until clinical resolution of the culture confirmed SSTI caused&#xD;
        by S. aureus. These subjects will be enrolled whether they have or have not already started&#xD;
        specific treatment of the infection. In case they have not started the treatment, this will&#xD;
        be then given in compliance with the standard medical practice for the management of S.&#xD;
        aureus SSTIs and the choice and judgment of the most appropriate treatment will be applied&#xD;
        by the investigator, outside the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects at study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt;40 kg/m2&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to latex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent history of uncontrolled neurological disorders or seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of potential immune-mediated disease (pIMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical conditions that in the investigator's opinion represent a contraindication to&#xD;
             intramuscular vaccination and blood draws&#xD;

             other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
             vaccine(s)/placebo (Day -29 to Day 1), or during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants&#xD;
             or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 3 months prior to the first&#xD;
             vaccine/placebo dose&#xD;
