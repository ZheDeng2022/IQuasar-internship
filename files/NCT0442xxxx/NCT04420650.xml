  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efforts in curing and preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been elusive thus&#xD;
      far. One reason for that is the lack of understanding of the role of the brain in the&#xD;
      development and treatment of the disease. In recent studies, the hypothalamus was identified&#xD;
      as part of a brain network including higher cognitive regions that is particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      to insulin resistance. Furthermore, the central insulin response in this network predicted&#xD;
      food craving and hunger. In this project, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is&#xD;
      implemented as a tool to stimulate brain networks. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      stimulating the hypothalamus-cognitive network will enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce&#xD;
      food intake, food craving and hunger. Furthermore, the project will provide the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to investigate novel mechanisms of insulin resistance in participants who have&#xD;
      been extensively metabolically characterized.&#xD;

      Objectives The overarching aim of the study is to stimulate the hypothalamus-cognitive brain&#xD;
      network to improve insulin sensitivity and eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement tDCS stimulation compared to sham stimulation in overweight and obese adults&#xD;
           to assess the impact on eating behavior, cognition and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation of the hypothalamus-cognitive&#xD;
           network has a causal effect on metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation has a significant effect on brain&#xD;
           functional connectivity and diffusion parameters.&#xD;
