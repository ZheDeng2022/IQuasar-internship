      INTRODUCTION: Rotator Cuff muscles are injured due to frequent use, repeated subacromial&#xD;
      loadings and circulatory failure, traction, compression, contusion, subacromial abrasion,&#xD;
      inflammation, injection and age-related degeneration, causing Rotator Cuff ruptures. The&#xD;
      prevalence of rotator Cuff ruptures increases with age, it usually starts at the age of 40,&#xD;
      and its incidence increases by 54% at 60, and 60-80% at 80. Rotator Cuff treatment strategies&#xD;
      vary according to the stage of the disease. While conservative treatment is preferred in&#xD;
      Stage 1 and Stage 2 of Rotator Cuff injuries, surgical approaches are performed in stage 3.&#xD;
      The most common conservative methods used in its treatment are corticosteroid injections,&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy methods. When the literature is&#xD;
      examined, there is no consensus about physiotherapy methods among conservative treatment&#xD;
      approaches. It is stated in the literature that there is no standard exercise protocol for&#xD;
      Rotator Cuff rehabilitation and specific exercise programs are needed. In recent years,&#xD;
      closed kinetic chain exercises have become the preferred exercises for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system problems. In the clinic, these exercises are preferred because they&#xD;
      put less stress on the healing tissue, which is more functional and safe. In the literature,&#xD;
      the study involving closed kinetic chain exercises related to Rotator Cuff ruptures is very&#xD;
      few, and there is no structured exercise protocol in this regard. In addition, the virtual&#xD;
      reality treatment approach, the most common example of the use of technology in&#xD;
      rehabilitation, has begun to take part in rehabilitation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The aim of the project is to examine the effectiveness of video-based game exercise&#xD;
      therapy in individuals with Rotator Cuff rupture, to develop a new exercise protocol with&#xD;
      closed kinetic chain exercises and to investigate the most effective treatment method for&#xD;
      Rotator Cuff ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: The project will include 45 Rotator Cuff partial ruptures in accordance with the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria in the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Policlinic in Esenler Medipol&#xD;
      University Hospital. Individuals who have been diagnosed with Rotator Cuff partial rupture&#xD;
      between the ages of 18-60, who do not have a professional sports history, who have had pain&#xD;
      for more than 4 weeks, and have not undergone any shoulder surgery will be included in our&#xD;
      project. Individuals with symptomatic neurological findings of cervical origin, having an&#xD;
      additional orthopedic problem on the shoulder, having mental problems, and individuals with&#xD;
      neurological, vascular, cardiac problems that limit function will not be included in our&#xD;
      project. Pain with Visual Analog Scale, pain threshold with algometer, Functionality with&#xD;
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand Problems Survey, quality of life with Life Quality Scale with Rotator&#xD;
      Cuff Patients, normal range of motion and proprioception with Fizyosoft applications,&#xD;
      shoulder aproximation force with Fizyosoft balance system will be evaluated in all&#xD;
      participants before and after treatment. Individuals participating in our project will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups. Electrotherapy program will be applied to all individuals.&#xD;
      conventional exercise therapy will be applied to the first group. An exercise program&#xD;
      consisting of 3 phases that runs from simple to difficult and includes closed kinetic chain&#xD;
      exercises and proprioceptive exercises will be implemented in second group. Video group&#xD;
      exercise program will be applied to the third group. By comparing the groups at the end of&#xD;
      the treatment, it is aimed to find the most effective treatment method for individuals with&#xD;
      Rotator Cuff rupture.&#xD;

    <description>The Rotator Cuff Quality of Life Index (RC-QOL) was developed to evaluate quality oflife in patients with rotator cuff disorders.The RC-QOL consisted of 34 questions and 5 subscales: (1) symp-toms and physical complaints (SYMPTOMS), 16 items; (2) work-related concerns (WORK), 4 items; (3) recreational activities, sportsparticipation, or competition concerns (SPORTS), 4 items; (4) life-style concerns (LIFESTYLE), 5 items; and (5) social and emotionalconcerns (SOCIAL), 5 items. Respondents were given the optionof answering &quot;not applicable&quot; to 14 questions. All questions werescored on a 100-mm visual analog scale from 0 to 100. The qualityof life score was calculated by taking an average of items an-swered by respondents.</description>
