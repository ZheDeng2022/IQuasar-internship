  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study people with knee arthritis so severe that a joint replacement is needed are&#xD;
      recruited for a one day study. Study participants will have an intravenous catheter (IV)&#xD;
      inserted in the forearm. A single intramuscular (IM) injection of oxytocin (Pitocin®), 17&#xD;
      micrograms will be administered and blood samples will be taken several times over the next&#xD;
      120 minutes. The amount of oxytocin will be measured in the blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to sample the blood, before and after the administration of&#xD;
      oxytocin and calculate the pharmacokinetics (amount of oxytocin in the blood over time) of&#xD;
      oxytocin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, sequential study of subjects, all will receive an intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injection oxytocin with blood samples taken thereafter in order to create a formula to&#xD;
      describe the concentrations of oxytocin in the blood over time (pharmacokinetics). In this&#xD;
      study people with knee arthritis so severe that a joint replacement is needed are recruited&#xD;
      for a one day study. Participants will come to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and have an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter (IV) inserted in the forearm. Participants will get a single IM&#xD;
      injection of oxytocin (Pitocin®), 17 micrograms (10 International Units (IU)) and blood will&#xD;
      be taken several times over the next 120 minutes and the amount of oxytocin measured in the&#xD;
      blood samples. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Core part of this application. The Core group&#xD;
      at Stanford will use mathematics to fit the amount of oxytocin over time as it disappears&#xD;
      from blood to a formula, called pharmacokinetics. The effect of subject age, sex, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity and weight on the pharmacokinetics of oxytocin will be tested for, since these&#xD;
      things can affect how quickly drugs circulate in the blood and are important to better adjust&#xD;
      the dose of drug to the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to sample the blood and calculate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      oxytocin. The research participants will not benefit from this study, but the knowledge&#xD;
      investigators get will be important not only to adjust oxytocin dose to individuals, but to&#xD;
      study its possible effects on pain in a very standardized way. The sample size chosen is&#xD;
      needed to get an accurate estimate for the parameters in the pharmacokinetic model for the&#xD;
      population, not just the subjects in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Male or female &gt; 18 and &lt; 75 years of age, Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Generally in good health as determined by the Principal Investigator based on prior&#xD;
             medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Normal blood pressure or, for those with hypertension, pressure controlled with&#xD;
             anti-hypertensives and with a resting heart rate 45-100 beats per minute.&#xD;

             barrier methods (e.g., condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or vaginal ring plus spermicidal&#xD;
             jellies or cream), or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse for a minimum of&#xD;

             the Principal Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk (active&#xD;
