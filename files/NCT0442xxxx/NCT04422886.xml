      The current study will evaluate the feasibility of transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) combined with an existing intensive physiotherapy program for children with ABI within&#xD;
      the in/day-patient brain injury program at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital,&#xD;
      Toronto, Canada. This feasibility randomized control trial will allocate 30 participants with&#xD;
      ABI (age 5 to 18 years) to one of two treatment groups. One group will receive active tDCS&#xD;
      prior to four of their existing physiotherapy sessions each week for a total of 16 sessions&#xD;
      while the other group will receive sham/placebo tDCS prior to their physiotherapy sessions.&#xD;
      Recovery of gross motor function will be compared between groups after the four weeks of tDCS&#xD;
      treatment and again after three months to evaluate the short and longer-term impact of tDCS&#xD;
      on an existing intensive physiotherapy program. Feasibility will be evaluated by tracking&#xD;
      process, resource, and treatment indicators such as eligibility, enrollment, adherence, and&#xD;
      tolerance rates.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using tDCS as a pre-treatment adjunct&#xD;
      to intensive physiotherapy (the 'physio+tDCS' protocol) for children with ABI in the&#xD;
      inpatient brain injury program at Holland Bloorview. The primary objectives of our study are&#xD;
      to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it feasible to implement a 'physio+tDCS' protocol within an existing inpatient ABI&#xD;
           rehabilitation program based on participant eligibility, recruitment, tolerance,&#xD;
           retention, and adherence to treatment protocol (e.g. session frequency and completion&#xD;
           timelines)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the effect of using tDCS as an adjunct to intensive physiotherapy on the&#xD;
           recovery of gross motor function in children with moderate to severe ABI, as measured by&#xD;
           individualized goal achievement and standardized gross motor outcome measures? METHODS&#xD;
           Trial design Using a feasibility randomized control trial (RCT) study design, 30&#xD;
           children with moderate to severe ABI, enrolled in intensive brain injury rehabilitation&#xD;
           at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, will be randomized&#xD;
           to the active or sham (control) tDCS intervention, which will be paired with&#xD;
           individualized intensive physiotherapy (i.e., 'physio+tDCS' and 'physio+sham').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding Once enrolled in the study, an independent research assistant (RA)&#xD;
      will randomly assign each child to the &quot;sham&quot; or &quot;active&quot; tDCS treatment group using a&#xD;
      computer randomization web-based program and approach described below. Only the RAs involved&#xD;
      in the study will be aware of each participant's treatment group assignment. The participants&#xD;
      and the assessing/treating PTs will be blinded to the participant's treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention tDCS Treatment- Depending on treatment group allocation, participants will&#xD;
      receive 20 minutes of active tDCS or sham tDCS (provided by a trained RA) immediately prior&#xD;
      to four of their physiotherapy sessions each week over 4 weeks for a total of 16 sessions.&#xD;
      Children and PTs will be blinded to their tDCS/sham allocation. Two electrodes (5x7cm) in&#xD;
      size will be used such that the anodal electrode will be attached to the Cz position on the&#xD;
      scalp, to target the lower extremity region of bilateral primary motor cortices, and the&#xD;
      cathodal electrode will be attached to the central supraorbital (Fpz) area of the forehead&#xD;
      (20). Each tDCS treatment will consist of up to 2.0 mA of stimulation, adjusting for the&#xD;
      child's age, head size, and tolerance as required. Participants will be told which treatment&#xD;
      group they were allocated to after completing their final assessment (3 months after&#xD;
      completing the treatment protocol). Participant symptoms and safety will be tracked before,&#xD;
      during, and after each tDCS session. Adverse events reported via a REB-approved standard&#xD;
      process to an independent in-house safety monitoring committee (SMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy Intervention- The physiotherapy treatment paired with the tDCS/sham consists of&#xD;
      the typical motor skills-based physiotherapy children receive in the in/day-patient brain&#xD;
      injury program at Holland Bloorview. Each 45- minute physiotherapy session promotes motor&#xD;
      learning by focusing on functional tasks related to the child's personalized motor goals.&#xD;
      Therapists individualize the program by adapting the tasks, instructions, feedback, and the&#xD;
      level of challenge based on the child's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Feasibility- Feasibility of study implementation and tDCS will be evaluated by&#xD;
      tracking process, resource, and treatment indicators. A priori feasibility targets are as&#xD;
      follows: 20% of children admitted to the program will be eligible for the study, 70% of&#xD;
      eligible children will be recruited; 80% of children will tolerate at least 1.0mA for 10&#xD;
      minutes of each tDCS session, 75% of treatment sessions will be completed, 95% of first&#xD;
      reassessments will occur, and 80% of follow-up reassessments will occur at 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment. Adherence to the study protocol will be tracked by the number of tDCS and&#xD;
      physiotherapy sessions scheduled per week and the number actually completed. Reasons for&#xD;
      cancelled sessions or decreased number of sessions booked will be documented. Because tDCS&#xD;
      should optimally occur in the half hour prior to physiotherapy, the start time and duration&#xD;
      of stimulation will be documented, as well as the start time and duration of each&#xD;
      physiotherapy session, on tracking sheets that will be completed by the RA/therapist&#xD;
      conducting each tDCS/physiotherapy session. Eligibility data will be tracked across the&#xD;
      study's duration to determine the proportion of children in the brain injury program who are&#xD;
      eligible for the study, and the number who enrol and reasons for being excluded from the&#xD;
      study will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gross Motor- Baseline assessments will be conducted by a blinded independent PT assessor&#xD;
      within four days of beginning the study treatment protocol. The first reassessment will be&#xD;
      conducted by the same blinded PT assessor within four days after their last study&#xD;
      intervention session. Three months after completion of the study treatment, a second&#xD;
      reassessment will take place, involving the same outcome measures. Additional information&#xD;
      regarding the participant's physiotherapy services (e.g., frequency, duration, focus of&#xD;
      intervention) and amount of daily physical activity (e.g., frequency, duration, intensity,&#xD;
      type) since study completion will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori targets for the co-primary gross motor outcomes are as follows: The active tDCS&#xD;
      group should have at least 5 mean points of change more than the sham group on the Gross&#xD;
      Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and at least 2.0 mean points of change more than the sham group&#xD;
      on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).&#xD;
