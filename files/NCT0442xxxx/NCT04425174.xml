  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia is frequently used in major surgery in association with general&#xD;
      anesthesia to ensure adequate postoperative patient analgesia and to decrease the intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative use of systemic analgesic drugs. Epidural analgesia (EP) is considered the&#xD;
      standard regional analgesic technique that is widely used in abdominal surgery. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      it has some limitations such as in colorectal surgery where complications in the form of&#xD;
      muscular weakness, hemodynamic instability, and postural hypotension result in delayed&#xD;
      patient ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these limitations, peripheral nerve blocks can be considered safer with less incidence of&#xD;
      complications compared to the central neuraxial blocks especially with the use of ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) as a guide in their techniques. Also, avoidance of the hemodynamic instability that may&#xD;
      affect the postoperative kidney function can be considered an important issue in patients&#xD;
      with risk for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the latest techniques in the field of regional anesthesia is the quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      (QL) block, which is based on US-guided injection of a local anesthetic agent into the&#xD;
      thoracolumbar fascia surrounding the QL muscle. Several different approaches were described&#xD;
      depending on the injection sites, for example, lateral, posterior, and anterior approaches .&#xD;
      According to the ASRA-ESRA Delphi consensus, there was no consensus on naming quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum block types where posterior QL had the strongest consensus in abdominal wall&#xD;
      analgesia with 71%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the QL block, there is evidence that the injectate spreads to the paravertebral space&#xD;
      where it blocks the thoracolumbar nerves and the thoracic sympathetic trunk. Because it&#xD;
      produces an extensive sensory block leading to adequate postoperative analgesia besides&#xD;
      decreasing the systemic analgesic consumption, QL block is now considered an effective&#xD;
      regional block that can be used in major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40% of the cases diagnosed as having AKI occurred as a postoperative complication. Cardiac&#xD;
      surgery carries the highest risk for AKI (18.7%), whereas general surgery comes second&#xD;
      (13.2%). The risk factors of developing AKI may be general or causes related to the type and&#xD;
      the setting of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid depletion is one of the major factors that can occur perioperatively and leads to renal&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, with subsequent renal arteriolar changes, attempting to maintain a normal&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate. The sympathetic effects of the neuroendocrine hormones may lead&#xD;
      to renal vasoconstriction, aiming to redistribute the blood to the medulla; however, it may&#xD;
      lead to renal ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The renal blood flow can be assessed by a rapid bed-side noninvasive technique, using the&#xD;
      renal Doppler resistive index (RI), which is one of the most fundamental parameters assessing&#xD;
      renal perfusion, because it reflects the degree of the vascular resistance inside the kidney&#xD;
      vascular bed and can be used to assess the modifications and the changes that occur in the&#xD;
      renal blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous studies so far discussed the effect of QL block on postoperative creatinine and&#xD;
      blood ureal nitrogen (BUN) levels. While, regarding epidural analgesia, multiple articles are&#xD;
      investigating the effect of epidural on postoperative kidney function using various indices,&#xD;
      such as serum creatinine, BUN, sodium clearance, and urine output. As far as the authors&#xD;
      know, this is the first study using the RI renal flow as a comparative parameter between the&#xD;
      QL block and EP analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to assess the analgesic efficacy of QL block compared with epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia as a primary outcome using the 10-point visual analog scale (VAS), time to first&#xD;
      morphine requirement, and 24-hour morphine consumption. Also, to study the effect of both on&#xD;
      postoperative kidney function as a secondary outcome using serum creatinine and BUN and renal&#xD;
      flow assessment using renal Doppler.&#xD;

      -  Study place: Ain Shams University Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent will be taken from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III, aged&#xD;
           between 35 and 65 years were included in this study and scheduled for short colorectal&#xD;
           surgery (2-4 hours), such as segmental colectomies and polypectomy using either the sub&#xD;
           umbilical incision or laparoscopic technique. Patients with major cardiac or cerebral&#xD;
           vascular diseases, bleeding disorders (known contraindication for EP anesthesia and in&#xD;
           QL which is considered a deep block), abnormal kidney functions (elevated creatinine,&#xD;
           BUN level, or history of renal disease), and neurological disorders were excluded.&#xD;
           Patients with known allergy to local anesthetics, puncture site infection, and body mass&#xD;
           index (BMI) of &gt;35 kg/m2 were also excluded. Also, patients with intra-operative&#xD;
           complications such as hemodynamic instability and unexpected prolonged surgical duration&#xD;
           were excluded. Patients who refused to consent to the study were not enrolled, without&#xD;
           any discontinuation of their management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected patients were randomized using an automated computer-assisted method&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.org), which divided them into 2 groups: the control group (EP) received&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia, whereas the study group (QL) received a QL block. The interventions were&#xD;
      done by well-experienced anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Doppler. An experienced radiologist performed the renal Doppler with at least 5 years&#xD;
      experience in the doppler field being blinded to the patients' data. A renal Doppler study&#xD;
      was performed for both groups preoperatively and postoperatively. Patients were asked to lie&#xD;
      supine or in lateral positions. The ultrasound (US) probe was applied to the anterior or&#xD;
      midaxillary line with the probe in a transverse direction until the kidney was adequately&#xD;
      visualized. The intrarenal and main renal arteries were assessed using color and pulse wave&#xD;
      Doppler. The intrarenal arteries assessment was repeated at the upper, mid, and lower pole&#xD;
      levels of each kidney. Also, the renal RI of the main renal artery was measured bilaterally.&#xD;
      All measurements for each patient were collected and the average RI was calculated. The&#xD;
      normal RI is considered when the value was &lt;0.7. The renal Doppler was assessed within 24&#xD;
      hours pre-operative and within 2-3 hours after surgery completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation. Patients who fasted for 8 hours, with full clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      results, were examined for any exclusion criteria with specific concerns with regard to&#xD;
      kidney function. 12 hours before the scheduled time for surgery, renal Doppler was performed&#xD;
      to measure the renal RI of all patients, before starting to fast for surgery and after&#xD;
      adequate hydration was checked, based on his ward fluid chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inside the operating room. The standard monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, non-invasive blood pressure, and capnogram for end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2),&#xD;
      were applied. Infusion of Ringer's lactate solution (8 mL/kg) was started through a wide bore&#xD;
      cannula. IV midazolam 0.05 mg/kg was given as a premedication before the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia by 2 μg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, and 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. An endotracheal&#xD;
      tube was inserted to initiate mechanical ventilation while keeping the ETCO2 in the range of&#xD;
      35-45 mmHg. Anesthesia maintenance was performed with 1.5% isoflurane and oxygen and topped&#xD;
      up with IV atracurium 0.5 mg/kg every 20 minutes. The urinary output was followed up using a&#xD;
      urinary catheter. IV fentanyl dose of 1 μg/kg was administered, in response to an increase in&#xD;
      blood pressure or heart rate of &gt;20% of the baseline measurement. Continuous ECG, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and pulse saturation were monitored. To ensure an adequate fluid balance, fluid&#xD;
      input, fluid output (urine and third space loss), blood loss, and central venous pressure&#xD;
      were recorded. The inhalational anesthetic isoflurane was discontinued at the end of the&#xD;
      surgery, followed by the administration of IV neostigmine of 0.05 mg/kg and atropine of 0.02&#xD;
      mg/kg, to reverse the residual neuromuscular block. The trachea was extubated after&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia was performed before the induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia by a well-experienced anesthesiologist with at least 5 years experience in local&#xD;
      and regional anesthesia. Patients were in a sitting position leaning forward with the legs&#xD;
      supported on a chair. Complete skin asepsis with povidone-iodine (7.5%), was applied followed&#xD;
      by draping. An 18-gauge Tuohy epidural needle was inserted into the intervertebral space&#xD;
      T9-T10, using a vacuum catheter aspiration technique followed by the epidural catheter&#xD;
      insertion. The epidural was activated at the end of the operation using 10 mL of 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine as a bolus followed by a continuous epidural infusion using 0.125% bupivacaine,&#xD;
      at a rate of 6 mL/hour, to be continued for up to 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QL block technique. A bilateral posterior approach, a US-guided QL block was applied after&#xD;
      anesthesia induction by a well-experienced anesthesiologist with at least 5 years experience&#xD;
      in local and regional anesthesia, using Honda electronics HS-2100 portable US machine (Honda&#xD;
      Electronics CO., LTD, Japan). The patient was in a supine position with a pillow under his&#xD;
      back. Povidone-iodine (7.5%) was used to sterilize the area above the iliac crest at the&#xD;
      level of the anterior axillary line, followed by draping before the application of a&#xD;
      high-frequency superficial probe (9-11 MHz). The probe was adjusted until visualization of&#xD;
      the external oblique muscle, the internal oblique muscle, and the transversus abdominis&#xD;
      muscle. Then the probe was moved posteriorly until the thoracolumbar fascia covering the QL&#xD;
      muscle was visualized. The needle was inserted just above the upper edge of the probe and&#xD;
      pierced the muscles until it reached the posterior aspect of the QL muscle. Aspiration was&#xD;
      done to ensure that there is no blood and to ensure extravascular injection to avoid the&#xD;
      undesirable systemic effect. The correct site was confirmed through saline injection (hydro&#xD;
      dissection); 25 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine were injected on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid balance was maintained throughout the operation, using a fluid chart to avoid any&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability that might affect the objective of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative study parameters. Patients were transferred to the intermediate care unit, for&#xD;
      continuous observation for 24 hours. A 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess&#xD;
      pain; with 0 being no pain and number 10 being the worst pain. The VAS score was assessed&#xD;
      immediately after patients' transfer from the theater room (0 hours) then 2, 6, 8, 12, 18,&#xD;
      and 24 hours postoperative. The following parameters were assessed by a blinded&#xD;
      anesthesiologist to the aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time required for the first morphine dose and the cumulative morphine consumption&#xD;
           for 24 hours were recorded as a primary outcome. Morphine was given at a dose of 0.05&#xD;
           mg/kg when the VAS score was &gt;4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative kidney function was assessed using laboratory and US Doppler indices to&#xD;
           compare it with the preoperative values, as a secondary outcome. Laboratory tests&#xD;
           included serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and were compared with&#xD;
           preoperative values.&#xD;
