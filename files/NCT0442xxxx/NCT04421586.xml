  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand why parents do or do not vaccinate their children&#xD;
      and explore what information parents need to vaccinate their children. The study will test&#xD;
      whether information about vaccinations provided during pregnancy by a health provider (VISTA&#xD;
      intervention) may improve the possibility that a child is vaccinated on time.&#xD;

      The study will be implemented in 10 health facility catchment areas in Mtwara region,&#xD;
