    <textblock>
      Introduction: eccentric exercise (EE) has been widely used in rehabilitation and in improving&#xD;
      physical fitness due to its mechanical advantage and less metabolic demand, however, EE can&#xD;
      induce muscle damage providing structural changes and reduced muscle function, therefore, it&#xD;
      is necessary to look for alternatives to reduce this damage caused by stress. Thus, ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning (PCI) can be seen as an aid in reducing the damage caused by EE, as it can&#xD;
      attenuate the ischemia-reperfusion injury, and can be used to accelerate the post-exercise&#xD;
      recovery process. Objectives: to compare the effects of PCI, using different occlusion&#xD;
      pressures, on acute and late responses to perceptual outcomes and muscle injury markers, in&#xD;
      addition to checking whether the technique causes deleterious effects on performance in&#xD;
      post-exercise recovery. Methods: a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with 80 healthy men aged 18 to 35 years who will be randomly divided into four&#xD;
      groups: PCI using total occlusion pressure (POT), PCI with 40% more than POT, placebo (10&#xD;
      mmHg) and control. The PCI protocol will consist of four cycles of ischemia and reperfusion&#xD;
      of five minutes each. All groups will perform an EE protocol, initial assessments,&#xD;
      immediately after the end of the EE, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise, with the maximum&#xD;
      isometric voluntary contraction (CVIM) assessed by the isokinetic dynamometer, vectors of&#xD;
      cell integrity by by means of electrical bioimpedance (BIA), creatine kinase (CK), blood&#xD;
      lactate, pain on the visual analog scale (VAS), pain threshold by the pressure algometer,&#xD;
      muscle thickness by ultrasound and tone, muscle rigidity and elasticity by myotonometry. The&#xD;
      descriptive statistical method and analysis of variance will be used for the repeated&#xD;
      measures model. The level of significance will be p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
