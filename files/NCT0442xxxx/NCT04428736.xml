      Hereditary cancer programs face challenges with respect to effective communication of genetic&#xD;
      test results within families and uptake of genetic testing by relatives. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine if a &quot;disclosure toolkit&quot; provided to the index participant (carrier of cancer risk&#xD;
      gene mutation) contributes to sharing genetic test results with relatives, if there are&#xD;
      preferred disclosure methods, and whether toolkit use contributes towards at-risk relatives&#xD;
      pursuing genetic testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The identification of a single individual with a highly penetrant cancer susceptibility gene&#xD;
      mutation can have far reaching implications for at-risk relatives in that other family&#xD;
      members can engage in highly informative and predictive genetic testing for cancer&#xD;
      predisposition. Family members who carry the familial cancer gene mutation are able to&#xD;
      receive personalized cancer risk management based upon their positive test result, while&#xD;
      those family members who test negative can generally be downgraded to follow cancer screening&#xD;
      guidelines for the general population, barring additional familial or personal risk factors&#xD;
      for developing cancer. Though crucial for stratifying and managing risks for relatives,&#xD;
      familial testing, otherwise known as cascade testing, is not always successfully implemented&#xD;
      within and across families. On a clinical basis the proband, also known as the index mutation&#xD;
      carrier, is generally encouraged to share results with family members in order to promote&#xD;
      their engagement in genetic counseling and testing. Despite the provision of results and a&#xD;
      tailored letter for family members, hereditary cancer programs routinely face challenges with&#xD;
      respect to communication of results within families and uptake of testing by relatives.&#xD;
      Research on family communication and cascade testing substantiates this experience as&#xD;
      previous studies have demonstrated suboptimal uptake of cascade testing in families, despite&#xD;
      its importance for defining and managing cancer risk (Barsevicket al,2008; Daly et al, 2016).&#xD;
      The purpose of our research study is to determine whether the provision of multiple&#xD;
      communication tools and platforms will improve communication between probands and at-risk&#xD;
      relatives, and if so, which communication method is the most useful to probands in&#xD;
      communicating their results and to relatives in coming to a decision regarding genetic&#xD;
      counseling and testing. Through the study, probands will be provided with a three-part&#xD;
      toolkit that includes a letter, website, and a chatbot known as &quot;GIA&quot; (for&quot;Genetic&#xD;
      Information Assistant&quot;). Though the challenges/barriers of cascade testing are&#xD;
      well-documented, there are scant reports of follow-up with relatives. Our study allows direct&#xD;
      contact with family members (by way of proband consent) to assess motivations and barriers to&#xD;
      genetic testing by family members.&#xD;

        Participants will be ascertained through the clinical genetics programs at Penn Medicine&#xD;
        (Mariann and Robert MacDonald Cancer Risk Evaluation Program, &quot;CREP,&quot; the Gastrointestinal&#xD;
        Cancer Risk Evaluation Program, &quot;GI CREP,&quot; and Penn Telegenetics). Participants will be&#xD;
        clinical patients identified to be a carrier of a high risk cancer predisposition gene&#xD;
        mutation as determined by the study team. Participants will have been through a formal&#xD;
        pre-test genetic counseling consultation and will be approached for study enrollment at&#xD;
        time of result disclosure (either telephone or in-person) - also known as the &quot;post-test&quot;&#xD;
        visit. Disclosure of genetic test results will be facilitated by a participating genetic&#xD;
        counselor.&#xD;
