  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients underwent a medical evaluation that included physical examination and routine&#xD;
      laboratory studies before and after transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated to real group , sham group or control group. A threshold of&#xD;
      3 points on the Hamilton Depression scale has been specified by the National Institute for&#xD;
      Health and Care Excellence to determine a clinically meaningful difference between active&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and placebo. We plan to enroll minimum total sample size of 37 participants&#xD;
      in real, sham or control group respectively according to the Power and Sample Size program.&#xD;
      The decision to enroll a patient was always made prior to randomization. The tDCS&#xD;
      administrators had access to the randomization list. They had minimal contact with the&#xD;
      patients, and no role in assessing depression. Each patient would be treated for continuous&#xD;
      14 days by tDCS in real and sham group. The control group was evaluated by clinical symptom&#xD;
      scale, behavioral evaluation before and after 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the tDCS treatment, depression symptom of each participant was assessed by the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Self-Rating Scale. The anhedonia severity&#xD;
      was evaluated by The Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale, the Self-Report Apathy Evaluation&#xD;
      Scale, Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale, the Motivation and Pleasure Scale.The neuroimaging&#xD;
      data was collected using event-related potentials during monetary incentive delay task. After&#xD;
      the last treatment, the same scales and neuroimaging scan were used again to assess the&#xD;
      treatment effect of the tDCS and the underlying brain mechanism. Each participant was&#xD;
      interviewed in detail about the adverse event of the tDCS intervention during the past 14&#xD;
      days.Every participant should take part in the study in voluntary and sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form before the study.&#xD;
