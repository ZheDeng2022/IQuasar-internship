      The proposed study will address the critical need for more precise characterizations of the&#xD;
      acute visual effects of the drug psilocybin by measuring the impact of acute psilocybin&#xD;
      intoxication on a perceptual task known as visual surround suppression, compared to an active&#xD;
      placebo control. The data collected in the proposed experiment will make important&#xD;
      contributions to knowledge of how psilocybin impacts contextual processing in the brain.&#xD;
      Moreover, this will in turn inform the neurobiology of visual surround suppression in&#xD;
      general, providing the first investigation of links between surround suppression and&#xD;
      serotonergic pathways in humans. Furthermore, the impact of psilocybin on surround&#xD;
      suppression will complement recent discoveries of differences in surround suppression present&#xD;
      in certain clinical populations. Taken together, these points suggest that this relatively&#xD;
      simple and straightforward study could have significant payoff in its contribution to&#xD;
      knowledge, not only of the effects of psilocybin but also of key brain processes underpinning&#xD;
      human vision and context processing more broadly.&#xD;

    <description>The Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire, a self-report of experiences associated with psilocybin use, contains 30 items rated on a scale from 0 (none; not at all) to 5 (extreme). From the report, 4 scores are produced - Mystical Experience, Positive Mood, Transcendence of Time and Space, and Ineffability.&#xD;
The mystical experience score is calculated by summing 15 items scores and ranges from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating a stronger mystical experience.&#xD;
The positive mood score is calculated by summing 6 items scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater positive mood.&#xD;
The transcendence of time and space score is calculated by summing 6 items scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater transcendence of space and time.&#xD;
The ineffability score is calculated by summing 3 items scores and ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating greater feelings of ineffability.</description>

Items are rated using a visual analog scale that is converted to a numeric range from 0-100.&#xD;
The ego-dissolution score is calculated as an unweighted average of the 8 items relating to the experience of ego dissolution. Scores for this subscale range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater ego dissolution.&#xD;
The ego-inflation score if calculated as an unweighted average of the 8 items relating to the experience of ego inflation. Scores for this subscale range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater ego inflation.</description>
