    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the addition of positional distraction to stabilization exercises in the&#xD;
      treatment of lumbar radiculopathy in adults. Half of the patients will recieve positional&#xD;
      distraction and stabilization exercises in combination, while the other half will recieve&#xD;
      stabilization exercises only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In positioanl distraction making use of the body position to produce traction at an isolated&#xD;
      spinal level to maximally open the affected neuroforamen. It is an alternative to lumbar&#xD;
      mechanical traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spinal level of vertebral level requiring traction is palpated and a soft roll is placed&#xD;
      and the patient side lies on the unaffected side. For further distraction both hips are&#xD;
      flexed until movement is noted at the spinal level needing traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, distraction applied by rotating upper trunk to opposite side of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stabilization exercises are mainly used for the stability of joints and for improving muscle&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step of lumbar stabilization exercises are to maintain functional back positions&#xD;
      during all activities. The second step is to improve strength and endurance of the core&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
