    <textblock>
      This phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fludarabine in&#xD;
      combination with CPX-351 in patients with untreated AML. Patients will receive fludarabine&#xD;
      and CPX-351 during Induction 1 and 2 as well as 2 cycles of consolidation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open label single arm study to look at the effectives and safety of&#xD;
      fludarabine in combination with CPX-351 in patients with untreated AML. The rationale for&#xD;
      this combination stems from data which indicated that pre-treatment of the THP-1 cell line&#xD;
      with fludarabine for 4 hours prior to CPX-351 administration (Flu-CPX) significantly&#xD;
      potentiated intracellular ara-CTP accumulation compared to CPX-351 alone. This suggests that&#xD;
      fludarabine combined with CPX-351 may have efficacy against leukemic clones that would be&#xD;
      resistant to CPX-351 or standard chemotherapy in first induction. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that treatment with CPX-351 produces superior clinical outcomes in secondary AML likely due&#xD;
      to its novel formulation, which results in sustained exposure of the cytotoxic agents&#xD;
      cytarabine and daunorubicin in a synergistic 5:1 ratio within the plasma and bone marrow.&#xD;
      Fludarabine can potentially improve upon the outcomes observed with CPX-351 monotherapy and&#xD;
      7+3 by enhancing intracellular ara-CTP accumulation from CPX-351. Patients will received&#xD;
      fludarabine and CPX-351 for up to 2 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of consolidation.&#xD;
