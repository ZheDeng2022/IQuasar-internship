      Our objective in this pilot study will be to identify PA parameters that can distinguish&#xD;
      benign vs. malignant lesions, and also, if PA parameters change with within breast tumors&#xD;
      during chemotherapy treatment over time.&#xD;

      This study will investigate photoacoustic tissue characteristics of breast lesions both at&#xD;
      diagnosis, and within a separate subgroup of patients, physiological changes in breast tumors&#xD;
      during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Our objective in this pilot study will be to identify&#xD;
      PA parameters that can distinguish benign vs. malignant lesions, and also, if PA parameters&#xD;
      change with within breast tumors during chemotherapy treatment over time. Our hope is to use&#xD;
      this information to correlate with pathological response.&#xD;

    <measure>Treatment response correlation between photoacoustic parameters and histopathological measurement.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint will investigate changes of measured photoacoustic markers and compare to these to histopathological indicators of breast tumor response to NAC. Changes in photoacoustic parameters (hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, tumor structure) will be made to a pre-treatment point over the course of treatment. Treatment will not be modified on the basis of our observations in this pilot observational study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast mass characterization</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary study endpoint will investigate if breast masses (benign vs. malignant) can be characterized by PA during clinical diagnostic work-up. Differences in the photoacoustic tissue-properties will be compared to histopathological evaluation. No diagnostic information from PA measurements will be used for patient-care/diagnosis as a result of our observations in this pilot observational study</description>
