  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, oral cancer (OC) is the eighth most common cancer&#xD;
      in the world with a five year survival rate of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral cancer tumor cells produce biochemical substances, tumor markers, differed from healthy&#xD;
      individuals in expression or quantitative ratio, detectable in tissues and/or body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, because of its accessibility, proximity and noninvasive approach, presents an ideal&#xD;
      tool for the research of oral cancer tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to isolate, quantify, analyze the role and describe the&#xD;
      kinetics of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), Squamous Cell Carcinoma associated Antigen&#xD;
      (SCCA), Trophoblast cell surface antigen (TROP2) in patients with OC, potentially malignant&#xD;
      disorders (PMOD) and age and sex matched control group with a clear medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are number of studies published on OC tumor markers isolated mostly in serum, however&#xD;
      the satisfactory specificity and sensitivity still hasn't been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid chromatography-ion trap-mass spectrometry, Multiple Reaction Monitoring method&#xD;
      (LC-IT-MS, MRM) will be developed to isolate and quantify the above mentioned tumor markers.&#xD;
      This method has not yet been used to quantify the above mentioned salivary tumor markers.&#xD;
      Ap4A and TROP2 have never been isolated from saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to develop a tumor-specific test with a satisfactory statistical sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity and dynamically measure the levels of tumor markers, before and immediately after&#xD;
      therapy - surgery/radiotherapy/chemotherapy or their combination, and during regular&#xD;
      follow-up one and two years after surgery. As another novelty, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine the markers circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A OC tumor specific test, with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, would enable earlier&#xD;
      OC diagnosis, possibly before the clinical appearance, raise the survival rate of OC&#xD;
      patients, enable early diagnosis of recurrence and/or new primary tumors and ensure better&#xD;
      post-treatment life-quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, treatment of oral cancer (OC) showed improvement due to the combined&#xD;
      efforts of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Nevertheless the long-term survival rate,&#xD;
      only marginally improved with a five year survival rate of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OC is preceded by a preinvasive stage, which may last for many years. Tumor progression in&#xD;
      epithelia has been classified as normal, hyperplastic (non-dysplastic), dysplastic carcinoma&#xD;
      in situ and invasive carcinoma. The majority of the initial alterations of precancerous and&#xD;
      cancerous oral lesions are often non recognizable, even by histopathological examination. The&#xD;
      basic biology of initiation and progression of these tumors is still obscure. Carcinogenesis&#xD;
      is a process which includes initiation, promotion and progression, driven by accumulation of&#xD;
      specific altered genes. Tumor cells produce biochemical substances called tumor markers. Some&#xD;
      of these substances found in healthy individuals, but with altered quantitative ratio.&#xD;
      Besides the salivary DNA and RNA, other markers are detectable in saliva, such as cell cycle&#xD;
      markers (p53, p16 etc.), growth factors (EGF, TGF, etc.), cell surface markers, oxidants and&#xD;
      antioxidants and other. Because of its accessibility, non-invasive approach and location&#xD;
      proximity, saliva presents an ideal tool for the research of OC tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will analyze the role of Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma associated Antigen 1 and 2 (SCCA1 and 2) and Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen&#xD;
      (TROP2) in the development of OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ap4A is the only diadenosine polyphosphate that can induce a considerable increase in [Ca2+]&#xD;
      in endothelial cells, indicating that its vasoactive effects are comparable to the known&#xD;
      effects of arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Ap4A is a&#xD;
      ubiquitous diadenosine polyphosphate signal molecule for DNA replication in mammalian cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of Ap4A was found to be directly related to the proliferative activity of the cells. It&#xD;
      is considered that the Ap4A has an important role in the regulation of cellular growth and&#xD;
      division. In the absence of the tumor suppressor gene FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), located&#xD;
      on the chromosome 3p, Ap4a accumulates and leads to DNA synthesis and multiplication of&#xD;
      cells. Loss of heterozygosity of the chromosome 3p is believed to be a common event in the&#xD;
      early phase of carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ap4A could represent a tumor marker for the early stages of carcinogenesis. Possibly it could&#xD;
      indicate carcinogenesis earlier than pathohistological diagnostics. Ap4a has never been&#xD;
      isolated in saliva or measured in OC and PMOD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, SCCA, a glycoprotein, is located inside the cell. In individuals with&#xD;
      OC it is released from the cell and thereby, is detectable in serum and saliva. Recent&#xD;
      reports have shown that SCCA can influence the invasion or metastasis of cancer cells.&#xD;
      However, it remains unclear how SCCA acts to mediate these biological functions. SCCA has&#xD;
      already been presented as a potential serum marker for pathologic lymph node metastasis,&#xD;
      advanced tumor stage, and an increased rate of distant metastasis in patients with OC,&#xD;
      however, never has it been isolated in saliva in OC patients. It has never been measured in&#xD;
      patients with PMOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human trophoblast cell-surface antigen, TROP2 (also termed GA733-1, M1S1, EGP-1) is&#xD;
      encoded by the TACSTD2 gene, which is mapped to the human chromosome 1p32. TROP2 function and&#xD;
      role is still not well understood, although it has previously been suggested that it played a&#xD;
      role in growth regulation of cancer cells, as well as in fetal lung formation as a calcium&#xD;
      signal transducer. Two studies showed that TROP2 over-expression may emerge as a prognostic&#xD;
      tool in patients with oral and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. TROP2 antigen has never&#xD;
      been isolated or measured in saliva in OC and PMOD patients. OC tumor-specific test will&#xD;
      probably have to involve two or all of the above described tumor markers. However, salivary&#xD;
      Ap4a alone could present a marker for the earliest stages of OC carcinogenesis. Therefore, it&#xD;
      could reveal carcinogenesis before the clinical appearance of OC. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that saliva proximity to OC could enable even higher specificity. As another novelty,&#xD;
      determining the circadian rhythm of the above mentioned markers should provide more&#xD;
      information on their kinetics and role in OC carcinogenesis and rule out any potential&#xD;
      confounders, such as the influence of a certain nutritive or the influence of some habits&#xD;
      e.g. smoking.&#xD;
