  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is caused by sudden changes in blood flow in the brain. This can be fatal or can&#xD;
      result in permanent disability. A fast diagnosis is essential to initiate effective&#xD;
      interventions and optimize benefits to patients. There are other diseases that can look like&#xD;
      a stroke and these are called &quot;stroke mimics&quot;. The quicker that stroke mimics can be ruled&#xD;
      out the faster a stroke can be diagnosed and treatment can be given. The investigators may be&#xD;
      able to use chemicals in the blood to rapidly confirm that a person has had a stroke. One&#xD;
      such chemical is called eotaxin. Eotaxin has been found to be changed in sufferers of a&#xD;
      stroke but not in those with stroke mimics. However, more research is needed to confirm the&#xD;
      usefulness of eotaxin. This feasibility study aims to provide the foundations to allow a&#xD;
      large scale trial of this test. The study aims to recruit participants that have had a stroke&#xD;
      or a stroke mimic from the Acute Stroke Unit and Stroke clinic at the Royal Devon and Exeter&#xD;
      Hospital. Up to 6 blood samples will be taken from each participant at different times over&#xD;
      one week. Eotaxin will be measured in these samples and in participant's leftover samples&#xD;
      taken for clinical care. This is needed because the investigators know that the amount of&#xD;
      eotaxin changes in the blood after a stroke but we do not know how quickly this change&#xD;
      happens and for how long the change occurs. The study will also allow the investigators to&#xD;
      understand how many participants will be needed for a large scale trial and the challenges&#xD;
      that may be faced in recruiting participants.&#xD;
