    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the investigators is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)&#xD;
      isolated from hematogenous bone marrow for treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar&#xD;
      depression patient (TRBD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aiming to study&#xD;
      the efficacy and side effects of MSCs adjunctive to TAU compared to a normal saline solution&#xD;
      in patients with TRBD. Relevant patients with bipolar depression will be addressed in order&#xD;
      to establish whether they are willing to be screened for the study. The patients must be&#xD;
      assigned a patient number and sign the consent form after receiving oral and written&#xD;
      information about the study prior to undergoing any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs will be infused as a single dose up to one week after the inclusion of the patient. The&#xD;
      treatment trial lasts eight weeks. Of note, the investigators will assess patients also at&#xD;
      week 26 with a neurocognitive and clinical battery. It will not be allowed changes in&#xD;
      psychiatric medication during this period. If a patient or the treating clinician decides&#xD;
      that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave&#xD;
      the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to&#xD;
      take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications&#xD;
      for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical&#xD;
      conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators&#xD;
      defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials&#xD;
      (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar&#xD;
      depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for&#xD;
      at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current&#xD;
      psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric&#xD;
      medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed&#xD;
      from the study protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in depression as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 8, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a short and reliable scale devised to be sensitive to change. Patients are rated on ten items, each of which has value ranges from 0 (the least pathology) to 6 (the most sever pathology). Sum scores range from 0 to 60, with a scoring of 20 indicating moderate and 30 severe depression. The scale is sensitive to change and covers many, but not all, symptom domains in depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional impairment as assessed by the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) assesses functional impairment. FAST is a 24-item scale and assesses six functional domains: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Overall functioning in living as assessed by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. The scale is presented and described in the DSM-IV-TR on page 34.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolar illness (CGI-BP), severity of mania subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression Scale for bipolar lllness (CGI-BP) is a modification of the CGI specifically for use in assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis. The clinician forms a global judgment both of the severity of the illness as compared to other cases with the same diagnosis and the global degree of change during treatment. There are 3 subscales (severity of mania, severity of depression, severity overall); and each subscale has a range of values from 1 (best) to 7 (worst).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, week 26</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in problem-solving ability as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) assesses problem-solving ability and is thought to be an index of functioning of the prefrontal cortex. The task requires subjects to match cards to one of four target cards according to a certain sorting rule (color, shape or number) without explicit instructions regarding the nature of the sorting rule. After 10 consecutive matches, the sorting rule changes without warning, and the subject needs to determine the new principle. Perseverative errors and number of categories achieved will be used as dependent measures.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with treatment emergent mania or hypomania as assessed by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and clinical assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is an 11-item scale that is used to assess the severity of mania. Each item is given a severity rating--four items are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.</description>
