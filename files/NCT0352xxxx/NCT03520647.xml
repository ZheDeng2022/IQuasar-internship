      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and paroxysmal nocturnal&#xD;
      hemoglobinuria&#xD;
&#xD;
      (PNH) cause serious blood problems. Stem cell transplants using bone marrow or blood plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy can help. Researchers want to see if using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)&#xD;
      rather than bone marrow cells works too. PBSCs are easier to collect and have more cells that&#xD;
      help transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see how safely and effectively SAA, MDS and PNH are treated using peripheral blood&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells from a family member plus chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients ages 4-55 with SAA, MDS or PNH and their relative donors ages 4-75&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will need a caregiver for several months. They may make fertility plans and a&#xD;
      power of attorney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will have blood and tissue tests, then injections to boost stem cells for 5-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will have blood collected from a tube in an arm or leg vein. A machine will separate&#xD;
      stem cells and maybe white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into the other&#xD;
      arm or leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hospital for about 1 month, recipients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central line inserted in the neck or chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicines for side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy over 8 days and radiation 1 time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell transplant over 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 6 months after transplant, recipients will stay near NIH for weekly physical exams and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 180, recipients will go home. They will have tests at their doctor s office and NIH&#xD;
      several times over 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA),myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and paroxysmal nocturnal&#xD;
      hemoglobinuria (PNH) are life-threatening bone marrow disorders. For SAA patients, long term&#xD;
      survival can be achieved with immunosuppressive treatment. However, of those patients treated&#xD;
      with immunosuppressive therapy, one quarter to one third will not respond, and about 50% of&#xD;
      responders will relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) offers the opportunity of cure,&#xD;
      HLA-matched donors are available for only half the patients needing a transplant. Combined&#xD;
      haplo-cord transplantation has recently been shown to be a viable transplant option for those&#xD;
      patients lacking an HLA matched donor. In our ongoing protocol 08-H-0046, we have utilized&#xD;
      this approach in 29 patients with SAA, and SAA evolving to MDS with 27/29 patients having&#xD;
      sustained engraftment and achieving transfusion independence. However, engraftment patterns&#xD;
      have varied substantially and, in some patients,, cord engraftment was profoundly delayed or&#xD;
      never occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) has the advantage over&#xD;
      cord transplantation of immediate allograft availability, higher stem cell doses, and the&#xD;
      feasibility of repeating cell collections if necessary for collecting CD34+ cells for stem&#xD;
      cells boosts or lymphocytes to treat or prevent disease relapse or infection. Recently, the&#xD;
      use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) has been shown to be an effective strategy to&#xD;
      prevent GVHD in recipients of haploidentical HSCT, but most reports have focused on patients&#xD;
      with hematological malignancies. At present, few data exist on the use of haploidentical&#xD;
      transplantation using post-transplant cyclophosphamide for patients with aplastic anemia that&#xD;
      have ATG-refractory disease and are heavily-transfused and HLA-alloimmunized. These patients&#xD;
      are at an exceedingly high-risk for graft rejection compared to other patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research protocol is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      using an unmanipulated GCSF mobilized peripheral stem cell allograft from a haploidentical&#xD;
      donor and post-transplant cyclophosphamide for patients with SAA,SAA evolving to MDS, or PNH&#xD;
      that has proven to be refractory to conventional therapy in patients who lack an HLA-matched&#xD;
      donor (sibling/ or matched unrelated donor) and who do not have access to a good quality&#xD;
      umbilical cord product that meets criteria for expansion (due to insufficient numbers of TNC&#xD;
      and/or CD 34+ cells and/or inadequate HLA match) on NHLBI protocol number # 17-H-0091.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is chronic GVHD-free survival (defined as the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who are alive with no evidence of moderate or severe chronic GVHD at 1-year&#xD;
      post-transplant). Secondary endpoints will include engraftment, 100 day and 200-day treatment&#xD;
      related mortality (TRM), and standard transplant outcome variables such as non-hematologic&#xD;
      toxicity, incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, and relapse of disease. Health&#xD;
      related quality of life will also be assessed as secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
