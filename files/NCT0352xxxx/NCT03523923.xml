  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) test the benefits of the patient-centered collaborative&#xD;
      care treatment approach for persons who have had a TBI and who have pain, including headache;&#xD;
      and also (2) test whether this approach improves quality of life, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      adherence to other treatments, and quality of care in the TBI care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project uses the contextual paradigm of disability to analyze and improve outpatient&#xD;
      treatment of pain, including headache, in people who have had a TBI. Issues of restricted&#xD;
      access and health care system complexity likely contribute to sub-optimal treatment of&#xD;
      chronic pain. Therefore, the investigators seek to enhance real-world outpatient healthcare&#xD;
      delivery through a patient-centered, collaborative care approach to treating chronic pain.&#xD;
      The intervention is structured to reduce pain interference directly and indirectly through&#xD;
      improved management of pain and comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, and sleep&#xD;
      difficulties) that can amplify pain perception and disability. In addition, change in the&#xD;
      system of care may reduce burden on the emergency department. The investigators have heard&#xD;
      from our clinician and patient partners that poor pain management often leads to emergency&#xD;
      department visits, and this has also been reported in the literature.&#xD;

      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants may be referred to the study by clinical staff, self-refer based on&#xD;
      seeing study brochures or flyers, or will be invited to participate based on review of&#xD;
      medical records of patients scheduled for TBI clinics at Harborview Medical Center (HMC) or&#xD;
      the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) Rehabilitation TBI clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a potential participant meets initial eligibility criteria of having a diagnosis of TBI&#xD;
      and reports of chronic pain, a research staff member will contact the patient to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility through a formalized Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved screening&#xD;
      questionnaire. The Six-Item Screener (a brief and reliable instrument for identifying&#xD;
      cognitive impairment) will be used to determine if the participant is cognitively able to&#xD;
      provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, research staff will introduce the study using a talking points&#xD;
      script, and if the potential participant is interested, provide a brochure and a consent&#xD;
      form. Potential participants will be fully informed of all risks and benefits prior to giving&#xD;
      their written informed consent and prior to enrollment in the study. They may take time to&#xD;
      think about participating and render a decision in a subsequent call or visit. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be asked to repeat back understanding of this material as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will also review a HIPAA authorization form with the participant that permits&#xD;
      research staff to collect data from the participant's medical records regarding injury and&#xD;
      medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll a total of 158 participants with the goal of outcomes&#xD;
      assessment on 63 subjects in each arm (total of 126).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Demographic Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic information including age, sex, and race will be collected via medical&#xD;
      record review without consent from all patients including those who do not enroll to&#xD;
      determine differences between enrolled patients participants and those who do not enroll to&#xD;
      examine potential bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, participants will be randomized into one of two groups: usual care (UC) or&#xD;
      Collaborative Care (CC). Those randomized to CC treatment group will work with Collaborative&#xD;
      Care Manager (CCM) for up to 12 contacts over a 16 week treatment period, and complete a 24&#xD;
      week post randomization check in call with CCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the UC arm will be informed of the assignment via phone by an&#xD;
      un-blinded research team member. In addition, participants assigned to the UC arm will&#xD;
      receive a letter explaining the assignment. Participants assigned to the CC arm will be&#xD;
      contacted by the CCM to arrange the timing of their first treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may choose to have the interview/s administered by phone or in person at either&#xD;
      UWMC or HMC by our research staff member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact Information - Research staff will collect the following information from&#xD;
      participants: (1) contact information; (2) best way to reach an individual if they have more&#xD;
      than one line; best times/days to reach participant; and (3) names and contact information of&#xD;
      people staff are allowed to contact if participant is lost to follow-up or otherwise cannot&#xD;
      be contacted (i.e. collateral contacts). The purpose of this is to maximize the likelihood of&#xD;
      reaching a participant to complete the study procedures. Furthermore, asking permission to&#xD;
      leave a voicemail on at a specified contact number ensures a greater level of privacy for the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - Baseline will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and includes&#xD;
      demographic variables, TBI variables (date of injury, TBI severity), medications and&#xD;
      information describing participants' pain history, including pain sites, and pain duration.&#xD;
      The Brief Pain Intensity measure (BPI), a 4 item pain intensity scale, will be asked 4 times&#xD;
      over the course of 7 days at each assessment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews will be collected at 4-months and 8-months post-randomization and will&#xD;
      each take approximately 45 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative Care (CC) is a systematic and integrated approach to improving the delivery and&#xD;
      utilization of effective treatments for chronic pain. The care will be delivered through an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team, organized around a CC Manager (CCM) who guides the participant&#xD;
      through various aspects of care. The team will include a group of experts on pain and TBI.&#xD;
      The CCM will offer all participants care management, collaborative medical management, and&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment. If the participant declines to receive any of the components of the&#xD;
      intervention, they may still choose to participate in the remaining components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to usual care will be encouraged to consult with their TBI or primary&#xD;
      care provider with any concerns around pain treatment. Study personnel will not make any&#xD;
      attempts to influence usual care participants' pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is an effectiveness study, treatment decisions for UC participants will be left&#xD;
      to the primary provider and may or may not include pharmacologic management, counseling, and&#xD;
      referral to specialty services or other local resources.&#xD;
