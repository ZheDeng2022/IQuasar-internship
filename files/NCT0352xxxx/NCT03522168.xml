  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main LAP01 study: The purpose is to evaluate the long-term pathologic weight changes&#xD;
      associated with multi-year risperidone or aripiprazole therapy in 3 - &lt;18-year-old children,&#xD;
      who have varying durations of prior antipsychotic drug exposure from the start of study Month&#xD;
      0 (M0). This is critical because children appear to have greater vulnerability to&#xD;
      antipsychotic-associated weight gain than adults, and obesity has significant effects on&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional sub-study (registry sub-study) has been added via a protocol amendment. This&#xD;
      registry sub-study is optional for participant and only participants who participating in the&#xD;
      main part of the study are eligible if they were 6 to less than 18 years of age at the time&#xD;
      of the M0 visit. Participants who consent to this registry sub-study will participate in&#xD;
      yearly in-person visits and complete monthly assessments remotely over the course of three&#xD;
      additional years from the time of their final visit of the main LAP01 study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Main LAP01 study: Prospective, multi-site, Phase 4, longitudinal observational study designed&#xD;
      to systematically collect robust longitudinal post-marketing safety and quality of life data&#xD;
      about multi-year pediatric treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Screening may occur&#xD;
      for up to 37 days prior to enrollment. Assessments will occur at in-person visits planned at&#xD;
      months 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24, and at unscheduled, in-person visits that study staff request&#xD;
      when the participant switches or stops antipsychotic monotherapy with risperidone or&#xD;
      aripiprazole, adds or stops treatment with a weight modifying agent, becomes pregnant,&#xD;
      chooses to withdraw from the study prematurely or, has an ongoing Serious Adverse Event (SAE)&#xD;
      that requires further assessment. Monthly remote interim contacts occurring between in-person&#xD;
      visits will monitor for changes (other than dose related) in antipsychotic therapy or weight&#xD;
      modifying treatments, potential SAEs, and potential pregnancy. The participant, his/her&#xD;
      parent/guardian, and the participant's personal psychotropic- prescribing medical provider&#xD;
      (PPPMP) will make any and all decisions related to antipsychotic medications; any other&#xD;
      medications; and the participant's current mental state, developmental/psychiatric condition,&#xD;
      and level of risk for potential harm to self or others independent of the study procedures&#xD;
      and assessments. Study staff (SS) will share all lab results and changes in the participant's&#xD;
      AEs or clinical presentation, which the study medical clinician (SMC) considers medically&#xD;
      concerning based on the participant's assessment during in-person visits, with the&#xD;
      participant's PPPMP. If an emergency safety concern is evident during an in-person visit, the&#xD;
      SMC will immediately assess the participant, following medical standard-of- care procedures,&#xD;
      to determine whether the participant is safe to leave the clinic or requires additional&#xD;
      emergency care. If new or worsening symptoms are reported by the participant or&#xD;
      parent/guardian during remote interim contacts, the participant and/or parent/guardian will&#xD;
      be instructed to contact the PPPMP directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry sub-study: Participants who choose to participate will consent via a mobile&#xD;
      application (Pattern Health) and will measure their height and weight at home monthly (also&#xD;
      collected through the Pattern Health mobile application). One questionnaire will be completed&#xD;
      every 6 months via the Pattern Health mobile application. Yearly in-person visits will be&#xD;
      conducted to obtain in-clinic height, weight, vital signs and review concomitant medications.&#xD;
      Participants may also provide access to their electronic health records via the use of a&#xD;
      different mobile application (Pluto).&#xD;

The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization in individuals aged 2 years and older. The main scales include physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Summary scores can also be utilized to measure change over time on a five point scale for 0 = &quot;Never a Problem&quot; to 5 = &quot;Almost Always a Problem&quot;. The guardian will be asked to complete the parent version for reporting on their child's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed ) by the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). This is a 21-item questionnaire with a categorical scale ranging from 1 (not at all a problem) to 5 (very much a problem) that assesses the caregiver's quality of life. It asks specifically about the caregiver's quality of life by assessing the impact of caring for a child with emotional and behavioral problems. The questions include information about disruption of family life and relationships; demands on time; negative, mental, and physical health effects for any family member; financial strain; feelings of sacrifice; disruption of social/community life; worry/guilt; fatigue/strain; and embarrassment.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed by the Delighted-Terrible Faces Scale (DTFS) and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). The DTFS is a uni-dimensional, single item scale that will be used to assess the participant's perceived life quality. Faces expressing various feelings are depicted, and the participant is asked which face comes closest to expressing how he/she feels about his/her life over the past month. The participant can then select from the range of seven categorical faces depicting from one-delighted to seven-terrible expressions. This scale is included because it can be easily completed by participants with limited verbal and cognitive abilities as well as by very young children.</description>
