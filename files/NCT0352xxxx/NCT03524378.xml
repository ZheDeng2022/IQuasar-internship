  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain has been identified as a major problem for seafood and agricultural&#xD;
      workers, and is known to affect worker health and productivity. The aims of this study are&#xD;
      to: 1) identify modifiable, sector-specific, work and movement solutions with the potential&#xD;
      to reduce the burden or severity of chronic lower back pain in clam workers and 2) determine&#xD;
      the extent that participants adopt identified solution(s), and the impact on functional&#xD;
      difficulty and low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot/feasibility pre-post intervention study will use a participatory ergonomic&#xD;
      approach without a control group or randomization. The participatory approach will foster&#xD;
      capacity building by creating support within the workplace communities and by involving&#xD;
      seafood workers in developing context specific solutions for their own work practice,&#xD;
      increasing the potential for adoption and success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Specific Aim 1: Identify modifiable, sector-specific work and movement solutions&#xD;
      with that can reduce the burden or severity of chronic lower back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of rapid prototype video clips: clam workers will be videotaped performing&#xD;
           typical work tasks during daily operations on the boat, as well as transporting, sorting&#xD;
           and packing clams will be analyzed. Key movements and positions such as lifting,&#xD;
           prolonged static flexed positions that may be contributing to repetitive stress in the&#xD;
           low back region will be categorized. Short clips will be edited to create examples of&#xD;
           movements and positions for each category potentially contributing to low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prioritization of specific tasks and relevant solutions by key leaders: Up to 10&#xD;
           participants with a history of chronic low back pain for more than 3 months will be&#xD;
           recruited by the Cedar Key Aquaculture Association for the initial pilot testing of&#xD;
           research methods. Once participants have provided informed consent, they will complete a&#xD;
           general demographic survey, functional disability and pain questionnaire and surveys to&#xD;
           measure co-variates that include pain fear and anxiety, self-efficacy and coping&#xD;
           questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus groups will be held in the participant's work settings with consented individuals from&#xD;
      the same work teams to ensure application within a specific context and promote discussion&#xD;
      directed towards the best outcomes. Participants will discuss major tasks and factors&#xD;
      contributing to their low back pain using the video clips to target discussions and their&#xD;
      opinions of options that would help alleviate or prevent pain. Only clips from the relevant&#xD;
      teams will be used for each focus group. The focus groups will be recorded and transcribed&#xD;
      for analysis and as a record of discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic principles of ergonomic adaptation and movement modification for repetitive work&#xD;
      activities on and off the boat and lifting will be introduced using demonstrations and&#xD;
      discussion in a small group format. Participants will discuss other possible solutions.&#xD;
      Self-management including movement strategies and pain relief techniques will be introduced&#xD;
      and demonstrated by the principal investigator. The educational session will be videotaped to&#xD;
      ensure all relevant discussions are considered during the development of interventions and to&#xD;
      assist with reliability of intervention delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the focus group and educational session, participants will prioritize their&#xD;
      most problematic work tasks and most relevant and feasible solutions. In a follow up visit,&#xD;
      participants will be videotaped demonstrating the tasks and selected methods to reduce or&#xD;
      prevent repetitive stress determined from the focus group. With permission from the&#xD;
      participants, selected videos will be edited to provide clips to be used in subsequent&#xD;
      workshops. Only participants who agree to be videotaped for educational purposes will be&#xD;
      included in this session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Specific Aim 2: Determine the extent that participants adopt identified&#xD;
      solution(s), and the impact of their self-selected work and movement modifications on their&#xD;
      functional difficulty in the workplace related to low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the workers recruited for specific aim 1, up to 24 additional clam workers for&#xD;
      a total of up to 34 participants will be recruited with the same criteria; chronic low back&#xD;
      pain for more than 3 months, over the age of 18 and employed full time in clam&#xD;
      gathering/preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline: Once participants have provided informed consent, they will complete a general&#xD;
           demographic survey, functional disability and pain questionnaire and surveys to measure&#xD;
           co-variates that include pain fear and anxiety, self-efficacy and coping questions.&#xD;
           Functional disability, pain reports and work related functional ability will be recorded&#xD;
           once a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of interventions, focus group discussion and identification of individual&#xD;
           solutions: After the baseline period, workers will contribute to small focus groups of&#xD;
           4-6 individuals in their work team. After introduction of basic ergonomic and&#xD;
           self-management principles, participants will review video clips of the prioritized and&#xD;
           revised solutions identified in Specific Aim 1. After indicating their preferences, the&#xD;
           feasibility of solutions will be discussed. Following this discussion, participants will&#xD;
           indicate if they believe that the adjustments in work tasks, movement strategies or&#xD;
           self-management apply to their work, are easy to implement and are likely to decrease&#xD;
           their back pain. Workers will suggest any additional options to implement the ergonomic&#xD;
           principles. At the end of the focus group, participants will select 3 options to use in&#xD;
           their work activities for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow up: The research team will contact participants by text or phone once a week to&#xD;
           provide reminders. At 4 weeks the initial survey data will be repeated. The frequency&#xD;
           and consistency of use of the solutions during work activities will be reported to&#xD;
           reflect adoption, along with any pre-post changes in measures. After completion of the 8&#xD;
           weeks, individuals will also comment on the effectiveness, feasibility and impact of&#xD;
           solutions on their low back pain and job performance. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
           suggest options for implementation and provide feedback on how to optimize the&#xD;
           intervention for wider dissemination, and if they would recommend the solutions to&#xD;
           co-workers.&#xD;
