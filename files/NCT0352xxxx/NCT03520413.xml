  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes generates significant morbidity, mortality, and costs within the Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VHA). Veterans with persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic-based&#xD;
      care are among the highest-risk diabetes patients in VHA, and contribute disproportionately&#xD;
      to VHA's massive burden of diabetes complications and costs. VHA critically needs effective,&#xD;
      practical management alternatives for Veterans whose diabetes does not respond to&#xD;
      clinic-based management. The proposed study will address this need by leveraging VHA's unique&#xD;
      Home Telehealth capacity to deliver comprehensive telemedicine-based management for Veterans&#xD;
      with persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic-based care. Because this intensive&#xD;
      intervention is delivered using only existing Home Telehealth workforce, infrastructure, and&#xD;
      technical resources - which are ubiquitous at VHA centers nationwide - it could represent an&#xD;
      effective, practical approach to improving outcomes in Veterans with PPDM, potentially&#xD;
      translating to a substantial reduction in VHA's diabetes burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a comprehensive telemedicine intervention for Veterans with&#xD;
      persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic-based Veterans Health Administration (VHA)&#xD;
      care. Because this approach is designed for delivery via existing Home Telehealth (HT)&#xD;
      services, which are ubiquitous throughout VHA, it may represent an effective, practical&#xD;
      alternative for Veterans whose diabetes is refractory to clinic-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although efforts by clinicians and researchers have improved diabetes control across VHA,&#xD;
      Veterans with persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) have not benefitted from&#xD;
      these advances. The investigators define PPDM as maintenance of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8.5%&#xD;
      for &gt;1 year, despite receiving clinic-based diabetes care during this period. Veterans&#xD;
      meeting this definition - approximately 12% of all Veterans with type 2 diabetes - contribute&#xD;
      disproportionately to VHA's burden of diabetes complications and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While clinic-based care is insufficiently effective in PPDM, telemedicine-based management&#xD;
      that comprehensively addresses factors underlying poor diabetes control could improve&#xD;
      outcomes for these high-risk Veterans. Unfortunately, healthcare systems have rarely&#xD;
      integrated comprehensive telemedicine-based care into real-world practice, even for&#xD;
      clinic-refractory conditions like PPDM. This gap stems from the fact that comprehensive&#xD;
      telemedicine-based diabetes care has not previously been designed for practical delivery&#xD;
      under real-world conditions. In order for telemedicine to fulfill its potential as a means to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of PPDM, interventions must be developed with an emphasis on feasible&#xD;
      delivery through existing workforce, infrastructure, and technical resources, such that&#xD;
      effective implementation is eventually achievable. Until then, Veterans with PPDM will be&#xD;
      left without alternatives when clinic-based care proves inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial will evaluate Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for&#xD;
      Veterans with Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE-DM), a novel, comprehensive&#xD;
      telemedicine intervention for PPDM that is designed for practical delivery within VHA. The&#xD;
      Specific Aims of this study are to: 1) determine PRACTICE-DM's effectiveness; 2) evaluate&#xD;
      PRACTICE-DM's acceptability and mechanisms of effect using a mixed method process evaluation;&#xD;
      and 3) understand costs associated with PRACTICE-DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred Veterans with PPDM from two sites (Durham, NC and Richmond, VA) will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive one of two HT-delivered interventions: 1) PRACTICE-DM, a comprehensive&#xD;
      intervention combining telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support,&#xD;
      medication management, and depression support; or 2) an active control, standard HT care&#xD;
      coordination and telemonitoring. Both interventions will be delivered over a 12-month period&#xD;
      and all participants will continue to receive usual VHA care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome will be change in HbA1c from study baseline to 12 months. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are guided by a theoretical framework, and will include diabetes&#xD;
      self-care, diabetes burden, self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms. Qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted with 20 intervention-group Veterans, the HT nurses delivering the&#xD;
      intervention, and administrators at each site. Intervention costs will be comprehensively&#xD;
      assessed and compared to standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although VHA is a leader in telemedicine, its telemedicine capabilities are currently&#xD;
      underutilized for Veterans with PPDM. These Veterans are refractory to clinic-based care, so&#xD;
      contribute disproportionately to diabetes complications and costs. This study will leverage&#xD;
      VHA's unique telemedicine infrastructure to deliver comprehensive management designed for&#xD;
      PPDM, with the goal of improving outcomes in this high-risk, high cost population. Because&#xD;
      the proposed intervention is designed for delivery using existing HT services, it may&#xD;
      represent an effective, practical approach to reducing the burden of poor diabetes control&#xD;
      across VHA.&#xD;
