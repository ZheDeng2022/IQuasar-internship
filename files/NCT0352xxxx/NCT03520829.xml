  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of developing Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment plans is today very dependent on&#xD;
      the level of human expertise resulting in a great heterogeneity of the intrinsic qualities of&#xD;
      the treatment planning and the quality of care delivered in radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing reverse planning systems, although they have progressed considerably in recent&#xD;
      years, produce results that are still lower than those achieved by an expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally, an experienced dosimetric planner will act mainly on the coordinates of the&#xD;
      position of the isocenters, on the size of the collimators, sector by sector, and on the&#xD;
      irradiation time of each isocenters. In theory, the combination of these variables provides&#xD;
      access to billions of combinatorics whose diversity far exceeds the computational&#xD;
      capabilities of the human mind. The dosimetric planner therefore uses a very small part of&#xD;
      the spectrum of possible patterns by always reproducing a limited number of empirical&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company Intuitive Therapeutics has developed a new mathematical algorithm which can&#xD;
      automatically test in a very short time all the combinatorial possibilities and converge very&#xD;
      quickly to the solution that best meets the clinical, anatomical and dosimetric objectives&#xD;
      defined by the neurosurgeon. The quick processing of the system also allows the operator to&#xD;
      modify the constraints to refine the proposed result in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of the reality of the performances of this algorithm would give the ability&#xD;
      to even inexperienced users to develop high performance planning for the benefit of the&#xD;
      patient in terms of optimizing the efficacy / toxicity ratio of the radiosurgery treatment&#xD;
      results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate comparatively the quality of the schedules produced by&#xD;
      the algorithm developed by the company Innovative Therapeutics to those produced by an expert&#xD;
      who carried out more than 15000 dosimetric plannings and radiosurgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion of comparison is the Paddick index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary criteria for comparison are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  selectivity index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gradient index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum, minimum, average dose at risk structures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose distribution in the target volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment time (at equal source activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of realization of the planning&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was chosen to treat patients with vestibular Schwannoma OR multiple brain metastases (&gt; 5)&#xD;
      treated in single session by Gamma Knife OR para-optic meningioma in hypo-fractionated&#xD;
      treatment on Gamma Knife with restraint mask with inclusion of visual paths in the target&#xD;
      volume planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to show at least the non-inferiority of this new method compared to&#xD;
      the expert user based on the Paddick Index. This index has continuous values between 0 and 1,&#xD;
      0 being the worst case and 1 being the ideal solution. In order to define the sample size&#xD;
      needed for each pathology, a pilot phase is required. This phase can be performed&#xD;
      retrospectively using treatments already defined by the expert user. This pilot phase will&#xD;
      allow us to identify the difference that can be expected between the index values and the&#xD;
      variability of this difference. Based on these values we will be able to determine the size&#xD;
      of the sample allowing us to statistically test the non-inferiority, or even the superiority&#xD;
      of this new device. The number of cases to be included during the pilot phase should be at&#xD;
      least ten cases and a maximum of thirty cases. The choice of the number of cases to be&#xD;
      integrated during this pilot phase will depend on the homogeneity of the differences obtained&#xD;
      on the first cases. These values will allow us to calculate the size of the samples necessary&#xD;
      for the study of non-inferiority as well as for the study of superiority. Depending on the&#xD;
      calculated sizes samples we will make a choice to ensure that this study takes place in the&#xD;
      expected duration.&#xD;
