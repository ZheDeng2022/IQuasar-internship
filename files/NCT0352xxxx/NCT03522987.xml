  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a potential solution to address high rates of depression and anxiety seen in epilepsy&#xD;
      patients and poor mental health care access, this trial aims to carry out treatment for&#xD;
      depression and anxiety directly in the epilepsy clinic. Patients that meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, including significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the intervention. The intervention will consist of an initial prescription for an&#xD;
      FDA-approved medication to treat depression/anxiety and telephone-based chronic care&#xD;
      management plan for repeated symptom measurement and side effect surveillance. The purpose of&#xD;
      this pre-piloting limited study is to streamline recruitment, intervention and outcome&#xD;
      assessment process in preparation for a randomized, controlled pilot of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This trial is an innovative learning healthcare system approach to translate the concept of&#xD;
      measurement-based depression care into a specialty clinic setting and extend the concept to&#xD;
      treat depression and/or anxiety. The neurologist/APP-administered medication intervention&#xD;
      utilizes FDA-approved drugs with advantageous features for use in epilepsy (escitalopram and&#xD;
      venlafaxine) and a telephone-based chronic care management plan for repeated symptom&#xD;
      measurement and side effect surveillance. The proposed intervention may overcome barriers to&#xD;
      implementing mental health treatment interventions in generalized clinical settings by using&#xD;
      healthcare providers commonly present in specialty clinics (physicians and APPs) along with a&#xD;
      billable, best practices chronic care management intervention package. To test this idea, the&#xD;
      study team seeks to pilot a feasibility trial of an epileptologist-driven medication&#xD;
      treatment intervention for anxiety and depression, carried out directly in the epilepsy&#xD;
      clinic during a regularly scheduled visit and supported by advanced practice provider (APP),&#xD;
      using epilepsy as a paradigm for chronic medical illness with high prevalence of psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity. In this limited, intervention only pre-piloting trial, the team will streamline&#xD;
      recruitment, intervention, and outcome assessment procedures to prepare for a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled pilot of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will consist of initiating a chronic care management plan in the epilepsy clinic and an initial prescription from the epileptologist for escitalopram 10mg daily. Escitalopram dose adjustment will be made based on biweekly repeated screening of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as side effects identified on biweekly telephone calls or the 6-week advanced practice provider (APP) follow up visit. Escitalopram dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 20mg daily in 5-10mg increments every 2 weeks for treatment effect, or titrated down to 5mg if needed for adverse effects. If a participant is unable to tolerate escitalopram, then venlafaxine XR 37.5mg will be substituted, to be titrated in a similar manner biweekly based on side effects and anxiety and depression symptoms (with 37.5-75mg increment dose changes and maximum dose of 225mg daily).</description>
