    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Male and female participants at least 18 years of age with advanced malignancies who have&#xD;
        received or been intolerant to standard therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parts 1A and 2A:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, HCC,&#xD;
             melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, soft-tissue sarcoma, SCCHN (recurrent or metastatic), TNBC, or&#xD;
             urothelial carcinoma. Additional tumor histologies, including MSI-H tumors, may be&#xD;
             allowed with approval from the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parts 1B and 2B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Histologic confirmation of the cohort-specific tumor types specified below: Cohort 1 -&#xD;
        Advanced or metastatic melanoma Cohort 2 - Advanced or metastatic NSCLC Cohort 3 -&#xD;
        Recurrent or metastatic SCCHN Cohort 4 - Advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohorts 1-3 must have received 1 prior PD-1/L1 treatment and have experienced PD&#xD;
             during or after that treatment and have progressed on other SOC therapy(ies); Cohort 4&#xD;
             must be PD-1/L1 treatment naïve but have progressed on SOC therapy(ies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.&#xD;

          -  Care should be taken to biopsy the same lesion for the baseline and on-treatment&#xD;
             samples. If a participant has a solitary target lesion, this should not be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;

             for participants with actionable mutations must have been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of retinal disease as defined in the protocol.&#xD;

             meaningful as per protocol-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain or CNS metastases&#xD;
             that have progressed as per protocol-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or inactive autoimmune disease or syndrome that has required systemic treatment&#xD;
             in the past 2 years or receiving systemic therapy for an autoimmune or inflammatory&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Grade 3 or higher immune-related AEs or any ocular toxicity on prior&#xD;
             immunotherapy as per protocol-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vitamin K antagonists, systemic corticosteroids, live vaccines, or&#xD;
             treatment with any anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the&#xD;
             protocol-defined intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or&#xD;
             complications from prior surgical intervention before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection or risk of reactivation.&#xD;
