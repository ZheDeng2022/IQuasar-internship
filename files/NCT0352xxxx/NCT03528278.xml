  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research project aims at investigating whether it is possible to obtain an&#xD;
      increase in physical activity among inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders by the&#xD;
      use of motivational interviewing and environmental interventions, and whether interventions&#xD;
      will be associated with an increase in physical fitness and/or improvement in mental health.&#xD;
      The Norwegian health care system operates with a catchment-area based organization, which&#xD;
      make high levels of representability of patients possible. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      intermediate-long term inpatient departments where patients typically have schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum disorders and are admitted for longer periods. There are thus unique possibilities&#xD;
      for coordinated efforts to motivate for and change dysfunctional habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate if motivational interviewing and environmental&#xD;
      interventions may induce behavioral or clinical changes in intermediate-long term psychiatric&#xD;
      in-patients with severe mental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will levels of physical activity increase?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will self-esteem, life satisfaction or mental or physical health improve?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will it be possible to identify subgroups of patients with differentiated responses to&#xD;
           the interventions? (i.e. for whom does it work?)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at including the majority of patients at all wards and the interventions will&#xD;
      be additions to the ordinary treatment routines. The design is thus observational. The&#xD;
      project will not influence the natural flow of patients through the wards during the study&#xD;
      period. The patient population will thus be in a state of continuous change throughout the&#xD;
      project period and the individual treatment periods will show substantial variation between&#xD;
      patients. The total study period at one site will be 15 months. Consecutive patients will be&#xD;
      included during a 12 month period form study start. All consenting patients admitted during&#xD;
      this period will be assessed according to protocol at admittance and discharge, at start of&#xD;
      interventions and every 3 months. The study will start in the first department in the first&#xD;
      quarter of 2013 and will end in the last department the second quarter of 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main interventions will consist of change in the ward routines on several fields. The&#xD;
      main organization of interventions will thus be according to wards and not according to&#xD;
      individual patients as it will be difficult to direct the interventions to specific patients&#xD;
      within the ward. As a consequence, once the interventions have started in a ward all&#xD;
      subsequent patients admitted will necessarily receive interventions from day one of their&#xD;
      admission into treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses will be tested by comparing assessments obtained before start of interventions&#xD;
      with assessments obtained after a period of active interventions. As start of interventions&#xD;
      in a ward will be an irreversible event, only patients in treatment in the ward at start of&#xD;
      interventions will be subjects to crossover studies. Some patients will complete their&#xD;
      treatment periods either before or after start of interventions and thus not be able to be&#xD;
      subject to individual crossover studies. Data from these patients will be pooled in a&#xD;
      pre-intervention and a post-intervention group respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-intervention period all patients will receive individual treatment plans and make&#xD;
      weekly plans of activity together with the staff. All patients are generally encouraged to&#xD;
      physical training, and there are some common activities, but there is no specific focus on&#xD;
      this. All wards have a dietary standard which include presence of fruit and raw vegetables&#xD;
      between meals, pre-portioned dinner servings, restrictions on sugar-containing beverages and&#xD;
      sweets and a general focus on a low-fat and high-fiber menu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measures will be measures of physical activity and fitness, clinical-physical&#xD;
      measures or results from laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for informed consent and handling of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At start of project and at every new admittance after this point of time all patients are&#xD;
      informed about the project and asked to give informed consent to participation. A folder is&#xD;
      created for each individual participant (ring-binder) containing overview over assessments&#xD;
      with time-lines and place-holders for score sheets for baseline and follow-up assessments. An&#xD;
      information/registration sheet with the participants' signature is added to this folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each unit will have a person responsible for data-collection. This person will supervise that&#xD;
      assessments are done according to protocol, distribute registration and score sheets and&#xD;
      collect sheets after assessments. The score sheets are added continuously to the individual&#xD;
      folders. One person is responsible for collecting and gathering data from all units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the clinical wards, the project information from individuals will be stored with the same&#xD;
      security as ordinary charts and other patient information. The research data will be put into&#xD;
      folders which will be kept locked in a room with restricted access within the hospital&#xD;
      premises in a 24-h locked building. Folders are only accessed when adding data (new score&#xD;
      sheets). One person supervises this and is in charge of this local folder-database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of the score sheets are eventually punched into a central computer database with&#xD;
      the necessary formal specifications and security measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments at baseline only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis: The participants will be diagnosed with the Structural Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version IV) for axis I&#xD;
      disorders (SCID-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General and psychosocial data: Data are collected about age and gender, ethnicity, education,&#xD;
      occupation, housing and marital/civil status.&#xD;
