  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine the investigational use of the conditioning regimen&#xD;
      (bendamustine, fludarabine, and rituximab) prior to haploidentical peripheral blood&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide. The study will&#xD;
      also test the investigational use of CD56-enriched Donor Lymphocyte Infusion to see if this&#xD;
      treatment is safe, and whether or not it will help patients achieve better outcomes&#xD;
      post-transplant, including reduced risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and preventing&#xD;
      disease relapse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I trial of a new haploidentical stem cell transplant regimen&#xD;
      intended to assess safety. Two groups of patients are planned: patients with lymphoma and&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. Each subject will receive a haploidentical stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells. Bendamustine-fludarabine-rituximab-TBI&#xD;
      conditioning will be used, followed by stem cell infusion, with Post-Transplant&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients will receive a CD56-selected&#xD;
      DLI on day +8. Evaluations will be taken at baseline and at each of the study visits.&#xD;
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Total&#xD;
      duration of subject participation will be one year. Total duration of the study is expected&#xD;
      to be three years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General Inclusion Criteria (For Treatment Groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient age 18 - 75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG 0 - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are allowed if these criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No history of opportunistic infections&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. CD4+ cell count greater or equal to 250 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No history of non-malignancy AIDS-defining conditions other than historical low&#xD;
                  CD4+ cell counts&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patient is on antiretroviral therapy with undetectable viral load. There must be&#xD;
                  minimal interactions of the antiviral therapy with the experimental treatment&#xD;
                  (antiretroviral such as ritonavir is potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and p-gp inducer may&#xD;
                  interact with tacrolimus resulted in increased serum concentration of&#xD;
                  tacrolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a related donor or who is at minimum HLA haploidentical. The donor&#xD;
             and recipient must be identical at least one allele of each of the following genetic&#xD;
             loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1. A minimum match of 5/10 is&#xD;
             therefore required, and will be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and&#xD;
             recipient share one HLA haplotype. An unrelated donor search is not required.&#xD;
             (Patients with a readily-available, suitable, fully-matched sibling donor less than&#xD;
             age 55 are not eligible for this trial, these patients should proceed to transplant&#xD;
             using the matched related donor as standard-of-care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Donor Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the&#xD;
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the following order of&#xD;
             priority will be used to determine the preferred donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medically and psychologically fit and willing to donate&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For CMV seronegative recipients, a CMV seronegative donor&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Red blood-cell compatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  RBC cross-match compatible&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Minor ABO incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Major ABO incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If more than one preferred donor is identified and there is no medical, HLA- or KIR&#xD;
             ligand reason to prefer one of them, then the following guidelines are recommended:&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the patient is male, choose a male donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Choose the youngest preferred donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient and family express a strong preference for a particular donor, use that&#xD;
             one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Lymphoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of resistant or relapsed CLL, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma, T-cell&#xD;
             lymphoma, NK or NK/T Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  relapsed after auto-transplant, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  failed to mobilize autologous stem cells, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for whom allogeneic stem cell transplant is deemed appropriate given disease risk&#xD;
                  factors that make cure with autologous transplant seem unlikely, such as history&#xD;
                  of chemotherapy refractoriness, high risk disease&#xD;
                  features/mutations/translocations (e.g., Double Hit / Double Expressor DLBCL),&#xD;
                  short remission after prior chemotherapy, or histologic transformation (see&#xD;
                  below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Patients with Aggressive Mantle Cell and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma who have&#xD;
             not had a prior autologous transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have been exposed to anthracycline, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High and High-Intermediate aaIPI score (2 or 3 factors), and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have relapsed within one year of primary therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For diagnosis of other aggressive lymphoma (e.g. NK/T Lymphoma, T Cell&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lymphoma, etc.):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed within 12 months of most recent therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For low-grade lymphomas / CLL:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Standard risk patients (absence of del(17p), absence of del(11q), no TP53&#xD;
                  mutation and absence of complex karyotype) must have progressed on BCR inhibitor,&#xD;
                  or undergone histologic transformation, to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with high risk disease (del(17p) or TP53 mutations and/or complex&#xD;
                  phenotype) who relapse after frontline therapy, demonstrate refractory disease to&#xD;
                  second line therapy (not BCR inhibitors), but show an objective response to BCR&#xD;
                  inhibitors are eligible to be taken off BCR inhibitors in order to proceed to&#xD;
                  alloHSCT on trial. Patients with high risk disease who relapse after frontline&#xD;
                  therapy, demonstrate refractory disease to second line therapy including BCR&#xD;
                  inhibitors (not BCL-2 inhibitors), but show an objective response to BCL-2&#xD;
                  inhibitors (venetoclax) are eligible to be taken off BCL-2 inhibitors in order to&#xD;
                  proceed to alloHSCT on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For aggressive lymphomas, partial or complete remission (PR or CR) is required&#xD;
                  prior to alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Regarding CD20 expression: Patients with B cell malignancies that were CD20+ at&#xD;
                  any level at the time of relapse diagnosis (including partial / dim staining on&#xD;
                  IHC or partial / low level expression by flow cytometry) will receive rituximab&#xD;
                  as part of allogeneic transplant conditioning, if indicated. Patients with&#xD;
                  primary-refractory disease who were CD20+ at any level at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
                  will likewise receive rituximab, if indicated. Patients with histologies that&#xD;
                  were CD20- will not receive rituximab (T cell lymphoma, NK/T lymphoma, etc.).&#xD;
                  Fresh tissue / repeat biopsy is not required; the most recent biopsy will be&#xD;
                  reviewed to assess CD20 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
