    <textblock>
      This project examines the effects of cannabis on cognition and other domains of function and&#xD;
      whether those effects are dependent upon the ratio of THC to CBD in the product. Current&#xD;
      cannabis users are asked to stop using their typical product and to use cannabis containing&#xD;
      different ratios of the cannabinoids THC and CBD. Participants complete baseline assessments&#xD;
      including cognitive tasks, clinical measures, substance use history, and blood draw.&#xD;
      Participants then acquire and use their study strain on their own, and after a period of use&#xD;
      the mobile pharmacology laboratory goes to a location of their choosing. They complete&#xD;
      cognitive, motor and blood-based assessments, then leave the mobile lab to use their study&#xD;
      product one last time, returning to the mobile lab to complete cognitive, motor, and&#xD;
      blood-based assessments immediately after use and one hour after use. A small subset of&#xD;
      participants complete all of these procedures but use edible as opposed to flower-based&#xD;
      products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis research can be dated back to the 1970's where standardized smoking of low potency&#xD;
      cannabis in a laboratory setting has been the primary method used to understand the effects&#xD;
      of the drug. The objective of this program is to use a naturalistic design to advance a more&#xD;
      nuanced understanding of the potential outcomes associated with using different strains of&#xD;
      marijuana. Researchers need to understand the effects of commonly used cannabis strains, as&#xD;
      they are used in every day life. Commonly available strains of cannabis sold in dispensaries&#xD;
      in Colorado have 3-5 times greater potency of cannabinoids, such as the psychoactive compound&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than what has been used in laboratory settings. It is possible&#xD;
      that laboratory based studies underestimate the effects of more potent strains that are&#xD;
      widely available. Also, scientists have focused on the effects of THC while mostly ignoring&#xD;
      other major cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol or CBD) and their synergistic relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to observe how different strains of marijuana, based off their&#xD;
      unique cannabinoid content, can influence your mental and physical state in real time. This&#xD;
      program will allow researchers to observe these effects immediately before and after cannabis&#xD;
      use. A participant will use cannabis in the comfort of their home, and will walk out their&#xD;
      front door and into a mobile lab that will be parked outside of their house. In this study,&#xD;
      there is no need to smoke and drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is this study involves one appointment at the laboratory facility in Boulder&#xD;
      and one appointment in the mobile laboratory.&#xD;

    <description>To test the hypothesis that a high delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) strain of marijuana will be associated with greater blood levels of THC and greater harmful effects, we will measure the concentrations of the cannabinoid THC in blood (ng/ml).</description>

    <measure>Change in Inflammation: Circulating Levels of cytokines (panel of inflammatory markers)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 3 time points over 5 days: Baseline (before 5 days of use), Pre-Administration (after 5 days of use but prior to acute use), and Post-Administration (after 5 days of use but 60 minutes after acute use).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in inflammation from before to after cannabis use will be tested in relation to THC and CBD blood levels.</description>

    <time_frame>Change over 2 time points over 1 hour: Pre-Administration (after 5 days of use but prior to acute self-administration), and Post-Administration (after 5 days of use but 60 minutes after acute self-administration).</time_frame>
    <description>The DEQ is a 5 items visual analog scale used to measure the strength of marijuana as well as the desirable effects (de Wit &amp; Phillips, 2012).</description>

    <description>The ARCI (Martin, Sloan, Sapira, &amp; Jasinski, 1971), including the ARCI-Marijuana (M) scale (Chait, Fischman, &amp; Schuster, 1985) will be used to measure subjective effects of marijuana in addition to drug-induced euphoria, stimulant-like effects, intellectual efficiency and energy, sedation, dysphoria, and other somatic effects.</description>

    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) will be used to collect baseline information on mood as well as information on mood changes throughout the study. (Johanson &amp; Uhlenhuth, 1980; McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppleman, 1971)</description>

Cognitive outcomes are measured in standard scores (e.g. Range of &gt;70 to &gt;140 (Mean of 100 and SD of 15) with higher scores indicating better performance) and can be averaged to reflect a standard score of overall cognitive function.</description>
