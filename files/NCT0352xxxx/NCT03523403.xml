  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is characterized by an underlying inflammatory state in which various inflammatory&#xD;
      signaling molecules, termed cytokines, affect metabolic processes central to type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease; leading causes of disability and death in Ontario. Such&#xD;
      obesity-associated inflammation is partly due to the movement of endotoxin (i.e.&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria) from the gut&#xD;
      microbiota to the blood, resulting in elevated blood levels of LPS (a condition termed&#xD;
      metabolic endotoxemia) that stimulates inflammation. Digestion of a high-fat meal increases&#xD;
      blood LPS and is subsequently associated with inflammation and metabolic impairments.&#xD;
      However, in this context, little is known about how the consumption of bioactive-rich foods,&#xD;
      such as whole apples, can improve impaired inflammatory and metabolic responses in overweight&#xD;
      and obese individuals. Apples are a key commodity to study given that they are Ontario's&#xD;
      predominant fruit crop with the apple industry valued at approximately $400 million, they&#xD;
      require little food preparation, and they are common in the diet year-round. There are some,&#xD;
      but limited, reports of potential apple-induced health benefits related to reductions in&#xD;
      inflammation and improved metabolic responses in lean/healthy individuals, but work in&#xD;
      overweight and obese individuals is especially lacking. Thus, to address the gap in our&#xD;
      understanding of how daily apple intake may improve the health consequences of obesity, we&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized clinical trial in which overweight and obese adults will consume&#xD;
      three Ontario-grown Gala apples (approximately 300 g) as part of their typical diet in one&#xD;
      sitting (i.e. acute consumption) and/or daily for six weeks (i.e. chronic consumption). The&#xD;
      Acute Apple Consumption phase of the study will follow a randomized crossover design in which&#xD;
      participants' rate of gastric emptying, efficacy of dietary lipid digestion and absorption,&#xD;
      and production of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of metabolism will be assessed before&#xD;
      and after consuming a high-fat meal (designed to provide 1 g fat/kg body weight) with or&#xD;
      without three apples in one sitting. The Chronic Apple Consumption phase of the study will&#xD;
      follow a randomized, controlled, parallel-arm design in which participants' (fasting)&#xD;
      production of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of metabolism, as well as their gut&#xD;
      microbiota profile, will be assessed before and after consuming three apples (or no apples)&#xD;
      daily for six weeks. We hypothesize that the consumption of three whole apples in one sitting&#xD;
      and daily for six weeks will improve these parameters in overweight and obese individuals at&#xD;
      risk of developing chronic metabolic diseases.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted at the Human Nutraceutical Research Unit (HNRU) at the&#xD;
      University of Guelph. The research will be carried out in accordance with the SOPs&#xD;
      established by the HNRU, which formalize the Department of Human Health and Nutritional&#xD;
      Sciences (HHNS) procedures to ensure that participant safety and comfort are consistently&#xD;
      maintained throughout the research process and that university research standards are met.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 1 - Recruitment and screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 participants will be recruited for this study. Interested individuals will&#xD;
      complete a 15-minute phone screening questionnaire to assess initial eligibility. If&#xD;
      eligible, a 30-minute in-person screening visit to the HNRU will be scheduled to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. Prior to initiation of the in-person screening visit activities, the appropriate&#xD;
      consent form will be provided to and discussed with the potential participant, and will be&#xD;
      signed. At the in-person screening visit, potential participants will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete an in-person screening questionnaire of health and lifestyle habits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have anthropometric measures taken, including body weight, height, waist circumference&#xD;
           and blood pressure in private area by a study coordinator Next, the Acute and Chronic&#xD;
           Apple Consumption phases of the study will be explained to eligible participants, and&#xD;
           all questions will be answered. Finally, the appropriate consent form will be provided&#xD;
           to and discussed with eligible participants, and will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two phases: Acute and Chronic Apple Consumption. The Acute phase will involve&#xD;
      eating 3 whole Ontario-grown Gala apples in one sitting, whereas the Chronic phase will&#xD;
      involve eating 3 apples or no apples daily for 6 weeks. All 60 eligible participants will be&#xD;
      included in the Chronic phase, and will be invited to also participate in the Acute phase.&#xD;
      There will be no consequences for refusing to participate in the Acute phase. 30 of the 60&#xD;
      participants will be included in the Acute phase on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis, and&#xD;
      upon completion of the Acute phase, they will immediately start the Chronic phase of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant to Acute + Chronic phase participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Acute phase will follow a randomized, cross-over study design. Participants who volunteer&#xD;
      to also participate in the Acute phase will complete the Acute phase before starting the&#xD;
      Chronic phase of the study. At least 7 days prior to the start of the Chronic phase&#xD;
      activities, Acute phase participants will visit the HNRU for 1, 7-hour study visit (see&#xD;
      below). Participants will eat 3 apples or no apples, plus consume a high-fat meal (whipping&#xD;
      cream + milk, designed to provide 1 g fat/kg body weight) containing 1500 mg of acetaminophen&#xD;
      within 30 minutes. Whether Acute phase participants consume 3 apples or no apples at their&#xD;
      study visit 1 will be randomized. At least 7 days later, participants will start the Chronic&#xD;
      phase of the study. At their study visit 2 participants will consume the opposite of what&#xD;
      they consumed at study visit 1: either 3 apples or no apples, plus the high-fat meal&#xD;
      containing 1500 mg of acetaminophen within 30 minutes. Acute phase participants' measurements&#xD;
      taken at the study visit with no apple consumption (study visit 1 or 2) will serve as their&#xD;
      baseline measurements for the Chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic phase will follow a randomized, parallel group study design. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention or control group; the intervention group will eat 3&#xD;
      apples/day for 6 weeks, while the control group will eat no apples/day for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 6 fecal samples: 3 before and 3 at the end of the 6-week study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the HNRU for 2, 15-minute check-in visits (see below) at weeks 2 and 4 during the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete 3, 3-day food records: before and at the end of the 2-week run-in period, and&#xD;
           within weeks 4 - 6 of the Chronic phase of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the HNRU for 1 hour at the end of week 6. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Be asked to complete a questionnaire detailing information about their diet,&#xD;
                lifestyle habits, and any health issues to report&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have anthropometric measures including body weight, height, waist/hip circumference&#xD;
                and blood pressure taken in a private area by a trained study coordinator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide a fasting blood sample via venipuncture conducted by a HHNS-approved,&#xD;
                qualified phlebotomist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant to Chronic phase only participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chronic phase will follow a randomized, parallel group study design. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention or control group; the intervention group will eat 3&#xD;
      apples/day for 6 weeks, and the control group will eat no apples/day for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the HNRU for 2, 1-hour study visits, immediately before, and immediately after the&#xD;
           6-week study. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Be asked to complete a questionnaire detailing information about their diet,&#xD;
                lifestyle habits, and any health issues to report&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have anthropometric measures including body weight, height, waist/hip circumference&#xD;
                and blood pressure taken in a private area by a trained study coordinator&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provide a fasting blood sample via venipuncture conducted by a HHNS-approved,&#xD;
                qualified phlebotomist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 6 fecal samples: 3 before and 3 at the end of the 6-week study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the HNRU for 2, 15-minute check-in visits (see below) at weeks 2 and 4 during the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete 3, 3-day food records: before and at the end of the 2-week run-in period, and&#xD;
           within weeks 4-6 of the Chronic phase of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 2 - Dietary guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to follow our dietary guidelines outlining a low-polyphenol&#xD;
      diet for 2 weeks prior to their first study visit, followed by a reduced polyphenol diet&#xD;
      (less restricted than the 2-week run-in period) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 3 - Study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant to the Acute phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the HNRU after a 10-12 h overnight fast on day 1 after the 2-week&#xD;
      run-in period. Participants will be asked to consume a standardized evening meal consisting&#xD;
      of a frozen vegetable lasagna, granola bar, pudding cup, and juice box prior to the 10-12 h&#xD;
      overnight fast, and to avoid over-the-counter acetaminophen-containing products for 24 h, and&#xD;
      alcohol and exercise for 48 h prior to the study visit. Water will be permitted up to 30&#xD;
      minutes before the study visit. Prior to initiation of study visit activities, participants&#xD;
      will submit their 3-day food record(s) and fecal samples (if appropriate) and will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire detailing information about their diet, lifestyle habits, and any&#xD;
      health issues to report. Participants will be invited to ask any questions or voice any&#xD;
      concerns about the study visit. Then, a study coordinator will take anthropometric measures&#xD;
      including body weight, height, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure in a private area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, at study visits 1 and 2, a forearm vein catheter will be inserted for repeated blood&#xD;
      sampling by a HHNS-approved, qualified phlebotomist. Once the catheter has been inserted, a&#xD;
      fasting blood sample (33 mL) will be taken (baseline, time point 0). Then, participants will&#xD;
      consume a high-fat meal (whipping cream + milk, designed to provide 1 g fat/kg body weight)&#xD;
      containing 1500 mg of acetaminophen within 30 minutes. In addition to the high-fat meal&#xD;
      (containing 1500 mg of acetaminophen), Acute + Chronic phase participants will consume either&#xD;
      3 apples or no apples at their study visit 1, and will consume the opposite (i.e. 3 apples or&#xD;
      no apples) at study visit 2. Repeated IV blood samples (6 - 27 mL each) will be collected&#xD;
      every 20 minutes during the first 3 hours, and then each hour for the next 3 hours, for a&#xD;
      total of 13 blood samples (150 mL total) at each of study visits 1 and 2. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to remain seated for the duration of each study visit with only short walks&#xD;
      permitted to use the washroom. Participants will be supervised by a study coordinator and/or&#xD;
      a medically trained technician at all times throughout the study and will never be left&#xD;
      unsupervised. After the 6-hour post-prandial period, participants will be provided with a&#xD;
      lunch consisting of a SUBWAY sub and a juice box. Participants will be advised to avoid&#xD;
      acetaminophen-containing products for the remainder of the day to avoid over-consumption.&#xD;
      Total time per study visit 1 and 2 will be approximately 7 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, study visit 3 will conclude the Chronic phase of the study as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant to the Chronic phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the HNRU after a 10-12 h overnight fast on day 1 after the 2-week&#xD;
      run-in period. Participants will be asked to consume a standardized evening meal consisting&#xD;
      of a frozen vegetable lasagna, granola bar, pudding cup, and juice box prior to the 10-12 h&#xD;
      overnight fast, and to avoid over-the-counter acetaminophen-containing products for 24 h, and&#xD;
      alcohol and exercise for 48 h prior to the study visit. Water will be permitted up to 30&#xD;
      minutes before the study visit. Prior to initiation of study visit activities, participants&#xD;
      will submit their 3-day food record(s) and fecal samples (if appropriate) and will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire detailing information about their diet, lifestyle habits, and any&#xD;
      health issues to report. Participants will be invited to ask any questions or voice any&#xD;
      concerns about the study visit. Then, a study coordinator will take anthropometric measures&#xD;
      including body weight, height, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure in a private area.&#xD;
      Afterwards, a HHNS-approved, qualified phlebotomist will conduct a venipuncture according to&#xD;
      collect a fasting blood sample (33 mL). Finally, participants will be provided with a granola&#xD;
      bar and juice box. Total time per study visit will be approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 4 - 3-day food records:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to follow our dietary guidelines during the two-week run-in period&#xD;
      and during the study to avoid/limit consumption of polyphenol-containing foods. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a 3-day food record according to our instructions on 3 separate&#xD;
      occasions: before and at the end of the 2-week run-in period and within weeks 4-6 of the&#xD;
      Chronic phase of the study. Total time to complete 3 days of a 3-day food record will be&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 5 - Check-in visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Chronic phase of the study, participants will be asked to visit the HNRU at the&#xD;
      end of weeks 2 and 4 to collect more apples (or not, if in the control group), have&#xD;
      anthropometric measures (body weight, height, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure)&#xD;
      taken by a trained study coordinator in a private area, and complete a brief questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess compliance with the dietary guidelines as well as recent lifestyle patterns and any&#xD;
      health issues. Total time per check-in visit will be approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 6 - Fecal sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 2 occasions, prior to study visit 1 and prior to their final study visit, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to collect 3 consecutive fecal samples according to the instructions and using&#xD;
      the materials provided. Total time for each fecal sample collection will be approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 7 - Study exit questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a study exit questionnaire, either in-person at their&#xD;
      final study visit or by email if the participant chooses to withdraw from the study early.&#xD;
      Total time to complete the study exit questionnaire will be approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
