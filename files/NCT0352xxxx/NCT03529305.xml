    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate functional and structural improvements in&#xD;
      the brain of stroke patients after rTMS treatment using multi-modal MRI techniques.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators sought to determine whether rTMS treatment modulate the brain&#xD;
      function and structure in patients and, if so, whether different frequency of the rTMS&#xD;
      treatment will affect the degree of the motor recovery in patients' brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized into three groups: Experimental group 1 (TMS group) received&#xD;
      low frequency rTMS; Experimental group 2 (TMS group) received high frequency rTMS; The third&#xD;
      group who received only physical therapy constituted the control group. All patients undergo&#xD;
      MRI scan one day before and after rTMS treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As the second leading cause of death and major cause of disability in the world, stroke is&#xD;
      the rapid loss of brain function due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain.&#xD;
      Approximately two thirds of patients with stroke have impaired motor function even at three&#xD;
      to six months after stroke onset. The abnormally increased interhemispheric inhibition driven&#xD;
      from the unaffected to the affected hemisphere is associated with the motor impairment, which&#xD;
      is characterized by increased cortical excitability in the unaffected hemisphere and&#xD;
      decreased cortical excitability in the affected hemisphere. Rebalancing the cortical&#xD;
      excitability between two hemispheres is associated with a better overall prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a painless, noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation technique. High-frequency rTMS facilitates cortical excitability, whereas&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS decreases the cortical excitability of the stimulated hemisphere.&#xD;
      Therefore, rTMS can be used to increase and decrease the cortical excitability of the&#xD;
      affected and unaffected hemispheres, respectively, and may facilitate motor function after&#xD;
      stroke. However, the previous studies commonly applied behavioral scales to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the rTMS treatment, little is known how the brain function and structure recover&#xD;
      after rTMS treatment and whether the different frequency of rTMS will affect the recovery in&#xD;
      the brain of stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques provide promising avenues to detect brain function and&#xD;
      structure in patients after stroke onset and have been increasingly applied to this disease.&#xD;
      The morphology of the brain (cortical thickness, gray matter volume) is commonly assessed&#xD;
      using T1-weighted MRI (Structural MRI). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising&#xD;
      technique to study human brain structure, especially white matter anatomy, by providing&#xD;
      multiple quantitative parameters to characterize tissue microstructure from different&#xD;
      aspects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a functional neuroimaging technique&#xD;
      which measures the changes of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are&#xD;
      highly correlated with neural activities. Task fMRI which applies stimulus-response pattern&#xD;
      to identify the regions activated by performance of a cognitive task, while resting-state&#xD;
      fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising tool to map intrinsic function of the human brain, which has&#xD;
      unique advantages in clinical conditions because it does not require participants to engage&#xD;
      in cognitive activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate functional and structural improvements in&#xD;
      the brain of stroke patients after rTMS treatment using multi-modal MRI techniques.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators sought to determine whether rTMS treatment modulate the brain&#xD;
      function and structure in stroke patients and, if so, whether different frequency of the rTMS&#xD;
      treatment will affect the degree of the motor recovery in patients' brain.&#xD;
