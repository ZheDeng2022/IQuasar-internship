      â€¢ Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is defined as an abnormally rapid heart rhythm&#xD;
      originating above the ventricles. It usually has narrow complex tachycardia but this is not&#xD;
      always the case. Conventionally, atrial flutter and fibrillation are excluded from this&#xD;
      group.ventricular tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance seen in children.(2) Most&#xD;
      general practitioners will deal with a case at some point. While in most cases ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia can be considered a benign rhythm disorder, special consideration needs to be&#xD;
      given to infants, athletes and patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiology Incidence of Supraventricular tachycardia is estimated to occur in 1 in 250&#xD;
      otherwise healthy children. About 50% of children with Supraventricular tachycardia present&#xD;
      with the first episode in the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After infancy there is another surge in incidence in early childhood (6-9 years) and then in&#xD;
      adolescence.In more than 90% of infants spontaneous resolution occurs by 1 year of age but up&#xD;
      to a third have a subsequent recurrence of Supraventricular tachycardia at a mean age of 8&#xD;
      years. Spontaneous resolution is uncommon (15%) in those presenting after 1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most children with Supraventricular tachycardia have a structurally normal heart but the&#xD;
      prevalence of congenital heart disease in patients with Supraventricular tachycardia is&#xD;
      substantially higher than that of the general population (9-32%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation Clinical presentation depends on the age of the child and the duration&#xD;
      of Supraventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants the heart rate is usually about 220 to 320 bpm and symptoms are usually&#xD;
      nonspecific, including poor feeding, irritability, vomiting and dusky episodes. If the&#xD;
      symptoms are unrecognised for hours or days the infant may present with heart failure or&#xD;
      shock.In older children the heart rate is between 160 to 280 bpm and the usual presenting&#xD;
      symptoms are palpitations, chest pain and shortness of breath. Often light-headedness and&#xD;
      dizziness can occur; however, syncope is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency and duration of episodes can vary hugely, with episodes lasting a few minutes&#xD;
      to several hours and occurring once a year to several times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination is normal apart from the infant presenting in heart failure and shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis is confirmed by making an ECG recording during symptoms. Options available for this&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter (24-hour ambulatory ECG) monitoring in children having daily symptoms. Cardiac event&#xD;
      recorders in those who have brief infrequent symptoms. ECG in the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      in those with infrequent but prolonged symptoms allowing them to travel to ED in the event of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG done during episodes is diagnostic and shows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tachycardia with narrow QRS complexes. P waves may not be visible. If visible, they exhibit&#xD;
      retrograde conduction with inverted P waves.A baseline echocardiography to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of a structurally normal heart and to ensure that,heart function is normal,is&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute management of Supraventricular tachycardia Acute management of Supraventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia is primarily based on use of vagal manoeuvres and/or adenosine. Sometimes other&#xD;
      medications and occasionally direct current (DC) shock are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced Paediatric Life Support guidelines recommend the following approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess airway, breathing and circulation (ABC) in any child or infant presenting with&#xD;
      Supraventricular tachycardia. Try vagal stimulation while continuing ECG monitoring. The&#xD;
      techniques that can be used include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elicit the 'diving reflex' by applying a rubber glove filled with iced water on the face or&#xD;
      wrapping the infant in a towel and immersing the face in iced water for five seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-sided carotid massage. Valsalva manoeuvre in older children. Give IV adenosine if vagal&#xD;
      manoeuvres are unsuccessful. Start with a bolus dose of 100 micrograms/kg intravenously. If&#xD;
      this does not work, increasing doses (200 micrograms/kg and then 300 micrograms/kg) can be&#xD;
      given after two minutes. The maximum single dose that is given is 500 micrograms/kg (300&#xD;
      micrograms/kg in infants less than 1 month of age), up to a maximum of 12 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a hemodynamically stable child not responding to adenosine, alternative medications should&#xD;
      be used based on advice by a paediatric cardiologist. The options available include&#xD;
      flecainide, amiodarone, propranolol, digoxin and procainamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      verapamil has been associated with irreversible hypotension and asystole in infants and&#xD;
      should not be used in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wide complex Supraventricular tachycardia(i.e Supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant&#xD;
      conduction) is uncommon in infants and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an infant or child with Supraventricular tachycardia and in shock the best treatment&#xD;
      option is synchronised DC cardioversion starting at a dose of 1 joule/kg and increasing to 2&#xD;
      joules/kg if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term management Long-term management is dependent on a number of factors, including the&#xD;
      age of patient, duration and frequency of episodes and presence of ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;
      Management is carried out under the supervision of a pediatric cardiologist.In children with&#xD;
      infrequent, mild and self-limiting episodes, usually no treatment is needed.In children in&#xD;
      whom the episodes are frequent, prolonged, difficult to terminate or interfering with sports&#xD;
      participation, treatment is indicated. Treatment options include medications or transcatheter&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical treatment The purpose of using anti-arrhythmic drugs is to slow conduction,&#xD;
           preferentially within one limb of the re-entrant circuit and therefore terminate the&#xD;
           tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment options include digoxin, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers and the&#xD;
           sodium-channel blocker, flecainide.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While there is significant variation in practice, the majority of European centers use&#xD;
           flecainide or atenolol as the first choice of drug for the prevention of recurrent&#xD;
           Supraventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is little difference in the efficacy of various medications and a randomised&#xD;
           controlled trial comparing digoxin and propranolol found no difference in recurrence of&#xD;
           Supraventricular tachycardia in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While any of the anti-arrhythmics can be used to initiate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ablation treatment Management of Supraventricular tachycardia has been revolutionised&#xD;
           with the development of transcatheter ablation which is now considered standard&#xD;
           treatment for older children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency (RF) is the preferred energy source for paediatric arrhythmias and catheter&#xD;
      ablation is only chosen if two or more anti-arrhythmic drugs have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to RF is cryoablation, which is safer and minimises the risk of heart block&#xD;
      during ablation. However, it is associated with a higher Supraventricular tachycardia&#xD;
      recurrence rate and therefore most centers use cryoablation in cases where RF ablation is&#xD;
      considered a higher risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports participation and general advice Patients and parents should be reassured that&#xD;
      Supraventricular tachycardia is typically not life-threatening but can be life-altering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and patients should be taught age-appropriate vagal manoeuvres and indications for&#xD;
      requesting assistance from emergency services. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged symptoms. Episode not terminated by vagal manoeuvres. Syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine school physical activities including recreational sports participation are&#xD;
      allowed.Much more caution needs to be exercised in those participating in competitive&#xD;
      athletics and high-speed or contact sports. Guidelines issued by the American Heart&#xD;
      Association recommend the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic athletes with structurally normal hearts and exercise-induced Supraventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia prevented by medical treatment can participate in all competitive sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Athletes who have had successful transcatheter ablation and are asymptomatic with no&#xD;
      inducible arrhythmia can return to full competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal supraventricular tachycardia It accounts for 60%-80% of fetal tachyarrhythmias, with&#xD;
      prevalence ranging from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 25,000 pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation is variable. Intermittent Supraventricular tachycardia may have no&#xD;
      hemodynamic effect, while persistent Supraventricular tachycardia may result in fetal hydrops&#xD;
      due to high-output cardiac failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of developing hydrops is related to the age of the fetus (the younger is more&#xD;
      susceptible) and duration of Supraventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis is made by fetal echocardiography using M mode and Doppler. Treatment is&#xD;
      transplacental therapy with anti-arrhythmics such as digoxin and flecainide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of structural heart disease or cardiomyopathy, the prognosis of&#xD;
      Supraventricular tachycardia is excellent.&#xD;
