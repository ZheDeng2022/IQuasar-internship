      The study will enroll patients with prior IO therapy (alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or in combination with other IO agents) regardless of the PD-L1 level, into a&#xD;
      non-randomized combination trial, with primary endpoint of disease control rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapeutic treatment with check-point inhibitors has increased survival in patients&#xD;
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not have any mutation to be&#xD;
      targeted. However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of&#xD;
      mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety&#xD;
      of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking&#xD;
      2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of&#xD;
      VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a&#xD;
      modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2&#xD;
      inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and&#xD;
      may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and&#xD;
      ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor&#xD;
      ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional&#xD;
      benefit of tolerable toxicities.&#xD;
