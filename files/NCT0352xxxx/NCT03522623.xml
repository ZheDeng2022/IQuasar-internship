    <textblock>
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. A recent Canadian study from found that Canada&#xD;
      has amongst highest incidence rates of childhood-onset IBD (10 per 100,000 for children&#xD;
      &lt;16y). In 2012, Crohn's and Colitis Canada estimated that direct medical costs of IBD in&#xD;
      Canada were &gt;$1 billion, and estimated indirect costs amounting to $1.8 billion. An American&#xD;
      study demonstrated the direct costs of caring for children with IBD was double those for&#xD;
      adults. Indirect health care costs in children with IBD have not been well-described. The&#xD;
      Canadian Gastro-Intestinal Epidemiology Consortium (CanGIEC) is a pan-Canadian network of new&#xD;
      and established IBD clinician-researchers and methodologists from 6 provinces experienced in&#xD;
      the use of health administrative data. CanGIEC is evaluating variation in care of children&#xD;
      with IBD, and will expand this research stream to assess direct and indirect cost of care.&#xD;
      This will involve a collaboration with the CIHR/CHILD Foundation Canadian Children IBD&#xD;
      Network (CIDsCaNN), which comprises an inception cohort of children diagnosed at all 12&#xD;
      pediatric IBD centres across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Direct health costs are dominated by medication expenses (particularly&#xD;
      biologics), with resulting variation within and across provinces in costs and out-of-pocket&#xD;
      expenses to the families due to coverage disparity. Indirect costs include school and&#xD;
      parental absenteeism, and productivity losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the cost of care of children with IBD, incurred by caregivers,across Canada.&#xD;
           Costs include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a Indirect costs - costs to the patient or family related to having the disease but not&#xD;
           to direct health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Out of pocket (OOP) - costs paid in cash or credit for health-related expenses not&#xD;
           covered by the public health or private insurance systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the sociodemographic and disease characteristics associated with higher costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Incident cases of IBD (&lt;16y) over 12 months (est. enrollment 250-300).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect and OOP disease-related costs will be determined with surveys conducted one year&#xD;
      following diagnosis and every 6mo for 2y. These will be conducted querying families on the&#xD;
      preceding 4 weeks including: school and work days missed, out-of-pocket expenses, distance&#xD;
      travelled to appointments, medications expenses incurred, and disability benefits collected.&#xD;
      Indirect costs will be calculated using the Human Capital Approach (gross income not earned&#xD;
      due to disease).&#xD;

      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the Indirect and out of pocket costs of care of children with IBD, incurred by&#xD;
           caregivers, funders, and the health system. Costs include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Indirect costs - all costs related to the patient having the disease but not&#xD;
                related to direct health care costs. These include those paid by the patient,&#xD;
                family, insurance system, and public funding. These include but are not limited to&#xD;
                the costs of lost productivity hours due to missed work, missed school and&#xD;
                volunteering activities, employment or disability insurance costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Out of pocket (OOP) costs - those paid by the patient or family of the patient in&#xD;
                cash or credit for healthcare related expenses that are not covered by the public&#xD;
                health or insurance systems. These include but are not limited to medication&#xD;
                dispensing fees, parking costs for medical appointments, travel expenses for&#xD;
                medical appointments, special diet, alternative health treatments, and any other&#xD;
                incurred disease-related costs such as educational books and donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the sociodemographic and disease characteristics associated with higher costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of disorders characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with remissions and relapses. The two most common&#xD;
      subtypes are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The incidence of IBD appears&#xD;
      to have risen over the last twenty years especially in the pediatric population.1-4 IBD is&#xD;
      often diagnosed in the second or third decades of life, and therefore can impact both&#xD;
      patients' social functioning and wellbeing, but also the family unit.. In addition, the fact&#xD;
      that patients are most frequently diagnosed while in school or soon after, can result in&#xD;
      significant cost to both the health system and to the economy. In 2012, the burden-of-illness&#xD;
      report from the Crohn's and Colitis Canada estimated that the direct medical costs of IBD in&#xD;
      Canada were over one billion dollars, primarily funded through the Canadian public healthcare&#xD;
      system.1 While many international studies examined IBD-related costs in adults, information&#xD;
      on direct and indirect health care costs resulting from a childhood diagnosis of IBD is not&#xD;
      readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the Canadian Literature in Adult IBD: Members of our group investigated the direct&#xD;
      hospital costs from the payer perspective for a cohort of 187 CD and 115 UC adult patients at&#xD;
      a tertiary care hospital in Manitoba, in 1994-1995. The mean cost of hospital admission per&#xD;
      medical case was C$2571 (95% CI, C$1801-C$3340) for CD and C$2186 (95% CI, C$1449-C$2922) for&#xD;
      UC. The mean cost per hospitalized surgical case was higher, with C$3427 (95% CI,&#xD;
      C$2728-C$4126) for CD and C$4635 (95% CI, C$3549-C$5726) for UC. Using the median values per&#xD;
      hospitalized patient, the medical cost was C$1664 for CD and C$1262 for UC; the surgical cost&#xD;
      was C$2546 for CD and C$3341 for UC. Surgery accounted for 50% of all hospital admissions,&#xD;
      58% of all hospital days, and 61% of all costs.5 The same investigators used administrative&#xD;
      data to estimate health care utilization in adults with IBD in Manitoba. They concluded that&#xD;
      the first 2 years from disease diagnosis were the most costly in terms of health care&#xD;
      utilization.6 Longobardi et al examined indirect costs in the form of work loss related to&#xD;
      IBD. Approximately 29% of adults with IBD reported labor force non-participation. The&#xD;
      investigators estimated IBD-related indirect costs attributable to nonparticipation in 1998&#xD;
      to be over C$104 million.7 In another study from Manitoba, an acceptable concordance between&#xD;
      patient-reported and administrative data-driven health care utilization.8 A high rate of&#xD;
      concordance was also reported in a recent study from the Netherlands.9 This specific question&#xD;
      of self-reported versus health records-reported health care utilization has never been&#xD;
      examined in pediatric IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population-based surveillance cohort from Alberta examined predictors of costs for adults&#xD;
      with UC who were hospitalized for a flare or colectomy between 2001 and 2009. Median&#xD;
      hospitalization cost for UC flare, emergent colectomy and elective colectomy were: C$5,499,&#xD;
      C$23,698 and C$14,316, respectively. Adjusted hospitalization costs increased approximately&#xD;
      6% annually. Use of infliximab was an independent predictor of increased costs.10 Economic&#xD;
      data for a small adult sample hospitalized for Crohn's disease in Alberta, assessed costs two&#xD;
      years before and after infliximab therapy. Total health care resource use and direct health&#xD;
      care costs were compared for patients with or without fistulae. In the year following&#xD;
      initiation of infliximab therapy, there were significant decreases in health care use,&#xD;
      reflected in total hospital days, inpatient and outpatient colonoscopies and major&#xD;
      surgeries.11 Review of Pediatric IBD Research: Using a collection of American HMO&#xD;
      administrative data, Kappelman et al described the healthcare utilization and direct costs&#xD;
      associated with IBD in insured American children and adults with IBD. Overall, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization was higher in children with IBD compared to adults and in patients with CD&#xD;
      compared to those with UC. Mean annual direct health costs for CD and UC were US$8,265 and&#xD;
      US$5,066 respectively. In children, direct costs were approximately double that of .12 In a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study Sin et al estimated the out of pocket (OOP) costs in parents of 150&#xD;
      children with IBD in California through surveys. Over 28% of those parents estimated their&#xD;
      annual OOP costs to be more than US$1,000. Uncontrolled, severe, and frequently relapsing IBD&#xD;
      correlated with higher OOP costs.13 In another retrospective cross-sectional analysis from&#xD;
      Canterbury, New Zealand, the annual total costs per patient for pediatric CD were NZ$14,375&#xD;
      with direct and indirect costs comprising NZ$12,583 and NZ$1,792, respectively. Based on&#xD;
      these data, the investigators estimated the annual total direct and indirect costs of CD&#xD;
      across New Zealand to be approximately NZ$25.9 million.14 In a single center study, Wu et al,&#xD;
      examined non-drug costs associated with outpatient infliximab infusions in children with IBD.&#xD;
      The total annual drug cost was approximately $393,000 in 2011. For direct costs related to&#xD;
      infliximab infusions, more than 77% of the total health care costs were related to personnel&#xD;
      (e.g., nursing), facility operations, and laboratory costs. Only 23% of the total costs were&#xD;
      related to the actual infliximab drug costs.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In its 2012 report on the burden of IBD in Canada, Crohn's and Canada estimated that direct&#xD;
      medical costs for IBD were C$1.2 billion, and that indirect costs were C$1.6 billion.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the total annual costs for IBD in Canada were approximately C$2.8 billion. It is&#xD;
      well-recognized that IBD causes significant financial burden on the economy, which is likely&#xD;
      rising due to increased prevalence of the disease and the increasing use of high-cost&#xD;
      biologic medications. Disease-related costs in Canadian children with IBD have never been&#xD;
      studied. Therefore, we will conduct a national Canadian study examining IBD-related health&#xD;
      costs, a crucial step to plan for proper allocation of resources and for future health&#xD;
      services for Canadian children with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort of recently developed CIHR/CHILD Foundation Canadian Children IBD Network&#xD;
      (CIDsCaNN) includes about 1000 IBD patients. This network comprises 12 pediatric IBD centres&#xD;
      across Canada tasked with the creation of an inception cohort of all children diagnosed with&#xD;
      IBD. Biological and clinical information, including medication utilization, disease phenotype&#xD;
      and disease severity is collected, with longitudinal follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Population: Incident cases of pediatric IBD (&lt;17y) in (CIDsCaNN) centres enrolled over&#xD;
      a 12 month period or after (estimated enrollment 250-300 over a period of 12 months).&#xD;
      Patients will be expected to be followed for a minimum of 2 years Study Design: A prospective&#xD;
      cohort study will be conducted to determine disease-related costs using a series of&#xD;
      cross-sectional surveys (Appendix). Surveys will be conducted at 6-18 months following the&#xD;
      diagnosis then every 6 months for 2 years through the CIDsCaNN web portal, querying families&#xD;
      on activity in the 4 weeks prior to the survey: school (patient) and work (parents) days&#xD;
      missed, out-of-pocket expenses, distance travelled to care appointments, medications expenses&#xD;
      incurred, and disability benefits collected. If participants are unable to complete the&#xD;
      survey online, research assistant will give them the survey in a paper format to be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of costs covered: The survey will collect direct (6 months period), indirect and OOP&#xD;
      costs in the 4 weeks preceding the survey (4 surveys over the study period) Indirect and OOP&#xD;
      costs will be calculated in Canadian dollars, and adjusted for inflation using an appropriate&#xD;
      inflationary measure (such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)). Indirect costs will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Human Capital Approach (gross income not earned due to disease).20 All&#xD;
      costs will be adjusted for inflation using an inflationary measure such as CPI for health and&#xD;
      personal care, by province (March 2016) 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of increased costs will be determined, with variables assessed to include: gender,&#xD;
      age, pediatric IBD centre, family income, parents level of education, region of residence,&#xD;
      disease duration, disease phenotype using Paris modification of Montreal classification,&#xD;
      clinical activity at diagnosis and one year after diagnosis as measured by pediatric Crohn's&#xD;
      activity index for CD (PCDAI) and pediatric UC activity index for UC (PUCAI), and adherence&#xD;
      to IBD medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be reported as means with standard&#xD;
      deviations (SD), medians with interquartile range (IQR), or proportions where appropriate.&#xD;
      Two-part models will be estimated, in which the likelihood of incurring any expenditures and&#xD;
      the natural logarithm of conditional expenditures will be estimated separately by logistic&#xD;
      and ordinary least-squares models.&#xD;
