    <textblock>
      Recent global burden of disease analysis of DALYs, showed that dietary risk have the highest&#xD;
      DALYs in ischemic stroke among behavioral risk factors. The MediDiet is associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of total mortality as well as stroke incidence and mortality. Although not&#xD;
      part of the classical Mediterranean diet they are another nutrient-dense source of MUFA, rich&#xD;
      in vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols extensively consumed in the&#xD;
      Americas. Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease cholesterol levels in diabetic and&#xD;
      obese patients. Secondary stroke prevention studies with diet as an intervention are lacking&#xD;
      and there is little information of what patients eat before or after an ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Lowering Low Density Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases stroke recurrence. The aim is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of a Mediterranean style diet based on Avocados on lipid profile&#xD;
      particularly LDL-C in patients who have had an ischemic stroke and are at high recurrence&#xD;
      risk.Methodology: Academic, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design), clinical&#xD;
      trial. Participants will be patients with an acute ischemic stroke admitted to Clínica&#xD;
      Alemana de Santiago, who fulfills the eligibility criteria. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either diet intervention in a 1:1 ratio. The interventions will be: A)&#xD;
      Avocado based Mediterranean diet with intake of ½ portion of a Hass avocado per day and B)&#xD;
      Standard recommendation of low fat-high complex carbohydrate diet recommended by the National&#xD;
      Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association. The main efficacy outcome&#xD;
      will be the level of plasma LDL-C level at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be changes in: Levels of serum lipid profile, serum inflammation markers,&#xD;
      glycemic control, anthropomorphic measures, stroke recurrence, cardiovascular events, adverse&#xD;
      events, compliance. A sample size of 100 patients per group (200 in total) was estimated to&#xD;
      provide 80% power and 5% level of significance with 10% loss and 5% crossover to detect the&#xD;
      same difference in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention in patients with acute stroke. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that an Avocado based Mediterranean diet will significantly reduce&#xD;
      levels of LDL-cholesterol at 3 months in patients who have suffered a recent acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke compared to the standard diet.&#xD;

      Introduction: Stroke is the second cause of death and the third of years of life lost&#xD;
      worldwide. In Chile, stroke is the second cause of death. Ischemic stroke represents roughly&#xD;
      80% of all strokes. The 11 risk factors responsible for 91.8% of the population attributable&#xD;
      risk of ischemic stroke are: Age, Blood Pressure ≥140/90mmHg, smoking, waist to hip ratio,&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus, physical activity, alcohol intake, psychosocial factors, Apo-lipoproteins,&#xD;
      Cardiac causes and noteworthy a healthy diet (35.8% of the population attributable risk).&#xD;
      Recent global burden of disease analysis of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), showed&#xD;
      that dietary risk have the highest DALYs in ischemic stroke among behavioral risk factors.&#xD;
      The MediDiet is associated with a decreased risk of total mortality as well as stroke&#xD;
      incidence and mortality. Although not part of the classical Mediterranean diet they are&#xD;
      another nutrient-dense source of mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), rich in vitamins,&#xD;
      minerals, fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols extensively consumed in the Americas.&#xD;
      Avocado-substituted diets significantly decrease cholesterol levels in diabetic and obese&#xD;
      patients. Secondary stroke prevention studies with diet as an intervention are lacking and&#xD;
      there is very little information of what patients eat before or after an ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Recurrent stroke represent 20% of all ischemic strokes at a population level and depending on&#xD;
      the etiology, recurrent stroke can occur from 2 to 20% at 3 months of the initial event.&#xD;
      Lowering Low Density Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreases stroke recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: The aim is to determine the effect of a Mediterranean style diet based on Avocados as&#xD;
      a source of poli unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on lipid profile particularly LDL-C in&#xD;
      patients who have had an ischemic stroke and are at high recurrence risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Academic, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      open-blinded end-point [PROBE design]), clinical trial. Participants will be patients with an&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke admitted to Clínica Alemana de Santiago, who fulfills the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either diet intervention in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The interventions will be: A) Avocado based Mediterranean diet with intake of ½&#xD;
      portion of a Hass avocado per day and B) Standard recommendation of low fat-high complex&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American&#xD;
      Heart Association. The main efficacy outcome will be the level of plasma LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      level at 3 months of the dietary intervention. Secondary outcomes will be changes in: Levels&#xD;
      of serum lipid profile, serum inflammation markers, glycemic control, anthropomorphic&#xD;
      measures of the metabolic syndrome, stroke recurrence, cardiovascular events, adverse events,&#xD;
      compliance. A sample size of 100 patients per group (200 in total) was estimated to provide&#xD;
      80% power and 5% level of significance with 10% loss and 5% crossover to detect the same&#xD;
      difference in LDL-C after 3 months of intervention in patients with acute stroke. The&#xD;
      following measurements will be performed at baseline and at 3 months in all patients: Blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, height, waist circumference, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, glucose&#xD;
      level, serum insulin level, Apo- lipoproteins A1 and B levels, soluble intercellular adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, Apo lipoproteins A and B, and interleukin-6&#xD;
      levels; In a random sample of participants (35%), investigators will measure the oleic acid&#xD;
      plasma content as a measure of adherence to Avocado intake.&#xD;
