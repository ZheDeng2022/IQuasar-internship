    <textblock>
      The Effectiveness of the Jamboxx Respiratory Therapy Device in Treatment of Patients with&#xD;
      Decreased Respiratory Function is a proposal for investigation of the application of gaming&#xD;
      to improving respiratory health. The Jamboxx device combines gaming with traditional&#xD;
      incentive spirometry to provide users with a fun experience to keep them engaged in their&#xD;
      respiratory therapy routine. The device allows users to play a series of mini-games that walk&#xD;
      them through their routines. The Jamboxx also records airflow and lung parameters with an&#xD;
      external mouthpiece attachment to provide users with real time feedback, and helps to assess&#xD;
      increases or decreases in relative lung function over time. The Jamboxx has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly impact the field of respiratory therapy by being one of the first gaming&#xD;
      devices for patient therapy, and the first respiratory therapy gaming device that is&#xD;
      accessible to users with limited mobility. Jamboxx provides a fun and engaging, low cost&#xD;
      alternative to the traditional therapy techniques used and aims to improve patient&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses the ongoing challenge of clearing the burden of bronchial secretions&#xD;
      resulting from cystic fibrosis. These patients are dependent upon mechanical devices to help&#xD;
      clear secretions. A device autonomous means for clearing secretions is well defined in the&#xD;
      literature (autogenic drainage) but is difficult to learn. This study proposes to teach&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis patients to master autogenic drainage, and seeks to determine at what age it&#xD;
      can be taught. As it would be expected that gaming could easily teach adults this procedure,&#xD;
      the study will include children for whom learning autogenic drainage based upon&#xD;
      conceptualization would be expected to be very difficult.&#xD;

      Testing Plan: Children will be randomized into one of two groups via a random number&#xD;
      generation software program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (education &amp; gaming): Children will participate in 1 initial training session at&#xD;
      Albany Med where they will be taught by a respiratory therapist (RT) to use autogenic&#xD;
      drainage: a series of controlled breathing exercises that mobilizes mucous without inducing&#xD;
      wheezing in patients with reactive airways. Patients will be sent home and prescribed to&#xD;
      practice the autogenic draining technique 15 minutes three times per week. At week 8 +/- 1&#xD;
      week patients will return for study visits and will be tested by a software program designed&#xD;
      to evaluate their ability to perform autogenic drainage sequence (percent accuracy). This&#xD;
      will be done through a software program installed on the device that uses a series of&#xD;
      calibration breaths to fit a curve that models the individual patient's idealized autogenic&#xD;
      drainage sequence, then maps their actual performance to this curve and calculates a percent&#xD;
      accuracy. At the 8 week visit, the Jamboxx gaming device will be introduced through a&#xD;
      training session with a RT, which will contain a game to guide them through the proper&#xD;
      sequence of breathing for the autogenic draining technique. Patients will be sent home with a&#xD;
      Jamboxx device and requested to do 15 minutes of autogenic drainage training three times a&#xD;
      week. Patients will return for a research visits at week 16 and again will be tested via&#xD;
      software program for ability to perform the autogenic drainage technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (gaming only): Children will participate in an initial training session at Albany Med&#xD;
      where they will be taught by a RT to use Jamboxx respiratory thearpy device to guide them&#xD;
      through autogenic drainage: a series of controlled breathing exercises that mobilizes mucous&#xD;
      without inducing wheezing in patients with reactive airways. Patients will be sent home and&#xD;
      prescribed to use the Jamboxx respiratory therapy device 15 minutes three times per week. At&#xD;
      week 8 and week 16 +/- 1 week patients will return for study visits and will be tested by a&#xD;
      software program designed to evaluate their ability to perform autogenic drainage sequence&#xD;
      (percent accuracy). This will be done through a software program installed on the device that&#xD;
      uses a series of calibration breaths to fit a curve that models the individual patient's&#xD;
      idealized autogenic drainage sequence, then maps their actual performance to this curve and&#xD;
      calculates a percent accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol does not replace prescribed chest physiotherapy. There is no alteration of the&#xD;
      standard of care beyond 15 minutes of autogenic drainage three times per week. Demographic&#xD;
      data (age, gender, ethnicity) will be collected. Medical records will be evaluated for&#xD;
      relevant health history, medication use, and hospitalizations including dates.&#xD;

Beginning in week 8, they will be taught to use autogenic draining technique guided by a videogame through the Jamboxx respiratory therapy device and will be advised to perform the technique regularly using the game for guidance through week 16 Participants in group B will be taught to perform the autogenic draining technique using the Jamboxx respiratory therapy guided by a videogame in week 0, and will be instructed to perform the technique regularly for the next 16 weeks using the game for guidance</intervention_model_description>
