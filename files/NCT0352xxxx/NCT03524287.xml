  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical Efficacy of robotic assisted&#xD;
      spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for patients with locally advanced upper third&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma（cT2-4a, N-/+, M0）.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of No. 10 lymph node metastasis is high in advanced proximal gastric cancer,&#xD;
      reported to range from 9.8%-20.9%, and the presence of No. 10 lymph node metastasis is&#xD;
      closely related to survival. Therefore, in East Asia, D2 lymph node dissection of potentially&#xD;
      curable locally advanced upper third gastric cancer including No. 10 lymph node is the&#xD;
      standard surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming&#xD;
      the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive&#xD;
      procedures. However, it remains a controversial international issue if it is safe and&#xD;
      feasible to conduct robotic assisted spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for&#xD;
      advanced upper third gastric cancer. There is no prospective study to identify the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is through a prospective, open, single-arm study,to explore the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of the robotic assisted spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection in the treatment of&#xD;
      locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma （cT2-4a, N-/+, M0）.&#xD;
