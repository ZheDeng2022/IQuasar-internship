    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of routine dinner time versus late dinner time on nocturnal&#xD;
      metabolism. Specifically, investigators will examine plasma profiles of free fatty acids,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and oxidation of dietary fat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an epidemic contributing to significant global morbidity and mortality. More than&#xD;
      simply being a manifestation of excessive eating, obesity and metabolic syndrome may also be&#xD;
      the consequence of inappropriate timing of food intake. Specifically, eating more calories&#xD;
      later in the day contributes to greater weight gain and metabolic syndrome. The mechanism by&#xD;
      which later eating harms metabolism is not fully understood. Meal digestion, absorption, and&#xD;
      oxidation can be influenced by circadian rhythm and sleep/wake status. Sleep induces a&#xD;
      regulated decrease in metabolic rate, which would be expected to impair the oxidation of&#xD;
      ingested fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that eating dinner at 10 PM, close to sleep time (11 PM), compared&#xD;
      to usual time (6 PM) will lead to impaired nocturnal metabolic profile and reduced fatty acid&#xD;
      oxidation of ingested fat. Investigators will test this hypothesis in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      study comparing routine dinner (RD) to late dinner (LD) on the nocturnal metabolic profile,&#xD;
      and assess oxidation of ingested fat using a stable isotope tracer. If investigators can&#xD;
      demonstrate that nocturnal metabolic profile and oxidation of exogenous fat is affected by&#xD;
      timing of dinner, investigators can target these pathways for combating obesity and related&#xD;
      metabolic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a randomized cross-over study of RD versus LD on overnight&#xD;
      metabolic function in healthy volunteers. Subjects will report to the Bayview Asthma and&#xD;
      Allergy center for screening and consent. If participants provide written informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a history and physical examination. Each participant will come to&#xD;
      the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 2 visits (RD or LD), each comprised of 2 consecutive&#xD;
      nights (acclimation night, then study night). The RD and LD visit will be spaced about 3-4&#xD;
      weeks apart, and occur in random order to allow washout of effects and tracer. To account for&#xD;
      potential metabolic effects of menstrual cycles, women will studied at the same phase of&#xD;
      their menstrual cycle (visits will be ~4 weeks apart). Participants will not have any routine&#xD;
      care or current therapy discontinued to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General visit schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the two visits (3-4 weeks apart) is comprised of two consecutive nights as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: Evening admission to the CRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Night 1: Sleep in the CRU without monitoring (acclimation night)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2: Standardized meals and stable isotope ingestion with either RD or LD, IV sampling&#xD;
           (every 60 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Night 2: Sleep in the CRU with Polysomnograph (PSG) and IV sampling (every 60 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3: Standardized breakfast, IV sampling (every 60 min), discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to CRU arrival: For 3 days prior to each CRU admission, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      keep to a regular sleep-wake cycle, rising at 07:00 h and sleeping at 23:00 and eating 3&#xD;
      meals a day with dinner no later than 19:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 + Night 1: Subjects will undergo a brief history and physical examination. (This can&#xD;
      occur on a day remote from admission to the CRU, or on the same afternoon as CRU admission.)&#xD;
      At 20:00 subjects will report to the clinical research unit and undergo anthropometric&#xD;
      assessment including weight, height, neck, and waist circumference. Participants will be&#xD;
      expected to have finished dinner by the time of arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night 1: Subjects will be provided with a private room in the CRU sleep. Lights will be&#xD;
      turned off at 23:00 and turned on at 07:00 the next morning. This is an acclimation night; no&#xD;
      polysomnographic monitoring will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 + Night 2: Subjects will be awakened at 7:00 AM. Subjects can engage in sedentary&#xD;
      activities in the CRU, but participants will not be permitted to sleep or engage in&#xD;
      aggressive exercise. Participants will be given four standard meals at 08:00, 13:00, 18:00,&#xD;
      and 22:00. The kilocalorie content of each meal, as a percentage of the total daily intake,&#xD;
      is shown in the table below and depends on whether participants are under RD or LD conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each meal will have a macronutrient composition of approximately 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat,&#xD;
      and 20% protein, but the final diet will be formulated with Institute for Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Research (ICTR) services to reflect typical western diet patterns. Two&#xD;
      peripheral IV's will be placed for blood sampling during sleep, with one as a backup in case&#xD;
      of failure of one IV. IV tubing will be extended to an adjacent control room so that blood&#xD;
      samples can be obtained without disturbing the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable Isotope ingestion: Investigators use a validated technique to quantify differences in&#xD;
      fatty acid oxidation (FAO) by providing an oral liquid dose of 15 mg/kg body mass of&#xD;
      [2H31]palmitate taken with dinner (18:00 on RD night, or 22:00 on LD night). The isotope is&#xD;
      dissolved in a warm (60 °C) liquid shake (milk or other emulsifiers) which is provided as a&#xD;
      beverage with dinner. FAO will be quantified thereafter by hourly assessment of deuterium&#xD;
      incorporation into plasma 2H2O using an isotope ratio MS (IR/MS), eliminating the need for&#xD;
      exhaled Carbondioxide (CO2) collection, Variability of Carbondioxide consumption (VCO2)&#xD;
      assessment, or acetate correction required with carbon-labeled fatty acid tracers. Subjects&#xD;
      will also ingest 0.4 g/kg body mass of H218O so that the total body water volume can be&#xD;
      calculated according to the method of Schoeller and van Santen. The FAO rate will be&#xD;
      determined by excess plasma 2H times total body water, while percent recovery of deuterium&#xD;
      will be determined by dividing by dose of 2H administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night 2: On each study night from 23:00 until 07:00, a PSG will be performed. The sleep study&#xD;
      will include electroencephalography, electrooculography, oxygenation, and respiratory effort.&#xD;
      Respiratory effort will be measured by thoracoabdominal movement assessed by mercury strain&#xD;
      gauges. Surface electrodes will be placed at C3A2 and C3O1, a submental electrode, and left&#xD;
      and right electro-oculogram will be used to stage sleep. Electrocardiograph (EKG) tracings&#xD;
      will be recorded from three chest electrodes. Continuous measurement of oxygen saturation&#xD;
      will be recorded using an ear oximeter (model No 472-1A, Hewlett Packard, Waltham, Mass).&#xD;
      Signals from the electroencephalograph, EKG, electromyogram, electrooculogram, respiratory&#xD;
      strain gauge, ear oximeter and thermistors will be recorded on a computer with RemLogic&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn at 60 minute intervals beginning at 5:00 PM and continuing until&#xD;
      the next day as shown in fig 1, spanning 20 time points. Each blood sample will be 4 cc in&#xD;
      volume and placed into lavender top tubes (EDTA) for centrifugation to obtain plasma. Cells&#xD;
      are removed from plasma by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1500 x using a refrigerated&#xD;
      centrifuge. Following centrifugation, plasma will be transferred to cryovials for storage.&#xD;
      The morning sample at time of final awakening (7:00 AM) will be 12 cc (3 tubes) since&#xD;
      investigators plan additional assays with this sample (lipid panel, inflammatory markers) and&#xD;
      4 cc will be retained as whole blood for future potential analysis. Samples will be frozen at&#xD;
      -80°C for research pertaining to metabolic effects of dinner time, with the consent of&#xD;
      participants. In total, the blood collected will be approximately 88 cc which is much less&#xD;
      than during a blood donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3: Participants will be provided with breakfast of similar composition as on day 2, at&#xD;
      08:00. Metabolic response to the meal will be assessed with 4 hourly additional blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DEXA scan will be used to estimate fat mass, which will be one of the variables analyzed as&#xD;
      a predictor of metabolic responses to altered meal time. Only 1 DEXA scan is required per&#xD;
      participant and can occur during any of the visit days.&#xD;
