    <textblock>
      Background: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the second cause of death worldwide. After&#xD;
      AMI, the heart failure (HF) is a main cause of patient rehospitalization and death. Despite&#xD;
      the total ischemic time of AMI is decreasing in general at present, the incidence of HF after&#xD;
      AMI remains high. The incidence of HF in Switzerland and the United States are 25% and&#xD;
      14-16%, respectively, and the epidemiological statistic of AMI in the past 10 years was&#xD;
      lacking in China, but the rate has been exceeded 22% by conservative estimation. Early&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation quality improvement system has been shown to reduce incidence of&#xD;
      post-infarction HF and improve cardiovascular function. However, early cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      has low proportion and poor quality, which lacks of standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purposes of this quality improvement study are to evaluate a pointed,&#xD;
      two-phase intervention system to improve the proportion and quality of cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation; to standardize the early cardiac rehabilitation procedure to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis among patients with post-infarction HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Including the period I of cardiac rehabilitation, pre-discharge (baseline)&#xD;
      assessment and the period II of cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data analyses are performed using the software package SAS version 9.2&#xD;
      and all tests are 2-sided with P&lt;0.05 denoting statistical significance. Quantitative data&#xD;
      changes between groups which are compared with using the paired Student's t test and Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test according to the data distribution, and categorical data is analyzed by&#xD;
      chi-square test and ranked data is analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. The investigator&#xD;
      compare the incidence of heart failure in early rehabilitation patients between two phases&#xD;
      according to the chi-square test of the rate of two groups, to explore the role of early&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation after AMI in reducing the incidence of HF after AMI.&#xD;

      Study design: After admission, and following clinical and diagnostic evaluation (12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, Doppler echocardiography, symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
      and other related laboratory tests), all patients are discharged in low risk group (ejection&#xD;
      fraction≥50% with AMI single-vessel lesion, emergency vascular recanalization without&#xD;
      complication) and intermediate/high risk group (EF&lt;50%, AMI partial blood transport&#xD;
      reconstruction/multi-branch lesion, combined or uncombined with cardiogenic shock or heart&#xD;
      failure). Researchers will assess inclusion and exclusion criteria, and patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria need provide informed written consent in duplicate. All patients are&#xD;
      enrolled in one I period rehabilitation during hospitalization and II period cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation after discharge according to the different group. After 1 month, 2 months and&#xD;
      6 months, all patients undergo a telephone or outpatient follow-up assessment including&#xD;
      training, smoking, drug usage and nutrient assessment. And after 3 months and 12 months, all&#xD;
      patients undergo an outpatient follow-up assessment by 6-minute walking test and/or&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test and three psychological scales (SF-12， GAD-7 and PHQ-9),&#xD;
      besides the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period I of cardiac rehabilitation: Patients who provide informed consents should assess&#xD;
      indications and contraindications at first. The indications are: 1) no new emerging/repeated&#xD;
      chest pain in 8 hours; 2) no further increase in the level of cardiac markers or cardiac&#xD;
      enzymes (creatine kinase and troponin); 3) no obvious sign of decompensation of heart failure&#xD;
      (the resting breath is difficult, combined with moist rale); 4) no new malignant arrhythmias&#xD;
      or new electrocardiogram ischemic changes in the last 8 hours. The contraindications are: 1)&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability or resting angina pectoris; 2) uncontrollable arrhythmia; 3) unable&#xD;
      to rehabilitation due to disability or disease sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period I of cardiac rehabilitation for low risk group is divided into five phases and&#xD;
      each phase has three parts. The three parts are daily life (from complete rest in bed, low&#xD;
      fat liquid diet to partly provided for themselves, low fat and semi-liquid diet to basically&#xD;
      provided for themselves, low fat diet), rehabilitation exercise training (from passive joint&#xD;
      exercises in bed to stand by bed and walk) and publicity and education (including&#xD;
      introduction about cardiovascular intensive care unit, rehabilitation procedure, smoking&#xD;
      cessation, risk factors of coronary heart disease, etc.). The period I of cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation for intermediate/high risk group is divided into seven phases and each phase&#xD;
      has three parts as well as the low risk group, but each part is more cautious than low-risk&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-discharge (baseline) assessment: One day before discharge, researchers should complete&#xD;
      the assessment about patients who completed I period cardiac rehabilitation and fill in the&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation quality feedback form. The assessments are as follows: 1) medical&#xD;
      history assessment: recording patient medical history (coronary heart disease, hypertension,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, and/or peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc.); 2) physical&#xD;
      examination: recording the heart rate, blood pressure and respiration of patients; checking&#xD;
      whether there are engorgements of the neck veins, lung rale, cardiac souffle, arrhythmias and&#xD;
      dropsy, etc; 3) accessory examination: recording the latest electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      echocardiographic results); 4) nutrition assessment: assessing whether the patient is on&#xD;
      high-fat diet or (and) high-salt diet and obese, setting a target weight based on BMI; 5)&#xD;
      smoking assessment: assessing smoking status and let patients fill out the Fagerstrom test&#xD;
      for nicotine dependence (FTND); 6) psychological assessment: let patients fill out the SF-12,&#xD;
      GAD-7 and PHQ-9; 7) motor assessment: recording the maximum exercise load, the changes of&#xD;
      heart rate and blood pressure from resting to maximum exercise load and rehabilitation&#xD;
      process, terminal symptoms (angina and electrocardiogram abnormality), peak oxygen uptake,&#xD;
      anaerobic threshold and alveolar air volume/carbon dioxide slope, through cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test; 8) drug assessment: assessing and recording the name, dosage and usage of the&#xD;
      drug; 9) adverse event assessment: assessing whether the patient with new or recurrent heart&#xD;
      cerebral vascular disease, death and other adverse events when hospitalization, this part&#xD;
      should be filled in the adverse event table; 10) Matters needing attention: Informing the&#xD;
      patient or his family of precautions during the rehabilitation procedure and marking the&#xD;
      doctor's contact number in the informed consent form, any hospitalization, reinfarction, or&#xD;
      death should be immediately notified to the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period II of cardiac rehabilitation: This period should last three months after discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. Exercise rehabilitation is based on aerobic exercise, and combined with&#xD;
      resistance and flexibility exercises, including warm-up period (5-10 minutes), training&#xD;
      period (20-40 minutes) and cool-down period (at least 5 minutes). Aerobic training should&#xD;
      begin from discharge, at least 3 times per week and resistance training should begin in at&#xD;
      least five weeks after AMI, 1 time per week at first. In addition, researchers should provide&#xD;
      counseling about living habit and drug taking. Psychological counseling would be given to&#xD;
      patients who have anxiety or depression.&#xD;
