    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of fMRI-targeted repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of depressive symptoms in service&#xD;
      members with a history of concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to ninety participants will be randomized to active or sham treatment. Participants&#xD;
      randomized into the active group will receive 20 sessions of left-sided dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) high-frequency rTMS, followed by right-sided DLFPC low-frequency&#xD;
      rTMS. The DLPFC treatment area will be identified by using individual subject-level resting&#xD;
      state network estimation (Hacker et al., 2013). Participants randomized into the sham&#xD;
      treatment group will receive 20 sham treatments designed to have similar sound and tactile&#xD;
      sensation, without producing active treatment. Participants will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      regular follow-up evaluations for up to a total of six follow-up sessions. Those who do not&#xD;
      respond to the treatment will have the option to receive active treatment through this study&#xD;
      regardless of group assignment to active or sham.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of individual&#xD;
      connectome-targeted repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (ICT-rTMS) treatment to&#xD;
      enhance the rehabilitation of service members with symptoms of depression and history of&#xD;
      concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-site, double-blinded, sham-controlled, prospective, randomized&#xD;
      interventional trial. Up to ninety participants will be block randomized to active (ICT-rTMS)&#xD;
      or sham treatment. Participants will receive 20 sessions of ICT-rTMS over approximately 5&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and structural MRI will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline to allow for the calculation of connectome-targeted treatment&#xD;
      coordinates and ensure the absence of structural abnormalities. The rsfMRI scan at baseline&#xD;
      will also be used to establish the baseline for the secondary imaging outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sessions will consist of high-frequency left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      stimulation for 4,000 pulses followed by low-frequency right DLPFC stimulation for 1,000&#xD;
      pulses for a total stimulation time of approximately one hour per session. This protocol was&#xD;
      chosen based on a recent meta-analysis (Brunoni et al., 2017) indicating that amongst the&#xD;
      various treatment protocols, priming the low frequency right hemisphere stimulation with a&#xD;
      high frequency left hemisphere stimulation led to the greatest efficacy for treatment of&#xD;
      Major Depressive Episodes. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of the literature in TMS&#xD;
      for depression targets the stimulation to DLPFC and the FDA has approved repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to DLPFC for the treatment of medication-resistant&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be change in depression severity from baseline to post-treatment.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be a comparison between the ICT-rTMS and sham groups. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures utilized will include cognitive, quality of life, and emotional regulation&#xD;
      measures, as well as imaging changes. Additional analyses will include durability of effects&#xD;
      during the 6 months following treatment.&#xD;
