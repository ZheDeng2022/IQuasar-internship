  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomised controlled intervention comparing the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure outcomes following Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) treatment of 180 degrees&#xD;
      SLT compared to 360 degrees in treatment naive patients with bilateral ocular hypertension or&#xD;
      primary open angle glaucoma . The right eye of each patient will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      either 180 or 360 degrees SLT, while the fellow eye will receive the opposite treatment. That&#xD;
      is, if the right eye is randomised to 180 degrees SLT, then the left eye will receive 360&#xD;
      degrees SLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the mean difference in intraocular pressure between two&#xD;
      eyes of each participant. The mean difference in IOP will be assessed at two weeks and at&#xD;
      one, three and six months after treatment with SLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include assessing whether there are differences in visual acuity, anterior&#xD;
      chamber inflammation, visual field progression and the rate of complications between the two&#xD;
      eyes treated with either 180° or 360° of selective laser trabeculoplasty. The complications&#xD;
      assessed are those published in the literature including: pain, blurred vision, anterior&#xD;
      chamber inflammation, IOP spike, and hyphaema. Additionally, participants will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to report symptoms experienced through free text.&#xD;

      Potential patients will be identified by the Principal Investigator during a clinic visit.&#xD;
      Pre-screening criteria is carried out by the co-investigator or the research co-ordinator.&#xD;
      General eligibility criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied. The Research&#xD;
      Co-ordinator approaches the patient and the SLT laser study is discussed with the patient.&#xD;
      The patient is provided the Information Sheet and advised to contact the Research Coordinator&#xD;
      if they wish to proceed. Informed consent is obtained if the patient wishes to proceed.&#xD;
      Baseline data is collected and the right eye is randomised with the fellow eye to receive non&#xD;
      randomised treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLT is performed in both eyes (180 degrees in 1 eye + 360 degrees in the fellow eye) during&#xD;
      an office visit. IOP in both eyes is checked and recorded at one hour post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient returns for follow up at two weeks post SLT treatment visit. A complete ocular&#xD;
      examination, including IOP, is undertaken. Complications and adverse events are assessed and&#xD;
      recorded. Any change to eyedrops is recorded. Patients return at one, three and six months&#xD;
      for review, and the same assessment as above is undertaken at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolling is complete when 48 patients are enrolled. Patients are advised enrolling is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis is undertaken to assess the mean change in IOP between the two&#xD;
      treatments. Complications and adverse events are each treatment group are recorded. The study&#xD;
      is submitted for publication and written communication is provided to each enrolled patient.&#xD;
