  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect prospective cohort data of individuals that are undergoing routine&#xD;
      clinical care for suspected idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). The&#xD;
      administration of the Conner's Continual Performance Test - version 3 (CPT-3), an automated&#xD;
      14-minute computerized measure of reaction-time and sustained attention, will be added to the&#xD;
      current neurocognitive screen being used (i.e., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA)&#xD;
      along with gait assessment. Patients will undergo pre-tap testing on the morning of their&#xD;
      large volume Lumbar Puncture (CSF-TT). These patients will receive post-tap CPT-3 and MoCA&#xD;
      testing one-to-three hours post-tap, and again at 2-3 days post-CSF-TT, during the follow-up&#xD;
      appointment in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard NPH quantitative assessment methods of MoCA and gait evaluation will continue to&#xD;
      be collected. For those patients that ultimately undergo ventricular shunt placement, the&#xD;
      CPT-3 will be administered at their post-operative follow-up appointment (~3 months&#xD;
      post-operation). The results of CPT-3 will not factor into consideration for shunt candidacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a syndrome involving the clinical triad of gait&#xD;
      disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction, in the context of ventricular&#xD;
      enlargement out of proportion to parenchymal atrophy with normal intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1980's, a protocol for quantitative measurement of symptom response to large volume&#xD;
      CSF tap (40-50ml) was developed, as a method for evaluating suitability for undergoing&#xD;
      ventricular shunting surgery. A 2016 systematic review of the literature noted heterogeneous&#xD;
      findings within the eight prospective cohort studies that were included in analysis, but&#xD;
      concluded that there appeared to be support for the CSF-TT as a rule-in screen for response&#xD;
      to shunt placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no extant literature has analyzed the independent predictive power of a&#xD;
      clinically significant reaction time improvement in response to CSF-TT (widely defined across&#xD;
      the literature as 5% improvement) to subsequent response to ventricular shunting. This&#xD;
      frustrates an a priori power analysis. However, a rough estimate was calculated based on data&#xD;
      presented within one of the aforementioned reviewed studies that identified an improvement in&#xD;
      reaction time in response to CSF-TT, as well as an improvement in reaction time to subsequent&#xD;
      shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors reported that 17 of 68 (25%) of the patients were labeled as positive-responders&#xD;
      to CSF-TT, defined as meeting at least 2 of the following criteria: 1) 5% improvement in&#xD;
      reaction time, 2) 5% improvement in gait (time or steps), 3) 25% improvement on visuospatial&#xD;
      recall task, 4) 25% improvement on visuospatial recognition task. Of those 17 positive&#xD;
      responders, 16 (94%) met the same positive-response criteria, post-shunting. If we use a 50%&#xD;
      response rate as a proportion null hypothesis, this gives us a z-statistic = 3.63, or f2 =&#xD;
      3.71. G*Power analysis, for a 4-predictor regression (i.e., the aforementioned indicators&#xD;
      used), estimates a necessary sample size of 16. The primary limitation of this approach is&#xD;
      that it is unclear which of the 2+ positive response criteria were met. However, review of&#xD;
      the pre- versus post-shunting data suggests reaction time was significantly improved&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.001; Cohen's d = 0.399), suggesting it is reasonable to infer the domain was favorably&#xD;
      impacted by the temporary effects of a CSF-TT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo pre-tap testing on the morning of their CSF-TT. The administration of&#xD;
      the Conners Continual Performance Test - version 3 (CPT-3), an automated 14-minute&#xD;
      computerized measure of reaction-time and sustained attention, will be added to the current&#xD;
      neurocognitive screen being used (i.e., the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA). The current&#xD;
      CSF-TT protocol's quantitative methods for measuring urinary incontinence and gait will&#xD;
      continue to be collected. These patients will receive post-tap CPT-3 and MoCA testing&#xD;
      one-to-three hours post-tap, and again at 2-3 days post-CSF-TT, during the follow-up&#xD;
      appointment with Neurosurgery. For those that undergo ventricular shunt placement, the CPT-3&#xD;
      will be administered at their post-operative follow-up appointment (~3 months&#xD;
      post-operation).&#xD;
