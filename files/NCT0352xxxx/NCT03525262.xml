    <textblock>
      Reduction of dose to or 'sparing' of neurovascular structures during stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      body radiotherapy (SAbR) for localized prostate cancer will improve retention of sexual&#xD;
      potency, while retaining excellent oncologic control and other secondary health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQOL) endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the decline in patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument-defined&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction following stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SAbR) with or without&#xD;
      neurovascular sparing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess acute (within 9 months of treatment) and chronic (&gt;9 months after treatment) SAbR&#xD;
           related GU and GI toxicities, as well as serial impact on HRQOL metrics over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess biochemical progression free survival, local recurrence, disease-specific&#xD;
           survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of neurovascular sparing on neurovascular element dose and the&#xD;
           impact of rectal spacer use on neurovascular element sparing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate quality of spacer placement and its effect on dose to neurovascular structures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate rate local recurrence in the area of sparing adjacent to the neurovascular&#xD;
           elements by biopsy in those with biochemical progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate simplified 'practical' secondary HRQOL sexual potency endpoints that can be&#xD;
           compared to prior literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, multi-institution, open-label, patient and HRQOL endpoint&#xD;
      assessor blinded study evaluating the ability of neurovascular element sparing SAbR to&#xD;
      decrease erectile dysfunction. The study procedure is to reduce 2-year Expanded prostate&#xD;
      cancer index composite (EPIC) sexual domain score decline by 50% (-20 to -10), there by&#xD;
      improving potency preservation. This reduction is usually expected to observe in patients&#xD;
      undergoing the treatment stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SAbR) to 40-45 Gy with&#xD;
      rectal spacer +/- sparing of at least one side's neurovascular structures using&#xD;
      dose-painting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The Expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
      instrument includes a sexual function domain, which is used to produce a composite score of&#xD;
      0-100 from 9 questions related to ability to achieve an erection with or without aids and&#xD;
      participate in intercourse. The primary endpoint will be the mean 24-month decline in EPIC&#xD;
      sexual function domain composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute Genitourinary (GU) and Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is defined as grade 1-5&#xD;
           toxicity occurring prior to 270 days from the start of protocol treatment. It is graded&#xD;
           based on CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delayed GU and GI toxicity is defined as grade 1-5 toxicity occurring prior to 270 days&#xD;
           from the start of protocol treatment. It is graded based on CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non GU and GI toxicity up to six months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical failure Radiation therapy oncology group-American Society for Therapeutic&#xD;
           Radiology and Oncology (RTOG-ASTRO) definition (also known as Phoenix definition) -&#xD;
           Thus, when the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) rises by more than 2 ng/ml above the&#xD;
           lowest level (nadir) achieved after treatment, biochemical failure has occurred and the&#xD;
           date of the failure is recorded at the time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml level is reached.&#xD;
           Patients should be followed for a minimum of 5 years on this study to evaluate this&#xD;
           endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease-specific survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical progression including local/regional and distant relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQOL questionnaires for genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and hormonal domains (EPIC and&#xD;
           SF-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosimetric comparison of neurovascular element sparing with rectal spacer on this&#xD;
           protocol versus without spacer in prior SAbR phase I-II protocol treated patients at&#xD;
           UTSW&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosimetric comparison of neurovascular element sparing according to quality of spacer&#xD;
           placement (maximum spacer distance at mid-gland and at apex), as assessed by study P.I.&#xD;
           using simulation MRI images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy positivity in area of dose sparing (i.e. PTV2-PTV1). To be evaluated only those&#xD;
           patients in BCR who merit per clinician judgement a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: To enroll 120 patients (60 patients in each treatment arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated, first, assuming that neurovascular element sparing SAbR&#xD;
      (experimental arm intervention) will result in a mean 24 month decline in EPIC (HRQOL&#xD;
      instrument) sexual domain composite score of -20, as compared to a decline of -10 in a&#xD;
      standard SAbR without neurovascular element sparing. A total sample size of 102 patients (51&#xD;
      patients in each treatment group) achieves 80% power to detect this difference of 10 in EPIC&#xD;
      sexual domain composite score decline at 24 months after treatment, with an equal standard&#xD;
      deviation of 20 in both groups and at a two-sided significance level of 0.10, using a&#xD;
      two-sample t-test (effect size 0.50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attrition rate of EPIC sexual domain questionnaire completion at 2-years of 15% is&#xD;
      anticipated, based upon yields from multi-center prospective trials in prostate cancer&#xD;
      radiotherapy with EPIC HRQOL endpoints. A total of 120 patients will be accrued to account&#xD;
      for this 15% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: For the primary endpoint, a two-sided two-sample t-test will be used to&#xD;
      compare EPIC sexual function domain score composite declines at 24 months from treatment&#xD;
      between experimental SAbR arms with and without neurovascular sparing. Our sample size of 60&#xD;
      patients in each arm gives a calculated 80% power to detect a difference of 10 (considered&#xD;
      the minimally important difference for sexual domain) at a two-sided significance level 0.10,&#xD;
      assuming an equal standard deviation of 20 in both groups and allowing for 15% attrition in&#xD;
      survey completion. Secondary endpoints and their analysis methodology is further specified in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. If DRE is performed, patient may not have palpable disease on side of gland to be&#xD;
             planned for neurovascular sparing. Given the poor accuracy of DRE, such a finding&#xD;
             should be confirmed by MRI and/or biopsy to harbor actual disease before excluding a&#xD;
             patient&#xD;
