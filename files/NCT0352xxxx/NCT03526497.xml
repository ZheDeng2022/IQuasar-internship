      In patients admitted to a coronary care unit, what is the correlation coefficient and limits&#xD;
      of agreement for paired measurements of peripheral venous pressure and central venous&#xD;
      pressure at multiple time points during the patient's hospitalization?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of numerous cardiac conditions requires assessment of intravascular volume&#xD;
      status, using central venous pressure (CVP) as the gold standard. Measurement of CVP requires&#xD;
      placement of an invasive venous catheter, with insertion of a venous catheter into a central&#xD;
      vein to obtain CVP. Catheter placement is invasive, costly and not without complications.&#xD;
      Ideally, there would exist a peripheral surrogate for CVP that would be 1) minimally invasive&#xD;
      to obtain, 2) low cost and 3) strongly correlate with CVP over a wide range of physiological&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral venous system is in continuity with the central venous system and, as such,&#xD;
      would be expected to have a pressure that correlates with central venous pressure. Numerous&#xD;
      previous studies suggest a correlation between peripheral venous pressure (PVP) and central&#xD;
      venous pressure. Prior studies have demonstrated a reasonable correlation between CVP and PVP&#xD;
      in patient populations including decompensated heart failure, cardiac and non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery(1), liver transplant donors(2) and recipients(3), neurosurgical(4) and pediatric&#xD;
      patients.(5) In an earlier study published by the authors of this paper, the mean difference&#xD;
      between PVP and CVP in patients with acute heart failure syndromes was 0.4 mmHg with a&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of 0.947. One limitation of the earlier study was that it established&#xD;
      this correlation at only one point in time. In the study presented here, PVP and CVP will be&#xD;
      obtained and correlation will be assessed across multiple time points during a given&#xD;
      patient's hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single center cohort study to investigate the correlation between&#xD;
      peripheral venous pressure and central venous pressure.&#xD;

        All patients with pulmonary artery catheters and peripheral IVs admitted to the Coronary&#xD;
        Care Units at the Cleveland Clinic, meeting the inclusion criteria, will be considered for&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We plan to enroll patients who meet the following criteria: Patients admitted to an&#xD;
             intensive care unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring. All eligible patients will be&#xD;
             those who have already undergone pulmonary artery catheterization via the internal&#xD;
             jugular or subclavian veins and upper extremity peripheral IV placement per routine&#xD;
             standard of care prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from this study for the following reasons: age less than 18&#xD;
             years of age, inability to obtain consent, femoral pulmonary artery catheter, or if&#xD;
             their attending physician refuses to allow enrollment.&#xD;
