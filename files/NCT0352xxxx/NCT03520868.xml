      To observe, using a prospectively designed study, the effect of type of oral anticoagulant on&#xD;
      intra-procedural heparin requirements in patients undergoing Atrial Fibrillation ablation and&#xD;
      to assess whether ACT assay accurately reflects heparin anti coagulation effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting the US population and&#xD;
      accounts for 15% of strokes worldwide. Radiofrequency ablation has become a frequently used&#xD;
      therapy for treatment of afib after failure of at least one anti-arrhythmic drug. Pulmonary&#xD;
      Vein Isolation (PVI) remains the cornerstone of AF ablation and requires transseptal puncture&#xD;
      and placement of catheters in the left atrium which can be thrombogenic and cause stroke.&#xD;
      This is avoided by intra-procedural infusion of heparin and the anti-coagulation effect is&#xD;
      monitored using Activated Clotting Time (ACT). With the approval of Novel Oral&#xD;
      Anti-Coagulants (NOAC), increasing number of patients are undergoing AF ablation on these&#xD;
      medications. It has been observed that patients on NOACs require much larger doses of heparin&#xD;
      and take longer time to reach therapeutic ACT. Consequently, patients are at higher risk for&#xD;
      thromboembolism and stroke. On the other hand, higher doses of heparin can expose patients to&#xD;
      excessive bleeding complications. The investigators seek to explain the mechanism of &quot;heparin&#xD;
      resistance&quot; in such a patient population and to develop a protocol that can achieve&#xD;
      therapeutic anticoagulation quicker.&#xD;
