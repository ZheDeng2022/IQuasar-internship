  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Treatment of up to 40 patients&#xD;
      will take place at up to 6 clinical centers. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      receive the AXIOS stent for up to 60 days stent indwell and 6 months follow-up after stent&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;
