  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disorder resulting in impaired platelet production and&#xD;
      enhanced destruction on the basis of autoantibody-mediated mechanisms. Patients with ITP are&#xD;
      at increased risk of bleeding and infection. First line therapy includes glucocorticoids,&#xD;
      with or without the addition of intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) when a prompt platelet&#xD;
      response is desired. The likelihood of stable and safe disease after first-line treatment&#xD;
      ranges from 30-60% and risk of relapse requiring additional therapy occurs in 50-80% of&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, the toxicity associated with first and subsequent therapy for ITP is&#xD;
      substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oseltamivir is an attractive drug for ITP since it specifically targets a pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanism that appears to be important for the development of ITP and has a benign side&#xD;
      effect profile compared to standard ITP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oseltamivir has never been rigorously tested in humans to determine its efficacy in the&#xD;
      management of ITP. The investigators therefore propose the first randomized, double blind&#xD;
      study to assess the impact of oseltamivir on biological markers in adult patients with ITP.&#xD;
      This study will also provide information about the feasibility of recruitment into a&#xD;
      definitive trial, which would be coordinated by St. Michael's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is: Do adults (≥ 18 years) with ITP treated with oseltamivir at 75mg&#xD;
      twice daily for 5 consecutive days have an increase in their mean platelet glycoprotein&#xD;
      sialylation compared to those receiving placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized controlled clinical trial will enroll 30 individuals&#xD;
      with ITP. Randomization and allocation will occur at a ratio of 1:1. Analysis of the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will occur via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to dramatically change the treatment of ITP. If the results from&#xD;
      this study demonstrate a biological effect, and results from the subsequent definitive study&#xD;
      are positive, The investigators envision a move away from non-specific immune-blunting&#xD;
      therapy such as prednisone, towards tailored therapy with oseltamivir. It could diminish the&#xD;
      lifelong summative immunosuppressive therapy burden, associated drug toxicity and improve&#xD;
      long- and short-term health outcomes for these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Explanation (of rationale for current study):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the encouraging case report described above, oseltamivir has not been rigorously&#xD;
      tested in humans to determine its efficacy in the management of ITP. Oseltamivir is an&#xD;
      attractive drug for ITP since it specifically targets a pathophysiologic mechanism that&#xD;
      appears to be important for the development of ITP and has a benign side effect profile&#xD;
      compared to standard ITP therapy. However, more robust evidence that oseltamivir affects&#xD;
      desialylation in humans is needed before a definitive, multicenter randomized trial can be&#xD;
      justified to funders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose the first randomized, double blind, study to assess the&#xD;
      impact of oseltamivir on biological markers in adult patients with ITP. This study will also&#xD;
      provide information about the feasibility of recruitment into a definitive trial, which would&#xD;
      be coordinated at St. Michael's Hospital (SMH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most appropriate treatment of patients with persistent ITP represents an area of major&#xD;
      clinical interest burdened by unacceptable uncertainty. This study has the potential to&#xD;
      dramatically change the treatment of ITP. If the results from the definitive study are&#xD;
      positive, the investigators envision a move away from non-specific immune-blunting therapy&#xD;
      such as prednisone, towards tailored therapy like oseltamivir. Targeted therapy for ITP is a&#xD;
      timely and relevant concept. It could diminish the lifelong summative immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy burden, associated drug toxicity and improve long- and short-term health outcomes for&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do adults (≥ 18 years) with ITP treated with oseltamivir at 75mg twice daily for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days have an increase in their mean platelet glycoprotein sialylation compared to&#xD;
      those receiving placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of oseltamivir on mean platelet&#xD;
      glycoprotein sialylation when administered orally at 75 mg twice daily versus placebo for&#xD;
      five consecutive days in the management of ITP in adult patients (≥ 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives relate to the feasibility of conducting a subsequent definitive&#xD;
      randomized trial focused on treatment efficacy and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The percentage of eligible patients who were successfully recruited;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of patients recruited per month;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The percentage of patients who received the study drug within 12 hours of randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The percentage of patients who received every scheduled dose of the study drug in a&#xD;
           blinded fashion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The percentage of patients who completed follow-up six months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional exploratory objectives are to determine in each treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The mean platelet count;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of patients who received additional ITP based therapy during the study 12&#xD;
           month follow-up period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T regulatory cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cytokine profiles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The anti-platelet glycoprotein antibody specificity/titer; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The effects of these antibodies on macrophage- and hepatocyte-mediated Fc-dependent and&#xD;
           independent phagocytosis in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Trial Design, Participants, Interventions, and Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, pilot, proof-of-concept, double-blind randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to determine the impact of oseltamivir on mean platelet glycoprotein sialylation in&#xD;
      patients with ITP. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two treatment regimens&#xD;
      in a 1:1 allocation ratio, receiving either oseltamivir (administered orally at 75 mg twice&#xD;
      daily) or placebo (administered orally twice daily) for five consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information for Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are capable of giving informed consent meeting study eligibility criteria, as per&#xD;
      the investigators judgement, will be approached for study. The informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
      and process for obtaining informed consent will comply with institutional, local, national&#xD;
      and international laws, rules and regulations. The ICF will be signed and dated by the&#xD;
      subject before the subject participates in any study-related activities. If any significant&#xD;
      changes to study design are made, a protocol amendment will be issued, submitted/approved by&#xD;
      the REB and signed by the site investigator. Protocol changes will be presented to the&#xD;
      subject and repeated ICF procedures will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center study undertaken at SMH, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All&#xD;
      laboratory based elements will be measured/studied at the SMH clinical hematology lab or at&#xD;
      Dr. Ni's platelet biology lab at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive either oseltamivir (administered orally at 75 mg twice&#xD;
      daily) or placebo (administered orally twice daily) for five consecutive days. Screening of&#xD;
      potential study participants will occur within 7 days of the randomization date (Day 0).&#xD;
      Screening can occur on Day 0. The study participant will be randomized on Day 0 and study&#xD;
      drug administration will begin on Day 1 and end on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All capsules will be dispensed in a blister pack format. The capsules of oseltamivir and&#xD;
      placebo will be encapsulated to look the same. Packing and labeling of the blister packs will&#xD;
      be performed by the study pharmacist at SMH. To track compliance, the blister pack will be&#xD;
      reviewed at Day 5 (or within 3 days of study drug completion) and a participant diary will be&#xD;
      utilized. Discontinuation of the medication while on trial can occur because of adverse&#xD;
      effects, participant or treating physician request (e.g. if patient requires standard ITP&#xD;
      therapy). The reason for discontinuation will be carefully collected and documented. For the&#xD;
      duration of the trial, there will be no additional study interventions aside from what has&#xD;
      already been described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that rare patients will receive additional ITP therapy over the&#xD;
      course of study follow-up, particularly if their platelet count falls to below 20 x 109/L.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will collect data regarding immunosuppressive therapy at all&#xD;
      follow-up time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of Intervention and Study Population Oseltamivir is a safe and well-tolerated&#xD;
      medication. The dose and duration of treatment used in this study is the accepted regimen for&#xD;
      the treatment of influenza. The most common side effects (2-15%) are gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea). Current second/third line management of ITP&#xD;
      involves a range of immunosuppressive regimens with variable efficacy and considerable&#xD;
      adverse effects, or observation without therapy (depending on a patient's platelet count and&#xD;
      bleeding risk). The placebo and oseltamivir treatment arms are ethically sound for the&#xD;
      reasons listed above and because the investigators are excluding patients with severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (&lt;20 x E9/L) and active significant bleeding (defined as a bleeding&#xD;
      assessment score of Grade 2 at any site by the Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura Bleeding&#xD;
      Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Generation, Concealment of Allocation and Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concealment of allocation will occur by centralized web based randomization using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes, with a 1:1 computer generated allocation sequence created independently by the&#xD;
      study statistician, Prof. Kevin Thorpe. Participants will be randomized with permuted blocks&#xD;
      of varying size to achieve allocation balance across the two treatment groups (this will be&#xD;
      concealed to participants, clinicians and data collectors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants, clinicians, data collectors, and laboratory analysts will be blinded.&#xD;
      Blinding of participants and clinicians will be achieved with the use of identical appearing&#xD;
      oseltamivir and placebo capsules (achieved via over-encapsulation). Blinding of laboratory&#xD;
      technologists is of particular importance since the primary outcome is technologist&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding In the event of a medical emergency, when management of a participant's condition&#xD;
      requires knowledge of the study drug, the treatment assignment may be unblinded to disclose&#xD;
      the identity of the study drug dispensed. Investigators seeking to unblind the participant's&#xD;
      treatment assignment will contact the Principal Investigator (Dr. M. Sholzberg), or in the&#xD;
      absence of the Principal Investigator; the Co-Investigator, Dr. Gloria Lim. The Clinical&#xD;
      Research Coordinator (CRC) will be contacted to record the reason for unblinding, name of&#xD;
      investigator requesting unblinding, date and time of unblinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data Collection, Management, and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data The investigators and study staff will maintain adequate and accurate source&#xD;
      documentation to document the treatment and study course of a subject and to substantiate the&#xD;
      integrity of the trial data submitted for review to regulatory authorities. Documentation&#xD;
      will be filled out by study staff and must be completed for each screened subject with all&#xD;
      required study data accurately recorded. The investigator has final responsibility for the&#xD;
      accuracy and authenticity of the clinical data at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome The primary analysis of platelet glycoprotein will be conducted using ANCOVA&#xD;
      where the baseline value is adjusted for. The treatment effect will be expressed as an&#xD;
      adjusted mean difference. The intention-to-treat (ITT) approach will be employed for analyses&#xD;
      of the primary outcome. If a meaningful difference is observed at day 5 a secondary analysis&#xD;
      will employ a linear mixed effect model to explore the duration of the treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Feasibility Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have set some minimal targets for the feasibility outcomes that will&#xD;
      facilitate assessment of the feasibility to conduct a larger trial. The targets the&#xD;
      investigators hope to achieve are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At least 30% of eligible patients recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Approximately two patients per month recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At least 80% receive study drug within 12 hours of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At least 90% successful blinding of drug distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At least 80% completing 12 month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Clinical and Biomarker Outcomes Given the small sample size of this trial it must&#xD;
      be stressed that all secondary outcomes should be viewed as supportive or describing&#xD;
      mechanisms related to the primary findings. Therefore, the statistical methods employed will&#xD;
      be used for effect estimation purposes rather than formal statistical inference. The&#xD;
      difference in proportion receiving ITP therapy will be expressed as the absolute risk&#xD;
      difference with 95% confidence interval. With the exception of the phagocytosis in vitro&#xD;
      study (outcome 6), all other biomarkers will undergo a primary analysis of their Day 5&#xD;
      levels. The ANCOVA model will be used to estimated the baseline adjusted difference between&#xD;
      groups. If possible (e.g. model convergance) linear mixed effect models will examine the time&#xD;
      course of platelets and cytokines by treatment group. In addition to the standard ITT&#xD;
      approach, per-protocol analyses of the biomarkers will also be conducted. Finally, &quot;The&#xD;
      effects of these antibodies on macrophage- and hepatocyte-mediated Fc-dependent and&#xD;
      independent phagocytosis in vitro&quot; is a one-time lab analysis. The difference in mean&#xD;
      flourescent intensity will be estimated from a linear regression model that adjusts for&#xD;
      antibody class. The possibility of an interaction between treatment and antibody class will&#xD;
      also be explored. All biomarker analyses will be supplemented with graphical displays of the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
