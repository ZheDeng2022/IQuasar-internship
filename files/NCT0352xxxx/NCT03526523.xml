      Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a risk factor for other diseases.&#xD;
      While women are at elevated risk for depression in general, the menopause transition is a&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable time for many women, with the risk for depression increasing 2-4&#xD;
      fold. The objective of this research study is to determine whether mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction (MBSR), an 8-week structured intervention involving meditation and yoga, has any&#xD;
      beneficial mood effects for women undergoing this vulnerable time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The menopause transition (a.k.a. perimenopause) represents the reproductive stage&#xD;
      transitioning from regular menstrual cycles through the loss of ovulatory function and to the&#xD;
      complete cessation of menses. The latter marks the onset of menopause. All middle-aged women&#xD;
      experience the menopause transition, which, on average, extends 5-6 years surrounding the&#xD;
      last menstrual period. In Saskatchewan, roughly 80 000 women are currently of perimenopausal&#xD;
      age. An estimated 26-33% of women develop clinically significant depressive symptoms during&#xD;
      the perimenopause. Rates of diagnosed major depressive disorder during the menopause&#xD;
      transition range between 12 and 23%. Mounting evidence findings from the PI and others&#xD;
      suggests that the erratic fluctuations in estradiol that occur during the normal menopause&#xD;
      transition play a key role. Specifically, increased estradiol fluctuation may increase one's&#xD;
      sensitivity to stress both in the laboratory and in the context of real-world stressful life&#xD;
      events, resulting in an increased risk for clinically significant depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBSR has proven to be very effective at increasing stress resilience and improving emotional&#xD;
      wellbeing in a variety of populations. Thus, in the current SHRF-funded project, we will&#xD;
      examine the prophylactic mood benefits of MBSR. We hypothesize that MBSR will increase&#xD;
      women's resilience in the context of stress-sensitizing hormonal fluctuation in the menopause&#xD;
      transition, making them less prone to developing depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project will be composed of five components: 1) Enrollment session; 2) Hormonal&#xD;
      Sensitivity Assessment (1 month); 3) Treatment Phase (8 weeks); 4) Follow-Up Phase (6 months)&#xD;
      and 5) Waitlist Control Group Treatment (8 weeks). Each component is described in detail&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment Session. After completing an eligibility screening over the phone, a trained&#xD;
           research assistant (RA) will conduct an enrollment session over the phone with the&#xD;
           prospective participant. The participant will be emailed a Powerpoint presentation&#xD;
           summarizing the study and a link to a Qualtrics survey that will contain an electronic&#xD;
           version of the consent form. Over the phone, the RA will review the Powerpoint slides&#xD;
           and consent form. Once consent is obtained, the RA will administer the Structured&#xD;
           Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5&#xD;
           (SCID-RV) for axis I disorders to screen for the presence of current psychiatric&#xD;
           disorders as well as assess past major depressive episodes. The participant will then&#xD;
           follow the RA's instructions on how to download the Expimetrics application on their&#xD;
           smart phone, which they will use to complete study component #2 (described below). After&#xD;
           the phone call, participants will be emailed a link to a Qualtrics survey containing a&#xD;
           number of questionnaires assessing demographic information as well as psychological&#xD;
           variables that may predict participant outcomes. The RA will instruct the participant to&#xD;
           complete the survey at their convenience over the following 7 days. The RA will also&#xD;
           mail a kit containing 12 2-ml vials contained in a small cardboard box and 10 ovulation&#xD;
           predictor tests. Next, participants will complete an electronic version of a number of&#xD;
           questionnaires, described below, with the use of Qualtrics. Finally, participants will&#xD;
           be given instructions on how to take an ovulation test and how to collect urine samples&#xD;
           at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hormonal Sensitivity Assessment (1.5 months). Starting on the first day of their next&#xD;
           menstrual period following the enrolment session, participants will complete the Daily&#xD;
           Rating of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for approximately 45 days (if possible, using the&#xD;
           Expimetrics smart phone app). Starting on day seven of their menstrual cycle, they will&#xD;
           take an ovulation predictor test upon waking each day until a positive test is obtained&#xD;
           (usually 6-8 days). Once a positive test is obtained, the participant will notify a&#xD;
           research assistant by text, email or phone. In addition, they will be asked to collect a&#xD;
           small sample of urine every other day for 30 days. The DRSP should be completed daily&#xD;
           until the last day of urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MBSR Intervention (8 weeks). The intervention is provided over the course of eight&#xD;
           weekly 150-minute sessions and one 7-hour weekend intensive silent retreat. The MBSR&#xD;
           program, modeled after the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and colleagues at the Stress Reduction&#xD;
           and Relaxation Clinic-Massachusetts Medical Center, has been used and adapted by Dr.&#xD;
           Campbell and his colleagues at the University of Calgary for numerous populations. The&#xD;
           MBSR program consists of three primary components: 1) theoretical material related to&#xD;
           relaxation, meditation, and the body-mind connection, 2) experiential practice of&#xD;
           meditation and yoga during the group meetings and home based practice, and 3) group&#xD;
           process focused on problem solving related to impediments to effective practice,&#xD;
           practical day-to-day applications of mindfulness, and supportive interaction between&#xD;
           group members. A booklet is distributed containing information pertinent to each week's&#xD;
           instruction, including a bibliography for those wishing to pursue relevant themes in&#xD;
           greater depth, and 2 CDs with guided meditation to help with home practice. Each week,&#xD;
           participants will be asked to record all between-session home practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All sessions will be audiotaped; audiotapes will be randomly selected to be viewed by&#xD;
           Dr. Campbell to monitor treatment fidelity. After evaluating the tapes, both written and&#xD;
           verbal feedback will be provided to the instructor to support compliance with the&#xD;
           treatment protocol. Note that audiotapes will not reveal the identity of any of the&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up Period (6 months). Immediately following the intervention and every two weeks&#xD;
           for 6 months, participants from both treatment groups will be emailed a link to a&#xD;
           Qualtrics survey including the CES-D. The following questionnaires will also be included&#xD;
           in the survey immediately following the intervention as well as months 2, 4 and 6: the&#xD;
           Perceived Stress Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Five Facet Mindfulness&#xD;
           Questionnaire and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. For participants without an&#xD;
           email address, an RA will complete the survey with them over the phone. Participants&#xD;
           obtaining a CES-D score ≥16 will be contacted by an RA to complete the mood module of&#xD;
           the SCID-5 over the phone to identify cases of major depression. Importantly, all&#xD;
           post-randomization correspondence with participants will be carried out by staff members&#xD;
           who are blinded to participants' treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Waitlist MBSR Intervention (8 weeks). Following the six-month follow-up, members of each&#xD;
           wave's waitlist control group will receive the MBSR intervention. Although this will&#xD;
           serve no research purpose, we believe offering MBSR to all participants, rather than&#xD;
           using a &quot;no treatment&quot; condition will make the trial more equitable and appealing.&#xD;
