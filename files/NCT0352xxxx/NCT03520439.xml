      This clinical trial is designed to study the effectiveness and safety of mifepristone in the&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis with multi center, random, double blind and controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials. This multicenter study is performed in 150 subjects who are diagnosed as&#xD;
      adenomyosis . Twelve weeks of randomization, allocation concealment, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel grouping. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups and received one of the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mifepristone tablets of 10mg, 1 tablet daily, oral&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo, 1 tablet daily, oral&#xD;

      Adenomyosis is a common benign disease of Gynecology, with secondary progressive dysmenorrhea&#xD;
      and menorrhagia as the main clinical manifestations, which seriously harm the physical and&#xD;
      mental health of the patients. Most patients have the desire to retain the uterus. Therefore,&#xD;
      the treatment of drug conservative treatment is dominant in the treatment of adenomyosis.&#xD;
      However, the current clinical treatment of adenomyosis still has some limitations and needs&#xD;
      to be improved. Therefore, it is imperative to expand the clinical medication of adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mifepristone is defined as a selective progesterone receptor modulator. Under specific&#xD;
      conditions, it plays the role of anti progestin, inhibits endometrial proliferation, inhibits&#xD;
      ovulation, and can cause reversible amenorrhea. In recent years, it has been widely used in&#xD;
      of uterine leiomyoma and endometriosis. Adenomyosis is also closely related to hormone&#xD;
      related diseases, especially endometriosis. At present, the study of mifepristone in the&#xD;
      treatment of adenomyosis is more extensive in China. A large number of domestic literature&#xD;
      reports that low dose mifepristone for the treatment of adenomyosis is safe and effective for&#xD;
      the treatment of adenomyosis . During the treatment of mifepristone, most of the patients had&#xD;
      amenorrhea, obviously alleviating dysmenorrhea and reducing the menstrual volume, reducing&#xD;
      the uterine and lesion volume of the patients with adenomyosis . However, most of the&#xD;
      domestic literature is a small sample case control study or retrospective study. There is no&#xD;
      randomized double blind control study. There is no clinical study on the application of&#xD;
      mifepristone to adenomyosis in foreign countries. Therefore, the clinical evidence is&#xD;
      inadequate, and a high quality randomized controlled trial is still needed. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of mifepristone (10mg) in the&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis with multi center, random, double blind and controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials. It is a new clinical study for the old medicine.&#xD;
