      The proposed study is a phase 1, open label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      antiretroviral activity of seven infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074, administered intravenously&#xD;
      at 30 mg/kg dose level, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals on&#xD;
      combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and during an analytical interruption of ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an open label study of the safety and antiretroviral activity of&#xD;
      3BNC117 and 10-1074 in HIV-infected individuals with well-controlled HIV infection on&#xD;
      combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are two broadly neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies (bNAbs) that target different sites on HIV-1 gp120. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      administration of repeated infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in the absence of ART will be&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated, will maintain viral suppression in HIV-infected individuals during&#xD;
      analytical treatment interruption (ATI) and will interfere with the maintenance of the HIV-1&#xD;
      reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty eligible participants will be randomized to either Group 1 or Group 2 in a 3:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (n=30): participants will discontinue ART 2 days after the first infusion of 3BNC117&#xD;
      and 10-1074, and will receive 6 additional infusions of both antibodies at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      16 and 20 (Part A). Participants will remain off ART until week 38, if viral suppression is&#xD;
      maintained (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=10): participants will remain on ART and will be administered seven infusions of&#xD;
      3BNC117 and 10-1074 at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (Part A). ART will be discontinued at&#xD;
      week 26 until week 38, if viral suppression is maintained (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, participants will remain on ART and undergo leukapheresis, and will have the&#xD;
      option to undergo LN biopsies 2-4 weeks prior to first 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in group 1 will discontinue their ART 2 days after the first 3BNC117&#xD;
      and 10-1074 infusions. Participants enrolled in group 2 will discontinue their ART at week&#xD;
      26. If the participant's ART regimen includes an NNRTI, the NNRTI will be switched to an&#xD;
      integrase inhibitor-based regimen, 4 weeks prior discontinuing all antiretroviral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ATI periods of the study, ART will be resumed if there is a &gt; 30% decline in CD4+&#xD;
      T cell count or CD4+ T cell count decreases to &lt; 350 cells/Î¼l from baseline (day 0) and these&#xD;
      changes are confirmed during next visit. ART will also be re-initiated if the participant&#xD;
      develops symptoms of severe acute retroviral syndrome or becomes pregnant. In addition, ART&#xD;
      will be resumed according the following virologic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A (wk 0 - wk 26), ART will be resumed if group 1 participants have 2 consecutive plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 200 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (wk 26 - wk 38), ART will be resumed if group 1 or group 2 participants have sustained&#xD;
      (&gt; 4 weeks) HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1,000 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C (wk 38 - wk 48), group 1 and group 2 participants who have not met criteria to&#xD;
      reinitiate ART will be offered to continue off ART with close monitoring. In Part C, ART will&#xD;
      be resumed if the participant has 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1,000 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for a total of 48 weeks from enrollment (day 0).&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to return for a large blood draw after they reach at least 24&#xD;
      weeks of viral suppression after ART is re-initiated, if this occurs after the active study&#xD;
      follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be performed at multiple time points following 3BNC117 and 10-1074&#xD;
      infusions. The effects of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 infusions on the HIV-1 reservoir of&#xD;
      ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals will be evaluated by several assays. These&#xD;
      evaluations will occur at baseline (day 0) and at week 26.&#xD;
