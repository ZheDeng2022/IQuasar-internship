  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that one in every 3,600 children in Canada has cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a&#xD;
      genetic disease that affects the glands that produce mucus and sweat. In CF, mucus production&#xD;
      increases and the mucus becomes thick and sticky. This can block the airways, making it&#xD;
      difficult to breathe. Mucus production also causes bacteria to grow, which can lead to&#xD;
      infections in the lungs. Individuals with CF suffer from shortness of breath, wheezing,&#xD;
      cough, and poor exercise capacity. There are limited treatment options to reduce shortness of&#xD;
      breath in these individuals. Some medications known as bronchodilators are commonly&#xD;
      prescribed to reduce breathlessness in patients with CF. These drugs help open the airways&#xD;
      making it easier to breathe. Unfortunately, there is limited scientific proof that these&#xD;
      drugs can reduce shortness of breath and improve exercise capacity in patients with CF. As a&#xD;
      result, some experts have recommended that these drugs should not be prescribed for patients&#xD;
      with CF. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a bronchodilator on shortness&#xD;
      of breath, exercise performance, and breathing responses compared to a placebo drug in adults&#xD;
      with CF.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exertional dyspnea is a symptom that reduces quality of life and is associated with reduced&#xD;
      exercise tolerance in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung hyperinflation has been&#xD;
      suggested to be an important factor contributing to dyspnea in CF. Dynamic hyperinflation&#xD;
      during exercise testing has been reported in up to 58% of CF patients with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      CF lung disease and is associated with reduced exercise tolerance and increased exertional&#xD;
      dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic lung hyperinflation also occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      is believed to be a major cause of exertional dyspnea and exercise limitation. Bronchodilator&#xD;
      use in COPD has been shown to reduce lung hyperinflation and improve exertional dyspnea and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance; however, there is limited data available in CF despite the&#xD;
      pathophysiological similarities between these conditions. Although a majority of individuals&#xD;
      six years and older with CF are prescribed bronchodilators, evidence to support the chronic&#xD;
      use of bronchodilators has been insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike acute bronchodilator reversibility testing during routine spirometry, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing (CPET) is a highly sensitive and reproducible tool to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      bronchodilators in CF. CPET can be used to identify significant physiological abnormalities&#xD;
      even in patients with mild CF lung disease with relatively normal spirometry. Compared to&#xD;
      healthy age-matched controls during exercise, adults with mild-to-moderate CF have: greater&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea; higher ventilatory requirements; earlier constraints on tidal volume&#xD;
      expansion; increased operating lung volumes; an earlier onset of unpleasant dyspnea&#xD;
      descriptors (i.e. unsatisfied inspiration); and are more likely to experience &quot;chest&#xD;
      tightness&quot;. All of these abnormalities are, in theory, amenable to change following&#xD;
      bronchodilator therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have evaluated the effects of short-acting bronchodilators on exercise in CF&#xD;
      using CPET. In these studies, despite improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second&#xD;
      (FEV1), short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) failed to show any effect on maximal exercise&#xD;
      parameters including workload, oxygen uptake, dyspnea, and leg discomfort ratings.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these studies used incremental exercise tests and focused on peak dyspnea&#xD;
      responses, which are often unresponsive to most pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions. A more clinically and physiologically relevant protocol is to use constant&#xD;
      work rate exercise tests and to evaluate dyspnea at standardized submaximal exercise times.&#xD;
      This approach has been highly effective in showing beneficial effects of bronchodilators in&#xD;
      COPD. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of SABA on&#xD;
      sensory, physiological, and exercise performance outcomes in adults with CF. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that SABA will reduce dyspnea intensity ratings and ventilatory limitations, delay the onset&#xD;
      of unpleasant dyspnea descriptors, and will improve exercise performance compared to placebo.&#xD;
      These findings would support future guideline recommendations for the use of SABAs to improve&#xD;
      dyspnea and exercise tolerance in patients with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Overview: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study&#xD;
      will include a total of four visits to the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Physiology Laboratory at&#xD;
      St. Paul's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will include medical history screening, chronic activity-related dyspnea, quality of&#xD;
      life, and physical activity questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, pulmonary function&#xD;
      assessment, and a symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test to determine peak&#xD;
      incremental work rate. On visit 2, participants will perform a constant-load cycle exercise&#xD;
      test at 75% of peak incremental work rate (from visit 1) in order to familiarize participants&#xD;
      with the exercise protocol and experimental procedures. Visits 3 and 4 will include baseline&#xD;
      pulmonary function testing followed by inhalation of either 400 μg salbutamol or matched&#xD;
      placebo, in a 2x2 crossover randomized design. Approximately 10 minutes after administration&#xD;
      of salbutamol or placebo, subjects will undergo pulmonary function testing and the same&#xD;
      constant-load cycle exercise test performed on visit 2. All visits will take place at the&#xD;
      same time of day. Visits 1 and 2 will be separated by a minimum of 48 hours and visits 3 and&#xD;
      4 will be separated by a minimum of one week and a maximum of five weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to perform their usual daily chest physiotherapy and will be required to&#xD;
      withhold SABAs, nebulized therapies, and caffeine for a minimum of 6 hours, and long-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators and strenuous exercise for 24 h prior to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding: The random allocation sequence will be computer-generated in&#xD;
      blocks of four. Drugs will be prepared as two identical meter-dose inhalers, which will be&#xD;
      administered according to the blinded randomization sequence. Drug administration will be&#xD;
      performed using identical large-volume spacers. The unblinding code will be held by an&#xD;
      individual not involved in the study, and all data collection and analysis will be performed&#xD;
      before the treatment codes are broken. All investigators and staff will be unaware of&#xD;
      treatment allocations at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change in standardized dyspnea score at the&#xD;
      highest equivalent submaximal exercise time achieved on both constant load exercise tests&#xD;
      (i.e., iso-time) between salbutamol vs. placebo. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Exercise&#xD;
      endurance time, standardized leg discomfort score, qualitative dyspnea measurements,&#xD;
      spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, airways resistance, impulse oscillometry derived&#xD;
      variables, and metabolic and cardiopulmonary parameters (e.g. ventilatory responses,&#xD;
      inspiratory capacity/dynamic hyperinflation, operating lung volumes, expiratory flow&#xD;
      limitation, breathing patterns, metabolic responses, and arterial oxygen saturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol: A symptom-limited incremental exercise test will be performed on visit 1&#xD;
      using an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 200P; Ergoline GmbH, Bitz,&#xD;
      Germany), according to recommended guidelines for cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The test&#xD;
      will consist of steady-state rest for six minutes, a one minute warm-up of unloaded pedaling,&#xD;
      and 10-20 watt stepwise increases in work rate, every minute until symptom-limitation using a&#xD;
      self-selected cadence. Constant-load exercise tests on visits 2, 3, and 4 will include rest&#xD;
      and warm-up periods followed by an immediate increase in work rate to 75% of maximal work&#xD;
      (determined on visit 1) until symptom-limitation, using a cadence &gt;50 rpm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function: Spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon&#xD;
      monoxide, maximum respiratory pressures, and impulse oscillometry will be performed on visit&#xD;
      1, according to established recommendations. Pulmonary function testing on visits 3 and 4&#xD;
      will include spirometry, plethysmography, and impulse oscillometry performed before and ~10&#xD;
      minutes after administration of salbutamol and placebo. A commercially available&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary testing system will be used, and all measurements will be expressed as&#xD;
      percentage of predicted values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea Evaluation: Dyspnea intensity (defined as &quot;the sensation of laboured or difficult&#xD;
      breathing&quot;) and perceived leg discomfort will be evaluated at rest, every minute during&#xD;
      exercise, and at peak exercise using the modified 0-10 category-ratio Borg scale, on all&#xD;
      testing visits. Participants will be asked to select the most applicable dyspnea&#xD;
      descriptor(s) after the intensity ratings using the following three descriptors: (1) &quot;my&#xD;
      breathing requires more work and effort&quot; (work and effort); (2) &quot;I cannot get enough air in&quot;&#xD;
      (unsatisfied inspiration); (3) &quot;I cannot get enough air out&quot; (unsatisfied expiration). None&#xD;
      to all three of the descriptors can be chosen at any one time. Upon exercise cessation,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to verbalize their main reason(s) for stopping exercise (i.e.,&#xD;
      breathing discomfort, leg discomfort, combination of breathing and legs, or some other&#xD;
      reason) and to select qualitative descriptors of breathlessness using an established&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory Responses to Exercise: Standard cardio-respiratory measures will be&#xD;
      recorded and averaged over 30-second epochs, including minute ventilation, oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, carbon dioxide production, tidal volume, and breathing frequency using a&#xD;
      commercially available system (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400). Heart rate will be monitored using&#xD;
      a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure will be measured using a manual&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer, and arterial oxygen saturation will be monitored using pulse oximetry prior&#xD;
      to, during, and after all exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating volumes (i.e., end-expiratory and end-inspiratory lung volumes) will be derived&#xD;
      from dynamic inspiratory capacity maneuvers as previously described. Expiratory flow&#xD;
      limitation will be measured by placing tidal flow-volume loops within the maximum flow-volume&#xD;
      loop. Briefly, a maximum flow-volume loop will be constructed by taking the highest&#xD;
      expiratory flows for any given lung volume from a series of graded vital capacity maneuvers&#xD;
      performed before and after exercise to account for both thoracic gas compression and&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchodilation. Tidal flow-volume loops will be ensemble averaged and&#xD;
      placed within the maximum flow-volume loop according to the measured end-expiratory lung&#xD;
      volume. The degree of expiratory flow limitation will be calculated as the percentage overlap&#xD;
      between the expired portion of the ensemble averaged tidal flow-volume loop and the maximum&#xD;
      flow-volume loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Statistical Analyses: The primary endpoint for this study will be dyspnea&#xD;
      ratings during exercise at iso-time, defined as the highest equivalent submaximal time&#xD;
      achieved during both constant-load exercise tests by a given patient. Using a two-tailed&#xD;
      paired subject formula with α=0.05 and β=0.80, we estimate that 16 participants are needed to&#xD;
      detect a minimal clinically important difference of ±1 Borg 0-10 scale units at iso-time&#xD;
      between treatments, assuming a standard deviation of ±1 Borg 0-10 scale units. Assuming a 20%&#xD;
      rate of attrition, at least 20 participants will need to enter the study to ensure adequate&#xD;
      power for the primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to identify changes in iso-time&#xD;
      dyspnea (primary outcome) and secondary outcome measures (e.g. endurance time; iso-time leg&#xD;
      discomfort ratings, operating volumes, etc.) comparing salbutamol to placebo. Possible&#xD;
      crossover and period effects for all outcomes will be assessed using paired t-tests according&#xD;
      to recommended guidelines for design and analysis of crossover trials. Qualitative&#xD;
      descriptors of dyspnea and reasons for stopping exercise will be compared using McNemar's&#xD;
      test. Multivariate models will be developed to identify predictors of between-test&#xD;
      differences in outcomes (e.g. iso-time Borg dyspnea scale and exercise endurance time) for&#xD;
      each individual. Predictor variables will include the between-test difference in operating&#xD;
      lung volumes, dynamic hyperinflation, and expiratory flow limitation at iso-time.&#xD;
