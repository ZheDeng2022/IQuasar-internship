  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poststroke recovery mainly takes place within the first weeks to months and about 95% of the&#xD;
      patients reach their maximum recovery 3 months after stroke onset. Poststroke rehabilitation&#xD;
      is initiated as early as possible and aims to reduce functional consequences of stroke,&#xD;
      allowing patients to integrate into the community. However, up to 75% of the patients remain&#xD;
      disabled in the long term. Strikingly, about 20 to 30% of the patients show functional&#xD;
      decline (i.e., learned-nonuse) in the long term - most often after having finished their&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation period - and even stroke survivors who have little or no residual&#xD;
      disability are less physically active when compared to their age-matched peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poststroke outcomes can be well predicted early after stroke. However, the deficits early&#xD;
      after stroke and the outcomes are measured by standardized clinical tests performed in the&#xD;
      laboratory. The drawback of these tests is that they provide information about the best&#xD;
      possible abilities of the patients, as they are encouraged by therapists in testing&#xD;
      situations. This so called &quot;capacity&quot; does not necessarily reflect what patients do in daily&#xD;
      life situations (i.e., &quot;performance&quot; or &quot;real world use&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the growing interest in the patients' performance, various assessments that objectively&#xD;
      measure activities in daily life situations have been developed in the last few years. These&#xD;
      devices capture movement in daily life situations in a sensitive and objective way. An&#xD;
      additional benefit is that they are less hampered by floor or ceiling effects when compared&#xD;
      to clinical laboratory measurements (i.e., clinimetrics). Nevertheless, outcome of real world&#xD;
      performance is hardly ever used in clinical trials aiming to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation interventions. Actually, until today, the natural course of performance&#xD;
      remains largely unknown, as are predictors for this course. It is also unknown to which&#xD;
      extend patients' subjective reporting of performance matches objectively measured&#xD;
      performance. Finally, although it is believed that there is a threshold for, for example,&#xD;
      real life use of the paretic arm and further improvement, there is no evidence as to what&#xD;
      this threshold is in terms of clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present prospective longitudinal cohort study fills in the gap regarding knowledge about&#xD;
      the profile and predictability of two performance outcomes during the first year poststroke:&#xD;
      engagement in physical activities and the use of the paretic upper limb. In addition, it will&#xD;
      provide insight in how physical activity engagement and upper limb use measured by daily life&#xD;
      assessments relate to standard clinical laboratory assessments. This knowledge is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for the identification of patients' phenotypes and a first essential step&#xD;
      towards the development of tailored (i.e., precision medicine), innovative rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions which enhance performance in terms of physical activities or upper limb use in&#xD;
      daily life. The ultimate goal is to reduce poststroke disability and associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-USE is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study of 120 first-ever stroke&#xD;
      patients, who will be assessed 3, 10, 28, 90 and 365 days after stroke onset, as well as at&#xD;
      discharge of the rehabilitation center.&#xD;
