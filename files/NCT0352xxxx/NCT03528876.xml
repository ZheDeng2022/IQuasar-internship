    <textblock>
      Background: Gastro-esophageal (GE) cancers are a highly aggressive disease and are one of the&#xD;
      major causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In general, combination chemotherapy has been&#xD;
      associated with better outcomes compared with single agent chemotherapy. Fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      doublets FOLFOX (infusional 5FU and oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (infusional 5FU and irinotecan)&#xD;
      are some of the standard first-line regimens and are less toxic than the anthracycline&#xD;
      containing three drug regimen. Although platinum compounds are very effective in GE cancers,&#xD;
      patients who are treated with platinum-based therapy often develop severe neuropathy and may&#xD;
      not be able to tolerate a salvage second-line paclitaxel-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate progression free survival, time to progression, overall survival,&#xD;
      toxicity and quality of life in previously untreated patients with metastatic GE cancers who&#xD;
      will be treated with a novel biweekly regimen comprised of two cycles of FOLFOX alternating&#xD;
      with two cycles of FOLFIRI. To determine the correlation between various clinical and&#xD;
      pathological biomarkers including an early FDG-PET scan response and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Phase 2 clinical trial Methods: Thirty-six adult patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      HER2 negative metastatic adenocarcinomas or poorly differentiated GE cancers will be&#xD;
      recruited at the two major cancer centers in Saskatchewan over a period of two years.&#xD;
      Patients will receive chemotherapy every two weeks and will undergo periodic imaging studies&#xD;
      every 8 weeks. A Cox proportional analysis will be performed to assess various clinical and&#xD;
      pathologic factors including an early FDG-PET/CT response and their correlation with patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The LOGIC study aims to develop an effective but potentially less toxic regimen&#xD;
      in the management of metastatic GE cancers, offering the possibility of longer disease&#xD;
      control as a result of 100% exposure to two active doublets in a first-line treatment setting&#xD;
      with lower neurotoxicities and an improved rate of salvage second-line therapy. This study&#xD;
      will inform the care of patients with metastatic GE cancers and will be used to design a&#xD;
      larger phase 3 trial to establish a more effective but less toxic chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic GE cancer and to establish role of FDG-PET/CT scan and other&#xD;
      biomarkers in predicting outcomes.&#xD;

      1. Current Knowledge and Rationale Gastro-esophageal (GE) cancers are a highly aggressive&#xD;
           disease and are one of the major causes of cancer-related death in the world. Despite&#xD;
           improvements in surgical and radiation techniques and the availability of newer agents,&#xD;
           the prognosis of recurrent GE cancers remains very poor (1-4). GE cancers comprise one&#xD;
           of the solid organ cancers with a high fatality rate. Although 5,600 (2.8%) of the&#xD;
           estimated 196,900 newly diagnosed cancers in Canada in 2015 were GE cancer, 4,100 (5.2%)&#xD;
           of the 78,000 cancer related deaths were from GE cancers (3). The need for novel&#xD;
           strategies to improve current therapy is therefore vital in the management of GE cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In many clinical trials, the treatment of metastatic gastric and esophageal cancers has&#xD;
           merged, and the majority of patients with gastric, esophageal, or GE cancers are treated&#xD;
           with a parallel chemotherapeutic regimens. The goal of treatment in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic GE cancer is to control the disease, to maintain or improve quality of life,&#xD;
           and to prolong survival. In a meta-analysis of three trials comparing chemotherapy&#xD;
           versus best supportive care, there was a significant benefit in overall survival in&#xD;
           favor of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 95% CI 0.24 -0.55) (5). Hence,&#xD;
           chemotherapy should be considered for patients with appropriate performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In general combination chemotherapy has been associated with higher response rates, and&#xD;
           better progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with single&#xD;
           agent chemotherapy. For most patients with GE cancers combination chemotherapy&#xD;
           represents the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) remains one of the reference regimens&#xD;
           for the first-line treatment of metastatic GE cancers. However, when both oxaliplatin&#xD;
           (O) and capecitabine (X) are substituted for cisplatin (C) and 5FU (F), respectively in&#xD;
           the ECF regimen (EOX, EOF, ECX), outcomes are at least as good as with ECF (6). FOLFOX&#xD;
           has also been compared to ECF with comparable results. An intergroup phase 2 trial&#xD;
           evaluated ECF, irinotecan and cisplatin (IC), or FOLFOX in combination with cetuximab,&#xD;
           and concluded that response rates, PFS, and median OS were comparable in the ECF and&#xD;
           FOLFOX groups. FOLFOX-based regimen required fewer treatment modifications compared with&#xD;
           other regimens (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Irinotecan-based regimens also appeared to be superior to cisplatin/5FU in response&#xD;
           rates and survival being in the 10-12 month range (8,9). A randomized phase 3 trial&#xD;
           evaluated 416 patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric junction (EGJ)&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma who were assigned to either FOLFIRI or ECX (10). There were no&#xD;
           significant differences in median PFS, OS, or response rates between the two regimens.&#xD;
           Time to treatment failure favored FOLFIRI (5.1 versus 4.2 months). Furthermore, FOLFIRI&#xD;
           was better tolerated overall (rate of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 69 versus 84% with ECX).&#xD;
           Although docetaxel based regimens such as DCF have shown significant improvement in&#xD;
           response, PFS, and OS compared to cisplatin/5-FU, it is a more toxic regimen with a&#xD;
           higher rates of grade 3 or 4 toxicities and is not commonly used in Canada (11-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite a large number of randomized trials, there is no globally accepted, standard&#xD;
           first-line chemotherapy regimen in advanced HER2 negative GE cancer. A meta-analysis of&#xD;
           first-line chemotherapy trials for metastatic GE cancers involving 10,249 patients in 50&#xD;
           trials that incorporated 17 different chemotherapy regimens with 37 direct comparisons&#xD;
           showed that anthracycline-containing triplets such as ECF or EOX and the&#xD;
           docetaxel-containing triplet DCF were more toxic but not superior to fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
           doublets with respect to PFS or OS (14). Although fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
           noncisplatin-containing doublets, fluoropyrimidine-cisplatin doublets, and all triplet&#xD;
           regimens showed significant improvements in overall survival compared with&#xD;
           fluoropyrimidine alone, a fluoropyrimidine-noncisplatin doublet containing oxaliplatin&#xD;
           (FOx) or irinotecan (FI) significantly improved OS compared with a fluoropyrimidine plus&#xD;
           cisplatin doublet (for FI, the HR for death was 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-0.99; for FOx, the HR&#xD;
           was 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.98). The cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine doublet was also associated&#xD;
           with more grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Furthermore, an individual patient data meta-analysis&#xD;
           of the GASTRIC group involving 4245 patients of 55 eligible trials concluded that there&#xD;
           was no role for epirubicin in combination with a fluoropyrimidine and a platinum agent&#xD;
           (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hence, based on efficacy and toxicity profiles, fluoropyrimidine doublets FOLFOX or&#xD;
           FOLFIRI are the preferred first-line therapy over cisplatin doublets, anthracycline&#xD;
           triplets, and DCF. A substantial number of patients who have disease progression after a&#xD;
           first-line chemotherapy may not undergo further active therapy, mainly because of&#xD;
           deterioration of their performance status or side effects-related to previous&#xD;
           treatments. Although the combinations of 5-FU with irinotecan and oxaliplatin&#xD;
           (FOLFOXIRI) is an active regimen in colorectal and pancreatic cancer, it has been&#xD;
           associated with a higher rate of adverse effects. Furthermore, this regimen is currently&#xD;
           administered at the two major treatment centers in Saskatchewan requiring frequent&#xD;
           long-distance travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The LOGIC study aims to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of a novel regimen comprised of&#xD;
           biweekly FOLFOX for two cycles alternating with FOLFIRI for two cycles (FOLFOX-FOLFIRI)&#xD;
           as the first-line therapy for patients with previously untreated metastatic GE cancers.&#xD;
           This novel schedule will expose the patients to three active agents in the first-line&#xD;
           setting without the toxicity that is typically associated when all of three drugs are&#xD;
           given together. Furthermore, since oxaliplatin is associated with significant&#xD;
           neuropathy, decreasing the exposure of this drug in an alternating schedule can result&#xD;
           in less cumulative neurotoxicity and an increased use of second-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Questions and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whether a novel treatment regimen comprised of biweekly FOLFOX alternating with&#xD;
                FOLFIRI as a first-line therapy for patients with previously untreated metastatic&#xD;
                GE cancers is as effective and less toxic compared to the other available two- and&#xD;
                three-drug regimens?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whether an early fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan&#xD;
                response and other biomarkers correlate with better PFS and OS in patients with&#xD;
                metastatic GE cancer who are treated with FOLFOX alternating with FOLFIRI?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  What is rate of second-line therapy in patients with metastatic GE cancer who&#xD;
                received first-line FOLFOX alternating with FOLFIRI?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We hypothesize that this novel regimen FOLFOX-FOLFIRI is less toxic but at least as&#xD;
                effective as the other two- and three-drug regimens available in metastatic GE&#xD;
                cancer and that an early FDG-PET response is associate with a better PFS rate. We&#xD;
                also hypothesize that this novel regimen is associated with low rate of decline in&#xD;
                QOL at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate progression-free survival of patients with metastatic GE cancer who are&#xD;
                treated with FOLFOX-FOLFIRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine correlation between various clinical and pathological biomarkers&#xD;
                including an early FDG-PET scan response and progression free survival and QOL of&#xD;
                patients who are treated with FOLFOX-FOLFIRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the quality of life of patients who are treated with FOLFOX alternating&#xD;
                with FOLFIRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the response rate, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of&#xD;
                patients who are treated with FOLFOX alternating with FOLFIRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate treatment toxicities, including the rate of neurotoxicity with FOLFOX&#xD;
                alternating with FOLFIRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Eligibility Criteria 4.1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adult patients (≥18 years older) with histologically proven HER2 negative&#xD;
                adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma of the esophagus, GE junction&#xD;
                tumors, and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurable or assessable metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Performance status World Health Organization (WHO) 0-2 and life expectancy of&#xD;
                greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No previous chemotherapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequate functioning of the bone marrow, liver, and kidneys. 4.2 Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Breastfeeding or pregnancy.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Cerebral metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe or uncompensated concomitant medical conditions including peripheral&#xD;
                neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The LOGIC trial is a single arm phase 2 study. 5.2 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Based on response rates of 40-50% with combination chemotherapy in the randomized&#xD;
                trials, to achieve 80% power the required sample in this single arm study is N=36&#xD;
                with 5% significance level and two-sided test. At this power we will be able to do&#xD;
                appropriate analyses and meaningful comparison of efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Recruitment timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Each year approximately 100 patients are diagnosed with gastric, esophageal, and&#xD;
           gastro-esophageal cancer in Saskatchewan. Unfortunately, most patients either have&#xD;
           advanced disease at diagnosis or develop recurrent cancer after curative treatment.&#xD;
           Based on that we estimated that each month we will be able to recruit 2 to 3 patients at&#xD;
           the two major cancer centers (the Saskatoon Cancer Center and the Allan Blair Cancer&#xD;
           Center) in Saskatchewan and recruitment will be completed in 18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Response rates and stable disease rates will be summarized by percentages and their&#xD;
           95% CI. Survival curves will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences&#xD;
           between groups will be analyzed using log-rank test. The efficacy and toxicities of this&#xD;
           novel regime will be compared with the historical control from the publish literature.&#xD;
           Correlation will be significant at the 0.05 level (two tailed). Univariate analyses will&#xD;
           be done to assess various clinical and pathologic factors for their correlation with&#xD;
           prognosis and if feasible a multivariate analysis will be performed. Linear mixed models&#xD;
           will be used to assess changes over time for overall QOL and for separate components of&#xD;
           QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Chemotherapy Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 FOLFOX Drug Dosage Timing Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 Day 1 Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 Day 1&#xD;
           Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 Day 1 Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 48 hrs infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for patients with ECOG P 6.2 FOLFIRI Drug Dosage Timing Irinotican 180 mg/m2 Day 1&#xD;
                Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 Day 1 Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 Day 1 Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 48&#xD;
                hrs infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for patients with ECOG P&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assessment, interventions, and follow-up visits 7.1 Baseline Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pretreatment patient evaluation includes a complete clinical history and physical&#xD;
                examination, full blood counts, renal and liver function tests (bilirubin, AST,&#xD;
                alkaline phosphatase), albumin, electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, serum&#xD;
                carcinoembryonic (CEA) level measurements, and CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and&#xD;
                pelvis (a baseline scan within 4 weeks of start of treatment, and then with every&#xD;
                4th cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Responses will be evaluated with standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
                Tumors (RECIST) by means of CT scans and will be complemented by an FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
                scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Patients will be seen prior to the second cycle of FOLFOX and FOLFIRI and before every&#xD;
           other infusion with medical history, examination and CBC and differential, platelets,&#xD;
           creatinine, LFT's (bilirubin, AST, alkaline phosphatase), electrolytes, albumin, and&#xD;
           blood Pressure measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 Dose Modification&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
                Toxicity Criteria Version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific drug reductions and management of neurotoxicity will be made in accordance&#xD;
                with published recommendations for FOLFOX and FOLFIRI at the discretion of treating&#xD;
                oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.4 Response Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Responses will be evaluated with standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
           (RECIST) by means of CT scans and will be complemented by an FDG-PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.5 Treatment Duration A maximum of 12 cycles is planned, but treatment could be&#xD;
           continued off the protocol in patients without disease progression in cases of clinical&#xD;
           benefit. Second-line chemotherapy will be left to the discretion of the treating&#xD;
           physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life (QOL) focuses on patient construct. Physical health, functional&#xD;
                status, sexual, and psychosocial domains are considered key elements in QOL&#xD;
                measurement. The European Organization for Research and the Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
                (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) along with the EORTC&#xD;
                Esophago-Gastric Cancer Module (QLQ-OG25).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a widely used instrument for measuring general cancer QOL. It&#xD;
                consists of 30 items and patients responses are transformed to produce 0-100 scores&#xD;
                on five functional scales, nine symptom scales and a scale representing global&#xD;
                quality of life. Higher functional scale scores indicate better QOL whereas higher&#xD;
                symptom scale/item scores indicate higher level of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The QLQ-OG25 has six scales, dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, odynophagia,&#xD;
                pain and anxiety. The QLQ-OG25 is recommended to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 when&#xD;
                assessing HRQL in patients with esophageal, junctional or gastric cancer (16). Both&#xD;
                English and French versions of questionnaire are available. The QOL will be&#xD;
                measured at baseline and then every four weeks till disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Correlative science&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positron Emission Tomography is commonly used to complement anatomic imaging in&#xD;
                cancer management (17). A CT-PET scan allows for images representing both anatomic&#xD;
                and metabolic properties. A PET/CT has emerged as an effective tool for diagnostic&#xD;
                and therapeutic evaluation in many types of cancers, including GE cancers. Evidence&#xD;
                has suggested that FDG-PET/CT seems to be an effective noninvasive tool for&#xD;
                response assessment in GE cancer (18,19). Early FDG-PET response will be correlated&#xD;
                with PFS and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In addition, the correlation between outcomes and various biomarkers such as tumor&#xD;
                grade, lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio, E-cadherin, fibroblast growth factor&#xD;
                receptor, TP53, and microsatellite instability will be evaluated.&#xD;
                Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin embedded tumor specimens using antibodies&#xD;
                against several biomarkers including P53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, E-cadherin,&#xD;
                fibroblast growth factor receptor, and Ki-67 will be performed. In addition, we&#xD;
                will use the plasma proteome database (http://www.plasmaproteomedatabase.org) to&#xD;
                identify novel biomarkers. The purpose of these analyses is to identify&#xD;
                differentially expressed tumor-specific genes that code for the plasma proteome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will select tumor markers based on their gradient of differential expression and&#xD;
                examine at least four markers using ELISA assays in patient's plasma samples (at 0&#xD;
                and 2 months of treatment) to assess their predictive and prognostic values.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Based on the indirect evidence that anthracycline-containing triplets such as ECF&#xD;
                or EOX or docetaxel-containing triplets such as DCF are more toxic but not superior&#xD;
                to fluoropyrimidine doublets such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, this study aims to develop&#xD;
                an effective novel but potentially less toxic regimen in the management of&#xD;
                metastatic GE cancers, offering the possibility of longer disease control as a&#xD;
                result of 100% exposure to two active doublets in a first-line treatment setting&#xD;
                and an improvement in the rate of salvage second line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Furthermore, this study will evaluate an early FDG-PET/CT response and various&#xD;
                other clinical and pathological variables and their correlation with PFS and QOL&#xD;
                using this novel regimen with an ultimate goal to improve care of this highly fatal&#xD;
                cancer. The results will be used for future collaboration and development of a late&#xD;
                phase trial at the national level.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Knowledge Translation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The research findings will be presented to health professionals, patients and their&#xD;
                family and decision makers using various platform. The findings will be shared with&#xD;
                P &amp; T committee and PFAC members. The result will be presented to the Western&#xD;
                Canadian Gastrointestinal Cancer groups. The findings will be published in the peer&#xD;
                reviewed scientific journals and will be presented at international, national and&#xD;
                local conferences.&#xD;
