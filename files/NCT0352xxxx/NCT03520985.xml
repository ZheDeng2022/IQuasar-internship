  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pomalidomide is an approved treatment for refractory multiple myeloma. Toxicity of&#xD;
      pomalidomide in the pivotal MM-003 trial, was considerable, with 60% of patients experiencing&#xD;
      drug-related G3/4 toxicity. Neutropenia (48% vs 16%) and pneumonia (13% vs 8%) were&#xD;
      significantly more common in the pomalidomide arm. This resulted in frequent dose&#xD;
      interruptions (67%) and dose reductions (27%). This suggests that for the majority of&#xD;
      patients the 4 mg daily dosing schedule is too toxic, and that strategies to deliver reduced&#xD;
      dosing of pomalidomide are of high practical relevance. The aim of this trial therefore is to&#xD;
      establish that alternate day dosing of pomalidomide (4 mg q2d, d1-28) is non-inferior to&#xD;
      daily dosing (4 mg d1-21 q28) in terms of efficacy of the drug with potentially less side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 1% of all cancers and ∼10% of all hematological&#xD;
      malignancies. Despite recent advances in myeloma treatment, including the introduction of&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and stem cell transplantation, myeloma&#xD;
      remains an incurable disease. The treatment of bortezomib and lenalidomide refractory myeloma&#xD;
      is still an unmet medical need. Once patients have relapsed after IMiD-containing therapies&#xD;
      and have become bortezomib-resistant, their prognosis is extremely poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is a third-generation, Swissmedic approved, oral immunomodulatory drug with&#xD;
      activity in such patients. However the toxicity of pomalidomide in the pivotal MM-003 trial&#xD;
      was considerable, with 60% of patients experiencing drug-related G3/4 toxicity. Neutropenia&#xD;
      (48% vs 16%) and pneumonia (13% vs 8%) were significantly more common in the pomalidomide&#xD;
      arm. This resulted in frequent dose interruptions (67%) and dose reductions (27%). This&#xD;
      suggests that for the majority of patients the 4 mg daily dosing schedule (4 mg daily on 21&#xD;
      of 28 days) is toxic, and that strategies to deliver reduced dosing of pomalidomide are of&#xD;
      high practical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative dosing schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is robust data available indicating that lower pomalidomide doses (e.g. 2 mg daily)&#xD;
      lead to similar responses and progression free survival with fewer side effects. Due to its&#xD;
      unique pharmacological characteristics, pomalidomide is well suited for alternate day dosing.&#xD;
      The decline of the plasma concentration at the terminal phase is slow. These data make&#xD;
      pomalidomide an ideal candidate for alternate day dosing. Therefore, a phase I study has&#xD;
      already been conducted in 2008 to test the alternating administration of the drug showing&#xD;
      excellent responses with a marked reduction of thrombotic events and less severe&#xD;
      myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug costs of pomalidomide are quite high. Interestingly, the manufacturer determined a&#xD;
      pricing model that is independent from the capsule strength (costs for one capsule 1 mg=2&#xD;
      mg=3 mg=4 mg). In patients requiring dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity, daily&#xD;
      dosing of reduced strength pomalidomide (e.g. 2 mg daily) is approved and suggested by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. This delivers 50% less pomalidomide to the patient, albeit at 100% of the price&#xD;
      of full dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the establishment of the modified pomalidomide schedule would be an interesting&#xD;
      option for our patients to achieve similar efficacy with fewer side effects. In addition, it&#xD;
      would optimize the cost-effectiveness of the drug.&#xD;
