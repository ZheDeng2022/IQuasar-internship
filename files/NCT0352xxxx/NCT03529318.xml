  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are types of chronic intestinal disorder called&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that can affect the small and large bowel causing symptoms&#xD;
      of abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, and weight loss. Irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS) is a milder form of IBD, with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea or&#xD;
      constipation, and blood in the stool. It is not known what causes diseases such as IBD and&#xD;
      IBS. This study will look at the events in the gut that leads to leaky gut and inflammation&#xD;
      in patients with IBD and IBS. The study will also see if medications such as rifaximin and&#xD;
      mesalamine may reduce the amount of leaky gut.&#xD;

    <description>1) Patients scheduled for endoscopy (EGD or colonoscopy) for IBD will be consented to allow physicians who are performing endoscopies to take additional biopsies and blood samples for &quot;research purposes&quot;.</description>

        The subject population includes patients with known Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and&#xD;
        indeterminant colitis. Patients will be recruited after they check in to the endoscopy&#xD;
        unit, and before their endoscopic procedure, prior to any pre-procedure sedation&#xD;
        medications having been given. All participants are undergoing endoscopy with biopsy for&#xD;
        surveillance, screening, , diagnosis , or assessment of treatment. If no biopsy specimens&#xD;
        are taken from subjects for diagnosis, no biopsy samples are taken for research purposes.&#xD;
        The subject enrollment goal is 60 separate subjects with Crohn's disease, ulcerative&#xD;
        colitis and indeterminant colitis or Irritable bowel syndrome. The subjects' participation&#xD;
        will be limited to in the endoscopy suite.&#xD;
