  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers believe that clinical care can be improved by engaging patients and families&#xD;
      directly in planning the care process. Engagement efforts have included asking&#xD;
      patients/families to provide information about whether they are getting better. But what does&#xD;
      &quot;getting better&quot; mean? The merits of surveys, questionnaires, or rating scales have been&#xD;
      widely discussed. Should they be disorder-specific or global? What should the investigators&#xD;
      do if patients have difficulty reading or understanding these instruments? Investigators in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom have proposed a simple solution: ask the patients and families what their&#xD;
      primary goal treatment goal is and track progress together on that goal (Goal-Based Outcomes&#xD;
      or GBO). Although there has been some work to suggest that this is helpful, it has never been&#xD;
      tested in a controlled way. This study will do a randomized controlled trial to test whether&#xD;
      GBO improves clinical care in child and youth mental health. Although the study will use this&#xD;
      in child and youth mental health care, if it is successful, it can be tested and applied in&#xD;
      any care setting with any type of medical problem. This could change practice at the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) and throughout Canada.&#xD;
