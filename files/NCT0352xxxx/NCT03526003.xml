      This study is an observational study measuring the esophageal pressure in anesthetized&#xD;
      surgical patient undergoing changes in posture and pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective observational study. Following approval by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board, the study will be performed in a prospective, longitudinal cohort manner.&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery aged between 20 and 60 years will be&#xD;
      included. Each participant signed an informed consent. Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
      respiratory pathology, a body mass index lower than 18 or higher than 40 kg/m2, esophageal&#xD;
      pathology and previous esophageal or pulmonary operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following induction of anesthesia using fentanyl 2-5 microgram/kg, propofol 1-3 mg/kg and&#xD;
      muscle relaxation with rocuronium 0.6-0.8 mg/kg, the trachea will be intubated using a 7-8 mm&#xD;
      ID endotracheal tube. Mechanical ventilation in a volume controlled mode with a tidal volume&#xD;
      6-8 ml/kg and a PEEP of 5 cm of water will be initiated at a rate of 12-16 breaths per minute&#xD;
      using an anesthesia machine (Fabius GS Premium, Drägerwerk AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Lübeck, Germany).&#xD;
      Balanced general anesthesia will be maintained by sevoflurane and fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal balloon catheter will be placed according to manufacturer instructions 9. In&#xD;
      brief, the stomach will be decompressed and suctioned with an 18 F orogastric tube. This tube&#xD;
      will be also utilized to estimate the depth of the lower esophageal sphincter, a measure that&#xD;
      will be corroborated with external simulation of the approximate distance from the gastric&#xD;
      opening to the nares. A lubricated 86 cm long closed-tip catheter with a 9.5 cm long balloon&#xD;
      catheter at its distal end will be gently inserted via one nostril and advanced into the&#xD;
      esophagus. The calculated depth aiding in positioning the balloon at the lower third of the&#xD;
      thoracic cavity at about 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter, as guided by catheter&#xD;
      markings, will be the product of patient height x 0.288. This location had been verified by&#xD;
      the external measurements at described above. An extension tubing will be attached to the Y&#xD;
      piece at the proximal ending of the catheter and connected to a syringe and a pre-calibrated&#xD;
      pressure transducer via a 3-way stopcock. One ml of air will be injected into the balloon so&#xD;
      that it became semi inflated, and the tracing on the pressure monitor will be adjusted with&#xD;
      additional small amounts of air until no flattening or damping will be noted in the pressure&#xD;
      waveform. When properly positioned, the catheter will be secured with tape to prevent&#xD;
      movement or extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal pressure will be continuously measured via a calibrated pressure transducer system&#xD;
      (Art-Line ,BioMetrix, Kiryat Mada, Jerusalem, Israel) connected to a patient monitor (Datex&#xD;
      AS/3, Datex Ohmeda Medical Equipment, GE Healthcare, USA) and recorded using a designated&#xD;
      computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal pressure will be documented with the patient at horizontal position, and with the&#xD;
      head up, operating table elevated 20 cm (anti Trendelenburg position) and head down,&#xD;
      operating table lowill bed 20 cm (Trendelenburg position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following peritoneal access and trocar insertion, the peritoneal cavity will be gradually&#xD;
      inflated with carbon dioxide by a laparoscopy insufflator (UHI-4 High Flow Insufflation Unit,&#xD;
      Olympus Corporation Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) and esophageal pressure will be recorded at&#xD;
      a stable peritoneal pressure of 5, 10 and 15 mmHg. Following complete peritoneal inflation,&#xD;
      the esophageal balloon catheter will be removed and recording terminated.&#xD;
