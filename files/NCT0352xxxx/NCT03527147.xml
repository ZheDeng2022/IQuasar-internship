    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 platform protocol designed to evaluate various targeted agents for the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Each study arm will&#xD;
      be conducted in a predefined disease subset. All study arms are open label and allocation to&#xD;
      each study arm will not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this master platform protocol has multiple study arms, subjects can be screened for&#xD;
      several study arms at once. Likewise, a subject who ends participation in one study arm may&#xD;
      be rescreened for participation in another (separate) study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of targeted agents for the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This protocol has a&#xD;
      modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added via protocol&#xD;
      amendment.&#xD;
