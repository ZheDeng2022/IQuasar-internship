  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular disorder characterized by attacks of severe&#xD;
      headache, autonomic nervous system dysfunction and, in some patients, aura, and disabling&#xD;
      neurological symptoms. Worldwide, migraine prevalence is as high as 18% in the general&#xD;
      population. Increased frequency of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in migraineurs was first&#xD;
      reported in 1998 in a case-control study. Since then, others have described a 60% prevalence&#xD;
      of PFO in patients suffering from migraine with aura. The presence of a right-to-left shunt&#xD;
      (RLS) is thought to be a potent trigger of migraine attacks, although the mechanism is&#xD;
      unknown. Moreover, PFO closure has correlated with improved migraine symptoms in several&#xD;
      retrospective uncontrolled studies. The aim of this single-center, prospective study is to&#xD;
      assess the impact of PFO closure on migraine attacks over time together with evaluation of&#xD;
      potential predictive risk factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study will evaluate the results of approximately 100 subjects from a single center study&#xD;
      registered in this trial. Subjects who experienced transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke&#xD;
      with a clinical indication to PFO closure and symptomatic for migraine with/o aura are&#xD;
      considered for a migraine score analysis at baseline before PFO closure and during the&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up (FU) at 6 and 12-months, together with lab evaluation for platelet&#xD;
      reactivity tests (P selectin, Thromboxane B2), Prostaglandin E1 and 2 (PGE1, PGE2),&#xD;
      serotonin, cytokines and prostaglandin PGE1 urinary metabolite run under aspirin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the presence of a large PFO have any impact on migraine with aura?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do migraineurs with aura and PFO have higher biomarkers of platelet activation than control&#xD;
      patients? and are they at higher risk of stroke and TIA recurrences based on high on&#xD;
      clopidogrel platelet reactivity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effect of PFO severity on monthly migraine frequency and aura frequency?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the result of PFO closure in migraineur patients with PFO? Do Migraine with aura&#xD;
      patients with large PFO have higher platelet activation and better migraine resolution after&#xD;
      PFO closure?&#xD;

            <description>We enrolled consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria, symptomatic for migraine alone and Migraine with aura (MHA) patients. Eight patients refused to continue the study and eight were non-compliant to antiplatelet therapy during the follow-up. .&#xD;
The leading indication to PFO closure was a previous TIA or stroke in 37 patients while an off-label indication was offered to 25 patients. These pts underwent PFO closure with the Occlutech Figulla device and treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 100 mg/day + Clopidogrel 75 mg/day), followed by aspirin 100 mg/day alone.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>MHA may have a multifactorial etiology. The role of oxidative stress appears consistent and corroborated by the in vitro data. The effect of serotonin and oxidative stress was tested on platelets from healthy subjects and not from pts because the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic imposed restrictions on pts enrolment. Finally, the thrombin generation capacity of platelets and MVs were included after the study started to support the pro-coagulant phenotype evidenced by ad interim flow cytometry data analysis</limitations_and_caveats>
