    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 18 in Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd Version (PDSS-2) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) consists of 15 questions about various sleep and nocturnal disturbances which are to be rated by the patients using one of five categories, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Patients were asked to rate the severity of each question based on their experience during the past week (7 days) from 0 (Never) to 4 (Very often, that meant 6 to 7 days a week). PDSS-2 total score ranges from 0 (no disturbance) to 60 (maximum nocturnal disturbance).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nocturnal Hypokinesia Questionnaire (NHQ) Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Nocturnal Hypokinesia Questionnaire (NHQ) is designed to assess hypokinesia symptoms in night in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, composed of two sections. Section 1 is assessed by PD patients with 10 one-point items evaluating &quot;turning over in bed&quot;, &quot;getting out of bed&quot;, &quot;parkinsonian motor symptoms&quot;, and &quot;others&quot;. Section 2 is assessed by spouses or caregivers who are with the patients during the night with 10 one-point items evaluating the same aspects as Section 1. The score for each section is by summing up points from the items in the respective section. Score of each of the two Sections is from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. The score was reported by section: Section 1 by patients, Section 2 by caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA)-Sleep Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>SCOPA-Sleep score is composed of three parts: a night-time scale (5 item scale with 4 Response Options (0-not at all to 3-very much) addressing night time disturbances. Total night-time scale score runs from 0 to 15, with a higher score indicating more severe problems, a single-item about perceived quality of nocturnal sleep (7-point scale ranging from slept very well to slept very badly.), and a daytime sleepiness scale (6 items with 4 Response options, from 0 (never) to 3 (often), and a maximum total score of 18.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Morning Off (EMO) Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The EMO is measured by the question of &quot;do you feel like your bodily movements are poor when you wake up?&quot; Patients answered this question according to the frequency during the previous one week by scoring from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very often&quot; or &quot;6 to 7 days a week&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate for Early Morning Off (EMO) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The responder of EMO is the patient with an improvement of at least 1 comparing to his/her baseline condition. The EMO is measured by the question of &quot;do you feel like your bodily movements are poor when you wake up?&quot; Patients answered this question according to the frequency during the previous one week by scoring from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very often&quot; or &quot;6 to 7 days a week&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-8 Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-8 is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 8 questions regarding the subject's disease symptoms. The total score summed up the items together and transformed onto a score from 0 (never have problems/issues) to 100 (always have problems or cannot do at all).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate for Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The responder of CGI-I is the patient rated of any improvement (1 = Very much better, 2 = Much better, or 3 = A little better). The CGI-I was rated (from 1: very much improved, to 7: very much worse) by the same evaluator to assess the overall status of Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This 2-stage open-label, randomised, active controlled parallel group study compared the efficacy and safety of Pramipexole Sustained Release versus Immediate Release administered orally over an 18-week treatment on nocturnal symptoms in patients on Levodopa combined with a Dopa-Decarboxylase-inhibitor with advanced Parkinson's disease.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Parkinson's disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) consists of 15 questions about various sleep and nocturnal disturbances which are to be rated by the patients using one of five categories, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Patients were asked to rate the severity of each question based on their experience during the past week (7 days) from 0 (Never) to 4 (Very often, that meant 6 to 7 days a week). PDSS-2 total score ranges from 0 (no disturbance) to 60 (maximum nocturnal disturbance).</description>

        <title>Nocturnal Hypokinesia Questionnaire (NHQ) Score (Change From Baseline)</title>
        <description>The Nocturnal Hypokinesia Questionnaire (NHQ) is designed to assess hypokinesia symptoms in night in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, composed of two sections. Section 1 is assessed by PD patients with 10 one-point items evaluating &quot;turning over in bed&quot;, &quot;getting out of bed&quot;, &quot;parkinsonian motor symptoms&quot;, and &quot;others&quot;. Section 2 is assessed by spouses or caregivers who are with the patients during the night with 10 one-point items evaluating the same aspects as Section 1. The score for each section is by summing up points from the items in the respective section. Score of each of the two Sections is from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. The score was reported by section: Section 1 by patients, Section 2 by caregivers.</description>
