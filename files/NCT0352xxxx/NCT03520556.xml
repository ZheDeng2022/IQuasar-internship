  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1&#xD;
      cause of death globally. Systemic and local tissue inflammation is now recognized as a key&#xD;
      etiological process leading to CVD. Hence, elevated blood levels of inflammation markers are&#xD;
      classified among the well-established risk factors for the development of CVD. Among&#xD;
      nutritional strategies to prevent and/or reduce chronic inflammation, long-chain omega 3 PUFA&#xD;
      (LCn-3PUFA), notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have raised&#xD;
      tremendous interest for their purported anti-inflammatory effects. Previous meta-analysis of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) substantiated the anti-inflammatory effect of LCn-3PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation as evidenced by significant reductions in plasma concentrations of specific&#xD;
      inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha). However, it is stressed that almost all of the reported RCTs have used a mix of&#xD;
      EPA and DHA in various ratios, as EPA and DHA occur concomitantly and naturally in food (fish&#xD;
      oils) and in most dietary supplements. Yet, several recent RCTs have recently been undertaken&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that not all LCn-3PUFAs are equal, at least when it comes to their&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. Accordingly, there is increasing interest and evidence for&#xD;
      potential distinctive effects of DHA compared to EPA on systemic inflammation, raising the&#xD;
      question: Is DHA a more potent anti-inflammatory nutrient than EPA? To formally answer this&#xD;
      question, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to assess and compare&#xD;
      the individual anti-inflammatory effects of DHA and of EPA. The present work will be a&#xD;
      pairwise and network meta-analysis focusing on RCTs comparing the effects of EPA and DHA on&#xD;
      surrogate markers of systemic inflammation. The findings generated by these analyses will&#xD;
      provide invaluable and timely comparative information on the specific efficacy of DHA and EPA&#xD;
      as one of the key nutritional modalities for the treatment of chronic inflammation in&#xD;
      high-risk men and women. This is important considering that LCn-3PUFA supplements are&#xD;
      increasingly being used by the population and an ever growing market in the dietary&#xD;
      supplements' industry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Increased systemic inflammation is positively correlated with the risk for CVD.&#xD;
      Among nutritional strategies to prevent and/or reduce chronic inflammation, long-chain omega&#xD;
      3 PUFA (LCn-3PUFA), notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have&#xD;
      raised tremendous interest for their purported anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for the proposed research: New emerging data from RCTs suggesting distinct effects of&#xD;
      DHA and EPA on systemic inflammation calls for a formal analysis of existing data through a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis, which are considered the gold standard of evidence to&#xD;
      inform dietary guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To conduct a pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs in humans to compare the&#xD;
      effects of DHA and EPA on surrogate markers of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and The PRISMA Extension&#xD;
      Statement for conducting Network Meta-analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library will be searched using appropriate&#xD;
      search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: RCTs of ≥7 days duration that have specifically compared the effects of DHA&#xD;
      to those of EPA, or RCTs that have assessed the effects of DHA or EPA individually compared&#xD;
      with a placebo (control), in which changes in plasma concentration of inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      namely C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha) and adiponectin, were study outcomes. Literature published in languages other&#xD;
      than English or French will be not considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Titles and abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy will be&#xD;
      screened independently by two investigators to identify studies that potentially meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria outlined above. The full text of these potentially eligible studies will&#xD;
      be retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two investigators with&#xD;
      disagreements being resolved by consensus. Extracted information will include: first author's&#xD;
      name, publication year, study design, sample size, subject characteristics (for example sex,&#xD;
      age, health and body weight status), EPA and DHA doses, EPA and DHA forms, trial duration,&#xD;
      composition of the control supplement, inflammation markers studied and the statistical&#xD;
      approach for data analysis. Mean ± SEM differences between various treatments will be&#xD;
      extracted for all endpoints. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive&#xD;
      missing variance data. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.&#xD;
      The overall quality and strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Risk of&#xD;
      bias for network meta-analysis will incorporate assessment of transitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Four outcomes will be assessed: 1) plasma CRP 2) plasma IL-6, 3) plasma TNF-alpha&#xD;
      and 4) plasma adiponectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: We will use standard Cochrane methods for pairwise meta-analysis and augment&#xD;
      this evidence using network meta-analysis methods. Mean differences will be pooled for direct&#xD;
      comparisons (DHA vs. EPA) using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model will be used even&#xD;
      in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. We will&#xD;
      present the pooled estimates as mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. We will&#xD;
      perform a frequentist network meta-analysis using multivariate meta-analysis model using&#xD;
      'network' suite of commands available in STATA. Mean differences will be pooled for direct&#xD;
      comparisons (DHA vs. EPA) and indirect comparisons (DHA vs. placebo and EPA vs. placebo using&#xD;
      placebo as the common comparator). We will present the contribution of direct and indirect&#xD;
      evidence to mixed evidence using contribution plots. Assumption of consistency will be tested&#xD;
      using design-by-treatment model. Paired analyses will be applied for crossover trials.&#xD;
      Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I2. To&#xD;
      explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study&#xD;
      is systematically removed. If there are more than 10 studies, we will also explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity using meta-regression analyses and a priori defined subgroup analyses such as&#xD;
      body weight status (normal-weight, overweight, obese), health status (for example diabetes,&#xD;
      CVD), age, sex, dose, baseline measurements for each outcome, study design (parallel,&#xD;
      crossover), study duration, risk of bias, and individual domains of risk of bias.&#xD;
      Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroup&#xD;
      analyses. When more than 10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by&#xD;
      inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger test and the Begg test. If&#xD;
      publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by&#xD;
      imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results from this systematic review and meta-analysis will be&#xD;
      disseminated through traditional means such as interactive presentations at local, national,&#xD;
      and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target&#xD;
      audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in&#xD;
      nutrition, inflammation, and CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The findings generated by this analysis will provide invaluable and timely&#xD;
      comparative information on the specific efficacy of DHA and EPA as one of the key nutritional&#xD;
      modalities for the treatment of chronic inflammation in high-risk men and women. This is&#xD;
      important considering that LCn-3PUFA supplements are increasingly being used by the&#xD;
      population and an ever growing market in the dietary supplements' industry.&#xD;
