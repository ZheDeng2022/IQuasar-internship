  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical and psychological stress on Warfighters during training and operational missions can&#xD;
      suppress immune responsiveness. Skin wound models can be used to detect changes in immune&#xD;
      function. Investigators have recently demonstrated that relatively modest sleep disruption&#xD;
      degrades immune response at the site of the disrupted skin barrier and delays the initial&#xD;
      restoration of the skin barrier. Provision of additional protein and a multi-nutrient&#xD;
      beverage during and after sleep restriction seems to mitigate decrements in local immune&#xD;
      function, without producing detectable effects on initial restoration of the skin barrier.&#xD;
      However, the prior work used a parallel-group study design and inter-subject variability may&#xD;
      have made it more difficult to detect significant differences in skin barrier restoration&#xD;
      between participants receiving the nutrition intervention versus those receiving the placebo.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the proposed cross-over study is to test the efficacy of a&#xD;
      multi-nutrient beverage and additional protein (1.5 g protein per kg body weight versus 0.9 g&#xD;
      protein per kg body weight) on immune function and the initial restoration of the skin&#xD;
      barrier consequent to an operational stressor (i.e., 72-h sleep restriction). The effect of&#xD;
      sleep restriction on a friend-foe marksmanship task, flow state, and measures of cognitive&#xD;
      and neuromotor performance, will be investigated as a sub-study (Appendix A). Additionally,&#xD;
      the effects of sleep restriction on appetite physiology, eating behaviors and intestinal&#xD;
      permeability will be tested. Research will be conducted in a laboratory environment using&#xD;
      male and female Soldiers from the human research participant detachment (NSRDEC), or Soldiers&#xD;
      or civilians at NSRDEC and/or USARIEM. Participants in the study described herein (n = 20)&#xD;
      will be exposed, in a single-blind, cross-over design to a ~72 hour normal sleep control&#xD;
      phase, and to 2 periods of ~72 hours of sleep restriction (monitored in laboratory with ~2-h&#xD;
      sleep per night) during which time eight blisters will be induced via suction on&#xD;
      participant's forearm and the top layer of blisters will be removed to reveal the dermal&#xD;
      layer of skin. In the normal sleep trial, participants will consume ~0.9 g protein per kg&#xD;
      body weight per day and a placebo beverage during (3 days). In the first sleep restriction&#xD;
      trial, participants will consume ~0.9 g protein per kg body weight per day and a placebo&#xD;
      beverage during (3 days) and after (5 days) sleep restriction; and, in the second sleep&#xD;
      restriction trial (after at least two weeks wash-out) participants will instead consume ~1.5&#xD;
      g protein per kg body weight and a multi-nutrient beverage (arginine: 20 g·d-1, glutamine: 30&#xD;
      g·d-1, zinc sulfate: 24 mg·d-1, vitamin C: 400 mg·d-1, vitamin D3: 800 IU·d-1 and omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids: 1 g·d-1). Outcome measures include immune function (e.g., circulating markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, cytokines at the blister site, and secretory immunoglobin A), skin barrier&#xD;
      restoration time (by transepidermal water loss), subjective appetite ratings,&#xD;
      appetite-mediating hormone concentrations, food preferences and cravings, gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition, and intestinal permeability. Findings from this study will determine if a&#xD;
      nutritional intervention attenuates the loss of immune responsiveness to a military relevant&#xD;
      stressor (i.e., sleep restriction), and will determine the effects of acute sleep restriction&#xD;
      on appetite, gut microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability.&#xD;
