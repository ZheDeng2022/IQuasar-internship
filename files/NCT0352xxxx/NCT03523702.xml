    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore if, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 (a marker associated with benefits from&#xD;
      immunotherapy), a combination of immunotherapy and a personalized 4-week radiotherapy course&#xD;
      could be more effective than standard treatment, which is a combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sequential pembrolizumab (200&#xD;
      mg every three weeks) and accelerated, dose-painted radiotherapy for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. Patients with PD-L1 expression &lt; 50% will also be&#xD;
      enrolled and treated with standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy to serve as a non-randomized&#xD;
      comparison group.&#xD;

    <description>Patients whose tumors are found to have high (≥ 50%) PD-L1 expression will automatically be placed in the PembroRT group. These patients will receive three intravenous treatments with pembrolizumab, followed by four weeks of daily radiotherapy, followed by up to 12 more treatments with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is given as an intravenous infusion once every three weeks. This treatment course will last, in total, up to one year.</description>

    <description>Patients whose tumors are found to have low (&lt; 50%) PD-L1 expression will automatically be placed in the ChemoRT group. These patients will receive radiotherapy over a course of four to seven weeks. During radiotherapy, patients will also receive two standard chemotherapy agents (carboplatin and paclitaxel) once each week. Following completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients may receive additional treatments with chemotherapy or immunotherapy as part of routine care. These treatments are optional and are not required by this clinical trial.</description>
