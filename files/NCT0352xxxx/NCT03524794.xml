    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and death with approximately&#xD;
      3% of the world's population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New drug therapies called new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have been developed and have&#xD;
      proven to be well tolerated with minimal side effects. The current costs of these agents are&#xD;
      extremely high, however, they provide an opportunity to cure most patients of HCV if they can&#xD;
      access and adhere to treatment. The bigger challenge is to engage and cure underserved groups&#xD;
      who are not accessing medical care, or who have other complex problems, including&#xD;
      homelessness, incarceration, and substance misuse problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to improve HCV case detection and case management have much to learn from other&#xD;
      infectious diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) disproportionately affects in large part the same&#xD;
      group of individuals and community models of care have been used with great success.&#xD;
      Strategies such as active case finding, community based screening and treatment, directly&#xD;
      observed therapy (DOT) and peer support have all shown high rates of case detection and&#xD;
      treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These strategies are currently being used by the Find&amp;Treat team, UCLH NHS Trust and this&#xD;
      study will ain in evaluating it's effectiveness. Previously used to aid homeless patients&#xD;
      engage with treatment services for TB, it is now being used with other disease groups such as&#xD;
      HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to assess the effectiveness of community based interventions&#xD;
      with peer support to improve case detection, carry out pre-treatment assessments and assist&#xD;
      underserved populations through HCV treatment by the Find&amp;Treat service.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hepatitis C infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and death throughout the&#xD;
           world1. Approximately 3% of the world's population is infected with hepatitis C virus&#xD;
           (HCV)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HCV is transmitted by blood and in the UK occurs primarily through injecting drug use.&#xD;
           Chronically infected people are at risk of progressive liver disease characterised by&#xD;
           hepatocellular inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
           (HCC). These complications develop only in a proportion of patients and only after many&#xD;
           years or decades of infection3. It has been estimated that up to 20% of chronically&#xD;
           infected individuals will develop cirrhosis of the liver over a 20 to 25 year period.&#xD;
           Approximately 3% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HCC per year3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           New drug therapies such as protease and polymerase inhibitors called direct-acting&#xD;
           antivirals (DAAs) have been developed in the last ten years and have recently been&#xD;
           licensed for use worldwide. These DAAs have proven to be very well tolerated with&#xD;
           minimal, and sometimes no, side effects. The current costs of these agents are extremely&#xD;
           high, limiting their use to select populations of infected patients. However, they&#xD;
           provide an opportunity to cure most patients with HCV if they can access and adhere to&#xD;
           treatment. A bigger challenge is to engage and cure those who are not accessing medical&#xD;
           care, or who have other complex problems, including homelessness, incarceration, and&#xD;
           substance misuse. These underserved populations are disproportionately affected by&#xD;
           infectious diseases such as HCV and face many challenges to access testing and adherence&#xD;
           to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There has been previously demonstrated a high prevalence (13% RNA detectable HCV4) of&#xD;
           chronic HCV infection among homeless people opportunistically screened at residential&#xD;
           hostels and day centres across London. Data from the HALT Hepatitis Study5 showed that&#xD;
           41% of HCV Ab positive recruits were homeless at enrolment and that over 60% of HCV&#xD;
           infected patients knew of their status but had disengaged from treatment services. This&#xD;
           population therefore includes a high number of undiagnosed cases and previously known&#xD;
           HCV positive cases who are not accessing treatment services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The epidemiology of HCV among homeless populations in the UK is poorly understood.&#xD;
           Currently there are no data on the extent of liver fibrosis in this population to inform&#xD;
           strategies for future management and estimate potential resource requirements to&#xD;
           effectively mobilise treatment to this vulnerable and underserved group. Early detection&#xD;
           of significant fibrosis is critical to prevent severe disease and death. Ongoing drug or&#xD;
           alcohol use is not a contra-indication to hepatitis C treatment, and research shows that&#xD;
           people who are actively using drugs can and should be treated for hepatitis C6. Point of&#xD;
           care tests (POCTs) mean that infection can be identified immediately in the community&#xD;
           reducing the risk of loss to follow up. Transient liver elastography (performed using&#xD;
           FibroScanÂ®) is now the gold standard in the assessment for liver fibrosis. FibroScanning&#xD;
           is a 5 minute non-invasive, painless procedure to accurately assess liver fibrosis with&#xD;
           high reproducibility7. This means that mush of what traditionally required several&#xD;
           hospital appointments can now be done in potentially one outreach session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Strategies to improve HCV case detection and management have much to learn from the&#xD;
           management of Tuberculosis (TB), a disease which affects the same group of individuals&#xD;
           and community models of care have been used with great success. Strategies such as&#xD;
           active case finding, community based screening and treatment, directly observed therapy&#xD;
           (DOT) and peer support have all shown high rates of case detection and treatment&#xD;
           completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Find&amp;Treat Mobile Health Unit (MHU) from UCLH NHS Trust provides health screening&#xD;
           for homeless individuals across various sites in London, UK such homeless hostels, day&#xD;
           centres and drug services. They are experienced in using outreach models of care and&#xD;
           peer advocates for infectious diseases such as TB to engage patients with specialist&#xD;
           care. As HCV treatment moves into the community there is a need to evaluate outreach&#xD;
           activities to inform future practice and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study aims to assess the effectiveness of community based interventions with peer&#xD;
           support to improve case detection, carry out pre-treatment assessments and assist&#xD;
           underserved populations through HCV treatment by the Find&amp;Treat service.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluate the effectiveness of the HCV community based detection and management including&#xD;
           screening, liver assessment and treatment support in underserved populations using&#xD;
           mobile health facilities and peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the proportion of homeless people with chronic HCV infection and their&#xD;
                degree of liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risk factors for HCV infection and for re-infection for those completing treatment&#xD;
                or testing negative at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Report this experience to inform the development of further programmes in the UK&#xD;
                and other EU countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study to establish the effectiveness of intensified community based&#xD;
      screening, liver assessment and supported treatment for homeless people and underserved&#xD;
      populations. Patients will be recruited from an NHS mobile health outreach service screening&#xD;
      individuals accessing homeless and drug services in London, UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrolment patient will be followed up for up to 12 months or until an appropriate&#xD;
      defined clinical end point is reached. Successful engagement with community based HCV&#xD;
      screening and treatment is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Successful pre-treatment assessment and a decision to not proceed by the clinician ii.&#xD;
      Engagement with treatment support (including offered, start or completion of therapy&#xD;
      according to individual circumstance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the HALT study (1) shows an effect size in improved engagement of 1.9.&#xD;
      To detect a 20% increase in individuals successfully engaging with community services, from a&#xD;
      baseline of 20%, we would need to recruit 164 individuals who are HCV positive (with 90%&#xD;
      power and 5% significance level) compared with 82 in the comparison group. The clinical team&#xD;
      would therefore have to screen 820 individuals assuming a rate of infection of 20%, which was&#xD;
      found in previous pilot study work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among those screened we will calculate the prevalence of hepatitis C infection and the&#xD;
      severity of disease in this population compared with published data and risk factors for&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection and re-infection for those achieving SVR or test negative. We will also&#xD;
      investigate the proportion completing treatment and factors associated with better treatment&#xD;
      completion and SVR using multivariable regression models. Statistical software used in the&#xD;
      analysis will be STATA version 14.1.&#xD;
