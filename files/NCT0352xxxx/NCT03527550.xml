  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether computer-based cognitive exercises are helpful for&#xD;
      reducing a specific type of impulsivity. Also, the study is testing whether these are&#xD;
      exercises are associated with specific changes in behavior and in the brain. Participants&#xD;
      will be psychiatric patients enrolled in a partial hospitalization program. Half of these&#xD;
      participants will receive usual treatment, and half will complete computer-based cognitive&#xD;
      exercises in addition to usual treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity has different components. One personality trait related to impulsivity, known as&#xD;
      &quot;urgency,&quot; is strongly related to many different mental health symptoms and risky behaviors.&#xD;
      Urgency refers to impulsivity specifically in the context of strong emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that higher levels of urgency are related to specific deficits in cognition.&#xD;
      Problems with response inhibition--the ability to cancel or withhold a planned action--are&#xD;
      associated with urgency. Also, research shows that difficulties in another aspect of&#xD;
      cognition--working memory--may moderate the relationship between inhibition deficits and&#xD;
      urgency. One previous study found that people who practiced computerized response inhibition&#xD;
      and working memory tasks for two weeks reported significant decreases in urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown if these computerized tasks would be helpful for reducing urgency in adults&#xD;
      with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it is unknown if changes in urgency are related to&#xD;
      changes in the brain mechanisms that help to support response inhibition. This study will&#xD;
      collect data on brain activity while people are completing response inhibition tasks.&#xD;

    <description>The SSRT (measured in ms) is the primary behavioral outcome measure of the Stop-Signal Response Inhibition task. It is an estimate of the average amount of time required to stop an action on this task.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at study completion (discharge), an average of two weeks. Baseline data and discharge data are shown separately below.</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluated the feasibility of using EEG to assess event-related potentials during the Stop-Signal task, in an acute partial hospital setting. This involves testing the percentage of participants who are able to complete and provide ERP data for the stop-signal task.</description>

    <measure>Average Perceived Helpfulness of Training</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion, an average of two weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a study-specific measure developed by the investigators to capture self-reported perceived helpfulness of the intervention. It consists of two separate questions that assess &quot;how helpful&quot; the Go/NoGo task and PASAT tasks were perceived to be. Each question is rated on a 1 (&quot;completely disagree&quot;) to 7 (&quot;completely agree&quot;) scale, with higher scores indicating better outcomes (i.e., greater perceived helpfulness of the task). Scores shown below are averages for each of these two items.</description>

The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>

            <description>Participants in this arm received daily computerized cognitive training sessions during partial hospitalization, in addition to treatment as usual. Cognitive training sessions alternated between response inhibition training and working memory training.&#xD;
Cognitive Control Training: Cognitive Control Training involves daily practice with one of two computerized interventions. The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>

Cognitive Control Training: Cognitive Control Training involves daily practice with one of two computerized interventions. The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>

The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>

          <description>This scale assesses self-reported difficulties tolerating distress. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater difficulties tolerating distress.</description>
          <population>Note: two participants in the Cognitive Training plus Treatment as Usual arm, and 3 participants in the Treatment as Usual arm, did not answer all questions for the Distress Intolerance Index at discharge, so an average score was not computed, resulting in smaller sample sizes for these analyses.</population>

          <title>Cognitive Training Plus Treatment as Usual</title>
          <description>Participants in this arm received daily computerized cognitive training sessions during partial hospitalization, in addition to treatment as usual. Cognitive training sessions alternated between response inhibition training and working memory training.&#xD;
Cognitive Control Training: Cognitive Control Training involves daily practice with one of two computerized interventions. The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>
