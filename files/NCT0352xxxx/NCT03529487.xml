      This is a Phase 1, open-label, repeat dose, ascending dose study assessing the PK, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PD, and dose- or exposure-response of Topical Oxymetazoline for intra-anal&#xD;
      application. A total of 32 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled to receive&#xD;
      either Topical Oxymetazoline 1 mg (Cohort A, n=16), 5 mg (Cohort B, n=8) and 10 mg (Cohort C,&#xD;
      n=8) applied intra-anally daily (QD) for 11 consecutive days.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, repeat dose, ascending dose study assessing the PK, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PD, and dose- or exposure-response of Topical Oxymetazoline for intra-anal&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma concentrations and PK&#xD;
      parameters, as data allows, of oxymetazoline following single and repeated intra-anal&#xD;
      application of oxymetazoline gel 1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated&#xD;
      intra-anal application of oxymetazoline gel 1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg in healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 32 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled (16 subjects in the first&#xD;
      cohort and 8 subjects in the remaining cohorts) and will be exposed to Topical Oxymetazoline&#xD;
      1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg applied intra-anally QD for 11 consecutive days.&#xD;
