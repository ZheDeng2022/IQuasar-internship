  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a public health problem worldwide, being responsible for 9.4 million deaths&#xD;
      worldwide each year, as well as contributing to the burden of coronary, cerebrovascular,&#xD;
      renal diseases, among others. The monitoring of blood pressure at home has gained importance&#xD;
      in recent years, being related to adherence to treatment, as well as in the prevention of&#xD;
      complications and optimization of pressure levels; In the same way, the use of information&#xD;
      and communication technologies (ICT) in health has contributed to the improvement of&#xD;
      communication systems by providing alternative tele-monitoring in this type of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of tele-monitoring at home through tensiometers with integrated SMS&#xD;
      system (text message), for the sending and recording of blood pressure and heart rate data in&#xD;
      the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted, evaluating the intervention with the&#xD;
      integrated blood pressure device with SMS capability, comparing it with the standard care.&#xD;
      After a follow-up of 1 month, the effect on the values of systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure will be evaluated, as well as the adherence to treatment and complications related&#xD;
      to arterial hypertension. A sample number of 20 participants per group was calculated, with a&#xD;
      significance of 95% and a power of 80%, to detect a minimum significant difference of 10&#xD;
      mmHg.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the home blood pressure telemonitoring through a device with&#xD;
      integrated SMS system, in blood pressure values in uncontrolled hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare adherence to treatment at the beginning and end of the follow-up between the&#xD;
           group that uses integrated tele-monitoring with SMS and the usual monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the experiences of the participants of the intervention group with the&#xD;
           tele-monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted, which will be followed for 1&#xD;
      month. The main measurement will be to evaluate the difference in blood pressure levels in&#xD;
      both groups at the end of the follow-up, the intervention group would use the device for 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Tele-monitoring with sphygmomanometer with SMS capacity Control group:&#xD;
      Regular monitoring Follow-up time: 1 month Primary Outcome: Difference in systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Hypertensive patients who attend a Primary Care Centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condevilla Health Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older than 18 years-old. Diagnosis of hypertension more than 3 months ago. Not Controlled In&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Pregnant women.&#xD;
      Travel or change of address in the next 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 20 participants per group was calculated, with a significance of 95% and a power&#xD;
      of 80%, to show a difference of 10 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 10 and 12 according to&#xD;
      the literature evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selection of patients will be made in the clinic of the health centers. If the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria are met, they will be invited to participate in the study, after&#xD;
      accepting and signing the informed consent, a randomization will be made for complete blocks&#xD;
      of 4 (2 controls, 2 interventions) until the total of 40 participants is reached, 20 in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 20 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive general education on hypertension and general care as well as&#xD;
      training for the use of the tensiometer and a graphic guide provided by the manufacturer of&#xD;
      the tensiometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the intervention group will receive a commercial blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      &quot;Omron Series 10®&quot; which was integrated into an SMS messaging system using open hardware&#xD;
      developing boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement scheme will be programmed 4 times a day: 2 in the morning, and 2 in the&#xD;
      evening with a 3-minute interval. If no record is received in 24hrs, specific reminder text&#xD;
      messages will be sent to the patient, caregiver and/or relative, if after 2 days, there is no&#xD;
      measurement, the patient will be contacted by phone and / or caregiver / family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMS of the tensiometer to the information center will include the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure Diastolic blood pressure Heart Rate Date Hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sphygmomanometer SMS will be sent to the information and monitoring center that will be&#xD;
      hosted on a server in the cloud. The information and monitoring system will store blood&#xD;
      pressure records and would be accessible to the primary care centers physicians, they would&#xD;
      be free to any decision making regarding treatment adjustment or scheduling visits to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of tensiometer with SMS capacity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information acquisition and SMS sending station capable of capturing the tensiometer&#xD;
      measurement will be developed using Arduino ® development cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tensiometer will be linked through its USB interface to the development board, which in&#xD;
      turn will send the blood pressure data automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be mentioned that the operation of the tensiometer has not been altered, and&#xD;
      remains the same as that recommended by the manufacturer. At the end of the pressure&#xD;
      collection, the data will be sent automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive the same educational session, and the usual monitoring in&#xD;
      Health Centers will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in blood pressure values will be made, after 1 month of follow-up, under the&#xD;
      same conditions as the initial measurement, as well as adherence to treatment, complications,&#xD;
      and compliance with scheduled appointments during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis will be a Mann-Whitney test of two independent samples&#xD;
      comparing the change in blood pressure measured between the baseline and after 1 month of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis of medication differences, adherence to treatment, complications, and&#xD;
      fulfillment of appointments will be made, between the 2 study groups The level of&#xD;
      significance will be given by a value of p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be requested from participants and caregivers / relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment will include a SIM card that will be recharged by the researchers of the study,&#xD;
      as well as the cost of the equipment and the messaging packages will be covered by the&#xD;
      researchers throughout the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol will be presented to the CIE of the UPCH as well as to the CIE of the&#xD;
      HNCH for its approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will be confidential, the personal identifiers will be separated from the&#xD;
      analysis database, which will be stored in a separate database, stored with a password to&#xD;
      which only the researchers will have access. The SMS data will be sent in an encrypted way so&#xD;
      that it can only be read by the information center.&#xD;
