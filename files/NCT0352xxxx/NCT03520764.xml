  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of a new infant formula on growth, safety, and tolerance&#xD;
      in healthy term Chinese infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening starts after the informed consent is obtained. Infants who are less than or equal&#xD;
      to 44 days of age and meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is around 12 months which includes 8 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants, whose mother has the intention to fully breastfeed her infant at least until 17&#xD;
      weeks of age will be enrolled into the breastfeeding reference group. Infants, whose mother&#xD;
      has the intention to fully formula feed her infant as of 44 days of age at the latest, will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either the investigational product or control product until infants&#xD;
      reach the age of 17 weeks. After the age of 17 weeks, infants can switch to any feeding and&#xD;
      continue be followed up until 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, growth and tolerance parameters will be followed and collected throughout the study.&#xD;
