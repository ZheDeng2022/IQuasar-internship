      A randomized controlled trial for the efficacy of contingency management to encourage smoking&#xD;
      cessation and weight loss.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      American Indians and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience striking disparities in&#xD;
      mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the general U.S. population. Among women of&#xD;
      childbearing age, early detection of chronic diseases can be missed because the type of&#xD;
      medical care they seek is typically focused on their reproductive health care needs. Yet,&#xD;
      chronic disease risk factors, such as smoking and obesity, are common in this age group and&#xD;
      can be treated with evidence-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this study propose to implement a contingency management (CM)&#xD;
      intervention that uses gift cards, and prizes to reinforce smoking cessation and weight loss.&#xD;
      CM has been used successfully for a range of addictive behaviors, including cigarette smoking&#xD;
      and heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other illicit substance use, as well as for&#xD;
      reducing psychiatric problems and HIV risk. CM is understudied in the treatment of obesity,&#xD;
      and in AI/AN populations but has great potential for treating smoking and overweight/obesity,&#xD;
      as it reinforces both short- and long-term behaviors. This is important because both smoking&#xD;
      cessation and weight loss are highly prone to short-term relapse, whereas a longer duration&#xD;
      of the desired behaviors is associated with greater success in adopting permanent lifestyle&#xD;
      change. The investigators will perform a randomized, controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial&#xD;
      design to evaluate a 16-week culturally-tailored CM intervention that promotes cigarette&#xD;
      cessation and weight loss among overweight/obese AI/AN women who are current smokers.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either: 1) CM for smoking abstinence, 2) CM for&#xD;
      weight loss, 3) CM for both, or 4) a non-contingent control group that will not receive CM&#xD;
      for either behavior. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the prevalence of overweight/obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, high&#xD;
           cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes and/or elevated fasting blood glucose, and depression and&#xD;
           anxiety among women of reproductive age (18-44 years) who are patients at a clinic that&#xD;
           primarily serves AI/AN people;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if women randomized to CM conditions more often quit or reduce smoking and&#xD;
           lose weight compared to those in the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if the intervention is disproportionately effective for women receiving CM for&#xD;
           both smoking abstinence and weight loss, compared to the single-behavior CM groups or&#xD;
           the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantify group differences in secondary cardiovascular disease risk factors after&#xD;
           completing the various CM interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW The CM intervention is 16 weeks long and consists of four groups: 1) CM&#xD;
      for smoking abstinence, 2) CM for weight loss, 3) CM for both, or 4) a control group that&#xD;
      will not receive CM for either behavior. Participants will be asked to go into the clinic&#xD;
      twice a week for 16 weeks during the intervention period, and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      baseline visit at the beginning of the study and three follow-up visits one month apart after&#xD;
      the intervention is completed (weeks 20, 24, and 28). In each intervention session the women&#xD;
      participants will complete a urine test to determine if they have smoked a cigarette within&#xD;
      the past 3-4 days, and will be weighed on a dedicated, standardized scale. Other clinical&#xD;
      measurements and self -reported outcomes will be collected as well.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We used a 2x2 factorial design to evaluate contingency management (CM) for weight loss and smoking abstinence among women who were both overweight/obese and current smokers. Participants were accordingly randomized in equal numbers into one of four groups: 1) women receiving CM for weight loss, 2) women receiving CM for smoking abstinence, 3) women receiving CM for both weight loss and smoking abstinence, or 4) a non-contingent control group.</intervention_model_description>
