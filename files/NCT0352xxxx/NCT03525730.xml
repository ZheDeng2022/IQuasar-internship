    <textblock>
      A translational proof of concept study in humans on the primary research question whether&#xD;
      novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) latency strategies, including a BAF inhibitor&#xD;
      and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, result in HIV reservoir reduction in HIV patients on&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The retrovirus HIV integrates as proviral DNA in the genome of cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      (CD)4+ T cells. A subset form a reservoir of latently infected long-lived memory T-cells with&#xD;
      nearly absent HIV-DNA transcription. This persistent latent HIV reservoir is the major&#xD;
      obstacle for a cure. HIV latency is sustained by multiple host factors that restrict the&#xD;
      viral promotor and expression of the viral genome. Latency reversing agents (LRA) can remove&#xD;
      these restrictive components and mediate HIV latency reversal. LRA monotherapy with histone&#xD;
      deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) alone, including valproic acid, vorinostat, romidepsin, or&#xD;
      panobinostat, reactivate HIV but seems insufficient to eliminate the reservoir in vivo. Our&#xD;
      research group has identified the BAF complex as another repressive factor that maintains HIV&#xD;
      latency. Pyrimethamine acts as an inhibitor of this BAF complex, is capable of reactivating&#xD;
      HIV from latency at clinical tolerable concentrations, and acts synergistic with other LRA&#xD;
      classes. This offers new opportunities for cure research. This is the first translational&#xD;
      clinical study with BAF inhibitors and it assesses the potential synergism of 2 LRA with&#xD;
      different modes of action on the reservoir in HIV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal assessment of the effects of the BAF inhibitor pyrimethamine and of the&#xD;
      HDACi valproic acid on the HIV reservoir in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label 6 week randomized controlled intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be HIV infected, ≥18 years and on antiretroviral therapy with plasma&#xD;
      HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell count ≥200 cells/mm3 at enrollment. The HIV-RNA was&#xD;
      ≥10.000 copies/mL before antiretroviral therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to either of 4 arms and receive valproic acid, pyrimethamine,&#xD;
      both for 2 weeks, or no intervention. Total study duration is 6 weeks and includes a 2 week&#xD;
      treatment period and a 4 week post-treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in HIV reactivation in the reservoir in vivo at treatment initiation and at the&#xD;
      end of treatment, measured as the change in cell associated HIV-RNA. The change in&#xD;
      reactivation is compared between the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
