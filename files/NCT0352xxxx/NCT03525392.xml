  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was being conducted to advance new treatment for patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      locally advanced cancers expressing Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). This study was a first&#xD;
      administration of a radioactive drug called 177Lu-3BP-227 to patients under controlled&#xD;
      conditions of a clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe this&#xD;
      investigational drug is as well to verify how well it is tolerated by patients after several&#xD;
      intravenous administrations. In addition, the effect of the study drug on tumoral lesions and&#xD;
      how it distributes throughout the body and at which rate it is removed from the body was&#xD;
      evaluated. Since 177Lu-3BP-227 is a radio-labelled drug, it will also be measured how the&#xD;
      emitted radiation is distributed throughout the body (dosimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of a phase I dose escalation part. The study originally planned to&#xD;
      include a phase II study however due to early termination (not due to safety concerns) the&#xD;
      study did not progress to phase II and was stopped during phase I. For the phase I dose&#xD;
      escalation part, it was anticipated that approximately 30 subjects will be included, in up to&#xD;
      six escalation steps. No expansion cohorts were implemented.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt;3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must not be pregnant or lactating at study entry and during the course&#xD;
             of the study and must not become pregnant for at least 6 months following the last&#xD;

             contraception includes a female partner of childbearing potential if she is using&#xD;
