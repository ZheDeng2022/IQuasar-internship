  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD) is a recognized clinical entity but several barriers&#xD;
      concerning patient-clinician communication, inadequate patients' awareness of the disease,&#xD;
      low perceived benefit of replacement therapy and poor compliance still remains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to improve AGHD management through a Smartphone app (MAGHD&#xD;
      App: Manage Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency) integrated with a software framework able to&#xD;
      merge patients daily data on physical activity, quality of life (QoL), and well-being with&#xD;
      clinical data collected in institutional databases. The target population consists of 100&#xD;
      patients with a previous diagnosis of AGHD, whether in treatment with growth hormone or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective 24 months study, MAGHD App will be developed and connected to MAGHD&#xD;
      Framework. This system will allow to integrate: 1) Physical Activity Data collected by&#xD;
      wearable devices, 2) Patient Related Outcomes Data, periodically inserted by the patients&#xD;
      through MAGHD App in response to questions extrapolated from validated questionnaires, 3) HCP&#xD;
      Data registered in clinical databases and including medical history, biochemical and&#xD;
      radiological examination. Data will converge in MAGHD Framework where they will be analyzed&#xD;
      and used to create reports visible to patients (in MAGHD App) and clinicians (by a monitoring&#xD;
      dashboard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are expected to positively influence AGHD management by involving patients in&#xD;
      care process and giving clinicians a useful tool for clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGHD is widely recognized as a specific clinical entity and recombinant human growth hormone&#xD;
      (r-hGH) therapy has become a standard practice since 90s thanks to its beneficial effects on&#xD;
      body composition, muscle strength, bone mass, cardiovascular risk and patients' exercise&#xD;
      capacity and QoL. All the beneficial effects of r-hGH in AGHD patients have been established&#xD;
      mainly on selected populations by both few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and several&#xD;
      clinical trials. Real life studies are also available, but they are mainly based on data&#xD;
      collected through multicenter sponsored studies such as the Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn International&#xD;
      Metabolic Database (KIMS) and the Hypopituitary Control and Complications Study International&#xD;
      Advisory Board (HYPOCCS). All these observational studies suffer from missing data in the&#xD;
      original databases and/or lack adequate control group (i.e. untreated GHD patients).&#xD;
      Well-conducted real life studies have the advantage to provide information on long-term&#xD;
      effects of therapies, as well as on safety, adherence and persistence to therapy.&#xD;
      Accordingly, in clinical practice it is common to find a disparity between hormonal levels&#xD;
      and patients' subjective well-being: some individuals with a full-blown AGHD do not report&#xD;
      any symptom and turn out reluctant to start a treatment, while others with slight GHD&#xD;
      experience a deterioration in their QoL that deeply improves after GH replacement. This is&#xD;
      mainly due to the fact that clinical presentation of AGHD is frequently based on nonspecific&#xD;
      symptoms. Similarly, individual differences in responsiveness to r-hGH are common findings in&#xD;
      the real life. Moreover, when other hormonal deficits coexist and patients have to face with&#xD;
      a polytherapy, it can be difficult both for clinicians and patients to relate symptoms to the&#xD;
      sole AGHD and to verify benefits after treatment. Finally, there is a lack of tools assessing&#xD;
      patients' physical activity, which is an important factor to consider when evaluating energy&#xD;
      levels, exercise performance, and well-being. Thus, a gap still remains in the real life&#xD;
      setting concerning how to measure the improvements occurring in r-hGH treated patients and&#xD;
      how to make patients and clinicians more aware of these changes. Nowadays, considering the&#xD;
      shortage of established predictive factors for the overall therapeutic response, the decision&#xD;
      to whether or not continue treatment depends often on the ratio of perceived and expected&#xD;
      beneÔ¨Åts over cost and risks of treatment, as well as on the persistent motivation of the&#xD;
      patient. These aspects involve also physician's attitude and patient's propensity to start&#xD;
      r-hGH replacement therapy. Vice versa the lack of information useful to predict patients'&#xD;
      individual response to treatment poses some clinical troubles about how to select patients&#xD;
      who may beneficiate from r-hGH therapy. Considering that r-hGH treatment is a chronic therapy&#xD;
      requiring a daily self-injection, long-term compliance is still a considerable problem in&#xD;
      this setting and is influenced by all the above mentioned issues. It is estimated that about&#xD;
      20 to 30% of patients discontinue the treatment, permanently or for extended periods, making&#xD;
      therefore an objective evaluation of the therapeutic effects difficult. All these aspects are&#xD;
      enhanced by the paucity of tools available to improve patients' education and awareness of&#xD;
      AGHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The widespread use of Smartphone applications and wearable devices presents an opportunity to&#xD;
      overcome these difficulties in the AGHD management. Although several apps exist to monitor&#xD;
      chronic endocrinological diseases, no specific app has been tested in AGHD till now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective, 24 months, open-label, monocentric study, an interactive smartphone app&#xD;
      (MAGHD App) will be developed, connected to an Integrated Framework (MAGHD Framework) and&#xD;
      tested by automatic software testing procedures before the real validation on patients.&#xD;
      Subsequently it will be validated on an estimated number of 100 AGHD patients; this system&#xD;
      will allow to combine patients' information and HCPs clinical outcomes in a single virtual&#xD;
      platform and to return easily accessible data to both AGHD patients and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAGHD App and the integrated MAGHD Framework will be provided by DataRiver, the research&#xD;
      and technological Partner of the study, which is a Contract Research Organization certified&#xD;
      by AIFA (Italian drug agency) and accredited as a Research Innovation Institution by the&#xD;
      Emilia Romagna Region. The MAGHD software framework will allow integrating patient's Physical&#xD;
      Activity data (PA-D), constantly collected by wearable devices (which will be rented and&#xD;
      given to patients in the second part of the study), with patient related outcomes data&#xD;
      (ePRO-D) and HCP data (HCP-D):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PA-D will be obtained through wearable devices and will guarantee the automatic&#xD;
           collection of data regarding patients' daily life activities. PA recorded by the&#xD;
           wearable devices will include: physical activity type, daily steps number, daily walking&#xD;
           distance, daily calories burned, sleep duration, sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ePRO-D will be collected via the MAGHD App, which will periodically generate a short&#xD;
           question extrapolated from the items of validated questionnaires: AGHDA questionnaire&#xD;
           and QLS-H questionnaire for QoL, the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS)&#xD;
           for well-being evaluation, the International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire&#xD;
           (IIEF-15) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for sexual function evaluation (in&#xD;
           men and women respectively), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)&#xD;
           for physical activity evaluation and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep&#xD;
           quality evaluation. Additional information on sexual function, working environment,&#xD;
           hobbies and adherence to r-hGH therapy (the latter only in Group 1) will be collected&#xD;
           through a simple series of questions taken from a specific chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The App will record the number of the user answers as well as the missing ones and will&#xD;
      periodically provide a visual satisfaction analogue scale on the use of MAGHD App usability.&#xD;
      Patients will be notified by the MAGHD App to promptly answer the periodic surveys. The daily&#xD;
      surveys could expire after a predefined time interval to prevent the participants to complete&#xD;
      them retrospectively, reducing the risk for recall bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCP data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data obtained from patient's record chart or by interview: anagraphic data, medical&#xD;
                history information, comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data obtained at baseline and at subsequent visits by physical examination,&#xD;
                anthropometric parameters, clinical data and symptoms, r-hGH therapy (weekly dose&#xD;
                and duration of therapy in months), if ongoing, other hormone replacement&#xD;
                treatments (and relative dosage) in case of multiple pituitary deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data obtained at baseline and at subsequent visits by clinical (biochemical and&#xD;
                radiological) examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pituitary hormones serum levels (IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3,&#xD;
           adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, 24-hour urinary free cortisol,&#xD;
           thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, luteinizing hormone,&#xD;
           follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone (in females), testosterone and&#xD;
           sex hormone-binding globulin (in men), prolactin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biochemical values (haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, renal&#xD;
           and hepatic function, electrolytes, glycaemia, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, bone&#xD;
           metabolism);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan for assessing body composition, bone&#xD;
           mineral content and bone mineral density on whole skeleton, at lumbar site and at&#xD;
           femoral site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hormonal-biochemical data will be collected at each visit, while the DEXA scan will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, at 12 months and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PA-D, ePRO-D and HCP-D will converge in the MAGHD Framework where they will be integrated,&#xD;
      analyzed and used to create graphs and tables visible both to patients (in MAGHD App) and&#xD;
      clinicians (by a monitoring dashboard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive periodically a feedback concerning: i) %change of their QoL,&#xD;
      well-being, sleep quality, sexual function and ii) changes in daily physical activities. This&#xD;
      kind of report will enhance patient's awareness on day-by-day changes related to their&#xD;
      clinical condition. In particular frequent feedback on QoL and well-being will provide a more&#xD;
      objective evaluation of these parameters, thus minimizing possible interference due to life&#xD;
      events occurred close to the day in which the questionnaires are filled. Moreover, a summary&#xD;
      of the patient's clinical outcomes will be provided through the MAGHD App in a simple&#xD;
      graphical way in order to communicate changes in serum IGF-1 and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out in 24 months. Months 1-6 will focus on: 1) App development,&#xD;
      2) Integrated Framework development, 3) App testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment and baseline visits will occur between months 1 and 6, then six-month&#xD;
      visits (visit 1, visit 2, visit 3 and visit 4) will occur in the next 2 years. In the first&#xD;
      phase (12 months) the recruited patients, after having signed the informed consent, will be&#xD;
      followed every six months according to our normal clinical practice without using the App and&#xD;
      the wearable device (baseline, visit 1 and visit 2). Then they will be trained to use the&#xD;
      MAGHD App prior to enter the second phase (following 12 months), in which they will be&#xD;
      evaluated every six months during the use of the App and the wearable device (visit 3 and&#xD;
      visit 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCP data will be collected both in phase 1 (usual follow-up without the use of MAGHD App) and&#xD;
      phase 2 (during the use of MAGHD App). Anamnestic, clinical and biochemical data will be&#xD;
      collected at each visit (baseline, visit 2, visit 3, visit 4), while DEXA scan (radiological&#xD;
      data) will be performed only twice (at baseline and at the end of the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the other data will be collected differently in the two consecutive phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL and well-being data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 1 AGHDA questionnaire, QLS-H questionnaire and WEMWBS will be administered&#xD;
                to patients in paper form at baseline, visit 1 and visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 2 MAGHD App will periodically generate a short question extrapolated from&#xD;
                the items of the same validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual function:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 1 IIEF-5 questionnaire (for men) and FSFI questionnaire (for woman) will&#xD;
                be administered to patients in paper form at baseline, visit 1 and visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 2 MAGHD App will periodically generate a short question extrapolated from&#xD;
                the items of the same validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity and sleep quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 1 physical activity will be evaluated through the IPAQ questionnaire and&#xD;
                sleep quality through the PSQI questionnaire; both will be administered to patients&#xD;
                in paper form at baseline, visit 1 and visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 2 MAGHD App will periodically generate a short question extrapolated from&#xD;
                the items of the same validated questionnaires; data on physical activity and sleep&#xD;
                quality will be also automatically collected through wearable devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional information on sexual function, working environment, hobbies and adherence to&#xD;
           r-hGH therapy (the latter only in Group 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 1 these aspects will be evaluated at baseline, visit 1 and visit 2,&#xD;
                through a specific chart in paper form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Phase 2 the same questions will be sent through the MAGHD App.&#xD;

        Patients with a diagnosis of biochemical GHD outside the appropriate clinical context of&#xD;
        pituitary disease 3) Patients with major psychiatric diseases, chronic highly invalidating&#xD;
        diseases (these patients will be considered not eligible for being enrolled in the study&#xD;
        due to the impact of the underlying disease on well-being and daily activities).&#xD;
