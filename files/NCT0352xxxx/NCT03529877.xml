  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring overall&#xD;
      improvement of EB symptoms) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of three doses of&#xD;
      allo-APZ2-EB administered intravenously to patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis&#xD;
      bullosa (RDEB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa clinical trial&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of the IMP allo-APZ2-EB in patients with RDEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo treatment with the IMP (three repeated intravenous applications) and&#xD;
      will be followed up for efficacy for 12 weeks. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-EB one&#xD;
      follow-up visit at Month 12 and one follow-up visit at Month 24 post IMP applications is&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the EB linked symptoms and quality of life will be assessed by using the&#xD;
      EBDASI score, the iscorEB, the change in pain and itch perception, and patient's quality of&#xD;
      life in EB. The wound healing process will be documented by photography.&#xD;
