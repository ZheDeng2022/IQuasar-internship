  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of infection is an important goal influencing peri-operative care of extremity&#xD;
      fracture patients. Standard practice in the operative management of extremity fractures&#xD;
      includes sterile technique and pre-operative skin preparation with an antiseptic solution.&#xD;
      The available solutions kill bacteria and decrease the quantity of native skin flora, thereby&#xD;
      decreasing surgical site infection (SSI). While there is extensive guidance on specific&#xD;
      procedures for prophylactic antibiotic use and standards for sterile technique, the evidence&#xD;
      regarding the choice of antiseptic skin preparation solution is very limited for extremity&#xD;
      fracture surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one million Americans suffer an extremity fracture (broken bone in the arm, leg, or&#xD;
      pelvis) that requires surgery each year. Approximately 5% (or 50,000) of surgical fracture&#xD;
      patients develop a surgical site infection (SSI), which is twice the rate among most surgical&#xD;
      patients and nearly five times the rate among patients undergoing elective orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeries (e.g. joint replacement). Patients who develop a SSI after their fracture fixation&#xD;
      surgery experience a long and difficult treatment pathway. Researchers have identified that&#xD;
      when a fracture patient experiences a SSI, they typically undergo at least two additional&#xD;
      surgeries to control the infection, spend a median of 14 additional days in the hospital, and&#xD;
      have significantly lower health related quality of life (HRQL). Similarly, results from the&#xD;
      recently completed Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds (FLOW) trial confirmed that patients who had a&#xD;
      SSI, or another complication, that required an additional surgery reported significantly&#xD;
      lower physical and mental HRQL in the 12 months following their fracture compared to patients&#xD;
      who did not experience a SSI. In the most severe cases, when a SSI cannot be controlled, a&#xD;
      limb amputation becomes necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open fractures, closed lower extremity fractures, and pelvic fractures represent some of the&#xD;
      most severe musculoskeletal injuries. Due to their high-energy mechanisms, these fractures&#xD;
      are often accompanied by soft-tissue injuries that contribute to unacceptably poor outcomes.&#xD;
      The FLOW trial of 2,447 open fracture patients reported a 13.2% incidence of open&#xD;
      fracture-related reoperations; Closed fractures of the lower extremity are also at high risk&#xD;
      of complications, particularly when compared to closed upper extremity fractures. For&#xD;
      example, the rate of SSI in closed tibial plateau and plafond fractures range from 5.6 -&#xD;
      11.9%, although some cohort studies have reported infection rates as high as 25.0%. This is&#xD;
      contrast with SSI rates of &lt;5% for common upper extremity fractures like humeral shaft,&#xD;
      forearm, or distal radius fractures. This is further illustrated in a series of 214 deep&#xD;
      orthopaedic fracture infections, in which 58% occurred in the tibia and ankle, and only 10%&#xD;
      occurred anywhere in the upper extremity. Finally, pelvic fractures are associated with some&#xD;
      of the most challenging SSIs to treat among closed fractures because of their propensity to&#xD;
      gram negative organisms and limitations in reconstruction options post-infection. Ultimately,&#xD;
      infectious complications in these fracture populations lead to prolonged morbidity, loss of&#xD;
      function, and potential limb loss.&#xD;

    <allocation>Randomized</allocation>
    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Treatment allocation will be determined using a cluster-randomized crossover trial design. The open and closed fracture populations will be treated with the same allocated solution at all times during the trial. The order of treatment allocation for each orthopaedic practice will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization table. Each site will start with the initially allocated study solution and eventually crossover to the other solution for their second recruitment period. This process of alternating treatments will repeat approximately every 2 months as dictated by the initial randomization.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The orthopaedic team (including the study coordinators) cannot be blinded to the treatment allocation as the antiseptic solutions are visually distinguishable and these individuals need to lead the implementation of the cluster-crossover protocol at their clinical site. The Adjudication Committee Members and data analysts will be blinded to the study treatment. All interpretation of study results will initially be done in a blinded manner by developing two interpretations of the results. One interpretation will assume treatment A is iodine povacrylex, the other interpretation will assume it is CHG. Once the data interpretations for each assumption are finalized, the data will be unblinded and the correct interpretation will be accepted.</masking_description>
