  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SMA REACH UK Network is a national and international partnership between doctors and&#xD;
      therapists involved in the care of children and adults with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. This&#xD;
      network is supported by Biogen and SMA UK.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to establish a Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) National Platform to&#xD;
      improve UK standards of care, manage national and International clinical trials and&#xD;
      facilitate translational research for this common neuromuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this purpose investigators will start to systematically collect longitudinal&#xD;
      validated outcome measures for SMA children followed at GOSH, the largest cohort followed in&#xD;
      UK, and pilot and update novel outcome measures. This will be done ensuring that data&#xD;
      collected are not only clinically meaningful but also robust for subsequent use in clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the MRC Neuromuscular Centre in London and Newcastle, investigators&#xD;
      will link the existing registries and the longitudinal data collection of outcome measures&#xD;
      and develop a hub and bespoke platform model linking the other paediatric UK centres involved&#xD;
      in the clinical management of SMA patients. This UK SMA Platform (SMA REACH UK) will be a&#xD;
      unique infrastructure containing the largest comprehensive longitudinal series of SMA patient&#xD;
      data in the UK; the data collected will be agreed between the relevant other UK centres&#xD;
      stakeholders and will take into consideration other international initiatives with historical&#xD;
      success in SMA treatment and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing analysis including modern psychometric techniques will ensure that the functional&#xD;
      data collected in the UK SMA population meets the high statistical standards required for the&#xD;
      data to inform natural history studies and be usable as an outcome measure for clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition SMA REACH UK is in the position to be involved in an international initiative&#xD;
      called ISMAC (International SMA Consortium) with two prestigious Networks: the PNCRN in the&#xD;
      United States (Principal Investigator Richard Finkel) and the Italian SMA Network (Principle&#xD;
      Investigator Eugenio Mercuri). The Consortium has been contacted by the Biotechnology&#xD;
      Company; Biogen with strong interest in collecting anonymised natural history data on the&#xD;
      entire spectrum of SMA severity from routine clinical visits. The main data to be collected,&#xD;
      including medical information and physiotherapy assessments, were agreed across the three&#xD;
      Networks and will be slightly more extended than the current dataset collected at each&#xD;
      Centre. The data collected with the new dataset will be collated on a separate IT platform&#xD;
      which will contain anonymised clinical and physiotherapy data from patients who have&#xD;
      consented to take part, and will be accessible to Biogen and can be shared with third parties&#xD;
      (pharmaceuticals, academic and government institutions) in a strictly anonymised form. The&#xD;
      ownership of the data will remain with the PIs at each centre.&#xD;
