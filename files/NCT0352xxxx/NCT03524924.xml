  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edoxaban, has shown in clinical registration trials a significant reduction of major bleeding&#xD;
      compared to warfarin, especially in elderly patients. Efficacy and safety of edoxaban will be&#xD;
      assessed in a cohort of very elderly patients (≥80 years of age) with NVAF. A secondary&#xD;
      analysis will correlate outcomes with frailty defined according to SHARE-FI (not-frail,&#xD;
      pre-frail or frail).&#xD;

      Aim of the study To assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban in a cohort of very elderly&#xD;
      patients (≥80 years of age) with NVAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edoxaban has never been tested in elderly frail patients. In both sexes, there is a&#xD;
      non-linear association between age and frailty. A secondary analysis according to frailty&#xD;
      assessment (not-frail, pre-frail or frail) will be also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Observational prospective cohort study including patients of ≥80 years of age&#xD;
      with a new diagnosis of NVAF. Edoxaban 60 mg (or 30 mg for patients with CrCL 15 - 50 mL/min&#xD;
      or with body weight ≤ 60 kg) will be administered to all patients. All participants will be&#xD;
      stratified according to frailty, as assessed by SHARE-FI score, to non-frail, pre-frail, and&#xD;
      frail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Patients of both sexes, of ≥80 years of age with a new diagnosis of&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation and without contraindications to Edoxaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following events will be included as outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial ischemic events (TIA or stroke documented a CT scan; documented systemic&#xD;
           embolism)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  major bleeding events (according to the ISTH definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNM), defined as bleeding that did not meet the&#xD;
           definition of major bleeding, but considered clinically significant (including&#xD;
           spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeding or rectal bleeding; macroscopic haematuria or&#xD;
           urethral bleeding requiring medical attention; skin haematoma &gt;25 cm2; and gingival&#xD;
           bleeding or spontaneous ear-nose-throat bleeding lasting ≥5 min) and/or resulted in&#xD;
           discontinuation of study medication18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  death (divided into cardiovascular death, fatal bleeding and other causes of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow-up visits will be performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months to assess adherence&#xD;
      and compliance to therapy, evaluation of relevant blood test and clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporary discontinuation of edoxaban for a planned surgical intervention will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed until the occurrence of a first outcome event, permanent&#xD;
      discontinuation of edoxaban or the end of follow-up period, whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be divided into 3 groups according to frailty measured with Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe - Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI) which provides 3 patient categories (non-frail, pre-frail and frail).&#xD;
A score of &lt; 0.3151361243 defines non frail female patients; a score of 0.3151361243 to 2.1301121973 defines pre-frail female patients; a score of 2.1301121973 to 6 defines frail female patients.&#xD;
A score of &lt; 1.211878526 defines non frail male patients; a score of 1.211878526 to 3.0052612772 defines pre-frail male patients; a score of 3.0052612772 to 7 defines frail male patients.&#xD;
