  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with poor early language skills are at risk for academic, social, vocational, and&#xD;
      health difficulties across the lifespan. Parent training-as part of early language&#xD;
      intervention-is a cost-effective option to address this public health issue, but these&#xD;
      interventions demonstrate large individual differences in outcomes and barriers to&#xD;
      scalability. The purpose of this research is to examine parent-level predictors of early&#xD;
      language interaction quality and modifiability during training, which will help increase&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a minimal-risk, behavioral clinical trial for adult parents and their children&#xD;
      (2;6-4;0). The purpose of this study is to determine if and how parent language skills and&#xD;
      behavioral awareness influence early language interactions and parent training. Participants&#xD;
      will include parent-child dyads in three groups: 1) children who are typically developing&#xD;
      (TD; Study 1 and 2), 2) children at risk for persistent developmental language disorder (DLD;&#xD;
      Study 1 and 2), and 3) children with autism spectrum disorder and at risk for persistent DLD&#xD;
      (ASD+DLD; Study 2). The investigators will examine whether parental language skills predict&#xD;
      early language interaction quality (Aim 1; Study 1), whether parental behavioral awareness&#xD;
      predicts modifiability during training (Aim 2; Study 2), and whether these predictors vary&#xD;
      across children-specifically TD children, children with DLD, or with ASD+DLD (Aim 3; Study&#xD;
      2). The primary outcome measure will be parents' use of language stimulation strategies. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measure will be the number of adult-child conversational turns. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that parent language skills (Study 1) and behavioral awareness&#xD;
      (Study 2) will be positively associated with the outcomes. However, the strength of the&#xD;
      association may vary across the groups. The Study 1 protocol will involve a screening session&#xD;
      and observational data collection sessions (TD and DLD groups). Study 1 will be a fully&#xD;
      remote model of data collection. The Study 2 protocol will involve five sessions-baseline&#xD;
      data collection (all groups), three parent training sessions (DLD and ASD+DLD), and follow-up&#xD;
      data collection (all groups) across approximately five weeks. Study 2 will be conducted in a&#xD;
      hybrid (in-person and remote) model. The investigators will collect data from demographic&#xD;
      questionnaires, language and learning assessments, measures of parental behavioral awareness,&#xD;
      and measures of parent-child language interaction quality (Study 1 and 2). These measures&#xD;
      will be administered before and after three parent training sessions (Study 2). These&#xD;
      sessions will follow the Teach-Model-Coach-Review framework (TMCR; 1) to train the Enhanced&#xD;
      Milieu Teaching (EMT) strategies of responsive interaction, matched turns, language modeling,&#xD;
      and expansions. After the training, parent-child dyads will complete the structured&#xD;
      interaction and behavioral awareness tasks again (Study 2). The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      inter- and intra-group analyses to explore the relationships between the independent (i.e.,&#xD;
      parent language abilities and behavioral awareness) and dependent (i.e., parent-child&#xD;
      language interaction quality and parent modifiability during training) variables.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will code the structured interaction task for parents' use of language stimulation strategies.The investigators will code use of trained strategies (i.e., responsive interaction, matched turns, language modeling, and expansions) and untrained generalization measures like constructive directives and scaffolds. This primary outcome will be a composite score of these language stimulation strategies (e.g., responsive interaction, matched turns, language modeling, expansions, constructive directives, and scaffolds). This composite will be measured at baseline and post-treatment during the structured interaction task, so the same amount of time will be given to each participant to interact. This is a continuous outcome variable, with values greater than or equal to zero. Higher values are generally representative of higher-quality language interactions.</description>

    <description>The parent training will incorporate the EMT strategies of responsive interaction, matched turns, language modeling, and expansions. There will be three, hour-long parent training sessions following the teach-model-coach-review format (TMCR). The TMCR framework teaching component will involve 10 minutes of verbal and visual instruction on the language stimulation target of interest. The teaching component will be followed by 15 minutes of clinician modeling of the target strategies with the child while the parent watches. The parent will then have the opportunity to practice using the strategy during naturalistic interaction with their child. The clinician will provide individualized coaching on the use of the target strategy during this 20-minute, parent-child interaction. Finally, the clinician will review the target strategies and set goals.</description>
