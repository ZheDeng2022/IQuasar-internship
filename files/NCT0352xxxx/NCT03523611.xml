      The purpose of this study is explore the impact of lung cancer surgery on inflammation and&#xD;
      function of the right side of the heart.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK and is the leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      related death. Where appropriate, surgery to remove the tumour and the surrounding lung (lung&#xD;
      resection) provides the best chance of cure. Frequently patients are either current or&#xD;
      ex-smokers with related lung or heart problems which increase the risks associated with&#xD;
      surgery. Following surgery patients may suffer long term shortness of breath, greatly&#xD;
      limiting their day-to-day function and lowering quality of life. The investigators believe&#xD;
      this shortness of breath is not solely caused by the removal of part of the lung but also&#xD;
      from a decrease in the performance of the heart. Although the surgery does not directly&#xD;
      involve the heart it is thought that the damage is caused indirectly by the surgery and by&#xD;
      the removal of part of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, the investigators showed that the function of the right side of the&#xD;
      heart (the right heart) is decreased following lung resection. The decrease in right heart&#xD;
      (the part that supplies blood to the lungs) function was associated with a prolonged stay in&#xD;
      the high dependency unit and blood markers indicating damage to the heart. The process by&#xD;
      which the damage occurs is poorly understood, but it is thought that an increase in the&#xD;
      forces preventing the right heart pumping blood (resistance) is to blame. The decrease in&#xD;
      function in the right heart may be triggered during surgery by the diminished blood supply to&#xD;
      the cancerous lung and, and maintained post operatively, as lung resection can cause a&#xD;
      long-term increase in resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diseases that cause an increase in resistance to the right heart have been shown to cause&#xD;
      damage to different parts of the right heart. An acute sudden increase in resistance can&#xD;
      cause inflammation, thinning and scarring whilst a long-term increase in resistance causes&#xD;
      the right heart to thicken. The investigators believe that the potential damage during the&#xD;
      operation could cause permanent damage to the right heart and contribute to shortness of&#xD;
      breath and functional limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the potential inflammation/scarring and the function of the heart the&#xD;
      investigators will image the heart with specialised Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the research is to determine whether inflammation occurs in the right heart during&#xD;
      and following lung resection and, if so, does it result in scarring?. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the function of the right heart before, during and after surgery to determine if&#xD;
      inflammation contributes to the decrease in right heart function following lung resection&#xD;
      seen in our previous study. The investigators anticipate that the study will increase&#xD;
      understanding of how the right heart may be damaged by lung resection. The investigators&#xD;
      believe this will guide further studies aiming to prevent such damage, ultimately limiting&#xD;
      the disabling breathlessness and decrease in heart function that so greatly affects patients'&#xD;
      lives.&#xD;
