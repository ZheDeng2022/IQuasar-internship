  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypotheses are: 1) the intestinal stem cell marker, DCLK1, which is increased in both the&#xD;
      epithelium and stroma in colon cancer is also increased in BE (Barrett's esophagus) with HGD&#xD;
      (high grade dysplasia) and in EAC (esophageal adenocarcinoma), 2) this expression correlates&#xD;
      with disease progression towards EAC and 3) eradication of cells expressing stem cell markers&#xD;
      occurs after therapy of EMR (endoscopic mucosal resection) or RFA (radiofrequency ablation)&#xD;
      to eradicate BE with HGD and intramucosal adenocarcinoma and esophagectomy for EAC. We will&#xD;
      test our hypotheses with the following aims: 1) To characterize the cell specific expression&#xD;
      patterns of intestinal stem cell biomarkers in BE patients and correlate them with serum&#xD;
      expression and disease progression, 2) To examine prospectively the effects of EMR, RFA or&#xD;
      esophagectomy on the expression of stem cell biomarkers and the progression to EAC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplasia of normal squamous epithelium. BE can progressively&#xD;
      develop more abnormal features like low-grade intraepithelial dysplasia (LGID), high-grade&#xD;
      intraepithelial dysplasia (HGID) before ultimately developing esophageal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EAC), with a low 5-year survival rate of 20 % or less. Recent evidence for the existence of&#xD;
      cancer stem cells (CSCs) has advanced our understanding of cancer and has opened doors to new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. The fundamental goals of this project are to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      (RFA) on eradication of putative intestinal stem cell markers that are overexpressed in BE&#xD;
      with HGID and EAC. A better understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate the&#xD;
      progression from normal squamous mucosa to EAC has enormous implications in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of esophageal cancer. The presence of a CSC in esophageal cancer has been reported&#xD;
      in both dysplastic BE/ EAC as well as in mouse models of the disease. The central hypotheses&#xD;
      of the current proposal are: elimination of cells expressing stem cell markers occurs after&#xD;
      ablative therapies (EMR/RFA) to eradicate BE with HGID/ EAC, and monitoring of stem cell&#xD;
      marker expression during follow-up will correlate with disease recurrence or appropriate&#xD;
      clinical response. Recently, we have reported that DCLK1, although minimally expressed in&#xD;
      normal distal esophageal squamous mucosa, is markedly expressed in BE epithelium and EAC. We&#xD;
      will test our central hypotheses with the following specific aims: 1. To prospectively&#xD;
      characterize the cell specific expression patterns of putative intestinal stem cell&#xD;
      biomarkers in BE patients and correlate them with serum/plasma protein expression and disease&#xD;
      progression, 2. to examine prospectively the effects of EMR/RFA on the expression of putative&#xD;
      stem cell biomarkers and correlate them with serum/plasma protein expression and disease&#xD;
      progression and/or recurrence, and 3. to examine prospectively the effects on EMR/ RFA on&#xD;
      esophageal-related quality of life and dysphagia during the endoscopic intervention period as&#xD;
      well as following completion. The studies proposed have the potential to offer new insights&#xD;
      for both the early diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic response of future therapies for&#xD;
      EAC. Moreover, these studies may identify novel biomarkers that can aid in the confirmation&#xD;
      of HGID and potentially predict disease onset, progression and/or recurrence. Finally, these&#xD;
      studies have the potential to provide preliminary data that will serve as the rationale for&#xD;
      large scale multicenter trials to compare the effectiveness of EMR and RFA in BE with respect&#xD;
      to clinical outcome, molecular features and effect on putative tumor stem cells. The recent&#xD;
      identification of DCLK1 as a marker that distinguishes between normal and tumor stem cells in&#xD;
      a rodent model of intestinal tumorigenesis lends support for our rationale for examining&#xD;
      DCLK1 as a potential mediator of the neoplastic response in BE.&#xD;
