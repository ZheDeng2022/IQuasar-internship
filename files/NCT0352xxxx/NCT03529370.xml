      In this study the invistigators chose to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter by&#xD;
      sonography for diagnosis of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in comparison to brain&#xD;
      computed tomograhy (CT) as the reference gold standard for detection of raised ICP since&#xD;
      optic nerve songraphy is radiation-free , noninvasive, and has certain features which&#xD;
      increase its convenience portability, easy application, low cost, repeatability on request,&#xD;
      bedside application, short application time and applicability even in the presence of&#xD;
      unstable vital signs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is seen in head trauma, hydrocephalus, intracranial&#xD;
      tumors, hepatic encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. Intractable elevated ICP can lead to&#xD;
      death or devastating neurological damage either by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)&#xD;
      and causing cerebral ischemia or by compressing and causing herniation of the brainstem or&#xD;
      other vital structures. Prompt recognition is crucial in order to intervene appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intractable high ICP is the most common &quot;terminal event&quot; leading to death in neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients. The association between the severity of intracranial hypertension and poor outcome&#xD;
      after severe head injury is well recognized. Outcomes tend to be good in patients with normal&#xD;
      ICP, whereas those with elevated ICP are much more likely to have an unfavorable outcome.&#xD;
      Elevated ICP carries a mortality rate of around 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid recognition of elevated ICP is therefore of obvious and paramount importance so&#xD;
      that it can be monitored and so that therapies directed at lowering ICP can be initiated. A&#xD;
      raised ICP is measurable both clinically and quantitatively. Continuous ICP monitoring is&#xD;
      important both for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic measures and for evaluating the&#xD;
      evolution of brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of ICP monitoring is to ensure maintenance of optimal CPP. The ICP also forms a&#xD;
      basis for medical or surgical intervention in cases of increased ICP with agents such as 3%&#xD;
      sodium chloride (NaCl), mannitol, or diuretics (Loop diuretics), ventriculostomy,&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion, and phentobarbital coma or surgical decompression in&#xD;
      cases of intractable ICP elevation that do not respond to conservative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP monitoring may be discontinued when the ICP remains in the normal range within 48-72&#xD;
      hours of withdrawal of ICP therapy or if the patient's neurological condition improves to the&#xD;
      point where he or she is following commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since many investigators have questioned invasive ICP monitoring in improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes, the invistigators tried to find noninvasive method of ICP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optic nerve sheath is contiguous with the dura mater, and its contents are contiguous&#xD;
      with the subarachnoid space. Thus, raised intracranial pressure (ICP) leads to an increase in&#xD;
      the optic nerve sheath diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-mode sonography was first used for visualization of the optic nerve sheath; however, it was&#xD;
      not until 1994, when Hansen et al used B-mode sonography, when the approach to measurement&#xD;
      was standardized. Sonographic studies of cadaveric optic nerves together with the work of&#xD;
      Hansen et al established that the greatest degree of distension of the sheath occurred 3 mm&#xD;
      behind the optic globe. This location has become the standard measurement point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a technique, ocular sonography is quickly learned; Tayal et al showed that with an&#xD;
      experienced operator, 10 scans with 3 abnormal scans should be sufficient training, whereas&#xD;
      in new ultrasound operators, 25 may be needed. In addition to these findings, measurement of&#xD;
      both eyes can be performed in less than 4 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the invistigators chose CT as the reference gold standard for detection of raised ICP as&#xD;
      simple noninvasive method in critically ill patients. Raised ICP is diagnosed with CT on a&#xD;
      daily basis in clinical practice. Treatments are initiated, hemicraniectomies are performed,&#xD;
      and intraventricular shunts are inserted, all on the basis of raised ICP as seen on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of elevated ICP in cranial CT (CCT) include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. changes in ventricular sizes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lessening in basilar cistern sizes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. narrowing or eliminating in sulci;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. transfalcine herniation; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. changes in the rate of grey/white matter. So in this study the invistigators chose to&#xD;
           measure optic nerve sheath diameter by sonography for diagnosis of elevated ICP in&#xD;
           comparison to brain CT as the reference gold standard for detection of raised ICP&#xD;
