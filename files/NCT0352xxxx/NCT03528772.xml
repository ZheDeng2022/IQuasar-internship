  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial aims to compare two topical treatments in the treatment of chronic anal&#xD;
      fissure: minoxidil gel and glycreyl trintrate cream. The endpoint of the study is the&#xD;
      duration of healing of anal fissure whereas secondary endpoints include adverse effects of&#xD;
      each treatment and recurrence of anal fissure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria and give consent for participation in the&#xD;
      trial and will be included and randomly assigned to either group I (5% Minoxidil gel) or&#xD;
      group II (0.2% GTN cream) with a 1:1 allocation. Randomization will be carried out using&#xD;
      online software (Research Randomizer Version 4.0 at https://www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the topical agent in unlabeled red or blue containers. The code of each&#xD;
      color will be known to a pharmacist who will not take any part in patients' care, follow-up,&#xD;
      data collection/analysis or accessing outcomes of the study. The investigators will be&#xD;
      blinded to the nature of content of each container and the outcome assessor will not be aware&#xD;
      of the study nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Eligible patients will be randomized into two equal groups: groups I will&#xD;
      receive topical 5% Minoxidil gel (Minoxidil Forte 5% topical gel 60 gm; Pharmacare Egypt Co.,&#xD;
      Cairo, Egypt) and group II will receive topical 0.2% GTN cream (Nitoglycerine-Glycerile&#xD;
      Tinitrade 0.2%, 30 gm; E.S.A.G Pharma Co., Cairo, Egypt). Both agents used in the study will&#xD;
      be relabeled by a pharmacist who will not take any part in the study in terms of patients'&#xD;
      care, follow-up, data collection/analysis or accessing outcomes. Both topical agents will be&#xD;
      placed in identical containers of 60 gm and labeled with blue or red colors. The color code&#xD;
      will remain undefined till the end of trial, data analysis, and interpretation of results&#xD;
      except for the same pharmacist. The containers will be distributed to the patients by the&#xD;
      outpatient's department nurse in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be advised to apply approximately 2 cm of the gel/cream (equal to 3 gm) on the&#xD;
      perianal area three times per day for 4 weeks. The first dose of drugs will be given at home&#xD;
      on the same day of the first visit. During the first visit, patients will be taught to&#xD;
      self-administer the topical gel/cream. The patients will be instructed to take laxatives to&#xD;
      avoid constipation and to avoid using other topical preparations during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be followed in the general and colorectal surgery outpatient clinics&#xD;
      for a period of three months. Patients will be advised to visit the outpatient clinic every&#xD;
      week for one month, then biweekly in the 2nd and 3rd months after starting treatment. In case&#xD;
      of intolerable adverse events patients will be advised to visit the outpatient clinic at any&#xD;
      other time point during the trial. At each visit the anal fissure will be inspected and the&#xD;
      extent of healing will be assessed by a surgical resident who is unaware of the nature of the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be asked about the improvement in their symptoms, particularly anal pain&#xD;
      and bleeding. Pain will be measured at each visit by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging&#xD;
      from no pain &quot;0&quot; to worst possible pain &quot;10&quot;. Blood pressures will be measured and any&#xD;
      decrease of &gt; 15 mmHg from the basal pressure measured at the first visit will be considered&#xD;
      significant. Adverse effects induced by the topical agents as itching, headache, palpitation,&#xD;
      dizziness, excess perianal hair growth, and hypersensitivity reaction will be recorded.&#xD;
      Itching will be assessed by 5-D pruritus scale. The continence state will be assessed using&#xD;
      Wexner continence score.&#xD;
