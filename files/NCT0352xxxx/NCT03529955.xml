  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With limited treatment options available for dermatomyositis, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, is a safe and efficacious add-on&#xD;
      treatment in patients with refractory cutaneous dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the efficacy, safety and toxicity of apremilast given at 30 mg&#xD;
      twice daily to patients with refractory cutaneous dermatomyositis. Clinical response will be&#xD;
      assessed at 1 and 3 months. Patients will also be evaluated for durability of their response&#xD;
      for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be monitored with frequent clinical visits (0, 1, 3 and 6 months) and blood&#xD;
      tests (CBC, CMP, creatine kinase, aldolase). Treatment will be discontinued at disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable adverse events. Disease progression is defined as 4 points&#xD;
      increase in the cutaneous dermatomyositis disease area and severity index (CDASI) score,&#xD;
      worsening of muscle disease by manual muscle testing (MMT-8) score and 5 points increase in&#xD;
      dermatomyositis life quality index (DLQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 mm skin biopsies from lesional skin will be performed before treatment with apremilast and&#xD;
      after 3 months of treatment for gene expression profiling and confirmatory&#xD;
      immunohistochemical stains.&#xD;

        1. Study Title: A phase 2, open label single arm study for evaluating safety &amp; efficacy of&#xD;
           apremilast in the treatment of cutaneous disease in patients with recalcitrant&#xD;
           dermatomyositis.&#xD;

      III. CONCEPT DESIGN AND RATIONAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapeutic Area: Immunology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specialty: Connective tissue disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disease State: Dermatomyositis&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-If other specify: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study Rationale: Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease that predominantly involves&#xD;
      the skin with or without proximal muscle weakness. First line treatment for dermatomyositis&#xD;
      is systemic steroids however due to long-term side effects, patients are usually treated with&#xD;
      a steroid sparing agent. There is no known consensus on treatment guidelines for&#xD;
      dermatomyositis and many anti- inflammatory medications have been successfully used. Tulane&#xD;
      University is a referral center for recalcitrant dermatomyositis cases.The investigators&#xD;
      present the case of a 57 y.o female patient with multidrug recalcitrant dermatomyositis&#xD;
      showing complete remission of her skin disease with apremilast and improvement of her muscle&#xD;
      disease. This patient was diagnosed with dermatomyositis. Over a 6-year period, she was&#xD;
      treated with adequate trials of multiple immunosuppressive agents, including&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, soriatane, Intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (IVIG), tacrolimus, chlorambucil, infliximab and rituximab. For the last four&#xD;
      years, physicians were unable to lower corticosteroids below 40 mg per day. Her disease&#xD;
      continued to flare despite these therapies. Chronic steroid use resulted in insulin dependent&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus as well as other steroids associated side effects. While on stable doses of&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and rituximab, the patient developed arthritis and was&#xD;
      started on apremilast 30 mg twice a day. Two months into her treatment she noticed&#xD;
      significant improvement of her skin disease and then nearly complete clearance of the skin.&#xD;
      Her muscle weakness lagged behind and she noticed improvement after 9 months of being on&#xD;
      apremilast with normalization of her aldolase and CK. The patient was able to wean off all&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents and prednisone. She was in remission for over 2 years and off all&#xD;
      medications. She experienced a mild flare of skin disease recently and she resumed apremilast&#xD;
      only and cleared immediately and continues on apremilast as a monotherapy. Patient&#xD;
      experienced mild nausea and diarrhea with apremilast that improved four weeks into the&#xD;
      treatment. She was able to discontinue insulin, lose weight and she has continued to be clear&#xD;
      of both skin and muscle symptoms for over 1.5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case was accepted as a poster presentation at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American&#xD;
      Academy of Dermatology &quot;Poster #: 6672 - Apremilast: a Potential Treatment for&#xD;
      Dermatomyositis.&quot; Following this successful outcome, the investigators initiated apremilast&#xD;
      in 3 other patients with recalcitrant dermatomyositis. Two patients had recalcitrant&#xD;
      cutaneous disease and responded to add on therapy of apremilast in 2 months with significant&#xD;
      improvement of their skin disease. The third patient had refractory dermatomyositis to&#xD;
      several steroid-sparing agents and with severe muscle disease was started on apremilast for&#xD;
      arthritis. She experienced significant improvement of her muscle weakness together with&#xD;
      decrease in her muscle enzyme creatine kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These very exciting findings triggered the idea of studying apremilast as an adjunct&#xD;
      treatment for recalcitrant cutaneous disease in dermatomyositis patients. This is a novel&#xD;
      idea; apremilast was never studied for dermatomyositis. Apremilast may have more advantages&#xD;
      in dermatomyositis compared to other immunosuppressive treatments. Dermatomyositis patients&#xD;
      may have lung involvement, and apremilast is an agent that doesn't have lung side effects in&#xD;
      contrast to methotrexate for example which is one of the main steroid sparing agents used for&#xD;
      dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of dermatomyositis is multifactorial with environmental, genetic and immune&#xD;
      factors contribution.T helper-1 (Th1) and T helper-2 (Th2) immune pathways play a fundamental&#xD;
      role in dermatomyositis.There is increase in proinflammatory cytokines including tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) 1, IL 6, and interferon (INF) α,γ shifting&#xD;
      the immune balance to a Th1 response.Th1 immune response was also involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia in the setting of dermatomyositis.IL4 released by&#xD;
      lymphocytes infiltrating skin and muscles in dermatomyositis patients contributes to increase&#xD;
      in Th2 response in conjunction with Th1 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast is a PD4-E inhibitor currently used for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.However,&#xD;
      its usage on patients with dermatomyositis has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inhibiting PDE-4 apremilast increases the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP),&#xD;
      leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and INF-γ thus&#xD;
      inhibiting Th1 response. Apremilast can also block Th2 response by interfering with the level&#xD;
      of IL6 secreted by type2 macrophages.While the mechanism of action of apremilast in&#xD;
      dermatomyositis is unknown, we suggest that apremilast can be a potential treatment option&#xD;
      for dermatomyositis through interfering with Th1 and Th2 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apremilast is a well-tolerated oral medicine with transient gastrointestinal side effects.&#xD;
      Apremilast offers an additional treatment option for those patients with recalcitrant&#xD;
      dermatomyositis, unresponsive to more conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Treatment and Dosing: Investigators will enroll patients seen at our facilities with a&#xD;
      known diagnosis of dermatomyositis who are still experiencing cutaneous disease after a trial&#xD;
      of systemic steroids and one steroid-sparing agent. Investigators will add apremilast to&#xD;
      their treatment regimen according to the approved dosage for psoriasis and psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis: 10 mg orally one time on day 1, 10 mg orally twice daily on day 2, 10 mg orally in&#xD;
      AM and 20 mg orally in PM on day 3, 20 mg orally twice daily on day 4, 20 mg orally in AM and&#xD;
      30 mg orally in PM on day 5, then 30 mg orally twice daily thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Brief Study Synopsis: With limited treatment options available for dermatomyositis,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, is a safe&#xD;
      and efficacious add-on treatment in patients with recalcitrant cutaneous dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the efficacy, safety and toxicity of apremilast given at 30 mg&#xD;
      twice daily to patients with recalcitrant cutaneous dermatomyositis. Clinical response will&#xD;
      be assessed at 1 and 3 months. Patients will also be evaluated for durability of their&#xD;
      response for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be monitored with frequent clinical visits (0, 1, 3 and 6 months) and blood&#xD;
      tests (CBC, CMP, CK, aldolase). Treatment will be discontinued at disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events. Disease progression is defined as a 4 points increase in CDASI&#xD;
      score, worsening of muscle disease by MMT-8 score and 5 points increase in DLQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 mm skin biopsies from lesional skin will be performed before treatment with apremilast and&#xD;
      after 3 months of treatment for gene expression profiling and confirmatory&#xD;
      immunohistochemical stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Sampling and correlative analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, the proposed mechanism of action of apremilast is though PDE-4 inhibition resulting&#xD;
      in c-AMP upregulation, the exact biological process that leads to dermatological response in&#xD;
      dermatomyositis remains ill-defined.Investigators propose to perform gene expression&#xD;
      profiling (GEP) using RNA sequencing on skin biopsies collected before and after treatment&#xD;
      with apremilast. In addition, we plan to confirm our GEP findings at the protein level using&#xD;
      immunohistochemical (IHC) stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Tissue sampling and preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tissue collection 5 mm punch biopsy from dermatomyositis skin lesions will be performed&#xD;
           at baseline and another 5 mm punch biopsy will be performed at the 3-month time point.&#xD;
           Each biopsy will be vertically split in two pieces and snap frozen on dry ice then it&#xD;
           will be stored at -80C for further analysis with RNA sequencing and IHC stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RNA extraction At the end of all timeline collections, each skin biopsy will be&#xD;
           mechanically broken down followed by mRNA extraction using the RNeasy extraction Kit&#xD;
           from QIAGENzz. mRNA will then be stored at -80°C for subsequent RNA sequencing as&#xD;
           detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Correlative Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the mechanism of action of apremilast in dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gene expression profiling RNA extracted form skin biopsies collected before and after in&#xD;
           vivo treatment with apremilast (as detailed above) will be subjected to RNA sequencing.&#xD;
           Illumina strand-specific TruSeq libraries will be prepared from the polyA selected RNA&#xD;
           and subjected to 1x100 base sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine. The number of&#xD;
           samples proposed here (10 samples before treatment and 10 samples after treatment) is&#xD;
           expected to yield sufficient statistical power for this approach; smaller numbers have&#xD;
           been used in similar approaches to investigate drugs' mechanism of action (usually three&#xD;
           samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
           RNA-seq analysis will be performed in conjunction with the Tulane Cancer Crusaders Next&#xD;
           Generation Sequence Analysis Core (Tulane Cancer Center -&#xD;
           https://tulane.edu/som/cancer/research/core-facilities/cancer-crusaders/). Gene and&#xD;
           isoform expression will be determined using RSEM and differential expression will be&#xD;
           analyzed using EB-seq. Genes that are identified as differentially expressed between the&#xD;
           two groups with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of &lt; 0.05 will be subjected to analysis by&#xD;
           Ingenuity (IPA, Redwood City, CA). This analysis will group the identified genes into&#xD;
           specific pathways, cell types, or disease process. A similar approach will be conducted&#xD;
           using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). These experiments and GEP analysis will be&#xD;
           performed in conjunction with our collaborator's (Dr. Nakhle Saba) lab, given his&#xD;
           extensive experience in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protein analysis Information identified by Ingenuity or GSEA (signaling pathways,&#xD;
           regulatory molecules, etc…) will be verified using IHC staining on select samples.&#xD;
