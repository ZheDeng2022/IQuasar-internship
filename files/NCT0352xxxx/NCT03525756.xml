  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colovesical fistulas are well-recognized but relatively uncommon pathology to both the&#xD;
      general and colorectal surgeon. It is a complication arising from an underlying primary acute&#xD;
      to chronic inflammatory process. Although colovesical fistulas are uncommon, they are&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity, affect quality of life, and may lead to death, usually&#xD;
      secondary to urosepsis. Early diagnosis and management is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the objective use of cystographic evaluation on&#xD;
      postoperative day two to guide early Foley catheter removal post colovesical fistula&#xD;
      takedown. The hypothesis is that a cystogram showing no extravasation of contrast on&#xD;
      postoperative day two will predict safe removal without increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an uncontrolled, single arm trial. Patients who meet criteria to undergo either&#xD;
      minimally invasive or open colovesical fistula takedown with sigmoid colectomy, without&#xD;
      evidence of the need for bladder repair will be eligible to participate. An indwelling Foley&#xD;
      catheter is placed intraoperative and continued postoperative. All patients who consent to&#xD;
      participate would undergo a cystogram on postoperative day two. The cystogram will be&#xD;
      conducted by a radiologist and technician well-trained in the techniques and interpretation&#xD;
      of the study. The colorectal surgery enhanced recovery protocol will be followed on all&#xD;
      patients with the exception of the cystogram being conducted on post-op day two. If there is&#xD;
      no evidence of extravasation of dye is seen on the cystogram the Foley catheter will be&#xD;
      removed. Patients will be monitored closely following catheter removal to ensure&#xD;
      self-diuresis.&#xD;
