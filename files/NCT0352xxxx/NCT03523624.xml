      In medical practice, a combination of clinical exam, electrocardiograms, circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers, and imaging is used to gain insights on the prognosis after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Novel molecular non-invasive tools are needed that help clinicians overcome the&#xD;
      adverse events of post-myocardial infarction remodelling and thereby achieve improved therapy&#xD;
      for its prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) decay has been linked to major adverse cardiac events (MACE)&#xD;
      in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Given the correlation between both intramyocardial&#xD;
      haemorrhage and microvascular damage with acute phase complications in ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, we hypothesise that excessive FXIII decay within the first week may&#xD;
      predict acute phase outcomes in these patients. If this holds true, FXIII determination could&#xD;
      be used as diagnostic and prognostic tool.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction of mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is achieved by the efficacy&#xD;
      of the current therapeutic strategies focused on an early reopening of the culprit coronary&#xD;
      artery, by either medical or mechanical reperfusion. Primary percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) represents the most effective way to limit infarct size and reduce&#xD;
      transmural extension of necrosis. Although coronary artery recanalization represents the most&#xD;
      effective way to reduce infarct size, the process of reperfusion may itself produce a series&#xD;
      of consequences including intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH) and microvascular injury (MVO)&#xD;
      contributing to the 'no reflow' phenomenon. MVO is an early event followed by intramyocardial&#xD;
      haemorrhage that plays a role later in reperfusion injury. Both luminal obstruction&#xD;
      (microvascular damage by neutrophil plugging, platelets and emboli) and external compression&#xD;
      (by oedema and haemorrhage) are allegedly linked with no-reflow, however, the real mechanism&#xD;
      underlying this complex time-sensitive phenomenon remains to be fully understood. MVO and IMH&#xD;
      in ST-elevation myocardial infarction are independent predictor of adverse left ventricle&#xD;
      remodelling, independently of the initial infarct size, and predict MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of no-reflow is usually made when post-procedural thrombolysis in myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (TIMI) flow is &lt;3, or in the case of a TIMI flow of 3 when myocardial blush grade&#xD;
      is 0 or 1, or when ST resolution within 4 h of the procedure is &lt;70%. It can be assessed&#xD;
      using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques, where they appear as dark zones on delayed&#xD;
      post-contrast sequences or contrast echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FXIII is a protransglutaminase that becomes activated by thrombin and catalyses the formation&#xD;
      of crosslinked fibrin mesh in the final stage of the clotting cascade. Blood coagulation&#xD;
      FXIII is thought to play a role in wound healing and tissue repair. FXIII is present in&#xD;
      plasma, platelets, monocytes, and macrophages, all of which are involved in infarct healing.&#xD;
      In an experimental model, mice lacking FXIII suffer from impaired wound healing and fatal&#xD;
      rupture of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction. This phenomenon was observed in&#xD;
      100% of homozygous and, interestingly, in 100% of the heterozygous FXIII-knockout mice,&#xD;
      despite a FXIII plasma level of 70%. Replenishment of FXIII during the 5-day acute and&#xD;
      subacute period of infarct healing restored survival rates of FXIII-deficient mice to that of&#xD;
      wild-type mice. In addition, reduced FXIII activity imaged via single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography predicted adverse infarct healing after MI in mice. In contrast,&#xD;
      increased intracardiac FXIII activity via induction of high FXIII zymogen plasma levels&#xD;
      improved cardiac healing. Moreover, FXIII levels were significantly diminished in myocardial&#xD;
      biopsies of human ruptured MI. In a case series of 25 patients with acute MI, a mean decrease&#xD;
      of initially normal FXIII plasma values by 25% was reported during the first week after the&#xD;
      ischemic event. During the first week after MI, an acute phase reduction in FXIII plasma&#xD;
      levels has been described, with the nadir of reduction on day 3-6 after the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FXIII thus seems to mediate the formation of a well-cemented scar, reducing MVO and IMH and&#xD;
      improve healing and left ventricle remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a prospective observational study to identify how the differences in FXIII&#xD;
      levels in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients relate with intramyocardial haemorrhage&#xD;
      and microvascular damage as detected by cardiac magnetic resonance.&#xD;
