  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute abdomen is one of the most frequent causes for presentation to the emergency&#xD;
      department. Imaging plays an important role for an accurate diagnosis, which in turn&#xD;
      diminishes morbidity and mortality Jastaniah and Salih demonstrate optimum CT aspects and&#xD;
      emphasize on the important features of CT for those patients presenting with an acute&#xD;
      abdominal pain at the Emergency Department. The reported data by this study are based on the&#xD;
      author working experience, which forms a continuous protocol adjustment process. The present&#xD;
      study provides evidence that CT would result in definite diagnosis of patients with abdominal&#xD;
      pain in terms of the detection of some urgent conditions . The acute abdomen may be defined&#xD;
      generally as an intra-abdominal process causing severe pain and often requiring medical or&#xD;
      surgical intervention. The acute abdomen is a frequent entity at the Emergency Department,&#xD;
      the acute abdomen may be life threatening and so rapid diagnosis of patients presenting with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain is required . Diagnostic work-up with imaging can consist of plain&#xD;
      X-ray, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and even diagnostic laparoscopy. During&#xD;
      the last decade, a trend towards increased use of computed tomography in patients with&#xD;
      abdominal pain can be seen. In general, acute abdominal pain is responsible for about 10% of&#xD;
      total number of patients visiting the emergency. Quick and precise diagnosis for the urgent&#xD;
      cases is usually vital for treatment. Medical imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      most acute abdomen pain. Abdomen and pelvis are reviewed by CT scan. Specifically, in cases&#xD;
      of acute abdomen complain.&#xD;

      There is no gold standard for diagnosis of acute abdomen as it still a matter of cooperation&#xD;
      between clinical data, radiological and laboratory worker. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      demonstrate optimum CT aspects and emphasize on the important features of CT for those&#xD;
      patients presenting with an acute abdominal pain clinically suspected to have emergency&#xD;
      operation .&#xD;
