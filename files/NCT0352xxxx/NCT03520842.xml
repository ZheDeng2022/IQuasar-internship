  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well regorafenib works together with methotrexate in treating&#xD;
      participants with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with tumors that harbor&#xD;
      a KRAS mutation. Regorafenib is a targeted therapy that works on different cancer pathways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells and stop them from spreading. Methotrexate may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving regorafenib and&#xD;
      methotrexate together may work in treating participants with KRAS mutated non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of the combination of regorafenib and&#xD;
      methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination of regorafenib and&#xD;
      methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of the combination of regorafenib&#xD;
      and methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1&#xD;
      prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic&#xD;
      KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as&#xD;
      the number of subjects that experience a treatment-emergent adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic&#xD;
      KRAS-mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as&#xD;
      the number (percent) of participants experiencing any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate when combined with regorafenib&#xD;
      (i.e., trough and maximum serum concentration [Cmax]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and methotrexate PO twice weekly&#xD;
      with 2-3 days apart on a 3 week on / 1 week off schedule. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants will come in for an end of study treatment&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)&#xD;
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria</description>
