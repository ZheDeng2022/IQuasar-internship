&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are voluntary to participate in the study and sign a written ICF, and&#xD;
             willing and able to follow the study protocol (e.g. able to understand and complete&#xD;
             the questionnaire, follow the visit plan and use the drug).&#xD;
&#xD;

          3. Subjects who are diagnosed with moderately to severely active RA with a course of&#xD;
             disease of at least 6 months, DAS28 CRP &gt; 3.2 at Screening, and at least 6 swollen&#xD;
             joints (based on 66 joints) and 6 tender joints (based on 68 joints) at Screening and&#xD;
             Baseline (Day 1) visit. If a joint has both swollen and tender symptoms, then this&#xD;
             joint should be included in both the SJC and TJC (except for artificial joints).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. MTX-IR: Subjects must be currently receiving MTX 10-25 mg/week for at least 12 weeks&#xD;
             and have been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry (Day 1). MTX&#xD;
             needs to be given at a stable dose throughout the study, unless dose adjustments are&#xD;
             made for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  a dose determined based on local medical practice) or equivalent medications&#xD;
                  (combination medications necessary for MTX therapy) during the entire study, and&#xD;
                  the dose of folic acid or equivalent medications should be stable for a minimum&#xD;

                  at least 8 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1), but if they have&#xD;
                  received standard cholestyramine elution treatment for 11 days, leflunomide will&#xD;

                  (Day 1); other DMARDs will need to be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
                  start of study treatment (Day 1). These drugs are not allowed to be used&#xD;
                  throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. If the subject is being treated with Tripterygium wilfordii, the drug should be&#xD;
                  discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1) and&#xD;
                  is not allowed to be used throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If the subject is receiving oral glucocorticoid treatment, the dose should not&#xD;

                  the dose should have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study&#xD;
                  treatment (Day 1) and remain stable throughout the 24-week treatment period&#xD;
                  (except for those receiving rescue treatment); if already discontinued, oral&#xD;
                  glucocorticoids should have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;

                  remain on a stable dose throughout the 24-week treatment period (except for those&#xD;
                  receiving rescue treatment); if already discontinued, NSAIDs should have been&#xD;
                  discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1).&#xD;
