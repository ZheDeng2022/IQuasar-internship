  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different cognitive intervention approaches have been developed to attenuate decline (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive engagement, training, or stimulation), but it is not clear which approaches are&#xD;
      efficacious. It is also not clear when, along the continuum of normal cognitive aging to mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI-a transitional stage before dementia onset), it is most efficacious&#xD;
      to intervene. This randomized clinical trial will determine the efficacy of a novel cognitive&#xD;
      engagement intervention approach (music training) as compared to cognitive stimulation (which&#xD;
      will serve as a stringent, active control). Grounded in theory, the central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that interventions enhancing central auditory processing (CAP), a strong, longitudinal&#xD;
      predictor of MCI and dementia, will improve cognition. Music training is increasingly&#xD;
      recognized as a feasible means to attenuate age-related cognitive decline. Prior research and&#xD;
      preliminary data suggest that intense piano training enhances CAP and is likely more&#xD;
      effective than cognitive stimulation. Correlational studies indicate superior CAP, executive&#xD;
      function, and other cognitive abilities for adults with formal music training compared to&#xD;
      non-musicians. The specific aims of the study are to examine the efficacy of music training&#xD;
      relative to cognitive stimulation (active controls) to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday&#xD;
      function among older adults with and without MCI. The efficacy of music training will be&#xD;
      established and moderating effects of MCI status will be examined. The proposed study further&#xD;
      aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of effective cognitive intervention approaches by&#xD;
      exploring mediators of training gains. The proposed study is the first phase II randomized&#xD;
      trial of music training to enhance older adults' cognition. Mediation analyses will elucidate&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms of intervention effects.&#xD;

      Interventions to Attenuate Cognitive Decline: Keys to Staying Sharp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives is to examine the efficacy of music training to improve central&#xD;
      auditory processing (CAP), cognition, and everyday function among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the moderating effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on music training&#xD;
           efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore mediators of intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The design is a two arm randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of music&#xD;
      training to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday function in older adults with and without&#xD;
      MCI across two time points (baseline and immediate post-test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The effects of of music training on CAP, cognition, and everyday functional&#xD;
      performance will be quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAP processing measures will include: Time Compressed Speech 65%, Words-in-Noise, Dichotic&#xD;
      Digits Test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, and Adaptive Tests of Temporal Resolution. A&#xD;
      composite will be derived from principal components analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition measures will include: Verbal Fluency Test (phonemic fluency, category fluency, and&#xD;
      category switching), Trail Making Test, and Digit Coding. A composite will be derived from&#xD;
      principal component analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday Function measures will include: Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and&#xD;
      Test of Everyday Attention. A composite will be derived from principal component analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration Two types of music training will be investigated. The two training&#xD;
      conditions will be equivalent in terms of frequency and duration of each session (90 min/day,&#xD;
      two days/wk, 10 weeks) and social contact (led by trainer and conducted in groups of up to 10&#xD;
      persons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population In-person screening of a maximum of 500 potential study&#xD;
      participants are planned to enroll up to 400 participants. The goal is to have at least 200&#xD;
      participants complete the study. Individuals with normal cognition and those with a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study.&#xD;
