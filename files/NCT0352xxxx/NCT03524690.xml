  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of prolonged negative energy balance, commonly observed in sustained military&#xD;
      training and combat operations, on systemic inflammatory responses has not been determined.&#xD;
      To define the putative role of energy balance on inflammation and its downstream effects, we&#xD;
      will conduct a controlled laboratory study that simulates extensive physiological stressors&#xD;
      to determine if inflammation is exacerbated by underfeeding. This design will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that maintaining energy balance will attenuate systemic inflammation and its&#xD;
      potential negative effects on whole-body metabolic homeostasis in response to physiological&#xD;
      stressors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endurance exercise elicits skeletal muscle and systemic inflammation. Inflammation in&#xD;
      response to endurance exercise is normally attenuated with adequate rest and recovery as&#xD;
      skeletal muscle adapts with training. However, performing repeated bouts of prolonged and&#xD;
      unaccustomed, muscle damaging (i.e., eccentric loading) endurance exercise may be detrimental&#xD;
      to performance and limit the adaptive responses to exercise by diminishing the absorption of&#xD;
      key nutrients. Warfighters are commonly exposed to such exercise bouts during sustained&#xD;
      training and combat operations, the effects of which may be exacerbated by negative energy&#xD;
      balance. Therefore, to define the putative role of energy balance on systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      we will conduct a controlled laboratory study that simulates the physiological stressors&#xD;
      imposed during sustained military training and combat operations to determine if systemic&#xD;
      inflammation is exacerbated by underfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-six male, non-obese (body mass index 19.9-29.9 kg/m2), physically active adults will&#xD;
      be recruited to participate in a 32 d, longitudinal study. The study is comprised of four&#xD;
      sequential phases: 1) a 96 h testing period, 2) a 7 day recovery period (Recovery 1), 3) a&#xD;
      second, 96 h testing period, and 4) a 14 d recovery period (Recovery 2). During testing,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to consume either sufficient food (combat rations) to maintain&#xD;
      energy balance or will be provided a restricted amount of food to elicit severe negative&#xD;
      energy balance. Mineral absorption studies and will be conducted during each testing&#xD;
      condition, energy balance and energy negative balance. This design will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that maintaining energy balance will attenuate systemic inflammation and its potential&#xD;
      negative effects on whole-body metabolic homeostasis in response to physiological stressors.&#xD;
