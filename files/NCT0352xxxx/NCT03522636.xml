      Trauma is a leading cause of death among people younger than 44 years. Five million people&#xD;
      worldwide die from trauma annually. Uncontrolled haemorrhage causing traumatic-haemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock (THS) is the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths from severe trauma.&#xD;
      Uncorrected hypervolaemia and prolonged shock cause severe tissue hypoperfusion, vital organ&#xD;
      ischemia and subsequently acidosis. In up to one third of trauma patients, laboratory&#xD;
      findings suggest traumatic induced coagulopathy, which is further triggered by loss or&#xD;
      dilution of coagulation factors. These patients have a significantly increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality compared to patients with similar injury patterns without coagulopathy. Minimizing&#xD;
      the time to surgical control of haemorrhage is key in order to improve outcome. However,&#xD;
      immediate and goal directed volume and coagulation resuscitation including use of blood&#xD;
      transfusion is crucial to enable survival until definitive hospital care. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study will be to evaluate feasibility of prehospital administration of 1&#xD;
      unit of human plasma and 1 unit of red blood cells, and explore association of early&#xD;
      prehospital transfusion with early outcomes in patients presenting with THS, severe bleeding&#xD;
      or peri-arrest state who are matching indication criteria and are transported by Helicopter&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Service. Results of clinical examinations and laboratory variables in a&#xD;
      group of patients receiving prehospital transfusion will be compared to matched population of&#xD;
      patients treated before blood has been available on board. Secondary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      detect any potential logistical and/or organisational adverse effects, incl.&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, in a regional trauma system with prehospital times (time of injury to&#xD;
      trauma centre) ranging from 45 to 75 minutes.&#xD;

      Background and rationale of the project Trauma is a leading cause of death among people&#xD;
      younger than 44 years. Uncontrolled haemorrhage causing traumatic-haemorrhagic shock (THS) is&#xD;
      the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths from severe trauma. Uncorrected&#xD;
      hypervolaemia and prolonged shock cause severe tissue hypoperfusion, vital organ ischemia and&#xD;
      subsequently acidosis. Shock, acidosis and hypothermia are recognized drivers of&#xD;
      anti-coagulant and fibrinolytic pathways. In up to one third of trauma patients, laboratory&#xD;
      findings suggest traumatic induced coagulopathy, which is further triggered by loss or&#xD;
      dilution of coagulation factors. These patients have a significantly increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality compared to patients with similar injury patterns without coagulopathy. Minimizing&#xD;
      the time to surgical control of haemorrhage is key in order to improve outcome. However,&#xD;
      immediate and goal directed volume and coagulation resuscitation including use of blood&#xD;
      product transfusion is crucial to enable survival until definitive hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of HEMS in a trauma system. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) can rapidly&#xD;
      deliver advanced medical care and speed up patient transport to designated trauma centres. In&#xD;
      the Czech Republic, HEMS covers 76.5% of the area and 99.4% of the population of the Czech&#xD;
      Republic within 20 minutes since the emergency call is received via Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Dispatch Centre (EMDC). HEMS Hradec Kralove is one of the well-recognized systems in the&#xD;
      country. Its catchment area is 1.1 million inhabitants living in the Hradec Kralove and&#xD;
      Pardubice regions. Trauma patients include 100-120 multiple trauma injuries and 50-60&#xD;
      isolated traumatic brain injuries (TBI) annually. In 2017, there were 95.9% primary flights&#xD;
      (to the scene of accident), of which 81.9% take-offs were decided by EMDC dispatchers&#xD;
      immediately after receiving an emergency call. Management of patients in THS requires early&#xD;
      identification of the bleeding source, use of effective techniques to stop compressible&#xD;
      haemorrhage, support of clot formation and minimisation of on-going blood loss in&#xD;
      non-compressible haemorrhage, judicious fluid resuscitation with monitoring of effect, and a&#xD;
      pre-alert system for damage control resuscitation or surgery at the receiving hospital. HEMS&#xD;
      teams must be skilled to recognise and treat massive bleeding and acute traumatic&#xD;
      coagulopathy in the pre-hospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostics of THS. Haemorrhage leads to a fall in systemic filling pressure and venous&#xD;
      return. The resulting decrease in cardiac minute volume, and therefore in oxygen and nutrient&#xD;
      supply, sets off an endogenous stress response aiming to maintain perfusion pressure. Thus,&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate must be interpreted with caution, and cardiac output might have&#xD;
      dropped to some 60% until blood pressure will start to decrease. Although a systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure &lt;90 mmHg is the typically considered as the leading symptom of hypovolemic shock,&#xD;
      clinical assessment of trauma patients comprises on-going and repeated evaluation of the&#xD;
      mental status, capillary filling time, clinical appearance, changes in heart rate, and&#xD;
      mechanism of injury. Current literature suggests that the combined evaluation of heart rate,&#xD;
      SABP, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the ability to maintain a patent airway increases the&#xD;
      predictability for advanced in-hospital interventions up to four times. This is of particular&#xD;
      importance for an in-hospital blood transfusion request policy. Suitable triggers for&#xD;
      preparation for massive transfusion are suspicion or evidence of active haemorrhage, incl.&#xD;
      trauma triage criteria, systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP) &lt; 90 mmHg, failure to respond&#xD;
      to a fluid bolus, heart rate &gt; 120/min, and penetrating injuries. Accordingly, physical&#xD;
      examination on scene should focus on injury patterns known to cause haemorrhage such as&#xD;
      penetrating trauma, pelvic or femoral fractures and blunt abdominal trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehospital treatment of THS. The up-to-date concept of initial trauma care is called damage&#xD;
      control resuscitation, which comprises hypotensive resuscitation, haemostatic resuscitation&#xD;
      and damage control surgery. Control of haemorrhage is crucial in order to interrupt the&#xD;
      vicious circle of blood loss, hypervolaemia, hypoperfusion, acidosis and coagulopathy,&#xD;
      finally resulting in therapy refractory shock and death. Basic techniques like direct&#xD;
      compression, pressure dressings, tourniquets, traction devices and pelvic splints are used&#xD;
      routinely in obvious or suspicious bleeding. In life threatening haemorrhagic shock, fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation is still the main stem therapy. The primary and ultimate goal of pre-hospital&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation is to prevent hypovolemic cardiac arrest and to minimize organ damage&#xD;
      caused by prolonged or uncorrected hypotension causing organ ischemia. For this reason&#xD;
      permissive hypotension should only be applied in the first hour after the insult. There are&#xD;
      extensive side effects of fluid resuscitation in uncontrolled bleeding patients.&#xD;
      Inappropriate or over-infusion has been shown to harm and to worsen outcome. Hypotensive&#xD;
      resuscitation is a temporary strategy for management of patients with uncontrolled blood loss&#xD;
      until the source of bleeding is controlled. Fluid resuscitation should be spared or postponed&#xD;
      in patients with uncontrolled haemorrhage, normal mental status and SABP &gt; 90 mmHg. Fluids&#xD;
      should be titrated in uncontrolled bleeding patients without head trauma to a target SABP&#xD;
      around 90 mmHg. However, it is noteworthy that the concept of hypotensive resuscitation must&#xD;
      be tailored and adjusted to the patients need. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      higher SABP must be achieved with higher amounts of fluids and very seldom use of vasopressor&#xD;
      drugs when necessary. There is an on-going debate which fluids and what amounts should be&#xD;
      considered optimal for haemorrhagic shock management. Colloids did not show to improve&#xD;
      outcome when compared with crystalloids. The same is true for hyperosmolar solutions.&#xD;
      Compared to the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and other highly developed countries, there are&#xD;
      no prehospital blood products currently available in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe,&#xD;
      partially because of high logistic and material demands, risk of wasting, high expenses, and&#xD;
      unproven benefit of prehospital use of red blood cells without plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-operation between HEMS and a trauma centre. The regional trauma system in the Hradec&#xD;
      Kralove Region has been gradually developed during last couple of years. One of its main&#xD;
      advantages is excellent long-term co-operation between EMDC, HEMS, and receiving trauma&#xD;
      centre, incl. quality management. There are different triage tools used to help to outline&#xD;
      patient routes to trauma centres. These latter can include immediate need for blood or life&#xD;
      saving surgery. In Hradec Kralove, it was for the first time in the Czech Republic, when a&#xD;
      new concept of trauma triage was implemented and improved on-scene triage. The triage&#xD;
      criteria were adopted from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and include: mechanism of&#xD;
      injury (e.g. fall from height &gt; 6 m, person trapped in a vehicle), anatomical and&#xD;
      physiological criteria, and selected special considerations (e.g. age, comorbidities). Its&#xD;
      specificity is 8-10% and sensitivity 95-97%. The same triage system was later implemented&#xD;
      into all other prehospital systems, integrated into the nation-wide recommendations of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (Trauma Care in the Czech Republic) and Guidelines of the Czech Society&#xD;
      for Emergency and Disaster Medicine ČLS JEP. Use of pre-hospital triage can predict risk of&#xD;
      THS and need for specialized trauma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehospital blood transfusion. Haemostatic resuscitation is the very early use of blood&#xD;
      products as primary resuscitation fluid to prevent exsanguination by trauma-induced&#xD;
      coagulopathy. The recommended ratio of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets is&#xD;
      1:1:1. In a few locations around the world, physician led HEMS teams provide advanced medical&#xD;
      interventions such as thoracotomy, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of aorta&#xD;
      (REBOA), and blood product (BP) transfusion which traditionally occurred in the highly&#xD;
      specialized hospital centres. Administration of BPs in a helicopter has been studied in&#xD;
      specific cohorts including either longer transport times to definitive treatment facility,&#xD;
      high prevalence of penetrating thorax and epigastrium injuries, or war injuries with&#xD;
      restricted medical care. The potential role of packed red blood cells is yet to be&#xD;
      identified, although many HEMS systems already demonstrated feasibility. Recent systematic&#xD;
      review searching bibliographic databases to July 2015 did not identify any prospective&#xD;
      comparative or randomized studies on prehopsital use of BPs. A single study showed improved&#xD;
      survival in the first 24 hours, but vast majority of studies provided very low quality of&#xD;
      evidence. None of these studies was performed on a cohort of patients similar to the&#xD;
      population treated in our setting: blunt injuries and short prehospital times. Transfusion&#xD;
      reactions were rare, suggesting the short-term safety of prehospital BP administration equal&#xD;
      to those occurring at emergency departments. Current practice at the HEMS Hradec Kralove is&#xD;
      to prealert the admitting facility and request blood products from the scene. These are&#xD;
      available after helicopter arrival at hospital. It was calculated that availability of BPs on&#xD;
      board would result in earlier BP transfusion for at least 20-30 minutes compared to current&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Given evidence in support of massive transfusion protocol in hospitals, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that early prehospital BP transfusion will be associated with lower&#xD;
      risk of THS and coagulopathy on admission to the trauma centre, and during 24 hours after&#xD;
      admission. Lower requirements for BP transfusion during 24 hours after admission, improved&#xD;
      24-hour mortality, and outcome on discharge from hospital are also expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Conditional logistic regression and mixed-effects linear regression&#xD;
      will be used to determine the association of early administration of BP transfusion with&#xD;
      outcome variables. Patients receiving BP transfusion are supposed to be more severely injured&#xD;
      with a higher risk of mortality. Because of this, we cannot compare their outcome data to&#xD;
      those of patients without prehospital BP transfusions, but with a retrospective cohort of&#xD;
      patients who had received massive transfusion protocol already requested by HEMS from the&#xD;
      scene during the period of previous 12/24 months before implementation of BP transfusion into&#xD;
      HEMS. To prevent selection bias, the propensity score model will be developed to predict the&#xD;
      likelihood of receiving BP transfusion based on several prehospital variables to allow&#xD;
      appropriate matching of treated and control patients based on this probability of receiving&#xD;
      BP transfusion. Covariates in the propensity score model will include age, SABP, heart rate,&#xD;
      crystalloid volume before HEMS arrival (if given by a ground ambulance team), crystalloid&#xD;
      volume during HEMS transport, type of injury (blunt vs. penetrating), prehospital time and&#xD;
      distance to hospital. Covariates for 24-hour survival will include at least sex, Injury&#xD;
      Severity Score (ISS), SABP, heart rate and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) at admission, INR,&#xD;
      rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters (e.g. clotting time, alfa-angle), intensive&#xD;
      care unit admission, days of mechanical ventilation, and need for surgery. Similar covariates&#xD;
      will be used for THS and trauma induced coagulopathy indicators. Subgroup analysis will be&#xD;
      performed for patients with traumatic cardiac arrest.&#xD;
