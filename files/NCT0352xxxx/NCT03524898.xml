      A clinical trial with biweekly regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for Soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas (STSs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic STS has been reported with&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone or in combination with taxanes including docetaxel and paclitaxel in&#xD;
      pre-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is a 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel particles (Celgene,&#xD;
      Summit, NJ) which was designed to eliminate the toxicities associated with Cremophor®-EL.&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel at equal dose of paclitaxel showed increased antitumor activity, enhanced&#xD;
      endothelial cell transport and 33% higher intra-tumor paclitaxel concentration in preclinical&#xD;
      models of solid tumor xenografts promising an advantageous pharmacokinetic profile In&#xD;
      sarcoma, nab-paclitaxel demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor activity in rhabdomyosarcoma&#xD;
      xenograft model. Local relapsed tumors following paclitaxel treatment proved to be&#xD;
      paclitaxel-resistant but remained responsive to nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings provide the rationale for further evaluation of nab-paclitaxel in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine for soft tissue sarcoma treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) account for 1% of all human cancers and consist of at least 50&#xD;
      different histological subtypes which have different clinical behavior and response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients with advanced disease (locally advanced or metastatic) have a somber&#xD;
      prognosis with a median OS between 12 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment in the metastatic setting, although in a&#xD;
      small subset with limited metastases local treatment may be curative. First-line treatment&#xD;
      for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma includes doxorubicin hydrochloride, alone or in combination&#xD;
      with other chemotherapy agents (e.g., ifosfamide), or olaratumab. Beyond first line several&#xD;
      agents have shown activity, including gemcitabine/docetaxel, trabectedin and pazopanib,&#xD;
      though no standard regimen has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic STS has been reported with&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone or in combination with taxanes including docetaxel and paclitaxel in&#xD;
      pre-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is a 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel particles (Abraxane®,&#xD;
      Celgene, Summit, NJ) which was designed to eliminate the toxicities associated with Cremophor&#xD;
      EL®. Nab-paclitaxel at equal dose of paclitaxel showed increased antitumor activity, enhanced&#xD;
      endothelial cell transport and 33% higher intra-tumor paclitaxel concentration in preclinical&#xD;

&#xD;
      These findings provide the rationale for further evaluation of nab-paclitaxel in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine for soft tissue sarcoma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and feasibility of combining nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether or not gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel regimen exhibits antitumor&#xD;
           activity that is worth testing further in STS.&#xD;
