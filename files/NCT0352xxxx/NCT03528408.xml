  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-site, single-arm Phase 2 study of adjuvant nivolumab combined&#xD;
      with ipilimumab for the treatment of adult subjects with completely treated high-risk ocular&#xD;
      melanoma, as defined in eligibility criteria, without evidence of metastatic disease. All&#xD;
      patients enrolled to the study will be treated with nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus&#xD;
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV every 6 weeks. 1 cycle = 6 weeks. Treatment will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request to discontinue or completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects may receive up to 25 doses of nivolumab and 8 doses of ipilimumab&#xD;
