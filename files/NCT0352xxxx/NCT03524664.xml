  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the emotion regulation skills of children with&#xD;
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and different strategies that may improve these&#xD;
      skills. This study is also testing whether a training program taught to caregivers is&#xD;
      helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a brief measure of verbal and nonverbal problem-solving skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Play two computer games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have their heart rate measured while completing a task that is designed to be mildly&#xD;
           disappointing. Two ECG pads are placed on the chest with a small recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Play or relax with study staff while you are finishing caregiver activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will be asked to complete interviews and questionnaires about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the child's background, including any past stressful experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the child's behavior and how s/he handles emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  caregiver views on the child's emotions and their own&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  caregiver relationship with the child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress caregivers experience as a parent&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have high rates of mental health&#xD;
      problems and incur physical and mental health expenditures that are 9 times higher than other&#xD;
      children. These mental health problems contribute to poor social adjustment for children with&#xD;
      FASD and result in considerable emotional and financial burden for families. Emotion&#xD;
      regulation is a core area of impairment in FASD and is implicated in most mental health&#xD;
      disorders. Research on empirically validated interventions for children with FASD is limited.&#xD;
      Results from two interventions targeting emotion regulation in FASD demonstrate that&#xD;
      child-focused interventions are insufficient to habilitate children's emotion regulation to&#xD;
      adaptive levels. Research is needed to identify alternate targets for intervention (e.g.,&#xD;
      parent training, environmental modifications) to improve the emotion regulation difficulties&#xD;
      of children with FASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates a novel intervention target to improve the emotion regulation and&#xD;
      adaptive functioning of children with FASD. Research with other populations provides ample&#xD;
      evidence for the impact of parent emotion socialization on the development of child emotion&#xD;
      regulation and other outcomes. In addition, studies demonstrate that parent emotion&#xD;
      socialization is amendable to intervention and results in improved child and parent outcomes.&#xD;
      However, no studies have investigated the emotion socialization practices utilized by parents&#xD;
      of children with FASD or whether interventions targeting parent emotion socialization result&#xD;
      in improved child emotion regulation and behavior in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address this critical gap by initiating an empirical test of a promising&#xD;
      emotion-focused intervention, Tuning In To Kids (TIK), with families raising children with&#xD;
      FASD. Results from this initial efficacy trial will determine whether parent emotion&#xD;
      socialization is a promising intervention target for this population. Consistent with a&#xD;
      developmental psychopathology perspective, multi-level data from the efficacy trial will be&#xD;
      leveraged to test theorized associations between parent emotion socialization and child&#xD;
      emotion regulation and identify possible factors contributing to individual differences.&#xD;
      These results will inform possible intervention adaptations for this population and provide&#xD;
      the necessary foundation for larger-scale efficacy trials. The long-term goals of this&#xD;
      research are to better understand the complex factors influencing emotion regulation in&#xD;
      children with FASD and improve mental health interventions and outcomes for this population.&#xD;

    <measure>mean change in parent awareness of own emotion score for sadness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The meta emotion interview is a semi-structured interview administered to parents about their own experience of anger and sadness and their feelings, attitudes, and behaviors toward their children's anger and sadness. Interviews are audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Interviews can be analyzed quantitatively using a checklist rating system. The Revised Meta-Emotion coding system uses a 5-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree) with which coders rate each item based on both the content and the way parents talk about emotions. The scores range from 1-5 with 5 indicating better outcome.</description>

    <measure>mean change in proportion of observed emotion coaching statements using the Family Narrative Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Narrative Task is a parent-child interaction task assessing how parents communicate about emotions with their children. Parents are instructed to engage the child in a conversation about three emotional events in turn: a positive family experience, a difficult family experience, and a time when the child misbehaved. Interactions are videotaped and coded for content and function using the Family Emotion Communication Scoring System, Revised. Emotion coaching (e.g., &quot;I could tell you were mad because you walked away,&quot; &quot;How did you feel when that happened?&quot;) and dismissing (e.g., &quot;It wasn't anything to get upset over,&quot; abrupt change in topic) will be coded. Number of emotion coaching statements versus total statements will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The Emotion Regulation Checklist is a 24-item parent report questionnaire assessing children's affect lability (e.g., &quot;exhibits wide mood swings,&quot; &quot;is easily frustrated&quot;) and emotion regulation (e.g., &quot;is empathetic towards others,&quot; &quot;can say when s/he is feeling sad, angry, fearful, or afraid&quot;). This assessment is 24 items rated by the parent on a 4 point scale of never to always given at baseline, 8 and 20 weeks. There are 12 items of lability and 12 items of emotion regulation. For emotion regulation the score ranges from 12-48 with higher scores reflecting better emotion regulation.</description>

    <description>The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory is a 36-item scale assessing the intensity of disruptive behaviors in children. Parents rate each item on a 7 point scale. This is then converted into a standardize score with a T score with mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 with higher scores reflecting more problems. This is given at baseline, 8 and 20 weeks.</description>
