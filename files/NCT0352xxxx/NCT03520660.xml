      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hepatitis C infects the liver. It may scar the liver. This is called cirrhosis and&#xD;
      may lead to liver cancer or death. Current chronic hepatitis C treatments cure most people.&#xD;
      But some keep getting complications even after it is cured. Researchers want to study why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the course and complications of liver disease after cure of hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 years and older infected with chronic hepatitis C virus who were never treated or&#xD;
      were treated and not cured and those who were cured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroscan. A probe vibrates the liver, testing stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, people with chronic hepatitis C will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a 3-day hospital admission to repeat some screening tests and have a liver biopsy. A&#xD;
      small piece of liver is removed by needle passed through the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take 1 tablet containing 2 hepatitis C drugs once a day for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat some blood tests at 3 visits in those 12 weeks while on treatment, then 4 additional&#xD;
      visits in the next 24 weeks with more blood work collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants who test negative for hepatitis C and all other eligible participants&#xD;
      will enter Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 participants will have a visit every 24 weeks for 10 years. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeats of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy. A tube guides a camera into the upper digestive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 5 years, participants will have another liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will give separate consent for genetic testing and a special blood&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We intend to enroll up to 350 subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from two sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: treatment naive or experienced who have failed a prior treatment (including&#xD;
      DAA-experienced) who are willing to undergo a pre-treatment liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects yet to achieve an SVR will receive 12 weeks of therapy with sofosbuvir/velapatasvir&#xD;
      (Epclusa ) fixed dose combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects yet to achieve SVR with evidence of clinical cirrhosis will undergo a transjugular&#xD;
      liver biopsy with hepatic venous portal gradient (HVPG) pressure measurements in lieu of the&#xD;
      percutaneous liver biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: subjects who have already achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) with oral&#xD;
      direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) only regimen and who have undergone a liver biopsy prior&#xD;
      to therapy and no history of hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have attained an SVR prior to enrollment (or upon achieving an SVR24 in Phase I)&#xD;
      will undergo a thorough medical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroscan&#xD;
&#xD;
      hepatic ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, subjects will be followed prospectively every 24 weeks for liver decompensation&#xD;
      (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage),&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality. During each study&#xD;
      visit, subjects will be questioned on the development of these adverse outcomes. In addition,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn for the assessment of routine blood tests, quantitative viral biomarker&#xD;
      levels, serological response markers and immune cell functional status. Blood, urine and&#xD;
      stool will be collected and stored for exploratory biomarker development. Fibroscan will be&#xD;
      performed annually in all subjects. For subjects with cirrhosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy&#xD;
      (EDG) will be performed annually and imaging every 24 weeks. At the end of 240 weeks, all&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted for a liver biopsy to assess the stage of liver fibrosis. In&#xD;
      subjects with cirrhosis at study entry, the liver biopsy will be performed by the&#xD;
      transjugular route with hepatic venous portal gradient (HVPG) pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study will be to describe the outcome of viral eradication following&#xD;
      treatment with direct acting antiviral agents, to identify predictors of adverse outcomes&#xD;
      after sustained viral eradication and regression of fibrosis/cirrhosis.&#xD;
