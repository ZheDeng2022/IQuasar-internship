      The aims of this study are as follows: AIM 1: To examine the weight loss and weight&#xD;
      maintenance efficacy of an alternate day fasting-high protein (ADF-HP) diet; AIM 2: To&#xD;
      examine the effects of an ADF-HP diet on metabolic disease risk factors (plasma lipids,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance).&#xD;

      Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that alternate day fasting (ADF) is an effective&#xD;
      diet strategy to help individuals with obesity lose weight and lower metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
      ADF regimens include a &quot;feast day&quot; where food is consumed ad-libitum over 24 h, alternated&#xD;
      with a &quot;fast day&quot; where intake is limited to ~600 kcal over 24 h. What has yet to be&#xD;
      elucidated is whether consuming a high protein diet (as meal replacements) during ADF is&#xD;
      effective for weight loss, weight maintenance, and metabolic disease risk reduction in&#xD;
      individuals with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aims of this study are as follows: AIM 1: To examine the weight loss and&#xD;
      weight maintenance efficacy of an alternate day fasting-high protein (ADF-HP) diet; AIM 2: To&#xD;
      examine the effects of an ADF-HP diet on metabolic disease risk factors (plasma lipids,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 24-week, single-center, longitudinal pilot study will be conducted to test the&#xD;
      study objectives. The trial will be divided into 2 consecutive intervention periods: (1)&#xD;
      12-week weight loss period, and (2) 12-week weight maintenance period. Subjects with obesity&#xD;
      will participate in an ADF-HP: alternate day fasting-high protein diet: 600 kcal &quot;fast day&quot;&#xD;
      alternated with ad libitum &quot;feast day&quot;, 35% kcal as protein. ADF-HP subjects will consume the&#xD;
      Optifast HP Shake Mix (Nestle) on each day of the trial. Body weight, insulin, glucose, and&#xD;
      insulin resistance, will be measured at baseline, week 12, and week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: These findings may show that alternate day fasting combined with high protein&#xD;
      meal replacements may be implemented as an effective diet therapy to help individuals with&#xD;
      obesity lose weight, maintain weight loss, and sustain reductions in metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
