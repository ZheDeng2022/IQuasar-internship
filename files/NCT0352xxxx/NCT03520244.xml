  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Engagement in regular physical activity (PA) is associated with a range of physical and&#xD;
      psychological benefits among chronic disease populations. Celiac disease is a chronic&#xD;
      autoimmune condition that requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for the best&#xD;
      medical outcomes, as well as to prevent detrimental health outcomes including bloating,&#xD;
      diarrhea, constipation, and increased risk of intestinal cancers and osteoporosis. Despite&#xD;
      following a GFD, individuals with celiac disease often report dissatisfaction with the diet,&#xD;
      are less likely to engage in social activities, can have an imbalance in gut bacteria and up&#xD;
      to 30% still report negative symptoms (e.g., gastro-intestinal upset). Furthermore,&#xD;
      preliminary research revealed that rates of PA among those with celiac disease are dismal,&#xD;
      with the majority of participants failing to engage in regular PA. The purpose of this pilot&#xD;
      research project is to examine the effects of a 12-week structured exercise program on&#xD;
      inactive adults with celiac disease. It is anticipated that compared to those in a wait-list&#xD;
      control condition, participants who engage in the 12-week exercise program will report&#xD;
      greater improvements in quality of life and experience improved balance of gut bacteria. The&#xD;
      findings from this project may reveal an additional strategy to optimize health while living&#xD;
      with celiac disease. In addition, results from this study will provide essential pilot data&#xD;
      that will inform a grant application for a larger clinical trial to further investigate the&#xD;
      role of exercise in the promotion of health and well-being among those with celiac disease.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engagement in regular physical activity (PA) is associated with a range of physical and&#xD;
      psychological benefits among chronic disease populations. Quality of life (QoL) is&#xD;
      significantly higher among people with cancer, depression and coronary heart disease who&#xD;
      engage in PA on a regular basis. Risk of other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      significantly reduced when people engage in regular PA. In addition, findings from a recent&#xD;
      intervention study revealed that after engaging in a 12-week structured exercise program,&#xD;
      cancer survivors had improvements in physical functioning, and reductions in fatigue and&#xD;
      tiredness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One chronic disease population that could particularly benefit from engaging in regular PA is&#xD;
      people with celiac disease. Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune condition and the&#xD;
      incidence has increased 4 to 5 times over the past 50 years. Strict adherence to a&#xD;
      gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only treatment for preventing both short- and&#xD;
      long-term consequences from celiac disease (e.g., infertility, intestinal cancers,&#xD;
      osteoporosis). Unfortunately, preliminary research revealed that rates of PA among those with&#xD;
      celiac disease are dismal, with the majority of participants failing to engage in regular PA.&#xD;
      Further, following a strict GFD alone may not be sufficient to effectively manage the&#xD;
      disease, and can be associated with detrimental outcomes including reduced QoL. Despite&#xD;
      following a GFD, individuals with celiac disease report high treatment burden, lower social&#xD;
      engagement, fatigue, altered gut microbiota, and up to 30% still report negative symptoms&#xD;
      (e.g., gastro-intestinal upset). Given the benefits of engagement in regular PA for other&#xD;
      chronic disease populations, helping people with celiac disease become more physically active&#xD;
      may lead to improvements in QoL and physiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has been found to be appropriate for those with&#xD;
      lifestyle-induced chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and metabolic syndrome. HIIT involves repeated bouts of high intensity effort&#xD;
      followed by varied recovery times and can be easily modified for people of all fitness levels&#xD;
      and chronic conditions. For example, Jung and colleagues reported on the benefits of HIIT for&#xD;
      people with pre-diabetes and found that compared to participants engaging in moderate&#xD;
      intensity continuous training, participants who engaged in regular bouts of HIIT exercise had&#xD;
      better adherence to independent exercise. Martinez et al. found that participants who engaged&#xD;
      in shorter interval training (e.g., HIIT), reported more pleasure and enjoyment of the&#xD;
      exercise when compared to heavy, continuous or longer interval exercise. In addition to&#xD;
      improvements in behavioural outcomes, Denou and colleagues recently found that HIIT also led&#xD;
      to improvements in the gut microbiota of mice with diet induced obesity. Given that people&#xD;
      with celiac disease are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome and are likely to have gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis (imbalance in gut microorganisms), it is anticipated that HIIT may lead to&#xD;
      improvements in key psychosocial (e.g., QoL) and behavioural outcomes (i.e., exercise&#xD;
      adherence). Further, key markers of metabolic syndrome and balance in the gut microbiota may&#xD;
      be positively impacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is an innovative examination of the effects of exercise on physiological&#xD;
      and patient-reported outcomes among people with celiac disease. Specifically, we will explore&#xD;
      the effects of a 12-week HIIT and lifestyle intervention on QoL, gut microbiota profile,&#xD;
      independent PA, fatigue, and markers of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, fasting&#xD;
      glucose, serum lipids, blood pressure) among people with celiac disease who are currently&#xD;
      sedentary (i.e., not meeting Canada's PA Recommendations (150 minutes of weekly activity at a&#xD;
      moderate intensity or greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-week exercise program will entail two 60-minute structured group exercise sessions per&#xD;
      week. As participants will not be meeting the recommended guidelines for weekly PA, workouts&#xD;
      will be progressive in nature and an initial conditioning phase will be integrated into the&#xD;
      12-week program. Participants will begin with 20-30 minute exercise sessions and progress to&#xD;
      40-60 minute sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Each class will consist of warm-up,&#xD;
      training period, cool-down and flexibility sections. Participants will have the option of&#xD;
      using various pieces of equipment, including stationary bikes, treadmills and ellipticals.&#xD;
      All participants will wear heart rate monitors in order to monitor workout intensity.&#xD;
      Participants' programs will be designed by a Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology (CSEP)&#xD;
      Certified Exercise Physiologist® and exercise classes will be supervised by a CSEP-Certified&#xD;
      Personal Trainer®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise condition will participate in 30-minute bi-weekly group&#xD;
      education sessions. Education will pertain to learning about the importance of following a&#xD;
      nutritious, whole foods-based GFD to effectively manage celiac disease, communication&#xD;
      strategies, effective sleep hygiene practices, and strategies to overcome barriers to&#xD;
      following a strict GFD. Participants will also be taught behaviour change skills based on the&#xD;
      theoretically-based group-mediated cognitive behavioural (GMCB) approach. GMCB interventions&#xD;
      teach participants how to self-monitor daily activity, set goals and overcome barriers to&#xD;
      regular PA. To prevent dependence on the group, self-regulation becomes a greater emphasis&#xD;
      over the course of the GMCB sessions. Previous GMCB interventions have lead to greater&#xD;
      improvements in frequency of PA, long-term adherence, fitness, self-efficacy for mobility,&#xD;
      and barrier self-efficacy.&#xD;
