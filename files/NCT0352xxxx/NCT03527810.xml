  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject will undergo standard pre-operative preparation. Subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      the presence of bothersome GERD symptoms by GERD questionnaires and use of Proton-Pump&#xD;
      Inhibitor (PPI) medications. Those eligible will be approached at their preoperative&#xD;
      appointment about participation in the study and consent will be reviewed with subject.&#xD;
      Signed consent will be collected from the subject prior to entry into the operating room.&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia, the subject will be randomized to sleeve gastrectomy with or&#xD;
      without interrogation of the hiatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SG will be performed as per standard approaches already described. In those randomized to&#xD;
      interrogation, the hiatus will be opened posteriorly with preservation of the&#xD;
      phreno-esophageal ligament where possible, as per standard described techniques. Dissection&#xD;
      into the mediastinum will be stopped if no hernia is seen or when appropriate intra-abdominal&#xD;
      length of 2 cm of esophagus is created. Once opened, the Hiatal Surface Area (appendix B)17&#xD;
      will be measured, calculated and recorded and when possible, a photo taken of the area.&#xD;
      Repair of the crura will then be performed around the sizing tube used to create the sleeve&#xD;
      with enough space to allow a 5 mm instrument to be easily inserted. Permanent sutures will be&#xD;
      placed posterior to the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recovered and be discharged per standard protocol. Evaluation for reflux&#xD;
      will be conducted pre-operatively and then 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (+/- 30 days) after surgery&#xD;
      or on demand if symptoms occur between follow up periods. Many groups advocate the use of PPI&#xD;
      for the first 30 days after bariatric surgery - accordingly assessments of reflux will not&#xD;
      occur until 3 months post operatively when most groups stop prophylactic PPI use. A visit&#xD;
      within the first 30 days after surgery (+/- 15 days) should occur to evaluate for potential&#xD;
      complications of surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic continues to exist as nearly one third of the adult population in the&#xD;
      United States is reported to be obese1. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective method&#xD;
      of achieving long-term weight loss among obese individuals. The remarkable success of weight&#xD;
      loss surgery in ameliorating obesity and its related comorbid conditions has been tempered by&#xD;
      procedure specific side-effect profiles. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition&#xD;
      which develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome heartburn or&#xD;
      regurgitation symptoms greater than twice a week is a known complication of bariatric surgery&#xD;
      and remains a controversial topic among bariatric surgeons.2 The prevalence of GERD in the&#xD;
      general Western population is between 10 and 20% 3, whereas the incidence of reflux among the&#xD;
      obese population has been reported to be as high as 61%. 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and maintenance of native intestinal anatomy by the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has&#xD;
      recently made this surgery the most popular operation for weight loss in America 5. The&#xD;
      operation, which was originally described as the first stage of a biliopancreatic diversion -&#xD;
      duodenal switch, consists of removing approximately 60% of the native stomach. Specifically,&#xD;
      the bulbous greater curvature and a portion of the antrum is removed, leaving behind a long,&#xD;
      thin banana shaped reservoir with a capacity between 100 and 150 mL. 6 This new stomach&#xD;
      offers excellent weight loss and also minimal anatomic rearrangement when compared to the&#xD;
      traditional gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some authors have reported an improvement in GERD symptoms after SG many studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated an increase in GERD symptoms9-14. Particularly concerning is the&#xD;
      development of de-novo GERD symptoms after surgery, which has recently been reported to occur&#xD;
      in up to 36% of patients when measured objectively.15 In some, GERD symptoms are severe&#xD;
      enough, despite medication, that corrective operations are required. The need for further&#xD;
      re-operative surgery carries along with it the risk for additional perioperative morbidity&#xD;
      from gastrointestinal leaks or bleeding as well as further time off work and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of GERD after SG. Some&#xD;
      authors postulate that the new shape of the stomach, increased intra-gastric pressure,&#xD;
      decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure or development of a hiatal hernia&#xD;
      may lead to new or worsening GERD. The International Sleeve Gastrectomy Expert Panel&#xD;
      recommend aggressively inspecting for and repairing an occult hiatal hernia to decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of post-operative GERD.17 This call for &quot;aggressive inspection&quot; has led many&#xD;
      surgeons to open the phrenoesophageal ligament and, in a sense, create a small hernia defect&#xD;
      which is then sutured closed more tightly. Some believe aggressive interrogation of the&#xD;
      hiatus may lead to disruption of the integrity of the sling fibers of Helvetius at the&#xD;
      esophagogastric junction, thus contributing to the incidence of new or worsening&#xD;
      post-operative GERD. Still, others propose that the main mechanism of GERD reduction is&#xD;
      weight loss and not the re-creation of the extrinsic anti-reflux valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether one should aggressively interrogate and subsequently repair the hiatus during a SG&#xD;
      remains controversial. To our knowledge, there are no randomized studies to demonstrate&#xD;
      superiority of either approach. The aim is to compare the rates of GERD (de-novo or&#xD;
      worsening) in patients undergoing SG between one group receiving hiatal interrogation and&#xD;
      repair and the other not having hiatal interrogation at all. Patient are randomized who&#xD;
      either have a small hiatal hernia (&lt;2cm) or do not have a hiatal hernia seen on preoperative&#xD;
      testing to either hiatal interrogation with cruroplasty of the hiatus or no interrogation. By&#xD;
      the end of the study, the study team will be able to provide a recommendation as to whether&#xD;
      patients with no or a small hernia undergoing SG should routinely undergo simultaneous hiatal&#xD;
      interrogation and repair with the goal of reducing the incidence of PPI de-novo GERD after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>In those randomized without interrogation, the stomach is reduced to about 15% of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The procedure involves a longitudinal resection of the stomach starting from the antrum at the point 5-6 cm from the pylorus and finishing at the fundus close to the cardia.[1] The remaining gastric sleeve is calibrated with a bougie. Most surgeons prefer to use a bougie between 36-40 Fr with the procedure and the ideal approximate remaining size of the stomach after the procedure is about 150 mL.</description>
