  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center exploratory phase II trial of intravenous (IV) Pembrolizumab MK-3475&#xD;
      as second or further line with advanced Non-small cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have failed to&#xD;
      a prior treatment with anti-PDL1 drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 patients will be enrolled in this trial to examine the efficacy and outcomes of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual procedures in a phase II study (evaluation of response, toxicity,&#xD;
      etc.) special attention will be paid in this trial to the molecular assessment in biological&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive Pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment. Investigators&#xD;
      will make all treatment-based decisions using the Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC).&#xD;
      However, for determination of overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the&#xD;
      guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version&#xD;
      4.0. Treatment with Pembrolizumab will continue until documented disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of&#xD;
      treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent,&#xD;
      noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for a minimum of 30 days for&#xD;
      adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for up to 90 days after&#xD;
      the end of treatment unless the subject starts a new anticancer therapy between days 31 and&#xD;
      90). Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status, including initiating a&#xD;
      non-study cancer treatment and experiencing disease progression, until death, withdrawing&#xD;
      consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this trial will be dependent upon supplying tumor tissue from a newly&#xD;
      obtained formalin-fixed specimen from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. The specimen&#xD;
      will be evaluated at a central laboratory facility for expression status of PD-L1 in a&#xD;
      prospective manner. Only subjects whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by the central&#xD;
      laboratory facility will be eligible for inclusion in this study. Also it is highly recommend&#xD;
      to send archival tumor tissue from the patient.&#xD;

             advanced disease (according to 8th version of the International Association for the&#xD;
             Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology) not amenable to radical&#xD;
             treatment (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IV), squamous or non-squamous, recurrent after at least&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The subject must be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must be aged ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease (at least 1 lesion) based on RECIST 1.1. Patients will not be&#xD;
             eligible if this lesion was irradiated before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Documented prior benefit (Stable Disease, Partial Response, Complete Response) to&#xD;
             check point PD1/PDL1 inhibitor (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, Atezolizumab,&#xD;
             Avelumab or others) for at least 16 weeks (Stable Disease, Partial Response, Complete&#xD;
             Response) and progression while on treatment (or &lt;12 weeks after stopping) with the&#xD;
             same PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. These patients should have received subsequent treatment&#xD;
             with Chemotherapy for at least 4 courses (Cohort 1) OR Documented prior benefit&#xD;
             (Stable Disease, Partial Response, Complete Response) to check point PD1/PDL1&#xD;
             inhibitor (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, Atezolizumab, Avelumab or others) for&#xD;
             at least 16 weeks (Stable Disease, Partial Response, Complete Response) and&#xD;
             progression &gt;12 weeks after stopping treatment (Cohort 2). No subsequent treatment&#xD;

             biopsy of a tumor lesion. PDL1 must be evaluable and at least 1% positive in tumor&#xD;
             tissue. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior&#xD;
             to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot&#xD;
             be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an archived&#xD;
             specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. Note: If a new sample core or&#xD;
             excisional biopsy cannot be obtained but the patient can be included in the study and&#xD;
             start the treatment and the archival tumor tissue could be sent afterwards for the&#xD;
             central laboratory confirmation. If no previous PDL1 result is available from the&#xD;
             archival tissue, the patient cannot be included in the trial until central laboratory&#xD;
             PDL1 result is available. Other cases could be consulted with the trail chair.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If&#xD;
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception (for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred&#xD;
             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception (starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred&#xD;
             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. All patients will be required to submit a tumor sample for PD-L1 IHC expression. If&#xD;
             the sample is inadequate for analysis, another sample could be provided. If a new&#xD;
             sample cannot be obtained due to technical or clinical reasons, archival tissue can be&#xD;
             sent. Other cases could be consulted with the trial chair.&#xD;
