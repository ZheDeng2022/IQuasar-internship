  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health education is now a major public health issue. In the field of perinatal care, the&#xD;
      interests involved are the upgrading of the role of mother / father in the health education&#xD;
      of their child and the disengagement of inappropriate pediatric consultations and emergency&#xD;
      services in front of mothers who &quot; fail know how to &quot;. A recent review of the literature&#xD;
      (Cochrane Library) on the effectiveness of parenting programs in the first 2 months of life&#xD;
      of the newborn shows that parental education programs focusing on the explanation of newborn&#xD;
      rhythms to young parents increased sleeping time to 6 weeks of life or a significant&#xD;
      improvement in the prevention of domestic accidents (checking the water temperature and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of burning, sleeping in the bed and preventing unexpected sudden death of&#xD;
      the infant, position and respect of instructions during transport by car and prevention of&#xD;
      road accidents). However, the authors of this meta-analysis concluded that new studies were&#xD;
      needed to confirm the results already published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an early parental&#xD;
      education program in maternity both in terms of parental acquisitions and their&#xD;
      implementation after leaving the service. These parental acquisitions relate, on the one&#xD;
      hand, to the care to be given to the newborn child and, on the other hand, on the possible&#xD;
      pathologies that he or she could have, and the best action to be taken by the parents to&#xD;
      respond to them. The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of this program on&#xD;
      maternal anxiety in this special period of transition to the role of a parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective, monocentric, comparative, randomized, controlled, open study. The&#xD;
      comparison will be made between two experimental groups. The first experimental group&#xD;
      corresponds to the mothers who attended the education program during their maternity stay.&#xD;
      The second control group corresponds to mothers who did not attend the training. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint for measuring this effectiveness is maternal knowledge assessment using knowledge&#xD;
      questionnaires that will be completed by mothers before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the&#xD;
      educational program in the maternity unit. The secondary endpoints for assessing the primary&#xD;
      objective of measuring this effectiveness are the maternal knowledge assessment 1 month after&#xD;
      leaving the maternity, using a questionnaire (Recall-Test) and the assessment of the appeal&#xD;
      to a medical consultation for the newborn child in the first month of life and the analysis&#xD;
      of the relevance of this recourse to the care. The criterion of evaluation of the secondary&#xD;
      objective to measure the impact of the educational program on maternal anxiety will be based&#xD;
      on questionnaires tested regarding parental anxiety in the perinatal period (STAI-Etat)&#xD;
      before and after the educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this improvement in parental knowledge will have a positive&#xD;
      impact on maternal anxiety in the first month of life and will lead to an improvement in the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the use of care during the first month of life. If these results are&#xD;
      confirmed, this educational program will have a real medico-economic impact (relieving&#xD;
      emergency departments and improving the prognosis of newborns with severe pathologies and&#xD;
      taken into care earlier by decreasing in parallel the duration of hospitalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of these results will allow to promote more widely the health education in the&#xD;
      perinatal and neonatal period by generalizing this educational program in other maternities&#xD;
      which could be interested. Also, it will allow to propose this educational program in&#xD;
      prenatal (within the framework of session of preparation for the birth), after the release&#xD;
      from the service, within the framework of structure of health such as the PMI, the community&#xD;
      centers and medical structures, even the distribution of these educational program on a&#xD;
      larger scale by means of media such as dedicated web site or smartphone applications.&#xD;
