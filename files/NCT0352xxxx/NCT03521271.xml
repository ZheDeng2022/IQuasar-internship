      The aim of this study, determining the factors affecting the hand functions of children with&#xD;
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy who have lost their independent ambulatory ability and&#xD;
      determining the effects on the overall upper extremity performance and quality of life of the&#xD;
      determined factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common neuromuscular disease seen in childhood.&#xD;
      DMD is an X linked recessive disorder. DMD is characterized by complete or partial (&lt;3%)&#xD;
      deficiency of the cell membrane protein dystrophin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dystrophin deficiency results in a permanent deterioration of muscle fibers. This leads to a&#xD;
      progressive decrease in muscle strength and functional abilities. The precise mechanism of&#xD;
      how the defect of dystrophin leads to degeneration of muscle fibers remains uncertain, but&#xD;
      cytoskeletal deterioration, sarcolemmal instability and abnormal calcium homeostasis are&#xD;
      thought to play a role in this degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients have symptoms such as limb proximals and progressive muscle weakness in the&#xD;
      trunk, gait abnormalities, Gower's sign, various degrees of restriction in daily living&#xD;
      activities, and frequent falls. The majority of patients have elevated serum creatine kinase&#xD;
      or elevated liver transaminases and less frequently language or general developmental&#xD;
      retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking ability of this children begins to deteriorate between the ages of 3-6. These&#xD;
      patients are generally dependent on wheelchair aged 10-12 years. The loss of walking is the&#xD;
      milestone in terms of the progression of the disease. The use of electric wheelchairs limits&#xD;
      arm functions such as lengthening and lifting during the late phase of the illness (when the&#xD;
      ambulance has been lost and the ambulance is being continued with the wheelchair).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DMD have an average life span of 30 years with spinal surgery and ventilation&#xD;
      support. They spend most of their lives dependent on the wheelchair and need functional use&#xD;
      of the upper limbs to maintain the best possible level of independence in their daily life&#xD;
      activities throughout their lifetimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although muscle weakness in the proximal limbs is the first finding of the disease, the&#xD;
      influence of upper extremity functions gives symptoms after 8 years of age and has a great&#xD;
      influence on the level of independence of DMD patients in life since this process. For this&#xD;
      reason, rehabilitation approaches for the protection of upper extremity functions from the&#xD;
      early period of the disease are of great importance.Effective interventions are necessary to&#xD;
      achieve this goal and these variables must be considered when making clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with adult DMD have been shown to be able to perform important functional activities&#xD;
      with limited distal motor function in the late phase of disease, but tend to lose these&#xD;
      capacities as muscle strength decreases. For this reason, determining the factors (grip&#xD;
      strength, thumb opposition, upper extremity joint range of motion, upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength, etc.) that may affect hand functions, which is an important component in&#xD;
      maintaining upper extremity functioning, and how these factors are related to the general&#xD;
      functions of the upper extremity it is crucial that this disease leads to physiotherapy&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs to be implemented.&#xD;
