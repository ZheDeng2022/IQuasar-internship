  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the present study are to evaluate whether the most common, and effective,&#xD;
      treatment for acute mountain sickness (AMS), acetazolamide (AZ), has a negative, positive, or&#xD;
      no influence on exercise performance, cognitive performance, or manual dexterity in young&#xD;
      healthy subjects during simulated altitude exposure. AMS represents a serious challenge to&#xD;
      the health and performance of the Warfighter who may need to rapidly deploy to high altitude.&#xD;
      However, there have been concerns that AZ might alter or impair endurance exercise&#xD;
      performance, and possibly fine motor skills. These would represent major limitations to the&#xD;
      use of this drug in a Warfighter who has a specific timeframe in which to accomplish mission&#xD;
      tasks. In the present project, we will use exposure to simulated altitude in the USARIEM&#xD;
      hypobaric chamber to quantify the impact, if any, of AZ on endurance exercise performance&#xD;
      following rapid ascent to 3500 meters (m) in unacclimatized lowlander volunteers. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted using a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study&#xD;
      design. Ten male and female volunteers will complete one orientation day, one VO2peak day,&#xD;
      three days of familiarization testing at sea level (SL), then two rounds of experimental&#xD;
      testing. Each round of experimental testing consists of six days including four days to&#xD;
      establish baseline euhydration, followed by a 30 hour (hr) exposure to 3500 m. Volunteers&#xD;
      will have a two week break between experimental testing rounds for washout of any effects of&#xD;
      altitude acclimation. During one experimental round, volunteers will take two doses of AZ&#xD;
      each day (Phase 1: 250 mg/dose,500 mg/day, Phase 2: 125 mg/dose, 250 mg/day) starting 48 hr&#xD;
      prior to their altitude exposure and continuing for the 30 hr stay at high altitude. During&#xD;
      the other experimental condition, volunteers will be given a placebo at the same time points&#xD;
      as the doses of AZ. Prior to altitude exposure, AMS will be evaluated and volunteers will&#xD;
      then ascend to a simulated altitude of 3500 m, where they will remain for 30 hr. Volunteers&#xD;
      will rest at altitude for an hr, after which they will complete an AMS questionnaire, resting&#xD;
      ventilation measurements, provide a blood sample and complete cognitive and finger dexterity&#xD;
      testing. Subjects will then perform 15 minutes (min) of steady state (SS) treadmill exercise&#xD;
      at 40-45% of SL VO2peak and a 2 mile treadmill time trial (TT). Volunteers will stay&#xD;
      overnight in the hypobaric chamber with research staff supervision. The following morning,&#xD;
      metabolic and blood measurements will again be completed, after which volunteers will perform&#xD;
      the exercise testing for a second time. Cognitive and finger dexterity testing will be&#xD;
      performed before volunteers return to sea level (i.e., &quot;descend&quot; from the simulated&#xD;
      altitude). The results of the proposed study will, for the first time, provide quantitative&#xD;
      evidence regarding whether AZ treatment impairs endurance exercise performance in the context&#xD;
      of a Warfighter-relevant endurance exercise task.&#xD;
