  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of child fractures is around 180 per 10,000 children under 16 years old in&#xD;
      industrialized countries. More and more hospitals, such as Nice University Hospital, are&#xD;
      using vigilant procedural sedation for simple surgical procedures such as fracture reduction,&#xD;
      allowing ambulatory care. This is why the investigators propose the alternative of intranasal&#xD;
      ketamine associated with nitrous oxide inhalation in the management of children's pain.&#xD;
      Indeed, thanks to its short duration of action and short duration of effectiveness, ketamine&#xD;
      is already used in pediatric anesthesia and resuscitation for many years and is considered&#xD;
      safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal ketamine associated with&#xD;
      nitrous oxide inhalation in the reduction of isolated fractures from the extremity of the&#xD;
      upper limb in children allowing optimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will consist of research involving non-randomized, monocentric prospective&#xD;
      interventional category 1 for duration of 18 months. Patients over 4 years of age and under&#xD;
      18 years, with a closed fracture isolated from the distal extremity of the upper limb, with&#xD;
      stable hemodynamic will be included. In view of active queue of pediatric emergencies Nice&#xD;
      University Hospital, the investigators can include 60 patients, allowing to have a&#xD;
      representative sample of the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administered will be intranasal ketamine, using a tip MAD® (Mucosal Atomization&#xD;
      Device) at a dosage of 1 mg/kg in a single administration, under continuous cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      monitoring for 2 hours. The reduction of the fracture will be done under inhalation of&#xD;
      nitrous oxide. The primary endpoint will be pain control during and after fracture reduction,&#xD;
      defined by the FLACC Hetero-Assessment Pain Rating Scale. Others parameters as the evaluation&#xD;
      of the degree of sedation, evaluation of the child's feeling of pain after the reduction,&#xD;
      evaluation of the feasibility of the preparation and administration of the drug by the nurse&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of child fractures is around 180 per 10,000 children under 16 years old in&#xD;
      industrialized countries (Norway, Sweden, Great Britain and France). However, the rate of&#xD;
      fractures treated in pediatric emergencies varies according to the different sports&#xD;
      activities and the location of the hospital. In Nice, the number of fractures of the upper&#xD;
      limb in children is about 400 per year, because of the sporting diversity between sea and&#xD;
      mountains to which children have access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the child's fractures are treated in operating theaters in hospitals in France.&#xD;
      However, more and more hospitals, such as Nice University Hospital, are using vigilant&#xD;
      procedural sedation for simple surgical procedures such as fracture reduction, allowing&#xD;
      ambulatory care. At the University Hospital of Nice, analgesic management of simple fractures&#xD;
      of the child, including fractures of the upper limb, combines 2 drugs: midazolam and&#xD;
      nalbuphine intra-rectal. This therapy is used in combination with nitrous oxide inhalation&#xD;
      for the reduction of the fracture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this treatment is not optimal: midazolam has significant side effects (respiratory&#xD;
      depressant, hypotensive, excessive drowsiness, etc.) and the intrarectal way of&#xD;
      administration suggests a problem of delayed action of the administered product, causing a&#xD;
      variability of the effectiveness of the drug over time and a social problem. This is why the&#xD;
      investigators propose the alternative of intranasal ketamine associated with nitrous oxide&#xD;
      inhalation in the management of children's pain. Indeed, thanks to its short duration of&#xD;
      action and short duration of effectiveness, ketamine is already used in pediatric anesthesia&#xD;
      and resuscitation for many years and is considered safe and effective. This drug is a very&#xD;
      interesting choice in the treatment of analgesics in surgical emergencies. However, it is not&#xD;
      used in pediatric emergencies for excessive fear of side effects and service habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal ketamine associated with&#xD;
      nitrous oxide inhalation in the reduction of isolated fractures from the extremity of the&#xD;
      upper limb in children allowing optimal management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will consist of research involving non-randomized, monocentric prospective&#xD;
      interventional category 1 for a duration of 18 months. Patients over 4 years of age and under&#xD;
      18 years, with a closed fracture isolated from the distal extremity of the upper limb, with&#xD;
      stable hemodynamic will be included. In view of active queue of pediatric emergencies Nice&#xD;
      University Hospital and taking into account lost sight, the investigators can include 60&#xD;
      patients, allowing to have a representative sample of the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administered will be intranasal ketamine, using a tip MAD® (Mucosal Atomization&#xD;
      Device) at a dosage of 1 mg/kg in a single administration, under continuous cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      monitoring for 2 hours. The reduction of the fracture will be done under inhalation of&#xD;
      nitrous oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be pain control during and after fracture reduction, defined by the&#xD;
      FLACC Hetero-Assessment Pain Rating Scale &lt; 4/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary evaluation criteria will be: the evaluation of the degree of sedation during&#xD;
      the gesture by the &quot;University of Michigan Sedation Scale&quot; score, the evaluation of the&#xD;
      tolerance of the treatment in the child during and after the gesture (presence of&#xD;
      desaturation) O2 &lt;94%, hypersialorrhea, apnea, laryngospasm), evaluation of the child's&#xD;
      feeling of pain after the reduction, evaluation of the feasibility of the preparation and&#xD;
      administration of the drug by the nurse.&#xD;

    <description>The effectiveness of ketamine will be assessed by measuring the change of pain control between the baseline and after fracture reduction.&#xD;
Measurement of pain intensity will be carried out using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale (FLACC) 5-item hetero-evaluation of pain, validated in children. The FLACC scale is a measurement used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
Effective pain control will be defined by a score obtained with the FLACC &lt;4/10 scale during reduction and after reduction. Our criterion will therefore be binary: control or not control of pain.</description>
