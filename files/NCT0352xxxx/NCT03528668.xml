  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the acceptability, use, and general effect that exposure to virtual&#xD;
      reality has on hospitalized patients reporting at least one discomfort including recent or&#xD;
      current moderate-severe pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate-severe pain will be approached with approval of nursing staff and&#xD;
      front line nurse manager who determine their appropriateness for a trial of virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) exposure for up to 30 minutes. The trial and use of VR will be explained after meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and they will be asked about their level of interest in trying the VR&#xD;
      headset. If interested, the subject will indicate their verbal consent to proceed with the VR&#xD;
      trial. They will be asked about any baseline discomforts of pain, anxiety/stress or other&#xD;
      discomfort; which will be rated on a 0-10 numeric (visual analog) scale. A baseline heart&#xD;
      rate will be recorded in beats per minute. The headset will be applied and adjusted for&#xD;
      comfort, then the app will be started along with a timer to track the duration of their use&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 30 minutes. When the Headset is removed, the duration of use will be&#xD;
      noted. The change in post-exposure heart rate (in beats per minute) and discomforts of pain,&#xD;
      anxiety/stress or other discomforts (subtracting baseline from 5 minute post-exposure data)&#xD;
      will be recorded. Subjects will be asked about the ease of use, whether or not they would use&#xD;
      VR again, and for any other comments they would like to express. The headset will be&#xD;
      disinfected between patient use.&#xD;

        Inpatients on adult general care medical/surgical units, regardless of genders will be&#xD;
        identified via an existing pain assessment dashboard that allows the investigator to&#xD;
        identify patients with 3 or episodes of moderate-severe pain in the prior 24-hour period.&#xD;
        The investigator will scan the report for potential subjects in accordance with&#xD;
        participating units, inclusion and exclusion criteria. The front-line nurse manager and&#xD;
        registered Nurse caring for to patient will be contacted for appropriateness to consider&#xD;
        including and the timing when the patient can be approached without interrupting planned&#xD;
        tests, treatments or workflow.&#xD;
