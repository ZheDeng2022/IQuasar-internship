  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacity of 1 dose of trazodone in TMD&#xD;
      patient (with chronic orofacial pain and poor sleep quality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will have 3 polysomnography (PSG) over 3 weeks. The first one being the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the patient will receive trazodone on their 2nd PSG and placebo on their 3rd PSG, and&#xD;
      the other half will receive placebo bedofe their 2nd PSG and trazodone for the 3rd PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain quality and sleep quality will be assessed before and after PSG. polysomnograms from&#xD;
      baseline, placebo night and trazodone night will also be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is an umbrella term to describe different disorders that&#xD;
      affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and/or muscles of mastication 1. TMD is one of the&#xD;
      most common chronic orofacial pain conditions and the second most commonly occurring&#xD;
      musculoskeletal condition, affecting 5-12% of the U.S and Canada. As other chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions, TMD significantly impacts patients' quality of life (sleep quality, mood, eating,&#xD;
      energy, etc). It is frequently associated with psychological conditions such as anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, or somatization, which are often related with central sensitization and&#xD;
      disability. The importance of the psychological axis for diagnose and treat TMD along with&#xD;
      other orofacial pain disorders is reflected in the ongoing process of including psychosocial&#xD;
      variables in the new orofacial pain classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIH funded Orofacial Pain Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study is&#xD;
      probably one of the most important and well-funded investigations assessing risk factors for&#xD;
      new onset and chronicity of TMD. This comprehensive study found that other comorbidities,&#xD;
      self-report of jaw parafunction, and somatization were important predictors for clinical TMD.&#xD;
      It was also found that deteriorated subjective sleep quality, assessed using the Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep quality Index (PSQI), it is present in TMD patients, can also predict incidence of TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep quality can be assessed subjectively or objectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjectively, it has been defined as tiredness on waking and throughout the day, feeling&#xD;
           rested and restored on waking, and the number of awakenings they experienced in the&#xD;
           night. It is usually assessed by self-report through questionnaires, such as the PSQI or&#xD;
           visual analogue or category scales. Numerous studies, see above, reported poor&#xD;
           subjective sleep quality in TMD subjects; a finding that has also been observed in&#xD;
           different chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectively, sleep quality is assessed through polysomnographic evaluation (PSG), and it&#xD;
           is defined as sufficient duration (&gt; 7hrs), high efficiency (&gt; 85%), and low&#xD;
           fragmentation (&lt; 25), as well as proper staging of sleep. Smith et al showed that sleep&#xD;
           disturbances and sleep disorders are prevalent among TMD patients using PSG; and&#xD;
           Dubrovsky et al. compared sleep architecture of 126 TMD cases with 46 matched controls,&#xD;
           finding that in TMD patients there was an increase of N1 stage of sleep, an increase in&#xD;
           arousals associated with respiratory events, and also in respiratory effort related&#xD;
           arousals (RERAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the results of these studies suggest that patients with TMD present decreased&#xD;
      subjective and objective sleep quality when compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of TMD frequently involves a multidisciplinary approach consisting on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-care measures with or without cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health psychology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of oral devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short-term pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMD is often accompanied by different medical comorbidities, including other pain disorders,&#xD;
      psychological conditions, and sleep impairment, which complicate the clinical picture and&#xD;
      make more difficult to manage it with usual strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, addressing the comorbid condition/status such as anxiety, depression, or poor sleep.&#xD;
      becomes important for the success of the TMD treatment itself. In these cases, a therapy that&#xD;
      can target symptomatology from different conditions seems like a beneficial approach for the&#xD;
      complex TMD patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy are two studied options for these&#xD;
      cases. While CBT success is based on a long-term therapy, pharmacology can be beneficial for&#xD;
      a short-term fast approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In TMD subjects, clonazepam, cyclobenzaprine, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressant&#xD;
      have been studied with mixed-results in the improvement of sleep quality and pain. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that the antidepressant trazodone, a medication that is frequently prescribed&#xD;
      off-label to manage insomnia, can help to attenuate the impact of sleep arousal in rising its&#xD;
      thresholds in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). As a) TMD patients have been&#xD;
      reported to present increased RERAs when compared to controls, b) OSA is a risk factor for&#xD;
      TMD onset, c) OSA is present in about 1 out 3 subjects with TMD, and d) certain&#xD;
      antidepressants have shown pain reduction properties , e) TMD is frequently associated&#xD;
      psychological conditions that often interfere with sleep and chronify pain, Trazodone seems&#xD;
      to be a putative candidate to improve sleep quality and pain in patients with TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal subjects, Trazodone increases total sleep time and non-REM sleep duration without&#xD;
      major side effects. Despite being an antidepressant, this medication is commonly prescribed&#xD;
      to treat chronic and acute insomnia, anxiety disorders, and it has also been used to treat&#xD;
      pain chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its use to improve sleep in OSA or chronic pain patients is off label and empirical so far,&#xD;
      with limited studies done in controlled conditions. Interestingly and also empirically, the&#xD;
      doses used to reduce to impact of sleep arousal and sleep instability and also to improve&#xD;
      sleep quality seem to be in the 25-100 mg range, taken at bed time for one to 4 nights per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common side effects of trazodone, which perhaps can explain the&#xD;
      advantage-effect of trazodone on sleep quality, is sedation. Other reported side effects are&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), cardiovascular (orthostatic hypotension&#xD;
      in elderly or people with heart problems and tachycardia), and less commonly dry mouth,&#xD;
      dizziness, blurred vision, headache, or change in weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Trazodone will contribute to reduce the sleep instability associated to&#xD;
      poor sleep in TMD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: Trazodone will contribute to improve subjective sleep quality and to&#xD;
      decrease pain ratings in TMD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 16 patients with chronic TMD (defined below), aged 18 to 45 years, and reporting&#xD;
      poor sleep quality will be recruited at the Université de Montréal dental clinic, at the CHUM&#xD;
      stomatology department, and based on referrals from physicians and dentists in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since TMD is three time more prevalent in the female population, and in order to reduce&#xD;
      variability in a relatively small sample size, only females will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size is based on a previous study whit similar outcomes and design in&#xD;
      OSA patients. After the recruitment of 10 participants, an exploratory power analysis with a&#xD;
      conventional alpha of 0.05 and a power level 0.80 will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A crossover, double blind design with a 7-day washout period will be used. Patients&#xD;
      will be recorded in blocks of 1 night at a time for a total of 3 nights (night 1 for&#xD;
      baseline-habituation to sleep lab), night 2 or 3 for medication or placebo administered in a&#xD;
      random double-blind fashion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Experimental nights 2 or 3: drug trazodone per os 100 mg/placebo (cross over, double blind&#xD;
      design) after a 1 week for washout from treatment sequence #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete psychosocial and demographic questionnaires before&#xD;
      baseline-habituation night, including sleep quality, day time stress, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      quality of life, alcohol or coffee use, awareness of clenching or grinding, presence of&#xD;
      comorbidities, using research questionnaires or numerical rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep recording will start at 22h30 and patients will be awakened at 7h30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration: Trazodone (Desyrel) will be given in a crossover order with placebo. The&#xD;
      order of administration of the active medication (trazodone) and placebo will be reversed for&#xD;
      half of the subjects. Trazodone and placebo will be prepared by a pharmacist in identical&#xD;
      size and color to maintain the blind conditions. Randomization will be done by the research&#xD;
      pharmacy, and the randomization key will also be held the research pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose of 100mg given at bedtime was elected since it was the dose used in the prior studies&#xD;
      that showed increased thresholds arousals with no reported side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trazodone is absorbed within 30-60 min, with a maximum plasma level reached in 2-4 hours and&#xD;
      a mean half-life of 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep recording variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be studied for 3 consecutive nights:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the first will be to screen for associated conditions (such as sleep apnea [&gt;5/hr of&#xD;
           sleep], periodic limb movement [&gt;10/hr], REM sleep behavior disorder, epileptic&#xD;
           activity) and for adaptation to the sleep laboratory conditions. All recording will take&#xD;
           place in a light and sound-attenuated room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nights 2 and 3 will be the experimental nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these nights, the following parameters will be recorded using surface electrodes:&#xD;
      central and occipital EEG leads (C3A2; 02A1), right and left EOG, chin EMG, EMG from right&#xD;
      and left masseteric (for sleep bruxism), and anterior tibialis muscles (for periodic limb&#xD;
      movement), and heart rate (ECG) derivation (for tachycardia). Airflow, respiratory movements&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation - CO2 for hypercapnia will be monitored during the first night to rule&#xD;
      out sleep apnea syndrome, and during following night 2 and 3. Psychomotor vigilance task&#xD;
      (PVT) will be performed at baseline and two experimental nights the next morning upon&#xD;
      awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep recordings will start at 22:30 (10:30pm) and will stop when the subject&#xD;
      spontaneously awakes or at 07:30am. Self-reports of pain, sleep quality, and side effects&#xD;
      will be collected on the morning after administration of medication/placebo and 7-10 days&#xD;
      after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep scoring, EEG and ECG analysis: sleep scoring will be performed off-line on a computer&#xD;
      screen under blind conditions for all studies, sleep stages will be scored visually according&#xD;
      to a standard method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For more stable measures during sleep and to avoid confounding influences, subjects will be&#xD;
      free of: 1) over to counter medications for 48 hrs before the study; 2) alcohol, coffee, tea,&#xD;
      cola, any cigarette, etc. 12 hrs before the study. Subjects will also eat a light dinner 3&#xD;
      hrs before sleep and will relax in the sleep laboratory for at least 90 min before going to&#xD;
      bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and design for analysis: Results will be analyzed under blind conditions. Sleep&#xD;
      parameters (microarousal, K-alpha complexes, etc.) for each night (2 and 3) and&#xD;
      questionnaires (e.g., stress and sleep quality) will be analyzed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. parametric tests such as: a) t-test for between-group comparisons, ANOVA and repeated&#xD;
           measures ANOVA followed by Tukey and contrasts for post-hoc comparisons when appropriate&#xD;
           (SAS and Systat statistical softwares); b) iterative general least squares (IGLS) for&#xD;
           across-night time effects, or canonical correlations for first 4 non-REM episodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nonparametric tests such as: chi-square, Mann-Whitney (for category data and/or when&#xD;
           data distribution is not normal);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlations tests, such as Pearson or Spearman, where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will obtain the informed consent from the patient by means of a dated and&#xD;
      signed declaration of informed consent before any study related procedure is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored using an alpha-numerical code corresponding the the patient's&#xD;
      identification. The code will be kept using an excel file, protected by a password only known&#xD;
      by the study coordinator and the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical data relevant to this study will be stored and analysed while maintaining&#xD;
      confidentiality. All data transferred to the CRF and any process derived from the CRF will be&#xD;
      handled anonymously. That will ensure that the identity of the individual will be protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CRF will be kept in a locked file cabinet, located in room 221-H. All data will be kept&#xD;
      for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results publication (abstract, scientific publication, congress, symposium, etc) will be&#xD;
      done as a group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trazodone may be potentially beneficial for long-term treatment in cases of chronic OFP&#xD;
      complaining of poor sleep quality and, eventually, chronic morning headache patients without&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is administered in the hospital under medical supervision and sleep recording are&#xD;
      conduct under technical supervision. A physician is available on call for adverse effect&#xD;
      (dizziness, nausea, hypotension, etc.) management. Investigators will be available on call&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
