      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab, tremelimumab and&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma that has come back (recurrent) or that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of&#xD;
      radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer&#xD;
      side effects. Giving durvalumab, tremelimumab, and hypofractionated radiation therapy may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab and palliative&#xD;
      radiation therapy in patients with recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head&#xD;
      and neck previously exposed to an anti PD-1 or PDL-1 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure objective response rates based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1. criteria in patients receiving the durvalumab, tremelimumab and palliative&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine overall and progression free survival in patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      day 1, week 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 cycles or every 6 weeks for up to&#xD;
      3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1, week 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 9 cycles or every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy using either&#xD;
      hypofractionated, image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) over 3 fractions every other day (QOD) during week 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and&#xD;
      10 months, and then every 12 months.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
