    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 6-months program of Adapted Physical&#xD;
      Activity (APA) on lifestyle, physical activity levels, insulin resistance and adipokines,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, microcirculatory haemodynamics and serum levels of specific circulating&#xD;
      miRNA in post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients in oncologic follow-up&#xD;
      with or without hormone therapy that had completed adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy and/or&#xD;
      chemotherapy) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study will determine the impact of APA on functional capabilities, on&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity, quality of life and psychic health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled double-group assignment study with intermedial switch-over&#xD;
      including post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients in oncological&#xD;
      follow-up with or without hormone therapy, that had completed adjuvant post-surgical&#xD;
      treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) from at least 3 months and from not more than 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in hormonal therapy and patient not in hormonal therapy will be assigned in two&#xD;
      different groups, each one of 50 patients. In each groups, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      divided in a control group (25 pt) and in a 6 months-physical training group (25 pt). After&#xD;
      6-months patient in control group will be switched in the physical training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is 2 year. Clinical evaluation of the patients will be made: at the&#xD;
      enrollment, after 6, 12, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity will be adapted according to arm and shoulder morbidity, after fracture&#xD;
      risk assessment. Exercise will be concentrated solely on leg muscles (pedalling on a cycle or&#xD;
      bed ergometer) in individuals with limitations in the range of motion of the arms (eg, due to&#xD;
      breast, axillary, or thoracic surgery). In patients experiencing ataxia, dizziness, or&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, walking outdoors and mostly cycle-ergometry training will be preferred&#xD;
      to other activities that also involve large muscle groups but require additional balance and&#xD;
      coordination (eg, treadmill walking, outdoor cycling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises will be performed at the Unipolar Spinal Unit of &quot;S. Maria della Misericordia&quot;&#xD;
      Hospital, Perugia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to confirm the positive effect of APA on metabolic stress, body mass&#xD;
      composition, functional capacity, serum levels of specific circulating miRNA and quality of&#xD;
      life in breast cancer patients in oncological follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, only few data are available about the relationship between physical activity and&#xD;
      microcirculatory hemodynamics that, together with oxidative stress, could be involved in&#xD;
      genesis and progression of breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) for insulin resistance (IR) is a method for assessing β-cell function and insuline resistance from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations. HOMA-IR can be calculated with a simple mathematical approximation as HOMA-IR = (FPI × FPG)/22.5, where FPI is fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU/l) and FPG is fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l), or as HOMA-IR = (FPI × FPG)/405 if fasting plasma glucose is expressed in mg/dl.&#xD;
Values bethween 3 and 5 are considered expression of moderate insuline resistance; values upper 5 are considered expression of severe insuline resistance.&#xD;
