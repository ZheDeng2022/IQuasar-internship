  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg) is associated&#xD;
      with increased organs dysfunction and mortality. Even short durations of reduced arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure episodes significantly increased the risk of myocardial injury, neurological&#xD;
      deficits, renal failure, and mortality. Hypotension rate during surgery is quite common and&#xD;
      recent studies showed an incidence up to 60% of patients endured hypotension during&#xD;
      anesthesia for an average of 10% of surgical time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays hypotension seems to be preventable even if current management of the hypotensive&#xD;
      episodes is predominantly reactive and rather occurs with some delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the prevention of hypotension by means Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences new technology (HPI software) can improve patients outcome after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present pilot randomized clinical trial is aimed at investigating various biomarkers&#xD;
      involved in organ dysfunction and how they correlate with different intraoperative&#xD;
      hypotension management strategies (Invasive blood pressure monitored by a normal arterial&#xD;
      line vs Invasive blood pressure monitored by Edwards FloTracIQ system with HPI software).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate if an early treatment of&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotension driven by an Edwards Lifesciences new technology (Hypotension&#xD;
      Probability Index - HPI software) and integrated hemodynamic variables is able to determine a&#xD;
      modification of the blood levels of several specific biomarkers of tissue and organ damage&#xD;
      compared to a traditional management of hypotension. It will also be evaluated if the&#xD;
      management strategy of patient hemodynamics based on the Hypotension Probability Index (HPI)&#xD;
      is associated with a lower incidence of hypotensive events and / or a shorter overall&#xD;
      duration of intraoperative hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study will be enrolled forty adult patients requiring an arterial line (at discretion&#xD;
      of treating physician) undergoing non-cardiac non-day surgery (with an expected duration of&#xD;
      more than 2 hours and an aimed medium arterial pressure - MAP of 65 mmHg) at the Universitary&#xD;
      Hospital of Catania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly (1:1) assigned to one of the subsequent two groups: a group&#xD;
      monitored with FloTracIQ with HPI software (Treatment Group) and a group with standard&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure monitoring (Control Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control Group, all hypotensive episodes during surgery will be treated according to&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the Treatment Group will receive monitoring with integration of HPI&#xD;
      index and hemodynamic parameters visible on the EV1000 platform; these informations will be&#xD;
      used to guide the investigator in the choice of the more appropriate treatment to be carried&#xD;
      out. The value of HPI is updated every 20 seconds and expresses in percentage the probability&#xD;
      of occurrence of a hypotensive event. The cut-off value of HPI is equal to 85%. Values above&#xD;
      the cut-off are related to a higher probability of hypotension. A specific visual and sound&#xD;
      &quot;ALERT&quot; will indicate to the investigator if the threshold value is reached / exceeded. Any&#xD;
      treatment strategy will be based on integrated analysis of clinical and instrumental data&#xD;
      showed on the screen of the EV1000 platform [MAP, cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance (SVR), stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), intra-ventricular&#xD;
      pressure rate of rise (dP/dt), dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups different blood samplings will be performed in order to assess biomarkers of&#xD;
      specific organ dysfunction: T0 (baseline, before starting operating procedures); T1 (2 hours&#xD;
      after starting anesthesia); T2 (at the end of surgical procedures). The following biomarkers&#xD;
      will be assessed: neuron specific enolase and S100B (for brain monitoring); high sensitive&#xD;
      cardiac troponin T (for heart monitoring); Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL,&#xD;
      for kidney monitoring); circulating endothelial cells counting and cytofluorimetric analysis&#xD;
      (for endothelial monitoring). There will also be determined the systemic effect of&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotension as measured by inflammatory cytokines [Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#xD;
      beta and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alfa], oxidative stress (reduced glutathione, lipid&#xD;
      hydroperoxides) and markers of hypoxia (HIF1alpha, lactate, acetylCoA, CoA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various clinical informations will be collected at the same time: glomerular filtration rate,&#xD;
      plasma electrolytes, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT), blood gasses analysis, anion gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone interview will be performed one month after surgery, in order to investigate&#xD;
      general health condition and any re-admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the pilot nature of the study, no formal justification of sample size has been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a test of normal distribution, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used. Continuous data&#xD;
      with normal distribution will be tested with paired or unpaired t tests, non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data using Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for unpaired and paired&#xD;
      results, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in biomarkers over time will be tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on repeated&#xD;
      measurements. Categorical data will be tested using Chi-square test and Chi-square test for&#xD;
      trend. Data will be presented as mean Â± standard deviation when normally distributed and as&#xD;
      median [interquartile ranges] in case of abnormal distribution. A p &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant for all tests.&#xD;
