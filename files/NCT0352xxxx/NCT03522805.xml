  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent condition worldwide and is&#xD;
      a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, few therapies have been shown&#xD;
      to improve survival. The importance of systemic effects and co-morbidities in COPD has&#xD;
      garnered attention based on the observation that many patients with COPD die from causes&#xD;
      other than respiratory failure, including a large proportion from cardiovascular causes.&#xD;
      Recently, two high profile randomized trials have shown substantial improvements in morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality with use of nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in COPD patients with&#xD;
      hypercapnia. Although the mechanisms by which NIV improves outcomes remain unclear, the&#xD;
      important benefits of NIV might be cardiovascular via a number of mechanisms. In contrast to&#xD;
      prior trials of NIV in COPD that did not show substantial benefit, a distinguishing feature&#xD;
      of these encouraging recent NIV clinical trials was a prominent reduction of hypercapnia,&#xD;
      which might be a maker or mediator of effective therapy. Alternatively, improvements might be&#xD;
      best achieved by targeting a different physiological measure. Additional mechanistic data are&#xD;
      therefore needed to inform future trials and achieve maximal benefit of NIV. Recent work in&#xD;
      cardiovascular biomarkers has identified high-sensitivity troponin to have substantial&#xD;
      ability to determine cardiovascular stress in a variety of conditions - even with only small&#xD;
      changes. In COPD, a number of observational studies have shown that high-sensitivity troponin&#xD;
      increases with worsening disease severity, and that levels increase overnight during sleep.&#xD;
      This biomarker therefore presents a promising means to study causal pathways regarding the&#xD;
      effect of NIV in patients with COPD. With this background, the investigator's overall goals&#xD;
      are: 1) To determine whether the beneficial effect of non-invasive ventilation might be due&#xD;
      to a reduction in cardiovascular stress, using established cardiovascular biomarkers, and 2)&#xD;
      To define whether a reduction in PaCO2 (or alternative mechanism) is associated with such an&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
