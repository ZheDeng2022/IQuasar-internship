    <textblock>
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) administration of tralokinumab compared with&#xD;
      placebo in treating adolescent subjects (age 12 to &lt;18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of SC administration of&#xD;
      tralokinumab compared with placebo when used to treat adolescent subjects (age 12 to &lt;18&#xD;
      years) with moderate-to-severe AD.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) will contain no evidence of their identity. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects and who will not perform any of the assessments.</masking_description>

    <description>The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their quality of life over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all'; 1 = 'only a little'; 2 = 'quite a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). Item 7 (on school time) has one additional response category 'prevented school', which is also scored '3'. The total score of the CDLQI is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>

Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W Tralokinumab: Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically binds to human IL-13 and blocks interaction with the IL-13 receptors. It is presented as a liquid formulation for SC administration.&#xD;
At Day 0, each subject received 4 subcutaneous injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab to receive a total loading dose of 600 mg tralokinumab. At subsequent visits (Q2W) each subject received 2 subcutaneous injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab to receive a total dose of 300 mg tralokinumab.</description>

          <title>Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index</title>
          <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their quality of life (QoL) over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all'; 1 = 'only a little'; 2 = 'quite a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor health-related quality of life.</description>

        <description>The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their quality of life over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all'; 1 = 'only a little'; 2 = 'quite a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). Item 7 (on school time) has one additional response category 'prevented school', which is also scored '3'. The total score of the CDLQI is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) From Baseline to Week 16</title>
        <description>The POEM is a validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in atopic eczema patients in both clinical practice and clinical trials. The tool consists of 7 items each addressing a specific symptom (itching, sleep, bleeding, weeping, cracking, flaking, and dryness). Subjects will score how often they have experienced each symptom over the previous week on a 5-point categorical response scale (0 = 'no days'; 1 = '1 to 2 days'; 2 = '3 to 4 days'; 3 = '5 to 6' days; 4 = 'every day'). The total score is the sum of the 7 items (range 0 to 28) and reflects disease-related morbidity; a high score is indicative of a worse disease severity.</description>
