    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating participants&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Ibrutinib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating participants with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib therapy on circulating levels of myeloid derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells MDSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety of the study combination in study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on circulating levels of MDSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive function of circulating MDSC by measuring their ability to inhibit T cell&#xD;
      proliferation and natural killer cell mediated antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study the effect of ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on levels of circulating&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune cells such as natural killer cell and T lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study circulating MDSC levels at the time of disease progression. V. Evaluate in a&#xD;
      preliminary fashion the effect of the regimen on progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily for 15 days. After 7 days receiving&#xD;
      ibrutinib, participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15. Courses with nivolumab repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and/or frequency and percentages for medically relevant categories. Changes of the continuous variables will be estimated using mixed model for repeated measures with proper data transformation as needed, and two-way tables and Chi-Square test will be used to summarize the changes of the categorical data.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>

    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Interval from study enrollment to first documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), assessed at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>One year progression free survival will be defined as proportion of patients who are free of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) after 1 year of follow up. Progression free survival will be summarized using Kaplan and Meier methods, where patients who are event-free at the time of their last evaluation will be censored at that time point.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between the clinical responses and biomarkers/immune cell populations of interest will be identified using conventional techniques. These analyses will be primarily exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Will study the biomarker association with clinical outcomes using descriptive statistics, graphical methods and statistical modeling where appropriate. T-tests (continuous variables), chi-square or Fisher?s Exact tests (categorical variables), logistic regression models or Cox proportional hazard models will be used to explore associations between biomarkers/immune cell populations and clinical responses, whichever is appropriate. Pre and post treatment biomarkers will be compared using either paired t-tests or non-parametric tests if necessary.</description>
