      This protocol has a 2-part design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 study is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      clinical activity of paxalisib in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with&#xD;
      unmethylated MGMT promoter status as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection and&#xD;
      initial chemoradiation with temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;

      Stage 1 Dose-Escalation and Maximum Tolerated Dose The dose-escalation portion of the study&#xD;
      (Stage 1) will use a standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design to determine the MTD for QD dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 - 12 patients with newly diagnosed GBM will be enrolled in Stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD for QD dosing will be determined. The initial dose level for QD dosing will be 60 mg&#xD;
      (Dose Level 0). This dose is based on the phase 1 findings outlined in the rationale in the&#xD;
      protocol, adding 1 dose level to test for a potential MTD increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation will occur in Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination in Step 1 will be 60 mg. Dose&#xD;
           levels will increase in 15 mg steps;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose-escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design to&#xD;
           assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of paxalisib administered orally in 28-day&#xD;
           cycles;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions regarding dose-escalation and selection will be made by a Cohort Review Committee&#xD;
      (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs, including DLTs, will be reported, with severity assessed according to National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determination of the MTD, patients continue to receive their protocol-assigned dose&#xD;
      levels of paxalisib until progression of their disease or an unacceptable toxicity, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 Expansion stage (2) of the study will be a two-arm, randomized, open-label expansion&#xD;
      study to further characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of paxalisib as well as to&#xD;
      provide a preliminary assessment of single-agent activity of paxalisib in patients with GBM.&#xD;
      Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in the expansion cohort in 2 treatment arms (10&#xD;
      per am) to examine the PK of paxalisib in fed and fasted-conditions, according to the defined&#xD;
      study eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 of the study will be initiated with recruitment of new patients as soon as the MTD&#xD;
      has been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in Stage 2 may continue the study at the dose allocated until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>This is an open-label study.&#xD;
Patients in Stage 1 will be enrolled and sequentially assigned to a dose cohort.&#xD;
The initial cohort will receive an oral dose of 60 mg paxalisib QD (4 x 15 mg capsules). Patients of future dose cohorts will receive paxalisib at increasing levels with 15 mg steps until a dose-limiting toxicity occurs (DLT) occurs. The dose level where &lt;1/3 of the patients exhibit a DLT will be determined the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
In stage 1, dose escalation will occur for QD dosing.&#xD;
In stage 2, the expansion phase, patients will receive doses of oral paxalisib at the MTD in stage 1, until disease progression or an unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to fed or fasted schedules.</description>
