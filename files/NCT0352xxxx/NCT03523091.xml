  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with overactive bladder (OAB) will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      receive 100 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder at either 3 sites or 10&#xD;
      sites. Patient satisfaction and the effectiveness of the medication will be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition which often has a negative impact on health&#xD;
      related quality of life. Primary and secondary treatments include behavior modification,&#xD;
      pelvic floor physical therapy, and OAB medications. OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) is a&#xD;
      well-established third line therapy for refractory OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTX has transitioned over the years from a procedure conducted in the operating room to one&#xD;
      that is commonly done in the clinic or physician office. While ten injection sites is&#xD;
      commonly practiced, there has been continuing interest in reducing the number of injection&#xD;
      sites to make the technique more tolerable and more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, refractory OAB patients will be randomized to receive 100 units of BTX over 3&#xD;
      or 10 injection sites. The investigators hypothesize that decreasing the number of injection&#xD;
      sites may improve patient tolerability and satisfaction with this office-based procedure and&#xD;
      potentially reduce the rates of adverse events including hematuria and urinary tract&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of incontinence episodes per day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline diary compared to 3 month diary after the initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a 3-day voiding diary. On the diary participants will record the number of occurrences of voids and incontinence episodes over a 24 hour period for 3 consecutive days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of bladder symptom bother</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to 3 months after the initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Per the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form (OABq-SF). This validated measure evaluates overactive bladder symptom severity and health related quality of life. For each question, participants will answer how bothered they are by their urinary symptoms from &quot;not at all&quot; (1), &quot;a little bit&quot; (2), &quot;somewhat&quot; (3), &quot;quite a bit&quot; (4), &quot;a great deal&quot; (5), and &quot;a very great deal&quot; (5). Each question will be scored. Scores range from 13-78. The higher the score the greater perceived degree of bladder symptom bother.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of urine leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to 3 months after the initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Per the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF). This validated questionnaire provides a measure to assess the impact of symptoms of incontinence on quality of life and outcome of treatment. Question items include frequency of urinary incontinence, amount of leakage, overall impact of urinary incontinence, and a self-diagnostic item. Scoring is between 0-21 with greater values indicating increased severity. Self-diagnostic item is not scored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in overactive bladder symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after the initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Per the Global Response Assessment (GRA). Participants will assess overall how their OAB symptoms/condition changed since starting the study. Participants will select, &quot;Markedly worse&quot; (1), &quot;Moderately worse&quot; (2), &quot;Mildly worse&quot; (3), &quot;Same (unchanged)&quot; (4), &quot;Slightly improved&quot; (5), &quot;Moderately improved&quot; (6), or &quot;Markedly improved&quot; (7). Scores are from 1-7 with a greater score indicating a greater improvement of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall patient satisfaction with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>After the initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Per the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Participants will record the amount of pain of performing the treatment on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Visual analog scores will be gathered at the end of the injection visit to assess for patient satisfaction, pain, and tolerability of the treatment procedure.</description>

    <measure>Overall voiding symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline compared to 3 months after the initial injection</time_frame>
