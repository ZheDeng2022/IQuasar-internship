  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PETHEMA Spanish group treats patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-negative&#xD;
      ALL, aged 18 to 55 years, based on the MRD clearance as assessed by flow cytometry at a&#xD;
      centralised evaluation centre. Patients with MRD &lt; 0.1% (&lt; 1×10-3) after induction and &lt;&#xD;
      0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4) after early consolidation are assigned to receive chemotherapy (late&#xD;
      consolidation and maintenance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early consolidation chemotherapy consists of three cycles including high doses of MTX, ARA-C&#xD;
      and ASP, together with vincristine and dexamethasone. The same therapy is repeated in the&#xD;
      late consolidation period if MRD after early consolidation is &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4). Maintenance&#xD;
      therapy is then administered for up to 2 years from the CR date. These patients do not&#xD;
      receive allo-HSCT if they maintain adequate MRD clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite having adequate MRD clearance, a proportion of patients (around 25%) experience&#xD;
      relapse, which makes other approaches necessary to try to decrease the relapse rate.&#xD;
      Intensifying currently existing chemotherapy regimens is not likely to increase the cure rate&#xD;
      and would likely significantly increase toxicity. The use of targeted immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents such as blinatumomab, which has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with R/R&#xD;
      ALL and in patients with ALL and MRD+, seems to be a promising option [30-33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it would be interesting to assess the potential efficacy of using blinatumomab in&#xD;
      CR patients to reduce the MRD more frequently and more intensely during the early and late&#xD;
      consolidation period. Our hypothesis is that blinatumomab will further reduce the level of&#xD;
      MRD and this could lead to a decrease in the relapse rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will replace the third early consolidation cycle with a cycle of blinatumomab, and&#xD;
      the same will be done in the late consolidation period. We hope that this strategy will&#xD;
      increase the extent of the MRD response and prevent relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, and as a secondary objective, we will investigate the safety of blinatumomab&#xD;
      administration after the administration of high-dose chemotherapy including MTX, ARA-C and&#xD;
      ASP&#xD;

      In the pre-phase, patients receive treatment according to routine clinical practice at&#xD;
      Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with high-risk ALL&#xD;
      (ALL-AR-11), with: Prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/m2, PO or IV until complete characterisation of the&#xD;
      ALL, for a maximum of 7 days, Triple intrathecal therapy, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30&#xD;
      mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard induction chemotherapy that these patients receive according to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice at Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with&#xD;
      high-risk ALL (ALL-AR-11), consists of: Vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum dose 2 mg) IV&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22,Daunorubicin (DNR) 45 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15 and 22, prednisone 60 mg/m2&#xD;
      per day, IV or PO, days 1 to 14,30 mg/m2 per day, IV or PO, days 15 to 21, 15 mg/m2 per day,&#xD;
      IV or PO, days 21 to 28,E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®) 10,000 IU/m2, IV, days&#xD;
      16-20, 23-27,Intrathecal TIT chemotherapy day 1* (if not administered in the pre-phase) and&#xD;
      22, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30 mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg, G-CSF (SC or IV) from day&#xD;
      15 until neutrophils &gt; 1000/µl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the administration of induction therapy, a bone marrow analysis will be performed&#xD;
      with morphological, genetic and molecular study if necessary, with a centralised MRD&#xD;
      determination by MFC. In the case of a complete morphological response and MRD &lt; 0.1% (&lt;&#xD;
      1×10-3), the patient will be enrolled in the trial and receive consolidation and maintenance&#xD;
      treatment according to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation - CYCLE 1 Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patients will receive in&#xD;
      the first cycle (21 days) consists of: dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5, 10&#xD;
      mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6, 5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7, 2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV&#xD;
      day 8, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 per day, IV (maximum 2 mg) days 1 and 8, Methotrexare 3g/m2, IV&#xD;
      in 24 hours, E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3,Triple&#xD;
      intrathecal therapy day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation - CYCLE 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patient will receive in the second cycle (21 days)&#xD;
      consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARA-C:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - 2 g/m2 every 12 hours, over 3 hours, days 1 and 2. Halve the ARA-C for patients over&#xD;
           50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3. Halve the dose for&#xD;
           patients over 50 years of age as the toxicity of any type of ASP increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 4 (administered that day to keep the intrathecal therapy&#xD;
           separate from the high-dose ARA-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation - CYCLE 3 In the third early consolidation cycle, the investigational drug&#xD;
      blinatumomab will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinatumomab 28 μg/day as a continuous infusion, IV over 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late consolidation Two weeks after completing the blinatumomab treatment, in the case of MRD&#xD;
      &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4), patients will receive 2 blocks of intensive chemotherapy (identical to&#xD;
      those in early consolidation), separated by 3 weeks, followed by a treatment cycle with&#xD;
      blinatumomab, the investigational medicinal product, for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administering late consolidation therapy, a bone marrow study will be conducted. In the&#xD;
      case of MRD &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4), the patient will receive maintenance treatment. If this MRD&#xD;
      level is not achieved, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and undergo a&#xD;
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to routine clinical practice at Spanish&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance therapy that patients will receive in this phase of the trial will consist of&#xD;
      continuous chemotherapy administration (mercaptopurine and methotrexate) with reinductions&#xD;
      for up to one year from CR&#xD;

    <description>Blinatumomab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to bind specifically to CD19, expressed on the surface of B-cells, and to CD3, expressed on the surface of T-cells. It activates endogenous T-cells by connecting the CD3 on the T-cell receptor complex (TCR) with the CD19 on the B-cells. The anti-tumour activity of blinatumomab does not depend on whether the T-cells carry a specific TCR or peptide antigens present in cancer cells, but it is polyclonal and independent of HLA on the target cells</description>
