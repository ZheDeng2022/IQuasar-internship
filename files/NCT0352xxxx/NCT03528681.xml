  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of two different doses (5 and 10 g) of ZS orally administered once&#xD;
      daily (qd) vs placebo in maintaining normokalemia in initially hyperkalemic patients having&#xD;
      achieved normokalemia following 24 or 48 hours of initial ZS therapy (10g TID).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in approximately 35 centers in China. Before patients are&#xD;
      randomized to the double-blind phase, they will receive open-label ZS for 24 or 48 hours&#xD;
      during the initial phase. It is expected that approximately 490 patients will need to be&#xD;
      enrolled, to have approximately 280 patients entered into the open-label initial phase&#xD;
      resulting in 250 patients being randomized in the 28-day treatment study phase. Enrolment&#xD;
      will be stopped when 250 patients have been initiated with the 28-day randomized treatment&#xD;
      study phase.&#xD;
