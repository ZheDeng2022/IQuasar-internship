  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well web-based mindfulness meditation works in reducing distress in&#xD;
      both participants with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body,&#xD;
      and their caregivers. Web-based mindfulness meditation, which uses audio exercises and&#xD;
      interactive webinars taught by trained meditation instructors, may help participants with GI&#xD;
      cancer and their caregivers reduce distress and improve their quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week web-based mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation program with live webinars among patients with a metastatic gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      cancer receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the efficacy of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program with live&#xD;
      webinars among patients with a metastatic GI cancer receiving chemotherapy and their&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants practice with web-based mindfulness meditation over 10-15 minute guided audio&#xD;
      sessions for 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Participants also attend meditation webinars over 60&#xD;
      minutes once a week, for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 8 weeks.&#xD;
