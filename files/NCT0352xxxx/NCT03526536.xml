    <textblock>
      This study is for people with diabetes who have either healthy kidneys or who have end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD) and are on hemodialysis that are having surgery. This research will help&#xD;
      increase our knowledge about how having diseased kidneys and being on hemodialysis changes&#xD;
      how the body responds to insulin. In the time period directly before, during, and after&#xD;
      surgery, maintenance of blood sugar within normal physiological range is essential. When&#xD;
      patients come for surgery and have an elevated blood sugar, it is up to each individual&#xD;
      physician to decide on the right amount of insulin to treat them. Currently, there are many&#xD;
      different protocols across the country to treat elevated blood sugar; however, there is no&#xD;
      one specific protocol to treat elevated blood sugar at SUNY Downstate Medical Center at this&#xD;
      time. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the change in blood sugar following&#xD;
      insulin administration to determine whether there is a significantly different response&#xD;
      between ESRD and non-ESRD patients. The results of the study will help develop safer practice&#xD;
      guidelines to patients with ESRD with an elevated blood sugar while they are having surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our study is to compare perioperative changes in blood glucose levels&#xD;
      following insulin administration (Novolin R human insulin, Novo Nordisk Inc. Plainsboro, NJ)&#xD;
      for preoperative hyperglycemia (as defined by blood glucose over 150 mg/dL) in diabetic ESRD&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis vs. diabetic non-ESRD patients without CKD. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that diabetic ESRD patients on hemodialysis with preoperative hyperglycemia will&#xD;
      demonstrate a more rapid decrease in blood glucose following insulin administration compared&#xD;
      to diabetic non-ESRD patients without CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at SUNY Downstate Medical Center at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Brooklyn. Following enrollment of eligible patients, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
      age, gender, height, weight, BMI, indicated procedure, medical record number, past medical&#xD;
      history (including liver dysfunction and EtOH abuse), ASA, and initial blood glucose. All&#xD;
      patient data associated with renal function and dialysis will be obtained and recorded for&#xD;
      ESRD patients. Relevant kidney function data, such as GFR, will also be obtained, if&#xD;
      available. The surgical procedures will include but are not limited to the following elective&#xD;
      surgeries: major abdominal surgery, major GU/GYN surgeries, vascular surgery, renal&#xD;
      transplantation, neurosurgery, vascular and orthopedic surgery . The investigators expect&#xD;
      patients in both groups to undergo similar surgical procedures. All medications prescribed to&#xD;
      the patient will be noted, as will the type of diabetes the patient has, type 1 or type 2. If&#xD;
      the patient takes insulin or oral diabetic medications, the time and amount of their last&#xD;
      dose will be recorded. The interval between the last dialysis and insulin testing will not be&#xD;
      similar and the extent of uremia will not be equivalent among participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consented patients with hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt; 150 mg/dL) will be administered an&#xD;
      IV bolus of Novolin R human insulin based on a sliding scale according to the table below.&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist that is taking care of the patient for that specific surgery will&#xD;
      administer the insulin based on the sliding scale, will measure and record blood glucose at&#xD;
      30 minute intervals, and will be responsible to adjust treatment as per the study's sliding&#xD;
      scale. Prior to initiating the protocol, the particular anesthesiologist that is responsible&#xD;
      for the case will be explained exactly how to follow the protocol. He/she will also be given&#xD;
      a supplemental form with written instructions. He/she will also be given contact information&#xD;
      for the principle investigator if they should have any questions or issues. The investigators&#xD;
      developed a dosing protocol based on guidelines in previous studies, determined as safe and&#xD;
      effective for perioperative hyperglycemic patients. The treatment protocol will be&#xD;
      administered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with preoperative blood glucose &gt; 150 and &lt; 200 mg/dL will be given a bolus of&#xD;
           2 insulin units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with preoperative blood glucose &gt; 200 and &lt; 250 mg/dL will be given a bolus of&#xD;
           3 insulin units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with preoperative blood glucose &gt; 250 and &lt; 350 mg/dL will be given a bolus of&#xD;
           4 insulin units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point-of-care blood glucose testing will be measured at 30-minute intervals using a&#xD;
      glucometer (Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA. USA), and the investigators will adjust treatment&#xD;
      to maintain a safe glucose window. Plasma insulin levels will not be tested. ESRD patients&#xD;
      will be administered normal saline and non-ESRD patients will be administered lactate ringers&#xD;
      during study protocol. Glucose readings collected at each interval will be recorded, as will&#xD;
      changes in insulin administration. Treatment will be adjusted as per the sliding scale given&#xD;
      above. For the purpose of the study and statistical analysis, blood glucose sampling will be&#xD;
      performed 3 times, one as baseline, second after Â½ hour after the first dose of IV insulin,&#xD;
      and the second after 30 additional minutes. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation)&#xD;
      for each group at each time point will be used to determine the difference between the ESRD&#xD;
      and non-ESRD groups in the pilot study. Any additional blood glucose estimations will be&#xD;
      strictly for clinical reasons to treat hyperglycemia and ascertain that no hypoglycemia has&#xD;
      occurred. For patient safety, the investigators will not give insulin for blood glucose&#xD;
      levels less than 150 mg/dL, but will continue to monitor blood glucose at 30-minute intervals&#xD;
      for 2 hours after the last dose of insulin and will not administer insulin if the blood&#xD;
      glucose levels fall below 150 mg/dL. Regular insulin when given intravenously has a rapid&#xD;
      onset and a short duration of action; intravenously the half- life of regular insulin is 0.5&#xD;
      to 1 hour and the peak effect is 0.8 to 2 hours. The investigators will therefore monitor&#xD;
      blood glucose levels until the expected peak effect of 2 hours where they expect the lowest&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia is highly unlikely in renal patients at discharge. It is&#xD;
      customary for patients to stay in the PACU for 2 hours post-surgery. During the 2-hour window&#xD;
      from the patient's last dose of insulin, the patients will be required to remain NPO except&#xD;
      water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood glucose drops below 100 mg/dL, a 25 cc bolus of 50% dextrose in water (Hospira Inc.,&#xD;
      Lake Forest, IL, USA) will be administered and blood glucose will be checked after 15&#xD;
      minutes. The investigators will give another dextrose bolus if necessary to restore blood&#xD;
      glucose above 100 mg/dL. Once blood glucose has reached a level above 100 mg/dL, blood&#xD;
      glucose will continue to be checked every 30 minutes for 2 hours after the last dose of&#xD;
      insulin given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, this treatment protocol is based on standard practice and designed for patient&#xD;
      safety. If the patient is discharged before 2 hours, the investigators will terminate the&#xD;
      study at that point. The patients will not be at increased risk of harm as insulin peak&#xD;
      effect occurs within 30 minutes. With study termination, the patient will return to their&#xD;
      normal anti-hyperglycemic regimen. No additional patient participation will be required after&#xD;
      this point. Blood samples collected for glucose readings will be discarded immediately after&#xD;
      use. Data will be entered into a password protected Microsoft Excel data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be pilot study to compare the response to insulin in diabetic patients with ESRD&#xD;
      vs. diabetic patients without renal disease. The investigators will generate insulin response&#xD;
      curves for each patient, with blood glucose level as a function of time. Then they will&#xD;
      compute average drop in glucose in the two groups. Using these data the investigators will be&#xD;
      able to observe the obtained effect size, determine whether it is clinically significant, and&#xD;
      if so, determine sample size that would be required to obtain statistical significance for a&#xD;
      larger study analysis. Based on the outcome of the pilot study, they will determine the&#xD;
      sample size and the analysis plan for the main study.&#xD;
