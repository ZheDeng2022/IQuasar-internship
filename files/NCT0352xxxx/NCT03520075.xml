  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1-2 study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of ASTX029&#xD;
      administered orally to subjects with advanced solid malignancies who are not candidates for&#xD;
      approved or available therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases&#xD;
      (ERKs) 1/2. ASTX029 has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion&#xD;
      of this study will assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally. The&#xD;
      Phase 2 portion will assess preliminary clinical activity in tumors characterized by gene&#xD;
      aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway that may confer&#xD;
      sensitivity to ASTX029.&#xD;
