    <measure>Satiety by Buffet Meal, Total Calories Ingested at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satiety (a measure of appetite) was appraised by &quot;free feeding&quot; buffet meal consisting of standard foods of known nutrient composition. The total amount of food consumed was analyzed by the study dietitian.</description>

    <measure>Satiation Volume to Fullness at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After drinking Ensure, participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0 to 5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation).</description>

    <measure>Satiation Maximum Tolerated Volume at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After drinking Ensure, participants recorded their sensations every 5 minutes using a numerical scale from 0 to 5, with level 0 being no symptoms, level 3 corresponding to fullness sensation after a typical meal and level 5 corresponding to the maximal tolerated volume (maximum or unbearable fullness/satiation).</description>

    <measure>Gastric Fasting Volume at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric fasting volume was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the stomach after intravenous injection of 99mTC-pertechnetate, which is taken up by the gastric mucosa.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Postprandial Volume at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric fasting volume was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the stomach after intravenous injection of 99mTC-pertechnetate, which is taken up by the gastric mucosa.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Accommodation Volume at 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks (approximately 1 hour after 99mTC injection)</time_frame>
    <description>Change between postprandial and fasting whole gastric volume by 99mTc-SPECT Imaging. A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was given by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overweight and obese adults (≥30 kg/m^2 or ≥27 kg/m^2 with an obesity-related&#xD;
             co-morbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects residing within 125 miles of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy individuals with no unstable psychiatric disease and not currently on&#xD;
             treatment for cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological,&#xD;
             neurological, or endocrine (other than hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes mellitus on&#xD;
             metformin) disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators plan to recruit equal proportions of men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential will be using an effective form of contraception, and&#xD;
             have negative pregnancy tests within 48 hours of enrollment and before each radiation&#xD;
             exposure. In addition, since liraglutide 3.0 mg is classified as Pregnancy Category X,&#xD;
             monthly urine pregnancy testing will be performed in any female participant with&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related&#xD;
             activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight exceeding 137 kilograms (safety limit of camera for measuring gastric volumes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, cholecystectomy, Caesarian section or tubal&#xD;
             ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could&#xD;
             affect gastrointestinal motility, or use of medications that may alter&#xD;
             gastrointestinal motility, appetite or absorption, e.g., orlistat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple&#xD;
             endocrine neoplasia-type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a past or current history of pancreatitis, gallstones, history of&#xD;
             alcoholism, blood triglyceride levels &gt;500 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant untreated psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital&#xD;
             Anxiety and Depression Inventory (HAD), a self-administered alcoholism screening test&#xD;
             (AUDIT-C), and the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (binge eating disorders&#xD;
             and bulimia). If such a dysfunction is identified by a HAD score &gt;11 on either the&#xD;
             Anxiety or Depression subscales, or difficulties with substance or eating disorders,&#xD;
             the participant will be excluded and given a referral letter to his/her primary care&#xD;
             doctor for further appraisal and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any medication (except multivitamins), within 7 days of the study.&#xD;
             Exceptions are birth control pill, estrogen replacement therapy, thyroxin replacement&#xD;
             therapy and any medication administered for co-morbidities as long as they do not&#xD;
             alter gastrointestinal motility including gastric emptying (GE) and gastric&#xD;
             accommodation. For example, statins for hyperlipidemia, diuretics, β-adrenergic&#xD;
             blockers, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists&#xD;
             for hypertension, and metformin for type 2 diabetes mellitus or prediabetes are&#xD;
             permissible. In contrast, resin sequestrants for hyperlipidemia (which may reduce GE&#xD;
             and reduce appetite, α2-adrenergic agonists for hypertension, or other glucagon-like&#xD;
             peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) receptor agonists (exenatide) or amylin analogs&#xD;
             (pramlintide) are not permissible because they significantly affect GE and/or gastric&#xD;
             accommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Delayed gastric emptying at 2 and 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the study medication, liraglutide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participate in highly intense physical activity program that could potentially&#xD;
             interfere with study interpretation.&#xD;
