    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the effects of neoadjuvant with radical surgery&#xD;
      on the prognosis of patients with stage II and IIIA small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is to observe 5-year survival, disease-free survival (DFS),&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS) in patients. Secondary efficacy indicators include recurrence rate,&#xD;
      surgical complications, resection rate, quality of life (QoL), and exploration biomarker&#xD;
      (tumor tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-arm, open, multicentral clinical study designed to assess the disease-free&#xD;
      survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radical surgery for&#xD;
      stage II and IIIA small cell lung cancer (SCLC). About 300 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study and randomly divided into two groups of 150 individuals. The neoadjuvant with radical&#xD;
      surgery group received 2 to 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with etoposide plus&#xD;
      cisplatin/carboplatin before receiving radical surgery, followed by 2 to 4 cycles of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (etoposide with cisplatin/carboplatin) plus radiotherapy. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group are planned to receive 4 to 6 courses of etoposide plus cisplatin/carboplatin&#xD;
      for chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before chemotherapy is widely used in clinical work, surgery is the main method for the&#xD;
      treatment of lung cancer. However, the prognosis of patients with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (SCLC) is significantly worse than that of other histological types of lung cancer. The only&#xD;
      two prospective studies comparing the surgery with other treatments (surgery vs. radiotherapy&#xD;
      alone; induction chemotherapy + surgery vs. chemotherapy + radiotherapy) found that patients&#xD;
      in surgery group had a poorer prognosis. Thus, small cell lung cancer was determined to be a&#xD;
      non-surgically treated disease. Therefore, for patients with stage II and III A SCLC,&#xD;
      combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy are currently recommended. The first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens are etoposide plus cisplatin and carboplatin. Surgical treatment is currently only&#xD;
      recommended for very early stage SCLC (T1-2N0M0) with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      but these patients only account for about 5% of all SCLC patients. Despite the sensitivity to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the long-term survival of small cell lung cancer remains unsatisfactory. For&#xD;
      patients with limited SCLC, even if combined with local radiotherapy, there are still 1/4 to&#xD;
      1/3 of patients progressing due to recurrence of local lesions. So the status of surgical&#xD;
      treatment is expected to be reassessed. In recent years, retrospective analysis results of&#xD;
      some large databases in Europe and the United States have provided a basis for the role of&#xD;
      surgery in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It is believed that surgery should&#xD;
      be used as one of the treatment options for SCLC. Based on the results of prospective studies&#xD;
      and retrospective studies, a well-designed, phased, prospective study is urgently needed to&#xD;
      explore the role of surgery in the treatment of SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neoadjuvant therapy combined with radical surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is based on&#xD;
      the combination of etoposide and cisplatin/carboplatin. Doses of the drugs are taken from the&#xD;
      NCCN guideline for the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for the limited-period SCLC: namely&#xD;
      etoposide 120 mg/m2 through intravenous infusion on Day 1, 2, and 3; cisplatin 60 mg/m2&#xD;
      through intravenous infusion on Day 1 (or carboplatin where area under the curve AUC = 5-6);&#xD;
      4 weeks for a cycle, with a total of 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radical surgery is&#xD;
      performed according to the growth of SCLC patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, using&#xD;
      lobectomy or pneumonectomy combined with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling. 4&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, chemotherapy and concurrent radiotherapy will be performed. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen is the same with that of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with 4 weeks as a&#xD;
      cycle and a total of 2 to 4 cycles. Radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy are planned to be&#xD;
      started synchronously, the patients whose intraoperative pathology showed no lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis (N0) will receive prophylactic brain irradiation (PCI) treatment and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy synchronously. Within 10 days, the patients will receive a total dose of 25 Gy&#xD;
      of PCI, once a day, 2.5 Gy of brain irradiation each time. The patients whose intraoperative&#xD;
      pathology show that there is lymph node metastasis (N1-2) are planned to receive PCI combined&#xD;
      with mediastinal radiation therapy: namely the patient receive a total of 45 Gy within 3&#xD;
      weeks at the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, twice a day, 1.5 Gy of chest irradiation each&#xD;
      time, and the PCI treatment is the same with patients whose intraoperative pathology show&#xD;
      there is no lymph node metastasis (N0).&#xD;
