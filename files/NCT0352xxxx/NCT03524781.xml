      This study evaluates the treatment of newly diagnosed gastro-esophageal reflux disease in a&#xD;
      Danish national cohort, comparing medical and surgical treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To compare rate of surgery with medical treatment in patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease in a nationwide population based cohort over 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Between 1990 and 1997, frequency of anti-reflux surgery in USA rose from 4,4 per&#xD;
      100.000 inhabitants to 12 per 100.000 inhabitants. In the same period a trans-abdominal&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach increased to 64% of cases and mortality as well as morbidity decreased.&#xD;
      The operation rate peaked around 2000 with an increase of 260% to approximately 16.7&#xD;
      operations per 100.000 inhabitants. Complications fell to its lowest point around 2000 as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereafter, the frequency of anti-reflux surgery dropped by 40% between 2000 and 2006.&#xD;
      Complications in the form of morbidity and mortality rates steadily rose again, but the&#xD;
      patients having performed surgery were now older and have longer hospital stays and more&#xD;
      comorbidity. A slight rise in frequency of anti-reflux surgery to 6,1 per 100.000 inhabitants&#xD;
      was registered in 2010 and at this time length of stay, morbidity and mortality rates have&#xD;
      decreased, probably illustrating an increased experience. Interesting to note is, that in the&#xD;
      American data, use of laparoscopic approach does tend to plateau at 70-80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether anti-reflux surgery in Denmark has followed the same trend. There are&#xD;
      important differences in the setup of surgical service that may affect the results, as open&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery never gained much popularity in Denmark. Also, significantly fewer&#xD;
      centers offer the procedure. In a study of re-operative anti-reflux surgery based on data&#xD;
      from 1997-2005, a primary anti-reflux surgery rate of 5.2 per 100.000 inhabitants was&#xD;
      reported. However, we do not know how this rate has developed or was preceded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: From 2000-2015 there has been an increase in diagnosis of GERD and in the use of&#xD;
      anti-secretory drugs, but a decrease in the utilization of anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials: Patient selection will be done through the Danish National Patient&#xD;
      Registers. Included will be the period 2000-2015 for a total of 15 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult Danish patients diagnosed with GERD and GERD-related diagnosis will be identified&#xD;
      (ICD-10 DK21.0-21.9B &amp; DK20.9B) using The National Patient Registry.To validate&#xD;
      GERD-diagnosis, upper endoscopy must have been performed no more than three months before&#xD;
      time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GERD-diagnosis within previous four years or with concomitant diagnosis&#xD;
      requiring independent anti-secretory treatment will be excluded (DK25.0-9, DK26.0-9,&#xD;
      DK27.0-9, DK22.7 &amp; DE16.4B). Patients diagnosed with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      (DC15-26) will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Danish National Prescription Register, use of H2-antagonists (A02BA), proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors (A02BC), prostaglandins A02BB and bismuth, alginate and sucralfate (A02BX) will be&#xD;
      identified in daily doses within two years of GERD-diagnosis. Anti-reflux surgery within the&#xD;
      same period will be identified from The National Patient Registry using the procedure codes&#xD;
      (NOMESCO: KJBC00, KJBC01, KJBC02, KJBW96, KJBW97).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From The National Patient Registry, age, sex and Charlson Comorbidity Index will be&#xD;
      retrieved. Mortality during follow-up will be retrieved from The Civil Registration System.&#xD;
