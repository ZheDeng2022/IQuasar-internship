  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of intravenous&#xD;
      ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), compared to oral iron, in pediatric participants who have iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study that compares the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of FCM to oral iron in pediatric participants with IDA and a documented&#xD;
      history of an inadequate response to oral iron therapy at least 8 weeks (56 days) prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in this study and enter into a screening phase to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. Randomization will occur via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to either Group A, participants receiving FCM, or Group B, participants receiving&#xD;
      oral iron (oral solution drops, elixir or oral tablets). Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      baseline Hgb (&lt;10, ≥10 g/dL) and age (1 to &lt;12 years and ≥12 to 17 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be based on the participant's age, such&#xD;
      that infants and children (1 to &lt;4 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate drops, children&#xD;
      (≥4 to &lt;12 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate elixir, and adolescents (≥12 to 17&#xD;
      years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate tablets. Participants who experience adverse&#xD;
      clinical symptoms due to the oral iron during the treatment phase may have a weight-based&#xD;
      dose of ferrous sulfate reduced from 6 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. If the participant is receiving&#xD;
      tablets, the dose will be reduced from one tablet taken twice daily to one tablet per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, all participants will return for efficacy and safety evaluations, including&#xD;
      adverse events and laboratory assessments, on Days 7, 14, 28, and 35. Additional&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic sampling and analyses will be performed for participants receiving FCM on&#xD;
      Days 0 and 7.&#xD;

Infants and children (ages 1 to &lt;4 years) will receive oral ferrous sulfate drops, while children (ages ≥4 to &lt;12 years) will receive oral ferrous sulfate elixir. Adolescents (ages ≥12 to 17 years) will receive an oral ferrous sulfate tablet (65 mg of elemental iron/tablet/dose) twice a day (BID).
