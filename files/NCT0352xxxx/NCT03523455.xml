  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are required to undergo a screening and qualification before beginning the&#xD;
      study. Once qualified, baseline testing is completed in the laboratory. This testing&#xD;
      includes: body composition measurements, a blood draw, questionnaires, a VO2 max test, and a&#xD;
      time to exhaustion trial. This testing is repeated during week 4 and week 12. At week 8,&#xD;
      subjects complete a blood draw and questionnaires only. During the 12 week period,&#xD;
      participants will follow an endurance exercise program in which they will train 4 days per&#xD;
      week. This is a double-blind study in which participants are randomized into either the&#xD;
      placebo or supplement group. They are instructed to ingest the supplement once a day at&#xD;
      breakfast. Diet logs are also monitored throughout the duration of the study with the&#xD;
      restriction of no red meat.&#xD;

      Subjects expressing interest in participating in this study, were interviewed in person to&#xD;
      determine whether they appeared to qualify to participate in the study. If they met&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, they were invited to attend an entry/familiarization session. During&#xD;
      this session, they completed personal and medical histories which were reviewed to determine&#xD;
      whether they met eligibility criteria. Once meeting entry criteria, they were familiarized to&#xD;
      the study protocol via a verbal and written explanation outlining the study design. Subjects&#xD;
      then read and signed the Informed Consent Statements after the study details were explained.&#xD;
      Subjects then perform the exercise protocol in which they must have completed in order to&#xD;
      qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were asked to perform a VO2 Max test using the Bruce protocol. Following the VO2 Max&#xD;
      test, subjects were given a rest period of 20 minutes before starting the Time to Exhaustion&#xD;
      (TTE) trial run. This session familiarized subjects with the exercise protocol preparing them&#xD;
      for the qualification testing session. Subjects then returned to the lab in a 12 hour fasted&#xD;
      state and completed a VO2max test. If a 42 ml/kg/min or above was achieved subjects were then&#xD;
      allowed to complete the 20 minute TTE test. After completion of the TTE, a blood draw was&#xD;
      done to access the subject's iron levels. Once results for iron levels returned at a 90 or&#xD;
      below subjects were given an appointment time to perform baseline assessments and testing&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing (Week 0), Week 8 and Week 12 took place on the 8th or 9th day after the&#xD;
      subject's menstrual cycle. Subjects returned to the lab in a 12 hour fasted state, with no&#xD;
      strenuous workouts done 48 hours prior to testing. Subjects had their height and weight&#xD;
      measured, filled out questionnaires, completed a DEXA scan and InBody to establish current&#xD;
      body composition, afterwards having their heart rate and blood pressure assessed. At this&#xD;
      point subjects were instructed to lay on a table for their blood draw. Once the blood draw&#xD;
      was done, subjects completed a VO2 Max test using the Bruce protocol. Following the VO2 Max&#xD;
      testing, subjects filled out 2 questionnaires and were given a rest period of 20 minutes&#xD;
      before starting the Time to Exhaustion (TTE) trial run. During the rest period subjects were&#xD;
      given a snack to ingest (banana or apple) and consumed the same snack at each testing&#xD;
      session. Approximately 12 minutes prior to the TTE subjects filled out a questionnaire.&#xD;
      During the TTE run subjects were able to control and see the speed at which they ran but were&#xD;
      blinded to the time passed along with the distance completed. After the 20 minutes, the&#xD;
      treadmill stopped, distance, heart rate and blood pressure were measured. Afterwards,&#xD;
      subjects filled out post exercise questionnaires. At week 0, after all exercise testing was&#xD;
      completed, subjects were assigned to a group (either placebo or active) and instructed to&#xD;
      ingest 1 capsule per day. A workout log was also provided to each subject, who would return&#xD;
      to the lab every Friday with their workout log to access exercise compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4, subjects returned to the lab on the 8th or 9th day after their menstrual cycle to&#xD;
      have a blood draw completed to access blood marker variables in addition to questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet logs were keep throughout the duration of the study and were monitored by lab staff.&#xD;
