  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well methylphenidate and physical activity works in reducing&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue in patients who are receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy for cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body. Central nervous systems stimulants, such as&#xD;
      methylphenidate, may help to improve cognitive function. Physical activity uses techniques,&#xD;
      such as aerobic and resistance exercises, which may help to improve quality of life. Giving&#xD;
      methylphenidate and physical activity may help in reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic cancer who receive anti-PD1 immunotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of methylphenidate plus physical activity (MP) compared to&#xD;
      placebo plus physical activity (PL) in reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer on anti-PD1 immunotherapy, as measured by changes in Functional Assessment&#xD;
      of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale scores after 2 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effect of MP on anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]),&#xD;
      depressed mood (HADS), cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), physical&#xD;
      activity (mean day time activity as measured by actigraphy), and serum levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP1), before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the frequency and factors associated with CRF as assessed by FACIT-F,&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue (PROMIS-F), Multidimensional&#xD;
      Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), actigraphy, Edmonton Symptom Assessment&#xD;
      System (ESAS), and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-8, MCP-1), before and during 4 initial doses of Immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the effects of MP on percentage (%) of patients with dose reduction and/or&#xD;
      discontinuation anti-PD1 immunotherapy due to CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive methylphenidate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 2 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete physical&#xD;
      activity consisting of walking and resistance exercise over 25-40 minutes once daily (QD) 4&#xD;
      days a week. After 2 weeks, patients may continue methylphenidate at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive a matched placebo PO BID and complete physical activity as in Arm I.&#xD;
