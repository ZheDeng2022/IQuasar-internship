    <textblock>
      Involuntary stress reactions including hyper-reactivity and dissociation are key diagnostic&#xD;
      features of many psychiatric disorders, are difficult to treat, and predict poor outcomes in&#xD;
      conventional and neurobehavioral interventions. Here, we evaluate the extent to which a novel&#xD;
      intervention, Tuned Vibroacoustic Stimulation (TVS), capitalizing on a preserved&#xD;
      neurocircuitry for sympathetic and parasympathetic system activity can be used to modify&#xD;
      arousal responses, overriding otherwise prepotent negative stress reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD has been characterized by dysregulated responses to stress as a result of severe acute&#xD;
      or chronic trauma resulting in significantly impaired functioning, quality of life, and&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality. Physiologically, PTSD severity has been associated with elevated&#xD;
      sympathetic tone and low heart rate variability suggesting that parasympathetic tone is&#xD;
      suppressed. Lower heart rate variability specifically, as a measure of parasympathetic tone,&#xD;
      is closely associated with impaired performance and resilience. In our first study (in&#xD;
      review), we showed that in some individuals, TVS is associated with increased heart rate&#xD;
      variability and performance under stress along with reduced subjective stress. These results&#xD;
      suggest that TVS could provide some therapeutic benefit in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N=100 individuals with mild-moderate PTSD (as assessed by PCL-5/CAP5), at least half of which&#xD;
      are military Veterans, will be assessed physiologically during active interventions.&#xD;
      Mechanisms of attentional focus on cognitive and emotional stimuli will be assessed.&#xD;
      Participants will also have a real-world intervention to determine if TVS helps alleviate&#xD;
      stress, symptoms, and medication burden in the real world when stress has been identified.&#xD;
      Success will suggest a new intervention pathway for a traditionally treatment-resistant&#xD;
      dimension of psychopathology.&#xD;

      This protocol will examine and elucidate a mechanistic model for tuned vibroacoustic&#xD;
      stimulation (TVS), an exteroceptive cue that has been shown to reduce subjective and&#xD;
      physiological indicators of stress and increase behavioral performance in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      In this study, we will test whether TVS can reduce subjective and physiological signs of&#xD;
      stress, improve performance, alleviate symptoms, and reduce medication burden in adults with&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This protocol will also examine whether software that&#xD;
      cues TVS in response to biological stress markers helps users detect, regulate, and develop&#xD;
      long-term resilience to stress outside of the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine how TVS alters calmness and stress markers. Our overall hypothesis is that&#xD;
      TVS, in combination with some other task, increases performance on that task by decreasing&#xD;
      stress and increasing emotion regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: TVS during an attention task will lead to decreased GSR, increased HRV, and&#xD;
      increases in prefrontal gamma and theta band EEG, along with improved behavioral performance&#xD;
      on a focused attention, working memory and emotional information processing task. TVS will&#xD;
      also reduce subjective stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the extent to which software, which monitors real time biological stress&#xD;
      markers of users, and in response, automatically signals wearable hardware to deliver TVS&#xD;
      when user is stressed, will be able to help users detect, regulate, and develop long-term&#xD;
      resilience to stress outside the laboratory for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Evaluate whether subjects with PTSD in the real world will use our software&#xD;
      to detect and alert them of stress dynamically and if this is associated with stress&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Examine whether TVS is associated with stress regulation. Hypothesis 2.3:&#xD;
      Examine whether TVS is associated with reduction in PTSD symptoms and, possibly, medication&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 39 million Americans suffer from excessive chronic stress, which can be psychologically&#xD;
      and physically debilitating (Salleh, 2008). Untreated chronic stress plays a role in the&#xD;
      development of major illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression (Dallman et al., 2006; Swaab, Bao, &amp; Lucassen, 2005). Post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), is a severe mental illness that impacts millions of veterans and civilians&#xD;
      nationwide. Existing treatments for chronic stress and PTSD are often ineffective, have&#xD;
      adverse effects, and are prohibited by cost, time-commitment, and accessibility, resulting in&#xD;
      high rates of substance abuse and suicide (Jonas et al., 2013; Watts et al., 2013). Stress in&#xD;
      general, and PTSD more specifically, are characterized by hyper-reactivity in the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system which is associated with increased arousal and vigilance, and compromised&#xD;
      reactivity of the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps to regulate emotion and stress&#xD;
      responses (Kibler, Tursich, Ma, Malcolm, &amp; Greenbarg, 2014; Lehrer &amp; Gevirtz, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD has been characterized by dysregulated responses to stress as a result of severe acute&#xD;
      or chronic trauma resulting in significantly impaired functioning, quality of life, and&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality. Physiologically, PTSD severity has been associated with elevated&#xD;
      sympathetic tone and low heart rate variability suggesting that parasympathetic tone is&#xD;
      suppressed. HRV is widely used as a biomarker for the coordinated activity of the sympathetic&#xD;
      and parasympathetic nervous symptom. A calmer, less stressful state is typically marked by&#xD;
      increased HRV, likely attributed to respiration based parasympathetic stimulation (Grossman &amp;&#xD;
      Taylor, 2007). GSR is also a reliable index for sweat gland activity and changes in&#xD;
      activation level of the sympathetic nervous system, and GSR usually increases with higher&#xD;
      levels of stress (Mohan, Sharma, &amp; Bijlani, 2011). EEG changes, such as elevated prefrontal&#xD;
      gamma and theta, have also been associated with state of relaxed alertness. Our initial data&#xD;
      (submitted) suggest that for some individuals, TVS can boost heart rate variability and&#xD;
      performance under stress while reducing subjective stress. These results suggest that TVS&#xD;
      could provide some therapeutic benefit in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large scientific literature supports the role of vibration in regulating stress physiology&#xD;
      (Takahashi, Ohashi, &amp; Yokoyama, 2011; M. Uchikune, 2002; M. Uchikune, 2004). For example,&#xD;
      slow whole-body vibration, in the 0.01 to 0.3 Hz range, is associated with increased ratings&#xD;
      of pleasantness and increased parasympathetic tone (M. Uchikune, 2002; M. Uchikune, 2004).&#xD;
      Stimulation at about 100 Hz has been shown to activate the posterior insula (Coghill et al.,&#xD;
      1994) which is associated with increased attention to interoception, as promoted in many&#xD;
      meditative traditions. Transcutaneous targets for the vibration frequencies have also been&#xD;
      identified, including stellate ganglion and vagus nerve (Cipriano et al., 2014; Fang et al.,&#xD;
      2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will be testing the potential for TVS to increase well-being (subjective&#xD;
      calmness, increased performance, and physiological reactivity) in the PTSD population.&#xD;
      Positive results would suggest that reduction in symptomatology may be possible without&#xD;
      effort, and in lieu of specific interventions with medications or psychotherapy. A wearable&#xD;
      form of TVS technology will be examined in a real-world setting. We will use ambulatory&#xD;
      assessment to detect physiological indications of stress unique to each user and to provide&#xD;
      user-optimized TVS, examining whether it increases parasympathetic nervous system reactivity&#xD;
      in response to stress, thus decreasing subjective stress just as a user's stress begins to&#xD;
      increase.&#xD;
