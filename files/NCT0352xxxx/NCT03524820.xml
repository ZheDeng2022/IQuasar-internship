      This research is intended to check the benefit of treatment with cetuximab in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients with wild type RAS as third line treatment. The advantage to the&#xD;
      patients is unclear. This study will look if mutations in patients' blood area predictive&#xD;
      marker for progression free time (FPT) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      third line cetuximab. A predictive marker for FPT metastatic colorectal cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with third line cetuximab will enable a reduction in the number of treated patients.&#xD;
      Treatment only of patients with a positive marker is expected to prevent inefficient&#xD;
      treatment which will reduce suffering for the patients and reduce unnecessary medical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This research is intended to check the benefit of treatment with cetuximab in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients with wild type RAS as third line treatment, following first line&#xD;
      cetuximab treatment and other second line treatments. The hypothesis is that most cetuximab&#xD;
      sensitive cells will be eliminated in the first line of treatment, but may reemerge following&#xD;
      other second line treatments which are targeted to other clones in the tumor. The advantage&#xD;
      to the patients is unclear, however some preliminary studies show advantage to patients. This&#xD;
      study will look if mutations in patients' blood are a predictive marker for progression free&#xD;
      time (FPT) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with third line cetuximab. A&#xD;
      predictive marker for FPT metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with third line&#xD;
      cetuximab will enable a reduction in the number of treated patients. Treatment only of&#xD;
      patients with a positive marker is expected to prevent inefficient treatment which will&#xD;
      reduce suffering for the patients and reduce unnecessary medical treatment.&#xD;
