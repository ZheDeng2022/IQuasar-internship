    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion&#xD;
      protein M7824 (M7824) when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the&#xD;
      body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. M7824&#xD;
      is a drug that targets specific proteins on immune cells in order to activate immune&#xD;
      responses against tumor cells. Giving M7824 together with radiation therapy may work better&#xD;
      in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of M7824 and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2 negative (-) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 and radiation therapy in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses, specifically percentage (%) change in&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) pre and post therapy to M7824 and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to power future&#xD;
      definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the in-field and abscopal effect of treatment with anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap&#xD;
      (M7824) and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the effect of anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap (M7824) and radiation therapy on&#xD;
      immune biomarkers including PD-L1 expression and fibrosis changes in tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      in tumor tissue obtained from subjects pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize circulating immune cell populations and cytokine profiles in tumor and&#xD;
      circulation following treatment with M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To conduct ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq), RNA Scope, whole exome sequencing (WES)&#xD;
      targeted sequencing and tissue IO gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive M7824 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 14 days. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 3 days&#xD;
      after second dose of M7824, patients undergo radiation therapy once a day (QD) for 5-10 days&#xD;
      depending on the site of disease in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;

Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined by &quot;3+3&quot; design, and the recommended phase II dose is defined when 6 patients have been treated on that dose with no more than 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT will be evaluated within 6 weeks after first administration of anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824). Detailed information collected for each adverse event (AE) will include a description of the event, duration, severity, relationship to study treatment, action taken, and clinical outcome. Severity of AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE v 4.0. Summary of AEs will include only AEs that started or worsened during the on-treatment period, the treatment-emergent AEs. However, all safety data (including those from the pre- and post-treatment periods) will be listed and those collected during the pre- and post-treatment are to be flagged.</description>
