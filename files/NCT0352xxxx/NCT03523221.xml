  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction, with multi-organ system manifestations&#xD;
      caused by the release of chemical mediators and it is potentially fatal .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 5% and 14% of patients may experience a recurrence of anaphylaxis 8-12 hours after&#xD;
      the initial presentation, called biphasic (late-phase) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of treatment for children experiencing anaphylaxis remains adrenaline and&#xD;
      H1-antihistamines. Corticosteroids are not life-saving and do not have an immediate effect on&#xD;
      the symptoms of anaphylaxis but may help reduce or prevent a biphasic &quot;late phase&quot; reaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral glucocorticoids in prevention of the&#xD;
      second phase or biphasic reaction of anaphylaxis, as compared to placebo in children,&#xD;
      presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PEC Al-Sadd) with mild to moderate&#xD;
      anaphylaxis (Prospective Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either one of the two treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 1: Dexamethasone 0.6mg/kg oral. Treatment 2 : Placebo All patients will be urgently&#xD;
      treated for anaphylaxis according to guideline protocol. Enrolled patients will be given one&#xD;
      of the study medications orally, and he /she will observe in the observation room with&#xD;
      cardiac monitor and close monitoring by nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physician will discharge patient when he/she looks well, breathing comfortably,&#xD;
      has oxygen saturation &gt;94%, stable blood pressure and no gastrointestinal or neurological&#xD;
      manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge patients will be sent home on anti-histamine (cetirizine) for 5days. All patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for one week post discharge by a phone call asking about the general&#xD;
      condition, relapse of symptoms, or need for readmission.&#xD;

      Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction, with multi-organ system manifestations&#xD;
      caused by the release of chemical mediators . It requires immediate recognition and&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated rate of anaphylaxis in children was 10.5 per 100,000 persons-years . Although&#xD;
      the Rochester Epidemiology Project showed a rate of 75.1 per 100,000 person-years in children&#xD;
      aged 9 years and 65.2 per 100,000 person-years in children aged 10-19-years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the state of Qatar with approximately 280,000 visits annually to Pediatric Emergency&#xD;
      Center (PEC), there were 171 cases of anaphylaxis seen at the facility from September 2015 to&#xD;
      September 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on typical systemic manifestations, due to exposure&#xD;
      to a causative agent. There are many possible triggers, including food, medication, insect&#xD;
      venoms, rubber latex and vaccines . In some individuals, anaphylaxis is idiopathic. Both IgE&#xD;
      and non-IgE activation of mast cells and basophils that results in the release and production&#xD;
      of several inflammatory and vasoactive substances, these substances most commonly involve the&#xD;
      skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. As a result, urticarial,&#xD;
      angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, increased vascular permeability and decreased&#xD;
      vascular tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaphylaxis involves a range of signs and symptoms from hives, wheezing and angioedema to&#xD;
      cardiovascular collapse and death [9,10]. More than 80% of the patients will present with&#xD;
      flushing, itching, hives, angioedema, or other skin or mucosal symptoms. Generally up to 70%,&#xD;
      at least 2 organ systems (skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal systems) are&#xD;
      involved; however, only 10-45% have cardiovascular symptoms, including chest pain,&#xD;
      hypotension, or shock . Between 5% and 14% of patients may experience a recurrence of&#xD;
      anaphlactoid reaction 8-12 hours after the initial presentation, called Biphasic (late-phase)&#xD;
      . Most of these reactions are mild or moderate . Risk factors for biphasic reactions include&#xD;
      a severe initial reaction; presence of laryngeal edema or hypotension; delay in the&#xD;
      administration of adrenaline (epinephrine); too small a dose of adrenaline; and a history of&#xD;
      a previous biphasic reaction . Delayed symptoms can develop despite treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of treatment for children experiencing anaphylaxis remains adrenaline 1:1000&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) . H1-antihistamines are also commonly administered in anaphylaxis. The&#xD;
      combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines appears to be more effective, especially for&#xD;
      cutaneous symptoms . The onset of activity of these agents is slower than epinephrine and is&#xD;
      considered next-in-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International guidelines consider antihistamines and glucocorticoids as second-line .&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are not life-saving and do not have an immediate effect on the symptoms of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis, since it takes 4-6 hours to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids are administered to 50% of individuals with anaphylaxis, despite a lack of&#xD;
      compelling evidence supporting their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent retrospective study in emergency department, evaluated the association between&#xD;
      glucocorticoids administration and prolonged length of stay. In 4years retrospective chart&#xD;
      review study on anaphylaxis patient, 70% of study patients received glucocorticoids as part&#xD;
      of their treatment. Glucocorticoids were not found to reduce follow up revisit in the three&#xD;
      days post discharge. And it didn't decrease the likelihood of extra epinephrine need for&#xD;
      flare of symptoms, and only found to decrease length of stay in severe anaphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing evidence for the use of glucocorticoids appears to consist mainly of&#xD;
      retrospective studies, case reports, and other descriptive literature. The need exists,&#xD;
      however, for a prospective study on the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis and its effectiveness in prevention of biphasic reaction. The objective of the&#xD;
      current study, therefore, is to complement the current research on anaphylaxis and to&#xD;
      investigate if glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis and if it can&#xD;
      prevent or limit biphasic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized controlled trial to look at steroid use in anaphylaxis and&#xD;
      its impact on anaphylaxis treatment on a prospective fashion which will be used to help&#xD;
      standardize care in the use of steroid for this common condition.&#xD;
