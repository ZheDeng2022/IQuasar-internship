    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy of nivolumab, alone or in combination with&#xD;
      relatlimab or ipilimumab in treating patients with locally-advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 signal-seeking study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will begin by establishing a participant's initial eligibility and signing of the&#xD;
      informed consent document. Eligible, enrolled patients will be assigned to one of 3 cohorts&#xD;
      in a non-randomized fashion according to prior treatment history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Patients who have not received prior anti-PD-1 therapy, but may have previously&#xD;
      experienced progressive disease or intolerance after up to two other systemic therapies&#xD;
      (e.g., one or more hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitors) will receive nivolumab 480 mg IV&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients whose disease has progressed after anti-PD-1, either as a part of this&#xD;
      trial or outside of this trial, may receive nivolumab 480mg IV q4weeks x 12 doses +&#xD;
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV q4 weeks x 4 doses, then q12weeks x 2 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C: Patients who have anti-PD-(L)1-refractory BCC (defined as PD or ongoing SD at 36&#xD;
      weeks) BCC after receiving anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy on CA209-8DP (Cohort A) or outside the&#xD;
      study, with or without having received a hedgehog pathway inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on Cohort A who demonstrate PD after nivolumab monotherapy may, if&#xD;
      appropriate in the opinion of the investigator, move to Cohort B or Cohort C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of nivolumab or ipilimumab +nivolumab or relatlimab + nivolumab may be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator under circumstances including but not limited to the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A complete response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A severe IMAR, defined as Grade 3 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Documented disease progression warranting alternative systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons&#xD;

             immune mediated adverse event that was considered related to previous immunotherapy&#xD;
             and required immunosuppressive therapy, or an immune mediated adverse event that was&#xD;
             considered related to previous immunotherapy and is still &gt; grade 1 despite&#xD;
             administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Exceptions may include Grade 3&#xD;
             ophthalmologic immune-mediated events that improved to Grade 1 within 2 weeks after&#xD;
