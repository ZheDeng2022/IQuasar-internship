  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 690517&#xD;
      in healthy male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses over 14 days&#xD;
      (MRD part).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives for the MRD part are the exploration of PK (Pharmacokinetic(s)),&#xD;
      including dose proportionality, as well as investigation of linearity and PD&#xD;
      (Pharmacodynamic(s)) of BI 690517 after multiple dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the FE (food effect) part, the secondary objective is to investigate the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of BI 690517 under fasted conditions (Reference, R) compared to BI 690517&#xD;
      (single dose) after a high fat high caloric breakfast (Test, T).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
