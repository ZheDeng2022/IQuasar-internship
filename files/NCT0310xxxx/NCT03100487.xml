  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if audio recorded guided imagery vs deep breathing exercises delivered via a&#xD;
           digital media player improves abdominal pain symptoms in children with functional&#xD;
           gastrointestinal pain disorders managed in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if audio recorded guided imagery and deep breathing exercises delivered via a&#xD;
           digital media player improves psychosocial distress in children affected by functional&#xD;
           gastrointestinal pain disorders managed in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of treating functional gastrointestinal pain disorders using remotely&#xD;
      delivered psychosocial therapies has the potential to treat many children affected by&#xD;
      functional gastrointestinal pain disorders in a cost-effective manner. This study will&#xD;
      provide insight into how well these patients in the primary care could benefit from such&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children managed in primary care with a functional gastrointestinal pain disorder will be&#xD;
      recruited and studied for this trial. After participants are deemed eligible, they will&#xD;
      complete multiple questionnaires and then be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      either guided imagery or deep breathing exercises delivered via a digital media player.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to listen to the tracks at least 5 days per week for an 8&#xD;
      week intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 3 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and&#xD;
      stool diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 7 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and&#xD;
      stool dairy. After this diary is completed, the participant will again complete multiple&#xD;
      questionnaires for their final visit.&#xD;
