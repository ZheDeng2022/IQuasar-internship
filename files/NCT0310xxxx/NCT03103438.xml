      This is an open label, phase 1, &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalating study of tolerability, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      the novel monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor - BCD-089. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 19 healthy male volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-6 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of&#xD;
      several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis. BCD-089 is a novel fully human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which&#xD;
      is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-089-1 study is the first-in-human&#xD;
      clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of BCD-089 when used as a single step-by-step escalating&#xD;
      subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine&#xD;
      diapason of safety doses of BCD-089 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
