  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded cluster-randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies&#xD;
      for scripting/dispensing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on retention, virologic suppression,&#xD;
      and cost compared to the standard of care. The study will be conducted in Malawi and Zambia&#xD;
      among approximately 8,200 HIV-1-infected adults (18 years or older) who are stable on ART.&#xD;
      Clusters will be randomized to one of three study arms: (1) standard of care (SOC) ART&#xD;
      scripting (varies by country, region, clinic, and/or provider), (2) three-month ART&#xD;
      scripting, and (3) six-month ART scripting. 30 clusters will be selected for the study, 15 in&#xD;
      Malawi and 15 in Zambia, and will be randomized to a study arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted among approximately 8,200 HIV-infected individuals age 18 years&#xD;
      or older who are stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 30 clusters in Malawi and Zambia.&#xD;
      Individuals will be screened at routine clinic visits and enrolled if they meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Enrolled individuals will receive standard of care at their site with the exception&#xD;
      of their ART dispensing interval based on the assigned randomization. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed after 12 months, but all participants will be under observational follow-up for 36&#xD;
      months, with annual re-assessment of retention, virologic suppression, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no contact with study participants during the period of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints will be determined by chart review after the primary endpoint is reached (12&#xD;
      months). Endpoint data collection will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retention in care on strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suppressed viral load of &lt;1,000 copies done as part of standard of care viral load&#xD;
           monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of participants in Malawi (n=1,500), we will perform a review of participants'&#xD;
      health passports, a record of patient clinic visits, general health information, and&#xD;
      medications that is possessed by patients in Malawi, after the 12-month endpoint has been&#xD;
      completed. Data will be collected on interim clinic visits, such as reason for visit/services&#xD;
      received (sick, family planning, non-communicable disease treatment), frequency of visits,&#xD;
      and location of clinic services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of participants (~240), we will perform a post intervention study visit after the&#xD;
      12-month endpoint is completed. Qualitative interviews will be performed with a subset of&#xD;
      participants and will focus on patient experience with assigned dispensing interval,&#xD;
      including challenges/barriers and facilitators towards adherence and retention. Focused&#xD;
      questions around endpoints (if default, reasons; if virologic failure, reasons including&#xD;
      adherence) will also be addressed in the post-intervention visit.&#xD;

          <description>The primary outcome to be studied is whether scripting/dispensing of ART for intervals of six months is non-inferior to three months with respect to retention in care.</description>
          <population>The sample includes only those participants for whom outcome data was available (n=8719). As described in the participant flow, 399 participant files could not be located to analyze final outcome data at the endpoint.</population>

        <description>The secondary outcome to be studied is the cost-effectiveness of scripting/dispensing of ART for intervals of six months compared to three months and SOC. Cost-effectiveness will be estimated as the average cost per successful outcome (patient retained at 12 months).</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>For the cost analysis, we excluded 179 participants whose visit data were unclear, leaving an analytic sample of 8,540 patients.</population>
