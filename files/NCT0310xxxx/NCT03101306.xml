  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
      This treatment is associated with long term side effects in around half of patients with up&#xD;
      to 10% suffering from grade 3-4 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows for shaping of radiotherapy&#xD;
      fields to reduce the doses delivered to organs at risk (OARs). This does appear to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of long and short term toxicity (although there is little randomized evidence). However&#xD;
      pelvic organ position varies both between and even during radiotherapy fractions; this means&#xD;
      that radiotherapy margins must be generous to allow adequate coverage of the clinical target&#xD;
      volume (CTV) but this also increases dose to OARs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a number of studies evaluating pelvic organ motion in cervical cancer as well&#xD;
      as assessing different adaptive radiotherapy strategies. These have included individualized&#xD;
      margins, plan of the day and adaptive techniques. Most of these studies have been carried out&#xD;
      using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging which is often poor quality with limited&#xD;
      soft tissue contrast. MR offers better visualization of the tumour and OARs and is used for&#xD;
      imaged guided brachytherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the role of MR imaging in adaptive radiotherapy for cervical cancer&#xD;
      with development of a number of theoretical treatment strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo standard treatment during the study with five weeks of external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy (25 fractions) followed by a MR guided brachytherapy boost or external beam&#xD;
      boost (further 10 fractions.) They will be treated with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 if&#xD;
      clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard treatment patients have a staging MR scan at diagnosis, a radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning CT and an MR scan in the 4th week of treatment. Cone beam imaging will also be&#xD;
      performed. Response will be assessed as standard with a MR scan at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study patients will undergo 3 additional MR scans. These will take place in&#xD;
      the 1st, 2nd and 5th weeks of treatment. Extra sequences will be added to the clinical&#xD;
      mid-point scan in the 4th week of treatment. These MR scans will include anatomical images -&#xD;
      with full and empty bladder as well as cine data (with a scan every minute for 10 minutes) to&#xD;
      assess intra fraction motion. They will also include a DWI sequence, which will be used to&#xD;
      assess if early prediction of response is possible. The frequency of cone beam imaging will&#xD;
      be increased from approximately 10 scans as standard of care to 25 scans to allow for daily&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st MR scan will be contoured to outline clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs. A&#xD;
      variety of planning strategies will be developed including standard planning target volume&#xD;
      (PTV) margins, a plan of the day (POTD) approach, a POTD+ as well as an online adaptation&#xD;
      model. These models will be used to assess coverage of CTV and PTV as well as dose to OARs&#xD;
      using the scans obtained during the radiotherapy treatment. The practicality of each approach&#xD;
      will also be assessed. Inter and intra fraction organ motion will also be analysed in order&#xD;
      to develop patient specific models.&#xD;
