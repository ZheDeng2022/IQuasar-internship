  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) is associated with considerable personal distress,&#xD;
      functional disability and societal costs. A large number of studies have shown that Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for PDA. However, the CBT-protocols&#xD;
      proven to be most effective involves repeated exposure to the particular environments the&#xD;
      agoraphobic patient fears such as trains, tunnels, lifts and shops. This cause great&#xD;
      practical problems for health care services as such therapeutic efforts involves spending&#xD;
      considerable time outside the clinic. For primary care services this is particularly&#xD;
      challenging due to the large number of patients expected to be seen. Normally clinicians meet&#xD;
      up to 7 patients daily which makes it almost practically impossible to offer 2-hour sessions,&#xD;
      which is necessary to carry out the relevant exposure tasks. Hence, the treatment proven to&#xD;
      be most effective, which primary care services are commissioned to deliver, is too&#xD;
      comprehensive and time consuming to be applied in real practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that a possible solution to the above problem is to provide&#xD;
      evidence-based CBT but with the exposure components carried out through Virtual Reality (VR)&#xD;
      rather than in vivo. Some research has already been done with virtual reality and exposure&#xD;
      therapy for anxiety disorders with promising results. The aim of this pilot study is to treat&#xD;
      patients with agoraphobia with or with a history of panic disorder with a standardized&#xD;
      exposure-based CBT-protocol through VR. The virtual environments that are used for the study&#xD;
      are live sequences filmed in 360Â°. The investigators hypothesize that CBT with VR will be&#xD;
      effective and lead to improvements on measures of panic disorder and agoraphobia.&#xD;
