      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232 in&#xD;
      treating patients with glioblastoma (brain cancer) that is newly diagnosed or has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the concentration and variability in concentration of MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232&#xD;
      (AMG 232 [KRT 232]) in brain and brain-associated tissue in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GBM). (Part 1) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AMG 232 (KRT&#xD;
      232) given in combination with standard radiation following surgery for patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM harboring unmethylated MGMT promoters and wild-type TP53. (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of AMG 232 (KRT 232) in patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
      (Part 1) II. Assess the variability of AMG 232 (KRT 232) concentration in tumor enhancing&#xD;
      versus (vs.) infiltrative tissue. (Part 1) III. Assess the pharmacodynamic effect of AMG 232&#xD;
      (KRT 232) on p21 elevation. (Part 1) IV. Determine the safety of AMG 232 (KRT 232) given&#xD;
      concurrently with radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvantly as monotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed GBM harboring unmethylated MGMT promoters and wild-type TP53. (Part 2) V.&#xD;
      Assess AMG 232 (KRT 232) exposure and correlations with pharmacodynamic (PD) effect on p21&#xD;
      elevation. (Part 2) VI. Assess PD effect on MIC-1 elevation in serum. (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase 0, intratumoral pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD study of MDM2 inhibitor&#xD;
      KRT-232 followed by a phase I dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I: Patients with recurrent glioblastoma receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG 232 (KRT-232) orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily (QD) for 2 days. Within 3-6 hours of the last dose, patients undergo standard&#xD;
      of care surgery. Upon recovery (within 45 days), patients with TP53 wild-type tumors continue&#xD;
      to receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG 232 (KRT-232) PO QD on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II: Within 6 weeks of standard of care surgery, patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma undergo radiation therapy daily during weeks 1-6. Patients also receive MDM2&#xD;
      inhibitor AMG 232 (KRT-232) PO 2 times weekly (days 2, 4), 3 times weekly (days 2, 3, 5), 4&#xD;
      times weekly (days 2, 3, 4, 5), or 5 times weekly (days 1-5) for 6 weeks during radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II (EXPANSION COHORT): Patients receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG 232 (KRT-232) PO QD on days&#xD;
      1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for the first two&#xD;
      years from the off-treatment date, and then every 6 months until death.&#xD;

             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements, are ineligible; patients with active infection&#xD;
             requiring IV antibiotics within 2 weeks of study day 1 are excluded; patients with&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III and higher), unstable angina, or&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease causing the inability to take oral&#xD;
             medication, malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous alimentation, prior&#xD;
             surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g.,&#xD;
             Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of bleeding diathesis are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), positive hepatitis total&#xD;
             core antibody with negative HBsAG, or detectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             (RNA) by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay are ineligible (screening is&#xD;
             generally done by hepatitis C antibody [HepCAb], followed by hepatitis C virus RNA by&#xD;
             PCR if HepCAb is positive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study as no studies evaluating the reproductive&#xD;
             toxicity of AMG 232 (KRT 232) have been conducted to date; the teratogenic potential&#xD;
             of AMG 232 (KRT 232) in laboratory animals, if any, is unknown; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AMG 232 (KRT 232), breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
             if the mother is treated with AMG 232 (KRT 232) through 1 week after receiving the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             AMG 232 (KRT 232); in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a planned use of Novo-TTF (Optune) are ineligible&#xD;
