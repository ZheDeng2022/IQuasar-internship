  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to increase the understanding of the characteristics, circumstances, medical&#xD;
      histories and pathologies of children from ages 11 months through 18 years who have died&#xD;
      suddenly and unexpectedly, and in some instances, without explanation. The SUDC Registry and&#xD;
      Research Collaborative will analyze cases of sudden unexpected deaths in these children to&#xD;
      understand risk factors and causes, and develop preventative measures.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Review the child's death, medical and family history by our study pathologists&#xD;
           (including forensic, pediatric, cardiac and neuropathologists) to determine whether a&#xD;
           possible, probable or definite cause of death can be identified and whether additional&#xD;
           studies might be helpful in determining a specific cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For case investigations that are open/active, the registry offers cardiac pathology, and&#xD;
           neuroimaging/neuropathology consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those cases determined to be unexplained/undetermined- access to genetic analysis&#xD;
           (whole exome sequencing) when viable samples are available. Additional genetic analysis&#xD;
           opportunities for biological parents and some family members. For more information,&#xD;
           please see our Genetics Frequently Asked Questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the risks that lead to sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide families with a review of their child's death through a case review report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify at-risk individuals with the hopes of gaining knowledge to establish prevention&#xD;
           strategies to reduce the chances of sudden unexplained death in the future.&#xD;

A full consultation report will be sent back to Dr. Orrin Devinsky and tissue will be returned to the NYU biorepository upon completion of the cardiac or neuropathology consultation.</description>

             prosecting pathologist&#xD;
&#xD;
