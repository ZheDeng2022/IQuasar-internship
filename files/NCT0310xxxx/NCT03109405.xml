  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the Veinplicity Device as an adjunctive IV&#xD;
      cannulation tool in subjects with a history of difficult to access veins. The Veinplicity&#xD;
      Device is intended to improve venous access rates in compromised patients by taking advantage&#xD;
      of the increased circulation that results from provoked muscle stimulation. The study&#xD;
      collected information about the device, intravenous access, user and patient perceptions for&#xD;
      IV access, and any device or procedural complications or other adverse events. Device use was&#xD;
      examined with patients in both a prone and upright position.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects received treatment (stimulation-assisted) with the Veinplicity Device per the Instructions for Use. The subject underwent standard IV cannulation using a 20 gauge cannula into the available vein immediately after completion of device stimulation. Use of a tourniquet was at the discretion of the nurse performing the IV cannulation.</description>
