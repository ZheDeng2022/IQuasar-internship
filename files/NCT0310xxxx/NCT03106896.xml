      Postherpetic neuralgia(PHN) is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome which persists more than 3&#xD;
      months after the resolution of the acute shingles episode. PHN is a complicated neuropathic&#xD;
      pain that results from the sustained peripheral injury by herpes zoster and its pathological&#xD;
      mechanism in skin and spine has been reported. But the cerebral mechanism is still unclear.&#xD;
      Based on the previous study that has proved the reorganization of cerebral functional&#xD;
      connectivity in pain chronicity, the investigators hypothesize that the process from acute&#xD;
      herpetic pain (AHP) to PHN is also accompanied with the reorganization of functional&#xD;
      connectivity.In the study, the investigators intend to use 7 Tesla functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging(fMRI) to observe the difference of brain activity and functional&#xD;
      connectivity between acute herpetic pain and PHN. Meanwhile, the investigators examine the&#xD;
      evolution of functional connectivity longitudinally in patients who is suffering from acute&#xD;
      pain, so as to explore the central mechanism of transition to PHN.&#xD;

      Postherpetic neuralgia(PHN) is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome which persists more than 3&#xD;
      months after the resolution of the acute shingles episode. PHN is the most common&#xD;
      complication of herpes zoster in the pain clinic and it was reported that 2%-35% patients who&#xD;
      suffer from herpes zoster may continue to suffer from PHN. Along with the coming of aging&#xD;
      population, advanced age is one of the risk factors and about 20.6% patients aged 50 years&#xD;
      and over may translate into PHN from acute herpes zoster . Besides, the proportion may&#xD;
      increase with age which not only seriously impacts the quality of patients' life but also&#xD;
      causes huge personal and social healthcare burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHN is a complicated neuropathic pain that results from the sustained peripheral injury by&#xD;
      herpes zoster and its pathological mechanism in skin and spine has been reported. But the&#xD;
      cerebral mechanism is still unclear. In the recent several years, fMRI is widely used in the&#xD;
      cerebral mechanism in several diseases due to its no trauma and accurate positioning about&#xD;
      brain regions. The existing fMRI research about PHN discovered that the alteration of brain&#xD;
      activity and reorganization of cerebral functional connectivity in PHN compared with healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Liu,et al. investigated the effects of PHN on resting-state brain activity&#xD;
      utilizing arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques and found that regional cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      in left caudate, left insula, left S1, and right thalamus was highly correlated with the pain&#xD;
      intensity, and meanwhile, the four brain regions exist functional connectivity with other&#xD;
      regions in different degrees. Liang,et al. explored the difference of cerebral activity&#xD;
      between acute herpes zoster and PHN and found PHN showed higher regional homogeneity in&#xD;
      bilateral thalamus, right cerebellum, right hippocampus, right fusiform gyrus, right insula.&#xD;
      They speculated tha the thalamus, cerebellum, insula may be associated with hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      hippocampus may be associated with pain memory in PHN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, fMRI showed that insula, thalamus, hippocampus, striatum and so on are&#xD;
      connected with PHN. And then the investigators are curious about the cerebral alteration&#xD;
      before the patient is definitely diagnosed as PHN. Meanwhile it's commonly presented in&#xD;
      clinic that why some patients who suffer from herpes zoster can heal without PHN while&#xD;
      someone are suffering from PHN in a long time. The investigators assume that cerebral&#xD;
      alteration and its functional connectivity are associated with the transition to PHN. That is&#xD;
      to say, it's a study of mechanism about the transition from acute herpes zoster pain to PHN.&#xD;
      Some studies have shown that the reorganization of neural network, especially the function&#xD;
      connectivity between cortex and limbic system, is involved in the transition to chronic back&#xD;
      pain and affects the sense, emotion, cognition, movement of pain. Apkarian ,et al. used fMRI&#xD;
      to identify intrinsic and extrinsic hippocampal functional connectivity, comparing subacute&#xD;
      back pain (SBP, back pain 1-4 mo) and chronic back pain (CBP, back pain﹥1 yr) patients to&#xD;
      control subjects. Both groups showed more extensive hippocampal connectivity than CON&#xD;
      subjects. They then examined the evolution of hippocampal connectivity longitudinally in SBP&#xD;
      patients who recovered (SBPr, back pain decreased﹥20% in 1 yr) and those with persistent pain&#xD;
      (SBPp) and found that SBPp and SBPr subjects have distinct changes in hippocampal-cortical&#xD;
      connectivity over 1 yr. Specifically, SBPp subjects showed large decreases in hippocampal&#xD;
      connectivity with medial prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrated that the&#xD;
      reorganization of hippocampal functional connectivity is associated with the transition to&#xD;
      chronic back pain. They also found that nucleus accumbens(NAc)-medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC)&#xD;
      functional connectivity is also involved in the transition to chronic back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators hypothesize that the process from acute herpetic pain (AHP) to PHN is&#xD;
      also accompanied with the reorganization of functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of technology, 7 Tesla fMRI is coming into our sight. Andreas, et al.&#xD;
      showed that 7 Tesla-fMRI with the increased field strength offers marked improvement for the&#xD;
      localization of activation foci with high spatial specificity when comparing neural response&#xD;
      to painful electrical stimulation with 3 Tesla. In our study, the investigators intend to use&#xD;
      7 Tesla fMRI to observe the difference of brain activity and functional connectivity between&#xD;
      acute herpetic pain and PHN. Meanwhile, the investigators examine the evolution of functional&#xD;
      connectivity longitudinally in patients who is suffering from acute pain, so as to explore&#xD;
      the central mechanism of transition to PHN.&#xD;

        The PHN sample size is determined according to the published reports. The AHP sample size&#xD;
        is determined according to the 20.6% incidence of patients who translate from AHP to PHN&#xD;
        and the drop-out rate, generally speaking, about 10%. Finally, we determine we need 54 AHP&#xD;
        subjects, 10 PHN subjects, 11 age and gender-matched control subjects.&#xD;
