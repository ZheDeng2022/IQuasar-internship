  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent French study conducted in the general population in the north, using more than&#xD;
      12,000 people randomly drawn from the electoral lists, shows a prevalence of nearly 15% of an&#xD;
      obstructive spirometric function disorder; The diagnosis was ignored in 70% of cases. If we&#xD;
      consider the Finistère situation, the mortality data are unfavorable, with an excess of COPD&#xD;
      mortality compared to the French average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to other frequent chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, the&#xD;
      management of COPD may appear complex for at least two reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening is difficult because of the banality of symptoms and the need for spirometry&#xD;
           to confirm the diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities are masking the respiratory pathology; It is on this first point&#xD;
           concerning the difficulty of screening that this project focuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is true that the development of screening strategies for COPD has been the subject of&#xD;
      numerous studies, the results of which are controversial. The target population of smokers&#xD;
      over the age of 40, who are readily selected, is difficult to achieve as a whole because the&#xD;
      use of care is far from homogeneous. Many people do not have a general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reviews of COPD screening do not recommend systematic screening for COPD in adults.&#xD;
      However, they emphasize the feasibility of screening by questionnaire and / or portable&#xD;
      spirometry. A selection of patients suspected of exacerbations (patients with at least one&#xD;
      episode labeled &quot;bronchitis&quot;) could increase the cost-effectiveness of screening by focusing&#xD;
      on the most severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the High Authority for Health (HAS), inspired by the work of the WHO (GOLD&#xD;
      programs), offers a simple five-question questionnaire available online for all healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in order to facilitate an indication of screening spirometry, where the&#xD;
      proposed approach combines symptom identification with active smoking. General practitioners&#xD;
      are in this first line of approach for the diagnosis: in fact, the HAS, in its guide of the&#xD;
      &quot;pathway of care of the patient COPD&quot;, recommends that the general practitioner can carry out&#xD;
      the spirometric screening. The corresponding pulmonologist intervenes in this course by&#xD;
      completing the explorations and optimizing the management, especially in patients with&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations. This ideal scheme is hampered by the present practical organization,&#xD;
      a minority of general practitioners (10%) practicing in multidisciplinary health centers,&#xD;
      places where the organization of a functional respiratory measurement can be easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current recommendations for smoking cessation allow the coding of this management. It is&#xD;
      global, applicable in primary care. It proposes as a starting point the minimal advice, then&#xD;
      associates medicines of assistance with the stop, cognitive-behavioral therapies and a&#xD;
      prolonged follow-up of the patients after weaning. However, although these comprehensive&#xD;
      management techniques are effective for smoking cessation, it is shown that they are&#xD;
      underutilized in routine practice by health professionals with low patient participation&#xD;
      rates. This is noticed, whereas the application of the minimum board alone would allow about&#xD;
      200 000 people to have access to weaning every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a complementary way, the performance of a functional respiratory test in the active&#xD;
      smoking patient has been proposed as a full-fledged tool for the weaning assistance process.&#xD;
      Analysis of the literature, however, yields discordant results. Two recent studies have&#xD;
      revived the debate: they highlight the potential of spirometry as a communication medium in&#xD;
      the context of smoking cessation (using pulmonary age) by confronting patients with the&#xD;
      discovery and understanding of their ventilatory disorder obstructive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, if other health care providers are invited to participate actively in screening,&#xD;
      including pharmacists, their place in this screening strategy has been less valued. In&#xD;
      particular, pharmacists and dentists are required to provide care to patients with little or&#xD;
      no use of the general practitioner: screening for COPD among these patients deserves&#xD;
      consideration. Similarly, nurses occupy a special place, being called in particular to carry&#xD;
      out regular care of patients, both in their office and at home. The administration of&#xD;
      injectable antibiotics in a context of exacerbation of unlikely COPD is a frequent care&#xD;
      opportunity, which may include this more comprehensive approach. Finally, physiotherapists,&#xD;
      who are increasingly trained in the concept of respiratory rehabilitation, are taking charge&#xD;
      of other potentially COPD smokers for other pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the willingness of Finnish actors to work on a COPD pathway with the help of the&#xD;
      regional health agency, the investigators propose to question the respective place of health&#xD;
      care professionals involved in primary care among potentially COPD patients: Dentists,&#xD;
      nurses, general practitioners, physiotherapists and pharmacists&#xD;
