  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that is carried (lives) in the nose of most&#xD;
      individuals and can sometimes go on to cause severe infections such as meningitis and&#xD;
      pneumonia. There are over 100 types of pneumococcus, and children in the UK have been&#xD;
      routinely immunized against pneumococcal disease since 2006. A vaccine against 13 types of&#xD;
      pneumococcus (PCV 13) was introduced into the UK in 2010, replacing a previous version that&#xD;
      prevented 7 types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal carriage in the Thames Valley region has been studied over the last 7 years with&#xD;
      carriage rates having been shown to be reflective of potential severe pneumococcal disease&#xD;
      and hence vaccine effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether the pneumococcal immunization program has&#xD;
      changed the frequency and nature of pneumococcal bacteria carried by children, as this may&#xD;
      give a clue as to what changes in pneumococcal disease are likely to be seen in the future.&#xD;
      In addition, this study is especially timely given the possibility of a change in the PCV 13&#xD;
      immunization schedule that is currently being assessed in the 'Sched3' Immunization study&#xD;
      (NCT02482636). Obtaining accurate baseline data will be important in informing the&#xD;
      interpretation of any subsequent data on carriage rates obtained following introduction of&#xD;
      the new schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol up to 1600 children aged 13 to 48 months living in the Thames Valley&#xD;
      and South Midlands and which have had three doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine. In addition, up to 800, 6-12 month old children who have received a priming dose of&#xD;
      PCV13 will be recruited. The study consists of one visit done at a convenient venue (GP&#xD;
      surgeries, educational/ play settings, or home) where a single nasal swab and an optional&#xD;
      finger-prick blood sample for a sub-set of 632 participants, will be performed. No additional&#xD;
      follow-up is needed. The study recruitment period will be from 2017 onwards.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional observational study to determine the point prevalence of&#xD;
      pneumococcal carriage in children. In this study up to 1600, healthy children aged 13-48&#xD;
      months who have received a complete course of PCV13 at least one month prior to study&#xD;
      enrolment, will be recruited. In addition, up to 800, 6-12 month old children who have&#xD;
      received a priming dose of PCV13 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 13-48 month cohort, an interim analysis for futility to demonstrate an increase in&#xD;
      serotype 19A will be performed after the first 750 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in the Thames Valley and South Midlands. Parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians will be approached either by website based advertisements, social media, poster&#xD;
      advertisements and emailing and/or handing out information booklets through their child's&#xD;
      nurseries, GP Surgeries and educational/play settings. The investigators may also identify&#xD;
      potential participants by mailing out invitation letters and leaflets to age appropriate&#xD;
      children via the Open Exeter system of National Health Application and Infrastructure&#xD;
      Services, the Child Health Computer Department, equivalent NHS database or through the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Network. Parents/legal guardians of potential participants who have&#xD;
      expressed interest will be directed to the Oxford Vaccine group (OVG) website where they will&#xD;
      be able to access the participant information booklet and if appropriate complete online&#xD;
      self-screening. If parents approach OVG to express interest, the information booklet will be&#xD;
      sent to them and they may be telephone screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve a one off visit. The study visit will be arranged to occur in a&#xD;
      convenient venues such as: hospital out patients, university clinic rooms, village halls,&#xD;
      church halls, nurseries, participant's homes, sporting and recreational areas, GP practices&#xD;
      and other similar venues where pre-school children frequently attend. Permission would be&#xD;
      seek from the above venues to carry out any study procedures on their premises. Pre-arranged&#xD;
      dates and times will be offered to parents/legal guardians by online booking, phone call or&#xD;
      email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit the investigators would go through the details of the study and provide an&#xD;
      opportunity for further questions. For those willing to proceed the investigators would then&#xD;
      ask participants to sign a consent form and collect demographic information. A nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swab will be taken, and if consented to do so an optional blood sample will be performed in a&#xD;
      subset of 632 participants. No further visits or follow-up will be required.&#xD;
