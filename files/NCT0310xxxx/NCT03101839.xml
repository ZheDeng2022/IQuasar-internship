    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD4785 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumours where KRAS may be an important driver of tumour survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Dose escalation in patients with solid tumours to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, a&#xD;
      dose expansion cohort may be included in Part A, with up to an additional 6 patients to&#xD;
      further explore the PK, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the&#xD;
      AZD4785 MTD for confirmation of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Expansion cohort at the selected dose in patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) to evaluate PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity&#xD;
      of the AZD4785 RP2D as monotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Approximately 20 patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC (Two groups of approximately 10 patients each) with NSCLC will be enrolled to Part B.&#xD;
      Group 1 patients will have an option to provide tumour biopsies and Group 2 will be required&#xD;
      (mandatory) to provide paired tumour biopsies. Overall up to 12 patients in Group 2Part B&#xD;
      patients will be required (mandatory) to may provide paired tumour biopsies. A third group of&#xD;
      up to 20 patients with other tumour types and/or a potential different schedule may be added&#xD;
      based on the results seen in Parts A and B and any other emerging data and may also provide&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-Time-in-Human (FTIH), Phase 1 study to determine the MTD, recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of AZD4785. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-escalation phase (Part A)and an expansion phase&#xD;
      (Part B). A third group of up to 20 patients with other tumour types and/or a potential&#xD;
      different schedule may be added based on the results seen in Parts A and B and any other&#xD;
      emerging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD4785 will be given as an IV infusion over 1 hour, initially in 3 loading doses during the&#xD;
      first week and then weekly thereafter. The loading doses will be given on Days 1, 3, and 5 of&#xD;
      the first week and weekly thereafter on Days 8, 15, and 22 of 28 Day cycles. In subsequent&#xD;
      cycles AZD4785 will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is established, a dose expansion cohort may be included in Part A, with up to 6&#xD;
      additional patients to explore the PK, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity of the AZD4785 MTD for confirmation of the RP2D. Thereafter, Part B expansion phase&#xD;
      will continue to explore PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity of the AZD4785 RP2D as monotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Approximately 20 patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC (2 groups of approximately 10 patients each) with NSCLC will be enrolled to Part&#xD;
      B. Group 1 patients will have an option to provide tumour biopsies and Group 2 will be&#xD;
      required (mandatory) to provide paired tumour biopsies. Overall up to 12 patients in Part B&#xD;
      may provide paired tumour biopsies. A third group of up to 20 patients with other tumour&#xD;
      types and/or a potential different schedule may be added based on the results seen in Parts A&#xD;
      and B and any other emerging data and may also provide biopsies. Up to 12 patients in Part B&#xD;
      may provide paired biopsies.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Group 2. Patients must have histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced or&#xD;
        metastatic KRASm+ NSCLC, who have failed prior therapy and for whom no current therapy is&#xD;
