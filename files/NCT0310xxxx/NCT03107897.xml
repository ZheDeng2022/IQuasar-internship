  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, investigators aim to identify patients undergoing TAVR who are at&#xD;
      elevated risk for adverse clinical events due to decreased exertional capacity and physical&#xD;
      deconditioning. Investigators aim to determine if monitored pre-procedural physical therapy&#xD;
      is safe in these patients. Lastly, investigators aim to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      prehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to improve physical functioning by the time of TAVR and to sustain benefit through 30&#xD;
           days post-procedure; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine its effect on post-procedural length-of-stay, clinical outcomes, and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
