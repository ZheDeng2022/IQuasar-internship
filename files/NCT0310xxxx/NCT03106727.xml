  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol concerns the implementation and evaluation of an intervention designed to&#xD;
      realign the existing cadre of Community Health Workers (CHW) in Neno District, Malawi to&#xD;
      better support the care needs of the clients they serve. The proposed intervention is a&#xD;
      'Household Model' where CHWs will be assigned to households, rather than HIV or TB specific&#xD;
      patients, and will be trained to provide support for a wider range of conditions including&#xD;
      HIV, hypertension, diabetes, and pediatric malnutrition. The new model is designed to improve&#xD;
      retention in care for clients with chronic, non-communicable diseases, along with increased&#xD;
      uptake of women's health services and treatment for pediatric malnutrition, while sustaining&#xD;
      the high retention rates for clients in the HIV program. Eleven sites (health centres and&#xD;
      hospitals) were arranged into six clusters by estimated size of the catchment area&#xD;
      populations, with a population range of 11,680 to 26,260 and an average population of 20,400.&#xD;
      The order in which the intervention will be rolled out across the sites will be randomized so&#xD;
      that the intervention can be evaluated in a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. These clusters were grouped based mostly on geographic location but also on catchment&#xD;
      area sizes, in order to maximize feasibility of training for the CHW team and not overload&#xD;
      CHW training sessions with too many trainees.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the household model program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Timely case finding through education and screening for common, treatable conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Linkage to care for symptomatic clients along with those qualifying through routine&#xD;
           screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ongoing support and accompaniment of patients in care, including adherence support,&#xD;
           psychosocial support, and tracking of missed patient visits (NCDs, chronic care,&#xD;
           Antenatal care, postnatal care); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health education for common health conditions and prevention and management of these&#xD;
           conditions to optimize prevention, health services uptake, and health management&#xD;
           behaviors in the household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CHWs in Neno will be reassigned and trained in the Household model in a staggered rollout&#xD;
      over two years. The maximum number of trainees per group is capped at 60 participants, with&#xD;
      some trainings occurring with two groups of CHWs per catchment area. CHWs will receive a 4 to&#xD;
      5 day foundational training, followed by half-day refresher trainings each quarter. CHW&#xD;
      training will be evaluated through the following tools: training attendance count; CHW&#xD;
      knowledge assessment; CHW skill assessment; CHW refresher assessment; and overall through a&#xD;
      training dashboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the new CHW model is designed so that it may be evaluated as a stepped&#xD;
      wedge, cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT). The stepped-wedge study design was selected for a&#xD;
      number of reasons. First, the training of CHWs needs to be staggered due to training capacity&#xD;
      constraints. Second, all sites in Neno will receive the intervention. And third, the stepped&#xD;
      wedge RCT design permits estimation of the causal effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven intervention sites were clustered into six groups based on population size such that&#xD;
      each group had manageable number of CHWs to train. The order of implementation for these six&#xD;
      sites was randomized by a third party. In the SW-CRT study design, each cluster crosses over&#xD;
      from control to intervention group until all groups receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV: % of enrolled clients with a visit to IC3 in the last 3m&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NCDs&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Asthma: % of enrolled clients with a visit to IC3 in the last 3m&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetes: % of enrolled clients with a visit to IC3 in the last 3m&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Epilepsy: % of enrolled clients with a visit to IC3 in the last 3m&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  % women of child bearing age receiving modern family planning methods&#xD;
&#xD;

      Descriptive Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure of Facility Performance o % of facilities offering women's health services on a&#xD;
           daily basis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  % months with no facilities stocking out of RUTF (ready-to-use-food for&#xD;
                malnutrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Average number of stock out days per month per facility for combination, adult TB&#xD;
                medication. Stock outs are measured as when running balance on the facility's stock&#xD;
                card is zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Average number of stock out days per month for non-communicable disease care at the&#xD;
                two satellite pharmacies for several key drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the outcomes listed above, we will collect data from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ministry of Health-monthly reports collected from each facility and entered into&#xD;
           electronic database called DHIS2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Partners In Health Medical Record capturing patient-level HIV and NCD data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Short, semi-structured qualitative interviews with purposively selected sample of CHW&#xD;
           program recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. However, unlike a&#xD;
      typical trial of this type, data will be collected at the aggregate cluster level rather than&#xD;
      from individuals within clusters. As such, we specify a model for the cluster-time cell&#xD;
      means. In addition, the primary outcomes are proportions of people, therefore we will specify&#xD;
      the model in logs and control for population size to transform to the whole real line and&#xD;
      make a linear model appropriate.&#xD;
