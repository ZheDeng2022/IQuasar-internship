    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose therapy on blood levels&#xD;
      of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23, a protein that regulates the amount of phosphate in&#xD;
      the body) in iron deficiency anemia in healthy participants, participants with Congestive&#xD;
      Heart Failure (CHF, where the heart does not pump adequate blood supply to the body),&#xD;
      participants with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD, where the kidney function is reduced), and&#xD;
      participants with CKD and CHF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron is a key part of our red blood cells which bring oxygen to our body's tissues. Without&#xD;
      iron, our blood cannot carry oxygen. The body normally gets iron through diet and it also&#xD;
      re-uses iron from old red blood cells. When iron stores are low, patients get iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia. This can happen because patients lose more red blood cells and iron than the body can&#xD;
      replace, the body does not do a good job at absorbing iron from the diet, or the body is able&#xD;
      to absorb iron but patients are not getting enough iron from their diets. Many patients with&#xD;
      chronic diseases such as CKD and CHF also have iron deficiency anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency may also cause a hormone in the body named FGF23 to rise. FGF23 is a hormone&#xD;
      that is made in bone and has an important role in the heart and kidney. When the kidneys are&#xD;
      not working properly, as in CKD, or when the heart is not pumping correctly, as in CHF, FGF23&#xD;
      levels in the blood go up. Many patients with CKD or CHF also have low levels of iron. In&#xD;
      these cases, FGF23 levels may rise even more. Too much FGF23 in the blood may lead to an&#xD;
      increased risk of heart problems and accelerate loss of kidney function. The best way to&#xD;
      control FGF23 levels in the blood in CKD and CHF is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a 6-week iron deficiency anemia study on healthy&#xD;
      individuals,individuals with CKD, and individuals with CHF to find out if treating iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia with intravenous iron sucrose therapy can safely and successfully lower&#xD;
      FGF23 levels. Iron sucrose has been shown to lower FGF23 in animal models. The short term&#xD;
      effects of iron sucrose on FGF23 levels in CKD and CHF are not known.&#xD;
