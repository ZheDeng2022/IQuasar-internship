      The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the increase in&#xD;
      the volume of peri-implant gingival tissue in implants installed in the aesthetic areas with&#xD;
      the use of subepithelial-conjunctive tissue graft, and a sample of 40 individuals with&#xD;
      implants Aesthetics where the test group (n = 20) will receive tec graft. (N = 20) will&#xD;
      receive only the dental implant without the placement of a tec graft.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osseointegrated implants have been used since the mid-1950s, and countless studies have&#xD;
      ensured the reliability of their use, so the implant has become a common practice among&#xD;
      dental surgeons, as the use of implants has increased its complications as well. Accompany&#xD;
      the same development, especially when they are installed in aesthetic areas, where deficiency&#xD;
      of periimplant gingival tissue is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the increase in&#xD;
      the volume of periimplant gingival tissue in implants installed in the aesthetic areas with&#xD;
      the use of subepithelial conjunctive tissue graft, and a sample of 40 individuals with&#xD;
      implants aesthetics where the test group (n = 20) will receive tec graft. (N = 20) will&#xD;
      receive only the dental implant without the placement of a tec graft epithelial conjunctival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to analyze the increase of gingival periimplant tissue, pre, trans and postoperative&#xD;
      clinical measurements, aesthetic evaluation, patient satisfaction assessment and improvement&#xD;
      of the quality of life will be performed and the radiographic measurements will be performed&#xD;
      to evaluate the periimplant bone structures and their influence on the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurements will be performed in the pre-operative (baseline), 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively and 6 months after installation of the definitive crown on the implant, the&#xD;
      study will have a power of 80% (p = 0.05).&#xD;

    <description>It is expected that the association of autogenous connective graft to the placement of cone-morse platform implants in aesthetic areas allows a greater gain of peri-implant soft tissue and better aesthetic results after the installation of definitive prostheses than in the other proposed groups.</description>
