      Research Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Impedance Cardiography to decrease the risk of preeclampsia in obese patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Obesity is epidemic in the United States and this is leading to an increase in&#xD;
      the number of pregnant patients with obesity. Obesity, especially morbid obesity (BMI &gt;/=&#xD;
      40), increases the risk of developing preeclampsia when compared to the non-obese population.&#xD;
      Impedance Cardiography has never been used to evaluate this patient population to see if they&#xD;
      have abnormal cardiac output and/or abnormal peripheral resistance. If identified, low dose&#xD;
      medical treatment can be done to normalize these patterns early on to see if this treatment&#xD;
      modality decreases the development of preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine if the use of Impedance&#xD;
      Cardiography can help identify the appropriate medicine for use in treating morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients that have abnormal testing results, to see if by normalizing impedance cardiography&#xD;
      testing parameters results in a decrease in the incidence of preeclampsia in general and&#xD;
      other pregnancy complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: All pregnant patients, 18-51 years old, less than 20 weeks pregnant, with a BMI&#xD;
      &gt;/= 40 will undergo impedance cardiography and if the results are abnormal, will be provided&#xD;
      informed consent to participate. If consent is given, and blood pressure is &lt; 140/90,they&#xD;
      will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: All patients who meet criteria will undergo impedance cardiography. Those with&#xD;
      abnormal results will be randomized as the whether they will be treated or not. Randomization&#xD;
      will require they blindly pull a paper labelled &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; from a container. Those who&#xD;
      select &quot;yes&quot; will be randomized to the treatment arm and will be prescribed antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications commonly used in obstetrics for hypertension (labetalol, nifedipine, atenolol)&#xD;
      Those who select &quot;no&quot; will not receive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure: All pregnant patients that meet study criteria and have abnormal Impedance&#xD;
      Cardiography testing will be asked to participate, consented and randomized to the treatment&#xD;
      or non treatment arm. The treatment group will receive antihypertensive medications as listed&#xD;
      above and undergo monthly cardiography testing after beginning treatment with medication&#xD;
      adjustments until normal test results are obtained. The non treatment group will undergo&#xD;
      repeat cardiography testing 8 weeks after the first test to compare results. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be followed with regular prenatal care for their prospective conditions and&#xD;
      followed closely for the development of high or low blood pressure and preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events: Adverse events related to this study are minimal because the test is non&#xD;
      invasive and complications for Impedance Cardiology are non existent. In addition, the drugs&#xD;
      used to treat hypertension have been used in obstetrics for over 30 years with good results&#xD;
      and minimal problems.&#xD;
