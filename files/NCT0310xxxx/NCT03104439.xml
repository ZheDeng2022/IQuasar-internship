      This research study is studying a combination of drugs with radiation therapy as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, or MSI High&#xD;
      Colorectal Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many&#xD;
      cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune&#xD;
      system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus&#xD;
      releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a cell that attaches to other&#xD;
      cells to fight off infection. The antibodies in ipilimumab work by not allowing cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. The antibodies in nivolumab work by causing programmed cell death of the cancer&#xD;
      cells. Radiation therapy is believed to increase the likelihood of response of immunotherapy&#xD;
      (the prevention/treatment of a disease through an immune response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of nivolumab,&#xD;
      ipilimumab and radiation therapy on participants with microsatellite stable colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, pancreatic cancer, or MSI high colorectal cancer. The combination of these study&#xD;
      drugs have been tested and optimized for safety and is currently being tested in multiple&#xD;
      disease types. The study drugs have not been tested and optimized in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The investigators believe that through the combination of the study drugs&#xD;
      and radiation therapy the body may produce an immune response to stop the cancer cells from&#xD;
      growing.&#xD;
