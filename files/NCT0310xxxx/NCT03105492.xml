      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prenatal whole genome sequencing (PWGS) will give expecting parents large amounts of genetic&#xD;
      data about their baby. This raises ethical concerns. Researchers want to find out if women&#xD;
      want access to the kind of data PWGS provides. They want to know why and under what&#xD;
      circumstances women would or would not want the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the views of pregnant women about possible use of PWGS. To find out whether they&#xD;
      would want different categories of genetic data, and how they would use such findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women ages 18 and older who pregnant and speak English or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a survey about their views of PWGQ. They may take it online or on&#xD;
      paper.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impending implementation of prenatal whole genome sequencing (PWGS) raises a host of&#xD;
      ethical concerns given the massive amounts of genetic information that expecting parents will&#xD;
      be able to learn about their baby. This project involves a cross-sectional quantitative&#xD;
      survey of pregnant women to explore whether they want access to the kinds of information&#xD;
      provided by PWGS, why and under what circumstances. The survey will address questions such&#xD;
      as: What sorts of information do pregnant women want to know about their baby, and why? What,&#xD;
      if anything, would they do with the information? What kind of guidance would pregnant women&#xD;
      like from their medical team regarding fetal genetic testing? Given the range of practical&#xD;
      and ethical challenges posed by PWGS, our data will inform practitioners approaches towards&#xD;
      PWGS as the technology develops and becomes more widely available. It is imperative that&#xD;
      government regulators and professional societies take into account the views of people&#xD;
      directly affected by any policies that are created - including patients themselves - before&#xD;
      crafting rules for whether, when and how to utilize PWGS.&#xD;
