      The purpose of this research study is to examine the impact of educational secure messages on&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the MEANS (MyHealtheVet&#xD;
      to Enable And Negotiate for Shared decision making) intervention in improving women's&#xD;
      self-reported knowledge and rates of diagnosis and appropriate management of menopause&#xD;
      symptoms. The proposed intervention is an educational and shared decision making platform for&#xD;
      menopause symptoms to improve communication between patients and their providers regarding&#xD;
      menopause symptoms. MEANS combines educational secure messages through the Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      online Personal Health Record called MyHealtheVet, along with face-to-face and print&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEANS will be applied in target population consisting of postmenopausal women Veterans ages&#xD;
      45 to 60 who receive primary care at the Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. This&#xD;
      project will enroll women in MyHealtheVet, develop a library of menopause symptoms material&#xD;
      for distribution, and evaluate how useful of MyHealtheVet use for educating and tracking&#xD;
      women regarding menopause symptoms.&#xD;
