      Early pregnancy renal anhydramnios or EPRA is a condition where a pregnant woman does not&#xD;
      have any amniotic fluid around her fetus because of a problem with the fetus's kidneys. This&#xD;
      condition is thought to be fatal once the fetus is born because of inadequate lung growth.&#xD;
      The Renal Anhydramnios Fetal Therapy (RAFT) Trial offers eligible pregnant women with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of EPRA an experimental therapy of repeated or serial &quot;amnioinfusions&quot; of fluid&#xD;
      into the womb. An amnioinfusion involves placing a small needle through the pregnant woman's&#xD;
      skin into the womb next to the fetus. Warm sterile fluid with balanced electrolytes and&#xD;
      antibiotics is then slowly infused into amniotic space inside the womb. The aim is to help&#xD;
      the fetus's lungs grow enough so he or she can survive after birth. These amnioinfusions will&#xD;
      be carried out by an expert in fetal interventions at a RAFT center. There is a significant&#xD;
      risk of early rupture of membranes and early delivery in subjects who receive amnioinfusions,&#xD;
      and any potential trial participants will be counseled about these risks before they decide&#xD;
      whether to join the trial. Any eligible patients who, after counseling, elect to terminate&#xD;
      the pregnancy will not be eligible to participate in the trial. All eligible patients who&#xD;
      choose to join the RAFT trial will be able to choose their assignment into one of two arms of&#xD;
      the study: (1) to receive serial amnioinfusions (2) to not receive amnioinfusions but receive&#xD;
      monitoring for the remainder of the pregnancy at the RAFT center. Thus, assignment of&#xD;
      patients to study arm will not be random, but will be decided by the participant. Fetuses who&#xD;
      do survive after birth will require intensive medical management for kidney failure including&#xD;
      placement of a dialysis catheter and dialysis therapy with the eventual need for a kidney&#xD;
      transplant. Treatment for lung disease secondary to abnormal lung development may also be&#xD;
      required. The study will follow babies and their families until non-survival or transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amniotic fluid is critical for normal lung development. After the first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy amniotic fluid is composed nearly completely of fetal urine. The absence of&#xD;
      amniotic fluid due to lack of urine production by the fetal kidneys is known as anhydramnios.&#xD;
      Early pregnancy renal anhydramnios or EPRA is thought to be 100% lethal after birth if left&#xD;
      untreated because of neonatal respiratory failure. The two causes of EPRA are bilateral renal&#xD;
      agenesis or fetal renal failure (such as from multicystic dysplastic kidneys or obstructed&#xD;
      kidneys). Recently there have been clinical case reports of repeated or serial infusions of&#xD;
      isotonic fluid (amnioinfusions) into the amniotic cavity leading to respiratory survival in&#xD;
      neonates with a history of EPRA. Some surviving neonates have gone on to undergo successful&#xD;
      dialysis and kidney transplant as toddlers. However, no prospective trial has investigated&#xD;
      the safety of amnioinfusions in EPRA, the feasibility of doing serial amnioinfusions in EPRA&#xD;
      pregnancies without causing rupture of membranes, or the neonatal survival rate after serial&#xD;
      amnioinfusions for EPRA. Accordingly the goal of the Renal Anhydramnios Fetal Therapy (RAFT)&#xD;
      trial is to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of serial amnioinfusions to&#xD;
      promote normal fetal lung development in EPRA. Pregnant patients presenting to a RAFT center&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of EPRA will undergo an evaluation including diagnostic amnioinfusion with&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging to verify the diagnosis. Counseling by a team of subspecialists including&#xD;
      a maternal fetal medicine doctor, a pediatric nephrologist, a pediatric surgeon, a&#xD;
      neonatologist, a kidney transplant specialist, a genetic counselor and a social worker will&#xD;
      be given to every patient. This counseling is meant to provide the clearest picture possible&#xD;
      of what serial amnioinfusions entail and what life will be like for a surviving neonate with&#xD;
      no kidney function. Survivors will require urgent dialysis with a peritoneal or hemodialysis&#xD;
      catheter. These children are prone to significant infections and often need a gastrostomy&#xD;
      tube in order to receive sufficient nutrition. The goal is for these children to ultimately&#xD;
      undergo the most robust form of renal replacement therapy with a kidney transplant once they&#xD;
      are large enough to tolerate it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the diagnosis of EPRA is confirmed, counseling is complete and a patient is deemed&#xD;
      eligible for serial amnioinfusions, enrollment into the study will be offered. Patients may&#xD;
      choose to enroll in the study, may choose to continue the pregnancy and not be a part of the&#xD;
      study or may choose to terminate the pregnancy. If the patients elect to enroll in the study,&#xD;
      they will be given a further choice of intervention with serial amnioinfusions or expectant&#xD;
      management with repeat imaging. Participants will not be randomized because there is no&#xD;
      realistic hope that expectant management will lead to postnatal survival. Patients who do not&#xD;
      choose to undergo amnioinfusions but who also do not elect to terminate will provide&#xD;
      invaluable insight into the in utero natural history of EPRA if they enroll in the trial. The&#xD;
      sample size of this trial is based on a calculation of the number of patients required to&#xD;
      adequately determine a postnatal survival rate of amnioinfusions for EPRA with narrow&#xD;
      confidence intervals. Postnatal survival will be defined as survival to successful dialysis&#xD;
      for 15 continuous days; this is the primary outcome measure. We have determined that 35&#xD;
      maternal/fetal participants are required in order to calculate a survival rate of anywhere&#xD;
      from 20-80%. We plan to study two 35 participant cohorts of EPRA patients, those with EPRA&#xD;
      from bilateral renal agenesis and those with EPRA from fetal renal failure. We will therefore&#xD;
      aim for a total of 70 maternal/fetal pairs with EPRA to undergo serial amnioinfusions.&#xD;
      Additionally we will aim to recruit 30 maternal/fetal pairs with EPRA in the expectant&#xD;
      management group for a total of 100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the prenatal portion of the trial we plan to collect a small specimen of amniotic&#xD;
      fluid from participants in the amnioinfusion group during each amnioinfusion. This fluid will&#xD;
      be assayed for different protein and lipid measures of lung maturity at a research lab at&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins. Additionally, in both the amnioinfusion group and the expectant management&#xD;
      group we will study ultrasound, MRI and echocardiogram measures of lung growth. We will&#xD;
      correlate these biochemical and radiologic markers with survival in order to better&#xD;
      understand who is likely to respond to amnioinfusions and why that response is occurring. We&#xD;
      also plan to study several secondary and tertiary outcomes in our surviving EPRA patients.&#xD;
      These outcomes include survival to discharge from a RAFT center, survival to transplant and&#xD;
      quality of life measures for both participants and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes made to the outcomes are due to the protocol amendment.&#xD;
