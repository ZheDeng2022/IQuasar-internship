  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal endothelial cells health and pumping function is crucial to permit corneal optical&#xD;
      clarity by keeping cornea in relatively dehydrated state. Corneal endothelial damage has been&#xD;
      associated with most types of intraocular surgery. Trabeculectomy is the standard glaucoma&#xD;
      surgical intervention in management of progressive glaucoma despite of medical therapy which&#xD;
      can be performed in combination with Cataract surgery (Phacoemulsification and IOL&#xD;
      implantation) in patients with cataract-impaired visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will investigate and compare the corneal endothelial cells&#xD;
      number and health status before and after trabeculectomy vs. combined surgery (at 1 month and&#xD;
      3 months post-op visits) using Specular microscopy which is a non-invasive technique to&#xD;
      access the structure and function of the corneal endothelium by permitting visualization of&#xD;
      the corneal endothelial mosaic to assess the effect of this surgical intervention on corneal&#xD;
      endothelial cells health and number.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Corneal endothelial cells health and pumping function is crucial to permit corneal optical&#xD;
      clarity by keeping the cornea in a relatively dehydrated state.1 The corneal endothelium is a&#xD;
      single layer of hexagonal cells with uniform size and shape in normal conditions. When&#xD;
      endothelial cell density diminishes, the remaining cells increase in size to cover the empty&#xD;
      spaces left by the dead cells, and therefore there is a change in the size (polymegathism)&#xD;
      and morphology (pleomorphism) of the remaining cells. Trauma or other insults often cause&#xD;
      endothelial cell death, which is irreparable because these cells lack division capacity.2,3,4&#xD;
      Corneal endothelial damage has been associated with most types of intraocular surgeries&#xD;
      including glaucoma and cataract surgeries.5,6,7,8 Cataract and glaucoma are the most common&#xD;
      causes of visual impairment worldwide.9,10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phacoemulsification and Intraocular lens (IOL) insertion, the most commonly performed method&#xD;
      of cataract extraction in the developed world, was first described in 1967.11 This technique&#xD;
      allows rapid visual rehabilitation postoperatively and low induced astigmatism.11 The&#xD;
      reported average loss of central corneal endothelial cells after phacoemulsification vary&#xD;
      between 4% and 25%.8 Trabeculectomy, introduced by Cairns in 1968 12, is the most commonly&#xD;
      performed incisional glaucoma procedure worldwide and has become the glaucoma filtering&#xD;
      procedure of choice in glaucoma patients 5,13,14 with advanced glaucoma or poor tolerance or&#xD;
      uncontrolled IOP despite of multiple topical or systemic medications with the goal of&#xD;
      preserving vision and reducing the likelihood and rate of visual field loss and optic nerve&#xD;
      changes in susceptible patients by reducing the intra ocular pressure (IOP) as the major risk&#xD;
      factor.15,16 The use of anti-metabolites specifically Mitomycin C (MMC) as a supplement to&#xD;
      trabeculectomy with more favorable effect on the outcome was reported by Chen 17 and Palmer 6&#xD;
      in the early 1990s5 showing eyes treated with MMC-augmented trabeculectomy have lower&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) than eyes treated with trabeculectomy only.12 About 8.7% loss in&#xD;
      central endothelial cells was reported after 3 months follow up in patients with&#xD;
      Trabeculectomy with augmented Mitomycin C (MMC).7 Combined Trabeculectomy with Cataract&#xD;
      surgery (Phacoemulsification and IOL insertion) can be performed based on the need to restore&#xD;
      cataract-impaired visual acuity in trabeculectomy candidates.9,18 Given available results of&#xD;
      previous studies on the effects of each of above mentioned procedures on corneal endothelial&#xD;
      cells7,8, it is presumed that combined trabeculectomy with phacoemulsification and IOL&#xD;
      insertion would have a cumulative effect on central corneal endothelial cell loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specular microscopy is a non-invasive technique to assess the structure and function of the&#xD;
      corneal endothelium by permitting visualization of the corneal endothelial mosaic.19 It is&#xD;
      the standard method of endothelial cell analysis worldwide. By counting the number of the&#xD;
      cells in measured areas of the cornea, an estimate of endothelial cell density can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only one retrospective study available comparing central corneal endothelial cell&#xD;
      loss after Trabeculectomy versus combined Trabeculectomy, Phacoemulsification and IOL&#xD;
      insertion.2 There is also very limited data available to determine whether the expected&#xD;
      damage is a non-progressive short-term effect or a progressive consequence which can lead to&#xD;
      corneal endothelial decompensation. The investigator's aim is to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      effects of above mentioned procedures on central corneal endothelial cells health and&#xD;
      density. The results of this study could help glaucoma surgeons make proper decisions in&#xD;
      performing combined versus single surgeries in patients with initial risk factors for corneal&#xD;
      decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Hypothesis The hypothesis of this study is that combined trabeculectomy,&#xD;
      phacoemulsification and IOL implantation has more effect on corneal endothelial cell loss&#xD;
      than trabeculectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Research Plan 4.1 Study Design This is a prospective, interventional comparative clinical&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Patients Patients for this study will be recruited from the John and Liz Tory Eye Centre,&#xD;
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All patients will&#xD;
      require and have consented to incisional glaucoma surgery with or without cataract surgery&#xD;
      prior to being recruited. Subjects will be placed in one of two groups (Group A:&#xD;
      Trabeculectomy only and Group B: Combined Surgery) based on absence or presence of&#xD;
      cataract-impaired visual acuity. After achieving consent, for all patients undergoing the&#xD;
      study, baseline information including age, gender, number of anti-glaucoma medications and&#xD;
      medical history will be recorded. All patients will receive an ocular examination, including&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity measurement (Snellen chart), slit lamp examination along with&#xD;
      tonometry (Goldmann applanation tonometry), central corneal thickness measurement&#xD;
      (Pachymeter) and specular microscopy photos at pre-op, 1 month and 3 month visits. Anterior&#xD;
      chamber depth will be measured by The IOLMasterÂ® (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) for all&#xD;
      patients on pre-op visit. Type of the cataract will be assessed and recorded for Group B in&#xD;
      pre-op visit. All achieved data will be recorded and saved on prepared data sheet for future&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
      4.3 Surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 A: Trabeculectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigator and/or a glaucoma fellow will perform a standard trabeculectomy.&#xD;
      After receiving a peribulbar block on identified eye, the patient will be transferred to OR&#xD;
      and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traction suture (6-0 silk) will be put in peripheral cornea after a lid speculum is&#xD;
      inserted. A superior conjunctival peritomy will be performed followed by bipolar cautery for&#xD;
      haemostasis. At this point 0.2 mg/ml Mitomycin-C will be applied using 3 soaked sponges&#xD;
      tucked under conjunctival flap which will be removed after 90 seconds while checking the time&#xD;
      by a digital timer. Copious irrigation with 20 cc sterile saline will be performed after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4 in 4 mm scleral flap will be demarcated by a diamond blade at the depth of 0.25 mm. The&#xD;
      flap will be elevated and dissected through the clear cornea using a crescent blade. After&#xD;
      creating a side port to decompress the anterior chamber by a 25-gauge needle, sclerotomy will&#xD;
      be performed using a 15 degrees blade followed by a peripheral iridotomy. The scleral flap&#xD;
      will be sutured back into place using 4-8 interrupted and buried 10-0 nylon sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior chamber (AC) will be reformed by balanced sterile saline (BSS) which reveals&#xD;
      filtration through the flap. Conjunctival flap will be repositioned meticulously into the&#xD;
      limbus using either continuous alone or with combination of interrupted 8-0 Vicryl sutures.&#xD;
      6-0 silk traction suture and speculum will be removed after reforming AC again to confirm no&#xD;
      leak from the wound site. The eye will be patched using an eye patch and a plastic shield&#xD;
      after application of TobraDexÂ® ointment and Atropine 1% eye drop (if Phakic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 B: Combined Trabeculectomy, Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigator and/or a glaucoma fellow will perform Combined trabeculectomy,&#xD;
      phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. After receiving peribulbar block on identified eye,&#xD;
      pt will be transferred to OR and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traction suture (6-0 silk) will be put in peripheral cornea after a lid speculum is&#xD;
      inserted. A superior conjunctival peritomy will be performed followed by bipolar cautery for&#xD;
      haemostasis. At this point 0.2 mg/ml Mitomycin-C will be applied using 3 soaked sponges&#xD;
      tucked under conjunctival flap which will be removed after 90 seconds while checking the time&#xD;
      by a digital timer. Copious irrigation with 20 cc sterile saline will be performed after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4 in 4 mm scleral flap will be demarcated by a diamond blade at the depth of 0.25 mm. The&#xD;
      flap will be elevated and dissected through the clear cornea using a crescent blade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the side port is made using 15 degree blade, the entrance to the anterior chamber (AC)&#xD;
      will be made using 2.4 mm keratome. Capsulorrhexis will be performed using a cyctotome after&#xD;
      filling the anterior chamber with viscoelastic (ViscostÂ® and ProviscÂ®). Lens material will be&#xD;
      extracted using phacoemulsification and completed by irrigation and aspiration of the cortex&#xD;
      material. The capsular bag will be inflated using Provisc and Posterior Chamber Intra-Ocular&#xD;
      Lens (PCIOL) will be inserted using the PCIOL dispenser in to the bag and dialed in place by&#xD;
      a Sinskey hook. Completion of sclerotomy and creation of a peripheral iridectomy will be&#xD;
      followed by using a 20 degree blade and Vannas scissors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scleral flap will be sutured back into place using 4-8 interrupted and buried 10-0 nylon&#xD;
      sutures. AC will be reformed by balanced sterile saline (BSS) which reveals filtration&#xD;
      through the flap. Conjunctival flap will be repositioned meticulously into the limbus using&#xD;
      either continuous alone or with combination of interrupted 8-0 Vicryl sutures. 6-0 silk&#xD;
      traction suture and speculum will be removed after reforming AC again to confirm no leak from&#xD;
      the wound site. The eye will be patched using an eye patch and a plastic shield after&#xD;
      application of TobraDexÂ® ointment.&#xD;
