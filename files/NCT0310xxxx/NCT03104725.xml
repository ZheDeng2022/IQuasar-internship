      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinsons disease (PD) causes slow movement, stiffness, and poor balance. Many symptoms are&#xD;
      due to the loss of brain cells that make the brain chemical dopamine. The cells may be&#xD;
      damaged by the breakdown of dopamine by a process called oxidation. The drug N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) can act as an antioxidant. Researchers want to test if NAC can decrease the oxidation&#xD;
      of brain dopamine in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look at the effect of NAC on brain chemistry in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with PD that were diagnosed within the past 5 years. They must be&#xD;
      taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteer participants ages 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized for 4 to 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, participants will have blood and urine tests. For several hours, they cannot eat or&#xD;
      drink anything but water and their medications. Late in the morning they will have a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 hours later they will have a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). For this, a numbing&#xD;
      medicine is injected into the back. A needle is inserted between the bones in the back to&#xD;
      remove a small amount of fluid. The spinal tap may use x-rays to see inside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the spinal tap, they will start taking NAC by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will take NAC twice a day for 2 more days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next day, they will not eat until a meal in the late morning. They will take a final&#xD;
      NAC dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 hours later they will have a second spinal tap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteer (HV) participants will receive a spinal tap on day one, followed by a&#xD;
      second spinal tap 48 hours after the first spinal tap. HV participants will not receive NAC.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to test whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits the spontaneous oxidation of&#xD;
      central neural dopamine as indicated by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of&#xD;
      5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprises up to 35 participants with early (less than or equal to 5&#xD;
      years from diagnosis), mild, levodopa-untreated PD and up to 6 healthy volunteer&#xD;
      participants. The PD participants will be on an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) that is&#xD;
      prescribed for their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a two groups employing a pretest-posttest design. Each participant undergoes a&#xD;
      lumbar puncture (LP) as an inpatient at the NIH Clinical Center to obtain cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF) for assays of Cys-DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and related biochemicals.&#xD;
      For PD participants, the second LP is done after the participant has taken at least 5 doses&#xD;
      of NAC (2 grams orally twice per day). The LP takes place about 2 hours after the last NAC&#xD;
      dose. For HV participants the second LP takes place approximately 48 hours after the first&#xD;
      LP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is the CSF concentration of Cys-DA. Other outcome measures are&#xD;
      levels of other catecholamine-related neurochemicals or of indices of oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Depending on the results, an exploratory study may be done involving NAC at 1 gram orally&#xD;
      twice per day.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mean Percent Change in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Concentration of 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) Pre and Post-N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants underwent a baseline LP. For PD participants, the second LP occurred approximately 2 hours after the participant had taken NAC the last NAC dose. For HV participants the second LP takes place approximately 48 hours after the first LP.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who took N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and healthy volunteers who did not take NAC, each had two separate lumbar punctures (LP 1 and LP 2) to obtain spinal fluid. The spinal fluid samples were used to measure the amount of a brain chemical called 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA). The primary outcome measure is the mean change in CSF Cys-DA levels between pre and post-NAC treatment, which is calculated as the difference of CSF Cys-DA levels at pre-treatment (LP 1) and post-treatment (LP 2) divided by CSF Cys-DA at pre-treatment (LP 1). A greater percent decrease in Cys-DA levels in the brain would suggest that NAC may contribute to a reduction in the oxidation of brain dopamine, while a smaller percent decrease would suggest that NAC had no effect on the oxidation of brain dopamine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Ratio of Cys-DA/DOPAC Pre and Post-treatment Lumbar Puncture With and Without N-acetylcysteine (NAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants underwent a baseline LP. For PD participants, the second LP occurred approximately 2 hours after the participant had taken NAC the last NAC dose. For HV participants the second LP takes place approximately 48 hours after the first LP.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who took N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and healthy volunteers who did not take NAC, each had two separate lumbar punctures (LPs) to obtain spinal fluid. The spinal fluid samples were used to measure the ratio of the brain chemical called 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) to the brain chemical called 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Cys-DOPAC). Dopamine has 2 possible metabolic fates or processes of degradation. One fate is the breakdown of Dopamine by an enzyme to form DOPAC. The other fate is spontaneous oxidation to form Cys-DA. The ratio of Cys-DA to DOPAC may reflect these relative fates. If NAC reduced spontaneous oxidation to Cys-DA, then the ratio Cys-DA/DOPAC ratio would decrease between LP 1 and LP 2.</description>

        <title>The Mean Percent Change in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Concentration of 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) Pre and Post-N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Treatment</title>
        <description>Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who took N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and healthy volunteers who did not take NAC, each had two separate lumbar punctures (LP 1 and LP 2) to obtain spinal fluid. The spinal fluid samples were used to measure the amount of a brain chemical called 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA). The primary outcome measure is the mean change in CSF Cys-DA levels between pre and post-NAC treatment, which is calculated as the difference of CSF Cys-DA levels at pre-treatment (LP 1) and post-treatment (LP 2) divided by CSF Cys-DA at pre-treatment (LP 1). A greater percent decrease in Cys-DA levels in the brain would suggest that NAC may contribute to a reduction in the oxidation of brain dopamine, while a smaller percent decrease would suggest that NAC had no effect on the oxidation of brain dopamine.</description>
        <time_frame>All participants underwent a baseline LP. For PD participants, the second LP occurred approximately 2 hours after the participant had taken NAC the last NAC dose. For HV participants the second LP takes place approximately 48 hours after the first LP.</time_frame>

        <title>Mean Ratio of Cys-DA/DOPAC Pre and Post-treatment Lumbar Puncture With and Without N-acetylcysteine (NAC)</title>
        <description>Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who took N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and healthy volunteers who did not take NAC, each had two separate lumbar punctures (LPs) to obtain spinal fluid. The spinal fluid samples were used to measure the ratio of the brain chemical called 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) to the brain chemical called 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Cys-DOPAC). Dopamine has 2 possible metabolic fates or processes of degradation. One fate is the breakdown of Dopamine by an enzyme to form DOPAC. The other fate is spontaneous oxidation to form Cys-DA. The ratio of Cys-DA to DOPAC may reflect these relative fates. If NAC reduced spontaneous oxidation to Cys-DA, then the ratio Cys-DA/DOPAC ratio would decrease between LP 1 and LP 2.</description>

          <title>Mean Percent Change in Cys-DA/DOPAC Between Pre and Post-treatment Lumbar Puncture With and Without N-acetylcysteine (NAC)</title>
          <description>Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who took N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and healthy volunteers who did not take NAC, each had two separate lumbar punctures (LPs) to obtain spinal fluid. The spinal fluid samples were used to measure the ratio of the brain chemical called 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA) to the brain chemical called 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Cys-DOPAC). Dopamine has 2 metabolic fates. One is the breakdown of dopamine by an enzyme to form DOPAC. The other is spontaneous oxidation to form Cys-DA. The ratio of Cys-DA/DOPAC may reflect these relative fates. If NAC reduced spontaneous oxidation to Cys-DA, then the ratio Cys-DA/DOPAC would decrease between LP 1 and LP 2, which would be reflected as a percent decrease.</description>
