  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In post-dilution haemodiafiltration only synthetic membranes have been used to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allergy problems described with these membranes require the development of other&#xD;
      membranes capable of performing this treatment. We describe in vivo performance and behaviour&#xD;
      of an asymmetric cellulose triacetate(ATA™) membrane, to identify its depurative&#xD;
      effectiveness and ease of use in clinical practice, as well as evaluate its biocompatibility&#xD;
      in a single haemodialysis session (acute biocompatibility) and after one month of treatment&#xD;
      (chronic).&#xD;

      An interventional study was performed in 3 hemodialysis hospital units (La Princesa&#xD;
      University Hospital, Príncipe de Asturias University Hospital and Infanta Leonor University&#xD;
      Hospital, Community of Madrid, Spain) in which the usual dialyzer that each patient had for&#xD;
      OLHDF was replaced with the Solacea™ dialyzer keeping the rest of the parameters unchanged.&#xD;
      The study (LIB 09/2015) was reviewed and approved by the CEIC of the Príncipe de Asturias&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design of the study Each patient underwent 12 sessions of haemodialysis with the usual&#xD;
           schedule and monitor: 5008 of Fresenius (n=14), AK200US (n=5) and Artis of Gambro (n=3)&#xD;
           and DBB007 of Nikkiso (n=1) all suitable for OLHDF, although with different convective&#xD;
           transport control systems. The nursing staff connected the automatic OLHDF system. In&#xD;
           the case where the system was Ultracontrol® (Gambro monitors) if alarm of PTM&gt; 300 mmHg&#xD;
           or system pressure (PSist)&gt; 700 mmHg appeared and were not solved, Ultracontrol® would&#xD;
           be withdrawn and the pressure-control system would be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic and dialysis data&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Demographic: sex, age, underlying disease, time in OLHDF, type of vascular&#xD;
                     access: fistula (AFV) and catheter (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Dialysis Data: Monitor, dialysis fluid composition, sodium conductivity and&#xD;
                     bicarbonate concentration, dialysis fluid flow (Qd, ml min), liquid&#xD;
                     temperature, heparin type and dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Each dialysis session: effective time (TE, min), blood flow (Qb, ml min),&#xD;
                     ultra-filtrated volume to achieve dry weight (UF, l/session), Vinf&#xD;
                     (l/session), infusion rate, (Qi, ml/min) Kt (l / session), maximum PTM and&#xD;
                     maximum Psist in Ultracontrol® (mmHg) and the technical complications, alarms&#xD;
                     and coagulation problems of the system that may appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The filtration fraction (FF) was calculated as the percentage of Qi relative to Qb.&#xD;
                The convective volume (Vconv) was defined as the total ultra-filtrated volume,&#xD;
                which is the sum of VI and UF.7&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analytical determinations&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Blood&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - On the first and last day of the study pre-dialysis samples were taken for&#xD;
                     the measurement of monocytes, IL-6 and IL-1β.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  On the interval day of the first week, 3 blood samples were taken: 1st)&#xD;
                          at the beginning (CI), 2nd) at 30 min (CM) and the 3rd) at the end of the&#xD;
                          dialysis session (CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
                     In CI and CP the following parameters were measured: haemoglobin, proteins and&#xD;
                     albumin, urea, phosphorus, creatinine, uric acid, β2-microglobulin, myoglobin&#xD;
                     and retinol transport protein (RTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Leukocytes, platelets, C3a and C5a were quantified in CI and CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     --- Laboratory determinations&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - General biochemical data: haemoglobin, proteins, albumin, urea, phosphorus,&#xD;
                     reactive protein C (PCR), creatinine and uric acid, β2-microglobulin,&#xD;
                     myoglobin, and (RTP) were determined with the usual analyser of each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - Determinations of monocytes, complement, IL-6 and IL-1β were performed in&#xD;
                     the laboratory of the University of Alcalá:&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Activation of plasma complement using a sandwich ELISA: Determination of&#xD;
                          C3a and C5a activation was performed on platelet rich plasma samples&#xD;
                          using commercially available ELISA kits C3a Elabscience (Wuhan, P.R.&#xD;
                          China) and ELISA C5a RayBiotech (Norcross, Georgia).&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Determination of interleukin concentration in serum using a sandwich&#xD;
                          ELISA: IL-6 and IL-1β concentrations were measured in serum samples&#xD;
                          obtained from whole blood and stored at -80 ° C until use. Both kits used&#xD;
                          were supplied by Abcam (Cambridge, UK)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Determination of monocyte subpopulations: The different subpopulations of&#xD;
                          circulating monocytes in peripheral blood were identified by flow&#xD;
                          cytometry (FACSCalibur™, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). First of&#xD;
                          all, the monocyte population was selected according to size (FSC/forward&#xD;
                          scatter) and granularity (SSC/side scatter) and then the different&#xD;
                          subpopulations were selected by double immunofluorescence according to&#xD;
                          staining with the anti-CD14 conjugated Tricolor (monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
                          TuK4) and anti-CD16 conjugated FITC (monoclonal antibodies 3G8). Both&#xD;
                          antibodies and their respective isotype controls were purchased from Life&#xD;
                          Technologies Invitrogen (California, USA). The analysis was performed&#xD;
                          with the Cyflogic program.&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  Calculations The percentages of reduction (RR) were calculated with&#xD;
                               the formula: RR (%) = [(Cpre - Cpos) / Cpre] x 100, where Cpre and&#xD;
                               Cpos are the concentrations of the analysed substances pre- and&#xD;
                               post-dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     For protein bound substances and β2-microglobulin concentrations at the end of&#xD;
                     the session were corrected for haemoconcentration by a correction factor (FC)&#xD;
                     based on plasma protein concentration (PT):&#xD;
&#xD;
                     FC = PTpre / PTpos, where PTpre and PTpos are the total concentration of&#xD;
                     proteins pre-dialysis and post-dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     --- Statistical analysis All data was collected in a database (SPSS version&#xD;
                     15). Each value was obtained with the average of the values obtained in the&#xD;
                     different sessions or analytical determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     For the statistical analysis, descriptive tools were used, showing the average&#xD;
                     (standard deviation), median, quartiles or percentages as appropriate. For the&#xD;
                     comparison of two independent continuous variables, the Student t test for&#xD;
                     paired samples was used. For the comparison of more than two quantitative&#xD;
                     variables the ANOVA test was used. The p &lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
                     significant.&#xD;
