    <textblock>
      Frailty, one of geriatric syndromes, is considered a major obstacle for recovery from&#xD;
      physiological stress. Such stress is imposed on patients with cancer by virtue of the disease&#xD;
      itself but even more so by the treatment. Moreover, malignancy and chemotherapy both cause&#xD;
      accelerated loss of muscle mass, deconditioning, frailty and negative outcomes. Several&#xD;
      studies showed that chemotherapy accelerates ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle mass reserve was found to be a major predictor of outcomes in patients treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Recently, several studies suggest that active muscle strength training during&#xD;
      chemotherapy may decrease side effects, improves the ability to deliver intended doses of&#xD;
      treatment and may even affect oncological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study we intend to assess the contribution of physical training to the&#xD;
      well-being of chemotherapy treated older patients, assessed by molecular and physiological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to recruit lymphoma patients above age of 70 and prospectively and randomly assign&#xD;
      them to the intervention group (strength, aerobic and balance training during the&#xD;
      chemotherapy) and control group (standard care with no special emphasis on physical activity&#xD;
      during the treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure clinical outcomes such as treatment tolerance and effects as well as&#xD;
      physiological outcomes (muscle strength and mass, elements activities of daily living) and&#xD;
      laboratory markers of ageing such as DNA methylation, INK 4a expression, telomere length and&#xD;
      serum levels of inteleukin 6, CRP among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that physical training will improve patients' ability to complete the&#xD;
      treatment with fewer side effects, will provide them with better daily functioning and better&#xD;
      muscle strength/function. We also hypothesize that the ageing process, as shown by laboratory&#xD;
      senescence markers, will be attenuated in the intervention group.&#xD;

      Introduction Rising life expectancy and an exponential correlation between age and cancer&#xD;
      incidence brought about a new field of geriatric oncology. As patients above age 65 account&#xD;
      for more than 60% of cancer diagnoses with octogenarians and even nonagenarians being not&#xD;
      rare in oncology practice, a geriatric prospective becomes essential in the treatment&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty, a nebulous term, defined on the metabolic basis as &quot;vicious circle of energetic&#xD;
      dysregulation&quot;, is largely heterogeneous in younger elderly population, with some people&#xD;
      being frail, others borderline -&quot;prefrail&quot; or even non-frail - &quot;fit&quot;. Nevertheless, frailty&#xD;
      becomes universal as senescence progresses, as it is tightly linked with physiological ageing&#xD;
      and usually worsened by comorbidities. Elderly patients can seem fit and in good health but&#xD;
      still be &quot;sub-clinically&quot; frail. The clinical significance is a gradual loss of ability to&#xD;
      cope and recover from physiological stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncological patients are exposed to two major physiological stresses: the catabolic state&#xD;
      induced by the disease and the chemotherapy challenge to tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curative-intent chemotherapy is usually withheld from very frail individuals but elderly&#xD;
      patients deemed to be pre-frail or fit are frequently treated according to standard or mildly&#xD;
      modified protocols, putting them at risk of slow or no recovery from drug related toxicity.&#xD;
      Moreover, it was shown in other studies that chemotherapy itself accelerates senescence by&#xD;
      stress related mechanisms and promotes muscle loss and frailty in younger individuals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous tools have been developed to try to measure frailty and help treatment decisions.&#xD;
      Despite some differences, the main bulk of evaluated elements in all of those tools refer in&#xD;
      some way to patient's ability to perform physical activity including muscle strength, walking&#xD;
      speed, level of energy production and feeling tired, emphasizing the critical role of muscles&#xD;
      in elderly general condition .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions shown to prevent deterioration and even improve physical condition of frail&#xD;
      individuals were muscle training and nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, incorporation of physical training in younger oncological patients was&#xD;
      shown to improve outcomes such as ability to complete chemotherapy without dose adjustment,&#xD;
      subjective feeling of less fatigue, better daily functioning, earlier return to work and&#xD;
      better physical measures of muscle strength and cardio-pulmonary fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive impact of physical activity on both: preventing of frailty deterioration and&#xD;
      ability to withstand chemotherapy better, led us to hypothesis that it would be especially&#xD;
      beneficial in elderly cancer patients. The benefit would probably expand beyond the clinical&#xD;
      and functional measures and would be also expressed on the molecular level with reduced&#xD;
      levels of senescence markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to prospectively recruit lymphoma patients above age of 70, admitted to Davidoff&#xD;
      Cancer Center outpatient clinic and being judged eligible for chemotherapy at 75% of more of&#xD;
      full dose. The patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo a similar evaluation at the beginning and after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard evaluation of all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropomorphic measures (hand grip by a hand-held dynamometer and quadriceps strength&#xD;
           by a sitting tensiometer), and functional measures (gait speed by 6 minute-walk,&#xD;
           sit-to-stand test, functional reach and timed get-up-and-go test) - performed by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist at the day of recruitment and one to two months after chemotherapy&#xD;
           completion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscle mass according to muscle mass index calculation from the cross section area of&#xD;
           both psoas muscles at the level of L3 vertebra corrected to height; and body composition&#xD;
           according to mean Housfield units of the psoas section area - done by the study&#xD;
           physician, using CT scans at the begging and after the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional, nutritional and cognitive function as performed routinely at the Senior&#xD;
           Oncology Program at Davidoff Cancer Center - done at the beginning and after the&#xD;
           treatment by a team member&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard blood tests including hemoglobin, white blood cells, albumin, CRP to be drawn&#xD;
           before and after the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  markers of senescence to be measured after the treatment completion: DNA methylation at&#xD;
           three selected loci, expression of p16INK4A , telomere length and plasma levels of IL-6&#xD;
           and CRP - markers of &quot;inflamm-aging&quot; - a process of chronic low-level inflammation&#xD;
           universal in older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the standard part of the evaluation by a physiotherapist, the patient will be&#xD;
           scheduled for another appointment and taught a set of exercises including strength&#xD;
           training for upper and lower limbs (with elastic bands and weights, rising up from chair&#xD;
           and climbing stairs), fitness work out (brisk walking) and balance exercises, as&#xD;
           recommended by senior sport programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be provided with printed instructions explaining the recommended&#xD;
           exercises, and with a diary to fill in, with days and number of repetitions of specific&#xD;
           training elements to be checked in according to their compliance. Patients will also be&#xD;
           equipped with a pedometer and will be asked to record the counts regularly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be met again by a physiotherapist for follow up at the start of every&#xD;
           chemotherapy course (once in 3-4 weeks) and will be contacted by phone twice weekly to&#xD;
           assure they stick to the training recommendations The control group will receive&#xD;
           standard treatment and follow-up with no special emphasis on physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size of each group will be about 50 patients. Innovation To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      there are no prospective studies published on this kind of intervention in elderly cancer&#xD;
      patients. Home-based physical training is a simple, low-cost modality, which, if proven&#xD;
      effective, would appreciably improve patient-related outcomes and probably reduce short and&#xD;
      long-term costs of patient care. There are no studies that explored differences in cellular&#xD;
      senescence in elderly cancer patient undergoing physical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be a prospective randomized study, with an intervention to which no&#xD;
      blinding can be done. The cross-sectional comparisons between the groups and longitudinal&#xD;
      changes will be searched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The statistical analysis of the data will be performed by a statistician of Rabin&#xD;
      Medical Center using SPSS software and according to accepted standards.&#xD;
