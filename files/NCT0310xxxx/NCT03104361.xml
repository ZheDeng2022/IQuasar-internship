  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a debilitating chronic disease of&#xD;
      unknown etiology characterized by urgency frequency and suprapubic pain at full bladder.&#xD;
      Current treatments are usually unsuccessful in completely eradicating bladder pain and&#xD;
      increasing bladder capacity. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is growing in popularity&#xD;
      as a therapy to augment wound healing, speed the recovery from muscle and joint injuries, and&#xD;
      enhance recovery after surgical repair. PRP is extremely rich in growth factors and&#xD;
      cytokines, which regulate tissue reconstruction and has been studied extensively among trauma&#xD;
      patients and trauma experimental models. Tissue regeneration can be improved by local&#xD;
      application of autologous bone marrow derived progenitor cells and PRP. This clinical trial&#xD;
      attempts to use autologous PRP in treatment of interstitial cystitis refractory to currently&#xD;
      available medical treatment or intravesical therapy. The results of this study might provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence for a novel therapeutic regimen in the treatment of IC/PBS.&#xD;

      Background: Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a debilitating chronic&#xD;
      disease of unknown etiology characterized by urgency frequency and suprapubic pain at full&#xD;
      bladder. Current treatments are usually unsuccessful in completely eradicating bladder pain&#xD;
      and increasing bladder capacity. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is growing in&#xD;
      popularity as a therapy to augment wound healing, speed the recovery from muscle and joint&#xD;
      injuries, and enhance recovery after surgical repair. PRP is extremely rich in growth factors&#xD;
      and cytokines, which regulate tissue reconstruction and has been studied extensively among&#xD;
      trauma patients and trauma experimental models. Tissue regeneration can be improved by local&#xD;
      application of autologous bone marrow derived progenitor cells and PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This clinical trial attempts to use autologous PRP in treatment of interstitial cystitis&#xD;
      refractory to currently available medical treatment or intravesical therapy. The results of&#xD;
      this study might provide clinical evidence for a novel therapeutic regimen in the treatment&#xD;
      of IC/PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Department of Urology, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A total of 30 patients with IC/PBS who have failed conventional&#xD;
      treatments for at least 6 months will be enrolled in this study. A diagnosis of IC/PBS has&#xD;
      been established based on characteristic symptoms and cystoscopic findings of glomerulations,&#xD;
      petechia, or mucosal fissures after hydrodistention. All patients have been treated with at&#xD;
      least two types of treatment modalities including oral PPS, intravesical instillation of&#xD;
      heparin, hyaluronic acid, or tricyclic antidepressant for at least 6 months but the symptoms&#xD;
      remained unchanged or relapsed. All patients should have IC symptoms for at least 6 months,&#xD;
      and proven to have grade 1 diffused glomerulations after cystoscopic hydrodistention (HD)&#xD;
      within recent 1 year without Hunner's lesion. Eligible patients will be admitted for the&#xD;
      treatment. The patients will receive intravesical injection of 12ml PRP (extracted from 50ml&#xD;
      of patient's own whole blood) followed by cystoscopic hydrodistention under intravenous&#xD;
      general anesthesia in the operation room. The procedure will repeat every one month for a&#xD;
      total of four treatments. Blood (10ml) and urine samples (30ml) will be collected before&#xD;
      intravesical PRP injection and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after PRP injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Primary end-point is the change of the O'Leary-Sant symptom score (including ICSI&#xD;
      and ICPI) from baseline to 6 months after the first treatment day. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include VAS, daily frequency, nocturia and FBC as record in 3-day voiding diary, Qmax, vided&#xD;
      volume, PVR and global response assessment (GRA). Four visits are required at baseline&#xD;
      screening (before first treatment) (V1), 1 month after the first treatment (V2, primary&#xD;
      end-point), 4 weeks after the fourth treatment (V3), 24 weeks after the first treatment (V4,&#xD;
      secondary end-point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected at each time-point for NGF and cytokines tests. Bladder&#xD;
      biopsy will be performed at baseline and 6 months after the first treatment day if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events including UTI, AUR, large PVR (&gt;150ml), dysuria and micturition pain will be&#xD;
      recorded&#xD;
