  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), is commonly used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (CTCL) and chronic graft-versus-host disease. ECP (cGVHD) is an immune modulating&#xD;
      treatment. White blood cells from the patient are standardized activated by a photosensitizer&#xD;
      psoralen (8-MOP) and irradiated with visible ultraviolet light (UV-A). The purpose is to&#xD;
      induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Disadvantage of current treatment is that 8-MOP&#xD;
      targets both diseased and normal cells with no selectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to improve the current ECP technology using aminolevulinic acid&#xD;
      (ALA) and UV light. ECP will be carried out in conventional manner except that 8-MOP will be&#xD;
      replaced with ALA. Systemic ALA / UV light is already approved and used in the detection and&#xD;
      treatment of disease in humans. The primary objective is to assess its safety and&#xD;
      tolerability after single and multiple treatment in patients with CTCL or cGvHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main advantages of using ALA for ECP are (1) highly effective and selective apoptotic&#xD;
      destruction of transformed/activated hyper-proliferative T-cells through an endogenously&#xD;
      selective production of the potent photosensitiser, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) from ALA via&#xD;
      heme biosynthetic pathway; (2) ALA/PpIX only targets membranous structures outside of the&#xD;
      cell nucleus thus causing no risk of carcinogenesis and (3) induces systemic anti-tumour&#xD;
      immunity.&#xD;
