  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brown meat from crab may contain high levels of the heavy metal cadmium. Cadmium is found&#xD;
      in the environment and long-term exposure can cause accumulation in the body. High cadmium&#xD;
      levels can be toxic to the kidney and have been statistically associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of cancer in the lungs, endometrium, bladder, and breast. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      if regular consumers of brown crabmeat have a higher body burden of cadmium than&#xD;
      nonconsumers. This is important as no other studies that have addressed this subject. The&#xD;
      results of this research may provide guidance on the consumption of brown meat from crab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the proposal is that regular habitual consumption of brown crabmeat&#xD;
      increases the body burden of cadmium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 25 healthy participants who consume brown crab meat and 25 healthy&#xD;
      participants who do not consume brown crab meat. Volunteers will be eligible if they are ages&#xD;
      40 years and older, non-smokers, and have not had significant occupational exposure to&#xD;
      cadmium. Eligibility will be determined using a questionnaire that consenting volunteers will&#xD;
      be asked to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to attend a study visit at the Rowett Institute or at a&#xD;
      GP practice in Stromness (depending on participant location). Participants will be weighed&#xD;
      and asked to provide a urine sample as well as a 40 ml (2-3 tbsp.) non-fasted blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood and urine samples will be processed at the Rowett Institute or at the Balfour&#xD;
      Hospital in Kirkwall (depending on where the study visit took place). Analysis will be&#xD;
      completed at the Rowett Institute where whole blood will be analysed for cadmium, selenium,&#xD;
      and zinc and the serum for creatinine and ferritin. Urine samples will be measured for&#xD;
      cadmium, B2-microglobulin and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is expected to take place over 4 months. Study participants will have the option&#xD;
      of receiving feedback on their cadmium, zinc, selenium and ferritin levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crab meat is low in fat and is a good source of sustainable protein that also provides high&#xD;
      levels of minerals (Se, Zn, I), vitamins (B12) and long chain omega-3 fatty acids. However,&#xD;
      crab meat can also contain high levels of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd), both in the white&#xD;
      meat but especially so in the brown meat (the hepatopancreas and liver). While European&#xD;
      legislation sets a limit of 0.5mg Cd/kg wet weight for the white meat from crab, there&#xD;
      currently is no limit set for the brown meat from crab due to the large range in&#xD;
      concentrations found across member states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cd occurs in an inorganic form as an environmental contaminant, both through natural&#xD;
      occurrence and from agricultural and industrial sources. The general population is exposed to&#xD;
      Cd from various sources, including smoking, but in the non-smoking general population, food&#xD;
      is the principal source. Cd is predominantly toxic to the kidney, but it also causes bone&#xD;
      demineralisation and is statistically associated with increased risk of cancer in the lung,&#xD;
      endometrium, bladder and breast. Moreover, blood Cd levels as low as 0.5 - 0.8 µg/l have been&#xD;
      associated with chronic disease. A study of 8,989 US adults from the National Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found such levels to be associated with all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, cardiovascular disease, and heart disease after around 5 years follow up and&#xD;
      adjustments for a number of potential confounding factors (Tellez-Plaza et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cd is thought to be absorbed within the body through the use of the same transport pathways&#xD;
      as essential metals including zinc, calcium and iron in the intestine. After absorption, Cd&#xD;
      is transported in the blood to the liver where it forms a complex with metallothionein, a low&#xD;
      molecular weight family of proteins. In the kidney, the Cd-metallothionein complex is&#xD;
      filtered in the glomeruli and then reabsorbed in the renal tubules. Although absorption of Cd&#xD;
      from the diet in humans is comparatively low (3-5%), it is efficiently retained in the kidney&#xD;
      and liver, with a long biological half-life (10 to 30 years). Cd excreted in the urine is a&#xD;
      well-characterized exposure biomarker and can be used as a quantitative indicator of&#xD;
      cumulative internal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of Cd increases with age (Olsson et al, 2002), with 50yrs being the age where&#xD;
      urinary cadmium is maximal (WHO/FAO, 2004). Cd is primarily toxic to the kidney, especially&#xD;
      to the proximal tubular cells where accumulation over time may cause a decrease in the&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate and eventually, renal failure. Cd causes bone demineralisation,&#xD;
      either through direct bone damage or indirectly as a result of renal dysfunction. It is&#xD;
      through long term accumulation of Cd that its toxic effects are mainly manifested. As Cd has&#xD;
      a high affinity for the main intestinal iron transporter (Kim et al, 2007), the absorption of&#xD;
      Cd is influenced by body iron status and there is a close inverse association between serum&#xD;
      ferritin (a marker of iron stores) and blood Cd (Berglund et al, 1994). In this regard,&#xD;
      studies on human populations have shown increasing blood Cd levels with decreasing serum&#xD;
      ferritin in women at fertile age and during pregnancy due to their generally decreased iron&#xD;
      status (Berglund et al., 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is concern that Cd from crab meat consumption can contribute greatly to the body's Cd&#xD;
      burden however, no studies have investigated whether the Cd present in crabmeat increases the&#xD;
      levels of Cd in the body and similarly, it is not known whether higher Cd intakes in regular&#xD;
      crab meat eaters is associated with increased incidence of kidney damage. This study will&#xD;
      examine some of these issues. There is evidence from some studies suggesting that selenium&#xD;
      and perhaps zinc, which are both present at high levels in crab meat, may counteract the&#xD;
      toxicity of Cd (Lindh et al, 1996; Skröder et al, 2015). Moreover, some evidence may suggest&#xD;
      that the bioavailability of Cd from crab meat may be less compared to Cd in other foods (Lind&#xD;
      et al, 1995). The study will investigate whether volunteers who regularly consume brown&#xD;
      crabmeat have higher levels of Cd compared to volunteers who do not consume crabmeat. A&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire will be designed to estimate participants' total brown crabmeat&#xD;
      intake and to evaluate Cd exposure from crab consumption and this will be compared to the Cd&#xD;
      body burden (assessed as urinary Cd and blood Cd levels) to determine whether an association&#xD;
      between these variables exists and whether regular crab meat consumers have a higher body&#xD;
      burden of Cd compared to non-crabmeat consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that regular habitual consumption of brown crabmeat increases the&#xD;
      body burden of cadmium&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The objective of the study is to determine if regular brown crabmeat consumers&#xD;
      have an increased body burden of cadmium compared to non-crabmeat consumers.&#xD;

    <description>Blood Cd level is a measure of recent Cd intake (2-3 months) and will be measured by closed vessel microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Cumulative Cd retention is assessed by measuring Cd in urine (U-Cd) as U-Cd is considered a valid biomarker of lifetime kidney accumulation and will also be measured by ICP-MS.</description>
