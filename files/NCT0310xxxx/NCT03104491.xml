    <textblock>
      This study has two phases, Phase I and Phase II. The main goal of the Phase I portion of this&#xD;
      research study is to see what doses post-transplant inotuzumab ozogamicin can safely be given&#xD;
      to subjects without having too many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion of this study is to see what side effects are seen with medication after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a combination of an antibody and chemotherapy which has been shown&#xD;
      to have significant activity against relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is considered experimental in this study.&#xD;

      Study Design This is a Phase I/II study of inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation for ALL or who underwent autologous&#xD;
      transplant for NHL and have a high risk of relapse. For ALL and NHL, respectively, the Phase&#xD;
      I portion of this study will be a 3+3 dose escalation trial, followed by a phase 2 cohort at&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Participants will receive study treatment up to 12&#xD;
      cycles until relapse of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Dosing Escalation Subjects will be assessed for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory&#xD;
      assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability&#xD;
      (including adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using&#xD;
      a continuous monitoring approach. In order to be included in the safety profile endpoint&#xD;
      review, subjects must have received at least of 1 cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL Phase I: To define a post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of inotuzumab ozogamicin in ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHL Phase I: To define a post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation MTD and RP2D of&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin in NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL Phase II: To assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured by diseasefree&#xD;
      survival (DFS) at one year in ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHL Phase II: To assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured by DFS at one year&#xD;
      in NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (for each cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse,&#xD;
           relapse-related mortality and overall survival (OS) at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin after transplant including the&#xD;
           incidence of myeloid toxicity and secondary graft failure and the rate of veno-occlusive&#xD;
           disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if inotuzumab ozogamicin at these doses is effective at eradicating minimal&#xD;
           residual disease in this cohort of participants (ALL participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin post autologous transplant&#xD;
           (NHL participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (for each cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess additional evidence of efficacy and safety as measured by non-relapse&#xD;
           mortality (NRM), relapse, relapse-related mortality and overall survival (OS) at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if inotuzumab ozogamicin at these doses is effective at eradicating MRD in&#xD;
           this cohort of participants (ALL participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy after transplant&#xD;
           including myeloid toxicity, secondary graft failure, and the rate of VOD/SOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin post allogeneic and autologous&#xD;
           transplant&#xD;

             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with inotuzumab ozogamicin, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin. These&#xD;

             antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody must have a&#xD;

             whichever is greater)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full&#xD;
             participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending&#xD;
             required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with&#xD;
             interpretation of study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications,&#xD;
