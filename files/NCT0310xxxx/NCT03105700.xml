  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) is safe and feasible for treating depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
      Patients will receive an accelerated protocol of TMS consisting of three consecutive days of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will have in-person follow up visits after one month and again after six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed primarily to assess whether patients with epilepsy can safely&#xD;
      tolerate low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in an accelerated protocol to treat&#xD;
      depression. The investigators aim to treat 12 patients with epilepsy and comorbid depression&#xD;
      to receive a total of 15 hours of transcranial magnetic stimulation over 3 days at&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The investigators will assess safety of this&#xD;
      protocol with regards to seizure frequency and other side effects of TMS treatment and the&#xD;
      feasibility of using an accelerated protocol in this patient population. In addition to these&#xD;
      primary aims, our secondary goal is to determine if dense array EEG can provide a useful&#xD;
      biomarker for depression and its treatment in focal epilepsy. A structural and functional MRI&#xD;
      will be obtained before treatment and a dense array EEG before and after TMS treatment to&#xD;
      assess for changes in specific dense array EEG based biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to recruiting patients, the study staff will likewise request that family members&#xD;
      or friends of the patient accompany the patient monitor him/her for increased seizure&#xD;
      frequency. The recruited family member will bring the patient to the treatment and stay with&#xD;
      the patient overnight at a local hotel and monitor for possible seizures or other adverse&#xD;
      events of treatment. Family members will be instructed in seizure safety and be given&#xD;
      emergency phone numbers to call if the patient is experiencing adverse effects of TMS.&#xD;

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a focal, nonpharmacological, noninvasive method for stimulating the brain and modulating neural network activity. To administer TMS, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp, and uses electrical current to create magnetic fields that depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons in the brain.</description>
