      This study will be conducted at the In vitro fertilization Unit at Ain Shams University&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be recruited from the In vitro fertilization Unit who will fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study The study will assess Role of&#xD;
      Ratio of Progesterone to Number of Follicles as a Prognostic Tool for Intracytoplasmic Sperm&#xD;
      Injection outcome.&#xD;

      Blood samples were collected on the day of final oocyte maturation, and serum Progesterone&#xD;
      levels were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative determination of&#xD;
      the hormone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The P/F ratio was calculated according to the equation (P(ng/mL)/number of follicles) and was&#xD;
      defined by the measurements obtained on the day of final oocyte maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasounds were performed at our In vitro fertilization center, and we included the&#xD;
      number of follicles ≥14mm on the day of final oocyte maturation in the ratio calculation&#xD;
      Oocytes were retrieved 36 hours after injection and were subsequently fertilized by In vitro&#xD;
      fertilization or Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection. On day 2 - 5, all embryos were evaluated&#xD;
      for cell number and morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each embryo transferred was evaluated for blastomere size and fragmentation. Embryos were&#xD;
      graded as follows. Those with equal blastomere size and no fragmentation were considered&#xD;
      Grade 1; those with blastomeres of equal size with slight fragmentation (&lt;20 %) were Grade&#xD;
      2;those with blastomeres of unequal size but no fragmentation were Grade 3; those with&#xD;
      blastomeres of equal or unequal size and moderate fragmentation (20 %-50 %) were Grade 4; and&#xD;
      those with unrecognizable blastomeres and severe fragmentation (&gt;50 %) were Grade 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The embryos were transferred on postretrieval day (2 - 5). Pregnancy was defined by Human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin titers within 11 days following Embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      was defined by the observation of intrauterine embryo heart motion by 7 weeks gestation.&#xD;

    <description>All patients were pretreated with Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (decapeptyl®) 0.05 mg/day from 10 days prior to the start of menstruation. The patients'ovaries were stimulated with a recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, subcutaneous) from day 2 of the menstrual cycle. human chorionic gonadotropin was administered when at least two follicles vary 18-22mm were observed on ultrasonography.Blood samples were collected on the day of final Human chorionic gonadotropin maturation, and serum P levels were measured.Pregnancy was defined by titers within 11 days following Embryo transfer,Clinical pregnancy was defined by the observation of intrauterine embryo heart motion by 7 weeks gestation.</description>
