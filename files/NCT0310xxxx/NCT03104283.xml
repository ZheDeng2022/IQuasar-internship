  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib in elderly advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer patients, and to find the relationship between the expression of VEGFR-2 and&#xD;
      efficacy of apatinib treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is funded by Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology-Beijing Xisike Clinical Oncology&#xD;
      Research Fundation. The trial is prepared to be registered on the clinicaltrail.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan: Every participant is enrolled or excluded by two practiced&#xD;
      investigators. And two investigators participate in all steps of the trail, including the&#xD;
      record of the data, which is compared by the investigators. If the data is consistent, the&#xD;
      investigators would record the data; if not, the data would be checked and decided by the two&#xD;
      investigators. All the steps and data are site monitored and audited by the staff of research&#xD;
      and financial department of Affliated Hospital of Qinghai University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data check: The investigators compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules&#xD;
      for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification: The investigators assess the accuracy, completeness, or&#xD;
      representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources, including&#xD;
      medical records and electronic case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,&#xD;
      including the source of the variable, coding information, and normal ranges if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as&#xD;
      participants recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for&#xD;
      adverse events, and change management. All registry operations would be done according to&#xD;
      specific steps, and by two practiced investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary&#xD;
      to demonstrate an effect. According to the formula to differ advantages and disadvantages,&#xD;
      the investigators need at least 47 participants to take part in the trail. The investigators&#xD;
      can recruit about 20 participants every year according to previous experiences, so the&#xD;
      investigators should recruit about two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data: The investigators would collect as much data as possible, and the&#xD;
      investigators exclude the participants who cannot cooperate on recruitment. And the&#xD;
      investigators manage situations according to statistical principles where variables are&#xD;
      reported as missing, unavailable, non-reported, uninterpretable, or considered missing&#xD;
      because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: Statistical analyses would be performed by using SPSS software,&#xD;
      version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., IL, USA). Survival analysis would be performed using Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      methodology. Fisher's exact test would be used to analyze the efficacy of treatment. Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards model would be used for multivariate analysis. The level of significance&#xD;
      is defined as P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
