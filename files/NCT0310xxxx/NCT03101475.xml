  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center early phase II study. This proof of concept&#xD;
      study will investigate whether the combined use of local tumor ablation/radiation plus&#xD;
      immunomodulating drugs may induce a significant immune response in patient with incurable&#xD;
      liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) (+/- limited extrahepatic disease) being stable&#xD;
      or in partial remission after completion of 4-6 months first line systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to show an overall response rate of lesions not treated&#xD;
      by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions (according to iRECIST criteria)&#xD;
      higher than 10%. With the continuation of first line systemic treatment, no further responses&#xD;
      are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the feasibility and safety of the combined treatment modalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of the local technique (RFA/Radiotherapy) on the results;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate biomarkers to predict response to the combined treatment&#xD;

    <time_frame>36 months from first patient in</time_frame>
    <description>The statistical design is based on the assumption that the continuation of first line systemic treatment would result in nearly no further response translating into a response rate of 0 to 5% at maximum in the enrolled patient's population. A response rate of 10% in the experimental arm (local treatment + immunotherapy) will be judged too low to justify this combined approach. On the contrary, a response rate of 25% will be judged very promising. An optimal Simon's two-stage design will be used for the rejection of a 10% or less iBOR rate</description>

             are eligible, for example cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;

             pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months, with&#xD;
             the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
             amenorrhoeic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low&#xD;

             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy the last study&#xD;
             treatment. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as a method which&#xD;
             results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly. Such methods include:&#xD;
