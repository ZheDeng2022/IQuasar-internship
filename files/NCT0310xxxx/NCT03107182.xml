  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and nivolumab combination will be administered for three cycles&#xD;
      of three weeks duration each. TORS or RT/CRT will be performed after induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      (i.e. day 64 of therapy). Patients with low risk and small volume tonsillar disease (T1-T2,&#xD;
      non-bulky N2A-N2B with ≤2 non-lower neck lymph nodes measuring ≤5 cm in size) or base of&#xD;
      tongue disease (T1-2 with lateralized primary ≤3 cm, non-bulky N2A-N2B with ≤2 non-lower neck&#xD;
      lymph nodes measuring ≤5 cm in size) who have ≥50% reduction by RECIST following induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy will undergo TORS and selective nodal dissection. De-intensified adjuvant RT&#xD;
      will be given for adverse pathologic features. Patients may refuse TORS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with low risk, who do not qualify for TORS (due to volume of disease or poor&#xD;
      visualization/access) or refuse TORS, who have ≥50% reduction by RECIST following induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be given de-intensified treatment with radiation alone to 50 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction chemotherapy, patients will undergo examination under anesthesia and direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy to tattoo and photograph the primary tumor to plan the post-induction resection.&#xD;
      Adjuvant nivolumab will be offered to all patients for 6-months post completion of definitive&#xD;
      therapy (7 doses given as a flat dose of 480mg, every four weeks).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II trial in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer&#xD;
      (as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry with confirmatory ISH or PCR) to determine&#xD;
      radiologic response to induction chemotherapy with nivolumab. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      evaluation by a multidisciplinary team prior to risk assessment. The patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to high or low risk groups based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and smoking&#xD;
      history. Patients will be assigned to treatment with induction chemotherapy with carboplatin,&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, and nivolumab. Radiologic response to induction chemotherapy according to&#xD;
      RECIST measurement of tumor shrinkage will then be used for therapeutic stratification of&#xD;
      locoregional therapy, consisting of either transoral robotic surgery (TORS) or radiation with&#xD;
      or without chemotherapy. Patients with low risk disease (see table above) and small volume&#xD;
      tonsillar/BOT disease (T1-2 primary, non-bulky N2A-N2B nodal status) who have ≥50% reduction&#xD;
      by RECIST following induction chemotherapy will undergo TORS for primary site resection and&#xD;
      selective nodal dissection as a definitive treatment if technically feasible with adjuvant&#xD;
      radiation for adverse pathologic features. Patients with other low risk tumors e.g. with&#xD;
      higher volume disease, or who refuse surgery, who also have ≥50% reduction by RECIST&#xD;
      following induction chemotherapy will be given de-intensified treatment with radiation alone&#xD;
      to 50 Gy (no chemotherapy). Patients with low risk features and &lt;50% but ≥30% reduction OR&#xD;
      high risk features (T4, bulky N2B or N2C-N3, &gt;10 pack-years tobacco use) with ≥50% reduction&#xD;
      will receive de-intensified chemoradiation with concurrent cisplatin-RT to 50 Gy (5 weeks) or&#xD;
      TFHX to 45 Gy (3 cycles/6 weeks). Patients with low risk features and &lt;30% reduction OR high&#xD;
      risk disease with &lt;50% reduction or any patients with progressive disease during induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy will undergo chemoradiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin-RT to 70 Gy (7 weeks)&#xD;
      or TFHX to 75 Gy (5 cycles/10 weeks). Patients with both high and low risk features who have&#xD;
      ≥50% reduction will receive locoregional therapy targeting the pre-chemotherapy extent of&#xD;
      disease only. Adjuvant nivolumab will be offered to all patients for 6-months post completion&#xD;
      of definitive therapy (7 doses given as a flat dose of 480mg, every four weeks).&#xD;

                  pregnancy testing as described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected&#xD;
             pregnancy. Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt;1% when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At a minimum subjects must agree to the use of one method of highly effective&#xD;
             contraception as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal&#xD;
             ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by WOCBP&#xD;
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IUDs, such as ParaGard®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomy 30 Version Date: 12/28/2016&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete Abstinence*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse&#xD;
                  and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Female subjects&#xD;
                  must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly&#xD;
                  effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses&#xD;
                  to forego complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are encouraged to use two methods of contraception, with one method being highly&#xD;
        effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective as listed&#xD;
        below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaginal sponge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male condoms and spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male condom without spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female condom*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  *A male and female condom must not be used together&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal demonstration of distant metastases (M1 disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unidentifiable primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intercurrent medical illnesses which would impair patient tolerance to therapy or&#xD;
             limit survival. Including but not limited to ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             immunodeficiency, symptomatic congestive heart failure, pulmonary dysfunction,&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects&#xD;
             and potential unknown effects on nursing newborns (please see above paragraph under&#xD;
             inclusion criteria regarding WOCBP) 31 Version Date: 12/28/2016&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical therapy other than incisional/excisional biopsy or organ-sparing&#xD;
             procedures such as debulking of airway-compromising tumors. Residual measurable tumor&#xD;

             of physiologic dose or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has hypersensitivity to nivolumab or any other drug used in this protocol.&#xD;

             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or any&#xD;
             tumors that are not likely to influence live expectancy in the subsequent 3 years&#xD;
             without active treatment (e.g. low grade prostate cancer in absence of therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past year&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of steroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy e.g.&#xD;
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid doses for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc. are not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected). However, if eradicated patient is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy. o Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 28 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
