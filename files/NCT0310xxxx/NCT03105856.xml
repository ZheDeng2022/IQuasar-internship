      Objective. To evaluate the impact of HPV vaccination as part of a hrHPV-based primary&#xD;
      screening program to extend screening intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. A total of 3,000 women aged 25-45 years, attending the regular&#xD;
      cervical cancer-screening program in primary health care services in Tlalpan, Mexico City,&#xD;
      will be invited to the study. Eligible participants will be assigned to one of three&#xD;
      comparison groups: 1) HPV16/18 vaccine and hrHPV-based screening; 2) HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine&#xD;
      and hrHPV-based screening; 3) Control group who will receive only hrHPV-based screening.&#xD;
      Strict surveillance of hrHPV persistent infection and occurrence of precancerous lesions will&#xD;
      be conducted to estimate safety profiles at different screening intervals; participants will&#xD;
      undergo diagnosis confirmation and treatment as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The FASTER-Tlalpan Study will provide insights into new approaches of cervical&#xD;
      cancer prevention programs. It will offer valuable information on potential benefits of&#xD;
      combining HPV vaccination and hrHPV-based screening to safety extend screening intervals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer mortality is a reflection of social inequity in health care. Globally,&#xD;
      266,000 women die from cervical cancer annually, and 85% of these deaths occur in low- and&#xD;
      middle income countries (LMIC).1,2 Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (hrHPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer.3,4 HPV16 and HPV18 are responsible for 70%&#xD;
      of squamous cell carcinomas, and in conjunction with HPV45, cause 94.2% of cervical&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas.4 The introduction of HPV vaccines will change the epidemiology of&#xD;
      HPV-related cancers. However, it may take 30 years to observe the desired benefits of&#xD;
      widespread vaccination when vaccinated cohorts reach the peak ages at which cervical cancer&#xD;
      cases currently occur (e.g. women aged 40-50 years).5 As of August 2015, 84 countries and&#xD;
      territories had national public-sector HPV immunization programs and 38 had pilot programs.6&#xD;
      These programs mainly target adolescent girls to obtain the greatest cost-benefit ratio,7&#xD;
      considering the initial price of the vaccine (&gt;$100 US per dose).8,9 Women older than age 25&#xD;
      are also vulnerable to new HPV infections10 and could also be vaccinated depending on&#xD;
      country-specific resource availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent results of Phase III HPV vaccination trials documented that the vaccine's efficacy&#xD;
      among adult women is excellent (efficacy &gt;80% to prevent resultant HPV-related cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia).11,12 Additionally, current vaccines protect against both HPV16&#xD;
      and HPV18 as well as provide cross-protection against other HPV types, particularly types 31&#xD;
      and 45.13 Broad-spectrum protection such as this may lower the need for subsequent screening,&#xD;
      warrant longer screening intervals than those currently used, and offer novel prevention&#xD;
      policies against HPV-related cancers. The combination of vaccination and screening strategies&#xD;
      to prevent cervical cancer may be particularly appropriate in countries with high incidence&#xD;
      of cervical cancer that have already implemented hrHPV-based screening programs. These&#xD;
      criteria are satisfied in Mexico.14 A broader age range of females in population-based HPV&#xD;
      vaccination programs could have direct benefits for vaccinated females, and indirect benefits&#xD;
      for non-vaccinated females and male sexual partners via increased herd immunity to reduce&#xD;
      HPV-related cancers.15 Based on the high efficacy of the HPV vaccine in older women, a novel&#xD;
      strategy combining vaccination and screening, HPV FASTER, has been proposed.16 In accordance&#xD;
      with this proposal, HPV vaccination of women in a broad age range can offer protection to&#xD;
      women who are not currently infected, but also can protect against subsequent re-infection.16&#xD;
      As a result, a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening may reduce the lifetime&#xD;
      number of screens used by the current hrHPV-based screening programs. If a screening and&#xD;
      vaccination strategy is widely adopted, we expect promising results. This strategy has the&#xD;
      potential to: 1) mitigate the screening demand on both women and health services by extending&#xD;
      screening intervals; 2) improve the cost-benefit balance of screening programs; and 3)&#xD;
      provide greater protection and quality of life to a large number of women through a reduction&#xD;
      in cervical cancer.17 An intervention such as this may not only save many lives in the next&#xD;
      30 years but also be cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the data on efficacy of HPV vaccination in older women to reduce cervical cancer&#xD;
      risk, and not just the risk of precancerous lesions, are lacking. That is, there is currently&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge regarding the role of HPV vaccination in older women to permit&#xD;
      screening intervals to be extend safely following a negative screen (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant challenge for HPV-vaccine uptake is the number of doses in the standard vaccine&#xD;
      schedule. Although licensed in some countries for use among older individuals, national HPV&#xD;
      vaccination programs target teenagers and young adults. Recent studies found that fewer than&#xD;
      three doses of the two commercially available prophylactic HPV vaccines seem to provide&#xD;
      similar protection against cervical HPV16 and HPV18 infections as the three-dose schedule in&#xD;
      women younger than 25 years old. 18,19 Herein we propose a population-based study to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of a 2-dose HPV vaccination with [HPV16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix 速)&#xD;
      and HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil速)] against HPV-persistent infection and HPV-related&#xD;
      cervical disease in older women between 25 and 45 years of age attending clinics for&#xD;
      hrHPV-based screening.&#xD;
