  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased hospitalisation, increased&#xD;
      health care cost and high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of VAP increases with&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation. There is limited data especially from India on the&#xD;
      incidence of VAP and also the role of subglottic aspiration in its prevention. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the role of subglottic suction in the incidence of VAP.&#xD;

      Patients will be enrolled following inclusion-exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Base line clinical and laboratory data will be recorded in a pre designed proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endotracheal aspirate will be taken at the time of enrollment and day3, day5, day7 and&#xD;
           then weekly till patient is on mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient following data will be recorded as per the proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be carefully followed up for signs of VAP during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from clinical examination, regular recording of body temperature, observance of&#xD;
      tracheal aspirate appearance, leukocyte counts and chest radiograph will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP Diagnosis: Based on American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An association of a new or progressive consolidation on chest radiograph Plus at least two of&#xD;
      the following variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fever &gt; 38 degree&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  leucocytosis ( &gt; 12000) or leucopenia ( &lt;4000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  purulent secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
      At VAP Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who diagnosed as cases VAP, based on the above criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be done for microbiological sampling. In&#xD;
      patients where clinically indicated, Flexible bronchoscopy and Bronchoalveolar lavage,&#xD;
      sampling will be done. At the time of VAP diagnosis blood culture and urine culture, will&#xD;
      also be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotracheal aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile 22 inch, 12 French suction catheter with a mucus extractor will be introduced at&#xD;
      least 30 cm and minimum of 5ml sample will be collected. Endotracheal aspirate cultures will&#xD;
      be examined semi quantitatively. Bacterial and antibiotic susceptibility tests will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non bronchoscopic protected BAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen will be collected by sputum suction trap. A 47-48 cm sterile suction catheter of&#xD;
      16fr will be inserted through endotracheal tube till it meets resistance and will be wedged&#xD;
      there.Then a 50cm long 8fr sterile suction catheter will be passed through it till it meets&#xD;
      resistance and specimen will be taken. 20ml of NS instilled, minimum of 5ml aspirate will be&#xD;
      collected. If aspirate is less than 5 ml it will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopic BAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be taken from the legal guardian. The patient will receive adequate sedation;&#xD;
      short-acting paralytic agent to prevent coughing during the procedure Will be considered if&#xD;
      necessary. The endotracheal tube will be ≥ 1.5 mm larger than the external diameter of the&#xD;
      flexible bronchoscope. The patients will receive a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of&#xD;
      100%, and positive-end expiratory pressure will be reduced as much as tolerated. To maximize&#xD;
      ventilation and minimize air trapping, the peak inspiratory flow will be decreased to ≤60&#xD;
      liters/min, the respiratory rate set between 10 and 20 breaths/ min, and the peak inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure alarm increased. The patient will be carefully monitored throughout the procedure.&#xD;
      The sampling area will be chosen based on the location of the infiltrate on chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the samples were subjected to Gram staining and microscopic examination and were cultured&#xD;
      on sheep blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar semi quantitatively and 104/ml CFU was&#xD;
      considered significant. Isolated strains were identified by standard microbiological&#xD;
      techniques and the antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed by disc diffusion&#xD;
      method as per CLSI guidelines. The Gram negative bacilli were tested against the following&#xD;
      antibiotics:amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin,&#xD;
      cefaperazone-sulbactam, meropenem ,imipenem, netilimicin, Piperacillin-tazobactum.&#xD;
      Additionally colistin and ertapenem will be tested when appropriate. Gram positive organisms&#xD;
      will be tested for amikacin, netilmicin, cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime,&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin,cefoperazone-sulbactam, penicillin, linezolid, erythromycin, vancomycin and&#xD;
      teicoplanin&#xD;
