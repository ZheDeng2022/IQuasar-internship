  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Microtable® Microstereotactic Frame and Drill Press and Associated Method for Cochlear&#xD;
      Implantation consists of a patient-customized microstereotactic frame which targets the&#xD;
      cochlea. The intended use of the device in this early feasibility study is to surgically&#xD;
      access the cochlea, allowing placement of an intra-cochlear electrode array for cochlear&#xD;
      implantation, thereby providing a less invasive surgical option than currently performed.&#xD;
      Compared to traditional cochlear implantation (CI) surgery, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the minimally invasive, image-guided approach may offer the following benefits: (1)&#xD;
      shorter procedure time including shorter general anesthesia time, (2) less tissue removal&#xD;
      potentially eliminating post-operative mastoid bone depression, decreased post-operative&#xD;
      patient discomfort, and quicker wound healing, (3) better chance of preservation of taste&#xD;
      secondary to preservation of the chorda tympani nerve, and (4) standardization of electrode&#xD;
      placement potentially allowing more consistent placement within the scala tympani&#xD;
      sub-compartment of the cochlea which has been shown to be associated with improved&#xD;
      post-operative audiological performance. This early feasibility study will focus on the&#xD;
      advantages of the new technology to the patient. Advantages to the healthcare delivery system&#xD;
      will be examined during the pivotal study phase.&#xD;

      advantages of the new technology to the patient. Advantages to the healthcare delivery system&#xD;
      will be examined during the pivotal study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this early feasibility study to determine if minimally invasive&#xD;
      image-guided drilling to surgically access the cochlea for CI can be successfully performed.&#xD;
      The study will involve only unilateral CI. The decision of unilateral vs. bilateral&#xD;
      implantation is made clinically and before the patient may elect to enroll in this study.&#xD;
      Bilateral implantation can take place either simultaneously or sequentially, with the&#xD;
      decision made by the clinician as part of standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is scheduled for routine bilateral CI, the traditional approach will be used&#xD;
      on one side and the investigational approach on the other. Traditional surgery will be&#xD;
      performed on the better-hearing ear, and the investigational technique will be performed on&#xD;
      the poorer hearing ear. To minimize patient variability, the investigators will only be&#xD;
      studying lateral wall electrodes, the Cochlear slim straight electrode and MED-EL electrodes.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 12 cochlear implant patients in two groups. Group 1 will&#xD;
      consist of patients implanted under direct visualization afforded by lifting a tympanomeatal&#xD;
      flap, and Group 2 will consist of patients implanted with visualization afforded by passing&#xD;
      an endoscope across the eardrum via a myringotomy.&#xD;
