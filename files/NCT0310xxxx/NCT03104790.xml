      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to&#xD;
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in vaccine effectiveness(VE),&#xD;
      whether prior vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if&#xD;
      any) this might have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children&#xD;
      will be dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative&#xD;
      fitness of individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating&#xD;
      strains (ability to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing&#xD;
      specific immunity as a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or&#xD;
      IIV), and innate immune factors including mucosal immunity. Understanding the relative&#xD;
      importance of different factors over two seasons when the strain composition of the&#xD;
      A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV virus will change and by comparing previously unvaccinated and highly&#xD;
      vaccinated groups (with both LAIV and IIV), can potentially give unique insights into their&#xD;
      contribution to the US LAIV observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the change of the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain in 2017/18, demonstrating improved&#xD;
      performance (in terms of VE, virus shedding and immunogenicity) and what contribution prior&#xD;
      vaccination might make will be key evidence for both the UK, but also the US. Information&#xD;
      presented at the ACIP in June 2018 from the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons will be key to inform&#xD;
      US future decisions around use of LAIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a parallel group, non randomised study which will enrol at least 400 children. Both&#xD;
      written informed consent from parent/ guardian and written assent from the child will be in&#xD;
      place prior to any study procedure. The two groups will be defined by previous influenza&#xD;
      vaccination history, with around half the children naïve to any influenza vaccination (LAIV&#xD;
      or IIV) and half having had at least three doses of LAIV with or without IIV. All will follow&#xD;
      the same schedule of vaccination and oral fluid collection at day 0 (by the nurse in the home&#xD;
      or at the GP surgery); nasal swab collection (by the parent at home on days 1,3,6); day 21&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States of America (USA) has a long-standing paediatric influenza vaccination&#xD;
      programme, including use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Following evidence of&#xD;
      lack effectiveness of LAIV in 2015/16, the USA suspended use in the 2016/17 season. The UK&#xD;
      introduced LAIV for children in 2013/14 and has since been closely monitoring programme&#xD;
      performance. In 2015/16, the UK - in contrast to the USA - found evidence of significant&#xD;
      effectiveness of LAIV against laboratory confirmed influenza in both primary and secondary&#xD;
      care including against A/H1N1pdm09. The UK results concord with those from several other&#xD;
      geographical settings, although several studies report relatively lower effectiveness of LAIV&#xD;
      against A/H1N1pdm09 infection compared to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). The reasons&#xD;
      for these apparent differences in effectiveness are currently unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The USA has indicated that for the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practice (ACIP) to&#xD;
      rescind their decision to suspend use of LAIV, they will require an understanding of the&#xD;
      likely underlying mechanism for the apparent reduction in LAIV A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness (VE) measured in observational studies in the USA and then evidence that the&#xD;
      problem has been resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several hypotheses are emerging to explain the apparent reduction in A/H1N1pdm09 quadrivalent&#xD;
      LAIV effectiveness in the USA last season and their discordance with findings elsewhere&#xD;
      including the UK together with the possible lower effectiveness of LAIV against A/H1N1pdm09&#xD;
      compared to IIV. These include one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Center for Disease Control (CDC)/ Department of Defense (DoD) specific finding - related&#xD;
           to chance, methodology, programmatic issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduced replicative fitness of the current A/H1N1pdm09 strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Viral interference/competition between A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain and other vaccine&#xD;
           viruses in multivalent formulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior vaccination with LAIV or IIV resulting in specific immunological interference with&#xD;
           H1N1pdm09 vaccine virus replication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Repeat LAIV vaccination resulting in broader, longer term immunological changes&#xD;
           affecting all viruses (mimicking adult response);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Combinations of the above Based upon in vitro studies, the manufacturer of LAIV&#xD;
           (MedImmune) have stated that reduced replicative fitness of the A/H1N1pdm09 strain is&#xD;
           likely to be the important root cause. However, this factor alone cannot explain the&#xD;
           difference in effectiveness observed between the USA and sites elsewhere including the&#xD;
           UK. This suggests that there is an important additional factor(s) involved. The US&#xD;
           programme has been running for many more years than the UK - and in addition children 6&#xD;
           months to 24 months of age are offered IIV, unlike the UK. These prior vaccine exposures&#xD;
           are potential contributory factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to&#xD;
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in VE, whether prior&#xD;
      vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if any) this might&#xD;
      have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children will be&#xD;
      dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative fitness of&#xD;
      individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating strains (ability&#xD;
      to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing specific immunity as&#xD;
      a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or IIV), and innate&#xD;
      immune factors including mucosal immunity. Understanding the relative importance of different&#xD;
      factors over two seasons when the strain composition of the A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV virus will&#xD;
      change and by comparing previously unvaccinated and highly vaccinated groups (with both LAIV&#xD;
      and IIV), can potentially give unique insights into their contribution to the US LAIV&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the change of the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain in 2017/18, demonstrating improved&#xD;
      performance (in terms of VE, virus shedding and immunogenicity) and what contribution prior&#xD;

                  children under 20kg, a dose greater than 1mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  NB: LAIV is not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV&#xD;
                  infection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled/low-dose oral&#xD;
                  systemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement&#xD;

                  weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Any other significant condition or circumstance which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in&#xD;
                  the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability&#xD;
                  to participate in the study.&#xD;

                       basis. Where these are present, the CI is able to authorise participation on&#xD;
                       a case-by-case basis, after assessing the child at the time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Administration of another live vaccine (e.g. MMR) within the previous 4 weeks is no longer&#xD;
        a contra-indication to LAIV administration, according to updated UK Department of Health&#xD;
