  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both simple mastectomy and breast conservation therapy (BCT) with radiotherapy yield similar&#xD;
      survival rates in breast cancer. These two treatment strategies have diverted cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome and convenience. Thus, shared decision making (SDM) is necessary to aid patients to&#xD;
      choose an appropriate treatment that suits thier needs. We have developed a decision aids&#xD;
      (DAs) and plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its impact on&#xD;
      cancer patients. The measurements include a battery of interview-based questionnaires and&#xD;
      evaluations of decision regret and postsurgical depression. We expect the DAs would benefit&#xD;
      the intervention group in the aspects of knowledge, communication and anxiety status during&#xD;
      and after thier treatment sessions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women with early-stage breast cancer, both simple mastectomy and breast conservation&#xD;
      therapy (BCT) with radiotherapy yield similar survival rates, making psychological adjustment&#xD;
      and quality-of-life issues pivotal in treatment choice. Using decision aids (DAs) is one way&#xD;
      to provide information to patients and to involve them in making decisions about their&#xD;
      treatment. We have developed a DAs to be administered after consultation for Taiwanese women&#xD;
      deciding on breast surgery, and plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      evaluate the benefit of DAs on breast surgery decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision aids are interventions designed to help patients with early breast cancer to make&#xD;
      deliberate choices among treatment options by providing information on those options and any&#xD;
      potential outcome relevant to different breast cancer surgeries. Women considering breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery are randomly assigned to receive a DAs or the standard oral conversation&#xD;
      (control condition) after initial consultation, wherein surgeons disclosed the diagnosis and&#xD;
      discussed treatment options with patients. Participants complete interview-based&#xD;
      questionnaires 1 day before and 4 weeks after surgery. Primary outcome measures 1 day before&#xD;
      surgery are decisional conflict and decision-making difficulties after consultation.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are decision regret and postsurgical depression 1 month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DAs group are predicted to lower decisional conflict scores before surgery, and lower&#xD;
      decision regret scores and depression scores 1 month after surgery compared with women in the&#xD;
      control arm. Our study hopes to support the efficacy of DAs in helping breast cancer women to&#xD;
      arrive at their breast surgery decision.&#xD;
