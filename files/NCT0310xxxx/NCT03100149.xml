  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of intravenous prasinezumab (RO7046015/PRX002) versus placebo over 52 weeks in&#xD;
      participants with early Parkinson's Disease (PD) who are untreated or treated with monoamine&#xD;
      oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors since baseline. The study will consist of three parts: a&#xD;
      52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (Part 1) after which eligible&#xD;
      participants will continue into an all-participants-on-treatment blinded dose extension for&#xD;
      an additional 52 weeks (Part 2). Participants who complete Part 2 (including the 12-week&#xD;
      treatment-free follow up visit assessing long term safety and efficacy of RO7046015) will be&#xD;
      offered participation in Part 3 open-label extension&#xD;
      (all-participants-on-RO7046015-treatment) for an additional 260 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Total Score (Sum of Parts I, II, and III) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The MDS-UPDRS is a multimodal scale consisting of four parts. Part I assessed non-motor experiences of daily living and has 2 components (Range 0-52). Part IA contains 6 questions and are assessed by the examiner (Range 0-24). Part IB contains 7 questions on non-motor experiences of daily living which was completed by the participant (Range 0-28). Part II assessed motor experiences of daily living (Range 0-52). It contained 13 questions completed by the participant. Part III assessed the motor signs of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and was administered by the rater (Range 0-132). Part III contained 33 scores based on 18 items. For each question a numeric score is assigned between 0-4, where 0 = Normal, 1 = Slight, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe. The MDS-UPDRS Total Score equals the sum of Parts I,II, and III (Range: 0-236). A higher score indicated more severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Total Score (Sum of Parts I, II, and III) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The MDS-UPDRS is a multimodal scale consisting of four parts. Part I assessed non-motor experiences of daily living and has 2 components (Range 0-52). Part IA contains 6 questions and are assessed by the examiner (Range 0-24). Part IB contains 7 questions on non-motor experiences of daily living which was completed by the participant (Range 0-28). Part II assessed motor experiences of daily living (Range 0-52). It contained 13 questions completed by the participant. Part III assessed the motor signs of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and was administered by the rater (Range 0-132). Part III contained 33 scores based on 18 items. For each question a numeric score is assigned between 0-4, where 0 = Normal, 1 = Slight, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe. The MDS-UPDRS Total Score equals the sum of Parts I,II, and III (Range: 0-236). A higher score indicated more severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Total Score (Sum of Parts I, II, and III) at Week 52</title>
          <description>The MDS-UPDRS is a multimodal scale consisting of four parts. Part I assessed non-motor experiences of daily living and has 2 components (Range 0-52). Part IA contains 6 questions and are assessed by the examiner (Range 0-24). Part IB contains 7 questions on non-motor experiences of daily living which was completed by the participant (Range 0-28). Part II assessed motor experiences of daily living (Range 0-52). It contained 13 questions completed by the participant. Part III assessed the motor signs of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and was administered by the rater (Range 0-132). Part III contained 33 scores based on 18 items. For each question a numeric score is assigned between 0-4, where 0 = Normal, 1 = Slight, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe. The MDS-UPDRS Total Score equals the sum of Parts I,II, and III (Range: 0-236). A higher score indicated more severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dopamine Transporter Imaging With Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (DaT-SPECT) Striatal Binding Ratio (SBR) in the Putamen Ipsilateral to the Clinically Most Affected Side</title>
        <description>DaT-SPECT (dopamine transporter imaging with single photon emission computed tomography) is a dopamine transporter SPECT imaging that uses a radioactive agent called 123^I-ioflupane to quantify the density of the dopamine transporters in the striatum. Changes from baseline to week 52 in DaT-SPECT striatal binding ratios (SBRs; reference region: occipital cortex) in the putamen ipsilateral to the clinically most affected side were analyzed.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>The mITT population includes all participants randomized in the study who received any amount of study drug treatment and had no symptomatic PD treatment. The analysis included all assessments regardless of symptomatic treatment intake.</population>

        <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening that was developed to be more sensitive to participants presenting with mild cognitive complaints. It briefly assesses short term and working memory, visuospatial abilities, executive function, attention, concentration, language and orientation. Scores on the MoCA test range from 0-30. Higher scores are associated with better cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Score</title>
        <description>The PGIC was intended as a measure of change in health state from the participants perspective. PGIC scores ranged from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). For the PGIC, participants were divided into one of two groups, Responders or Progressors. Responders were scored on a scale of 1-4 which was rated as &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;minimally improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved.&quot; Progressors were scored on a scale of 5-7 which was rated as &quot;minimally worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot; The percentage of participants rated by PGIC Scale grouping at week 52 was analyzed using a logistic regression model.</description>
