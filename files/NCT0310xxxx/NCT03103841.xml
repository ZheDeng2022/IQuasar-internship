  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that affects around one in 20 children. In&#xD;
      children with OSA, repeated episodes of airway obstruction can severely disturb and fragment&#xD;
      sleep, leading to subsequent cognitive and behavioural problems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy affects 60,000 children in the UK and up to 30% of children with epilepsy have&#xD;
      learning problems. Evidence suggests that OSA is more common in children with epilepsy, such&#xD;
      that sleep disturbance could account for some of the learning problems they experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of OSA in children with epilepsy. The&#xD;
      investigators plan carry out detailed sleep studies in children with epilepsy and healthy&#xD;
      controls to determine if children with epilepsy are more likely to have OSA than healthy&#xD;
      children of the same age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA is almost always treatable and the benefits of detecting and treating the condition in&#xD;
      healthy children are well-established. If OSA proves to be a common finding in children with&#xD;
      epilepsy, it will be important to carry out further studies to see if treating the condition&#xD;
      has beneficial effects on learning and behaviour. This project could lead doctors to target&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing as a way of improving learning outcomes in children with epilepsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that affects around one in 20 children. In OSA,&#xD;
      the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse during sleep causing the upper&#xD;
      airway to become blocked. Breathing is briefly interrupted, blood oxygen levels fall and this&#xD;
      causes the child to wake and start breathing again. These episodes can happen many times a&#xD;
      night causing severely disturbed sleep. Untreated OSA may leave children with daytime&#xD;
      attention difficulties and problems with learning and behaviour. Epilepsy affects&#xD;
      approximately 60,000 children in the UK and up to 30 per cent of these children have&#xD;
      associated learning problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence, including pilot work undertaken by the study team to suggest that OSA is&#xD;
      more common in children with epilepsy, in which case, sleep disturbance could account for&#xD;
      some of the learning problems they experience. The aim of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of OSA in children with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to carry out detailed polysomnography sleep studies in 55 children&#xD;
      with epilepsy and 28 healthy children (controls). These studies will measure the length and&#xD;
      quality of sleep over one night spent at the hospital. Seizure activity during this period&#xD;
      will be monitored by video recordings combined with electroencephalograms (EEG).&#xD;
      Sleep-disordered will be assessed using a variety of tests to measure air-flow, lung&#xD;
      expansion and blood oxygen levels. This study should help to determine if children with&#xD;
      epilepsy are more likely to have OSA than healthy children of the same age. OSA is almost&#xD;
      always treatable and the benefits of detecting and treating the condition in healthy children&#xD;
      are well-established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If OSA proves to be a common finding in children with epilepsy, it will be important to carry&#xD;
      out further studies to see if treating the condition has beneficial effects on learning and&#xD;
      behaviour. This project could lead doctors to target sleep-disordered breathing as a way of&#xD;
      improving learning outcomes in children with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with epilepsy attending Royal Hospital for Children, Edinburgh will be invited to&#xD;
      take part in the study. Children without epilepsy (controls) will also be recruited. The&#xD;
      children without epilepsy are included because although there are statistics for incidence of&#xD;
      OSA in the general population, information for all the measures of sleep the team will&#xD;
      collect are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep architecture and respiratory events&#xD;
      in children with epilepsy and control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be sufficiently powered, it is planned to test 50 children with epilepsy and 25 healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sleep physiologist will work with participants to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polysomnography (to record body functions in sleep - airflow in and out of the lungs,&#xD;
           oxygen level in the blood, body position, breathing effort and rate, electrical activity&#xD;
           of muscles, eye movement and heart rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EEG or electroencephalography (to measure the electrical activity of the brain),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrooculography (to measure rapid eye movements along horizontal and vertical axes),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chin electromyogram (to measure electrical impulses to chin muscles),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurologist and physiologist will assess seizure frequency and discharges between seizures,&#xD;
      and epilepsy types using video EEG monitoring. Further information will be collected: height,&#xD;
      weight, body mass index, antiepileptic medication use, tonsillar size, Mallampati score (a&#xD;
      measure of base of tongue to hard palate), completion of sleep questionnaires by participants&#xD;
      and their parents, to include sleepiness scales and sleep quality index.&#xD;
