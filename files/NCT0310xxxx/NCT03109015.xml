  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a sunitinib administration schedule&#xD;
      2/1 (2 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week without) compared to a schedule 4/2 (4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment followed by 2 weeks without) on cardiopulmonary function in subjects with renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: 4/2 schedule of sunitinib&#xD;
      administration or 2/1 schedule of sunitinib administration. Cardiopulmonary function will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, week 4 (4/2 schedule only), week 5 (2/1 schedule only) and week 12. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that schedule 2/1 of sunitinib is not only better tolerated but&#xD;
      will be associated with less fatigue and functional cardiovascular/muscular toxicity than the&#xD;
      4/2 schedule.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Capacity will be assessed using Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) to determine VO2peak. Higher VO2 peak measured in mg/ml/min indicates better cardiac function. Mean change in cardiac functions will be assessed by the difference in Relative Peak VO2 from baseline to 12 weeks in both the arms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in upper and lower extremity maximal muscular strength as measured by the voluntary one-repetition max (1-RM) between week 12 and baseline.

    <description>Mean change in upper and lower extremity maximal muscular strength as measured by the muscular endurance which is 70% of 1-RM between week 12 and baseline. Muscular Endurance of the upper and lower body will be assessed as the number of repetitions to fatigue at 70% of the 1-RM.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-repetition Chair-Stand Test measures the time taken to complete 5 repetitions of the sit-to-stand maneuver performed on a chair. Standardized instructions are: &quot;By the count of 3, please stand up and sit down as quickly as possible for 5 times. Place your hands on your lap, and do not use them throughout the procedure. Lean your back against the chair's backrest at the end of every repetition.&quot; Note: Timing will start when the subject's back left the backrest and will be stopped once the back touched the backrest.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up and Go (TUG) test assesses a person's mobility. TUG measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Scores of 10 seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 - 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail, elderly, and disabled subjects, and greater than 20 seconds suggests that further examination is required.</description>
