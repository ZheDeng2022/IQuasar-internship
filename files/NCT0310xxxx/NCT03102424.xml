  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to demonstrate the use of &quot;Dragon Waves Resonant Home Care&quot;&#xD;
      Electronic Nerve Stimulator (DW1330) is associated with improvement of blood glucose control,&#xD;
      as measured by change of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The second study objectives are to&#xD;
      demonstrate that DW1330 is associated with the mechanism of glycemic control and inflammation&#xD;
      pathways. The study is also aimed to investigate the safety of DW1330.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (DW1330) to improve blood glucose control in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who meet inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to either of the 2 groups below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DW1330&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo (sham TENS delivering ineffective pulse wave)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the study treatments&#xD;
      in a double-blind fashion. All patients enrolled should perform 1 treatment within 1 hour&#xD;
      after dinner 5 days a week. The end of a 20 week treatment period, subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for an additional 2 weeks for safety follow-up. The time frame includes 2 weeks of screening,&#xD;
      20 weeks of treatment, and 2 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur every 2 or 4 weeks depending on the study phase. At randomization&#xD;
      visit study device will be dispensed at the site, during the treatment period visits, all&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AEs) as well as follow-up for all AEs that have not been resolved will be&#xD;
      recorded, changes to concomitant medications will be noted, vital signs will be taken, and&#xD;
      efficacy evaluations will be performed as well. Investigators, site staff, subjects, and the&#xD;
      study team will be blinded to the device assigned. The study includes collection of blood and&#xD;
      urine samples. The end-of-treatment visit and the last estimation of glycemic control will&#xD;
      occur at week 20 (visit 8) for all subjects. In addition, 2-week follow up will occur in&#xD;
      order to collect safety data after the device is returned. The final visit will be at week 22&#xD;
      (visit 9). Subjects will be encouraged to complete all planned visits regardless of their&#xD;
      adherence to study device administration.&#xD;
