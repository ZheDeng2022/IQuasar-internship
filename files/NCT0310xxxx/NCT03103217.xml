  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a time of significant adjustment and uncertainty. Anxiety is common among this&#xD;
      group and is associated with poor cognitive and physical outcomes for both the mother and&#xD;
      child. Few trials have been conducted to ascertain the effectiveness of brief psychological&#xD;
      interventions designed to alleviate general anxiety, labour and pregnancy specific anxiety&#xD;
      and promote well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to establish if a brief Cognitive Behavioural Therapy treatment is&#xD;
      effective in reducing general anxiety during pregnancy. The study will also explore whether&#xD;
      the treatment has an impact on reducing pregnancy specific and labour related anxiety and&#xD;
      reducing medical intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective matched cohort design with follow up. The treatment group will&#xD;
      consist of women who attend once to a one off 3 hour brief cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      treatment (CBT) session. Outcome measures will be completed at 3 time points, baseline, 2&#xD;
      weeks post intervention and 2 weeks' post partum (follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previously published dataset collected locally will be used as a control group. This&#xD;
      dataset includes 120 sets of data who have completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HADS) which will be the primary outcome measure for this study. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      dataset includes data on several key variables including age, current pregnancy information,&#xD;
      past pregnancy information, family and partner support available, medical support/input,&#xD;
      income, education, living circumstances and future plan. These will be matched at key&#xD;
      variables which are predictors of anxiety during pregnancy and might otherwise be expected to&#xD;
      influence scores on outcome variables and utilised as covariates. The outcome measures will&#xD;
      be completed at the same time points follow up, 2 months' post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a preexisting maternity care system, women are routinely offered a stress&#xD;
      reduction session by their community midwives. Those who wish to attend are routinely placed&#xD;
      on a database. For the purpose of this research, everyone who has been put forward for the&#xD;
      group will be sent a covering letter, personal Information sheet (PIS) and screening HADS by&#xD;
      the lead clinician (Mo Tabib - midwife). Participants who express an interest will be invited&#xD;
      to have a telephone consultation with the chief Investigator. During this telephone call,&#xD;
      eligibility will be discussed ad if appropriate telephone consent will be sought. Following&#xD;
      this, those who do not meet eligibility criteria will be invited to attend the session as&#xD;
      planned at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital and continue with their maternity care as usual.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be sent a pack of baseline measures as well as a consent form.&#xD;
      Participants will have the option of returning these in a pre paid envelope or deposit in a&#xD;
      confidential box at the session. Consent will also be sought for access to online medical&#xD;
      records and consent to contact participants following the group by phone/text/email as&#xD;
      reminder. Participants will be emailed two weeks following the session as a reminder to&#xD;
      complete second set of measures. Participants will identify three areas which they will&#xD;
      commit to practice following the session. The chief investigator will track their delivery&#xD;
      date using using an online care system; 2 months' post-partum they will receive a further&#xD;
      reminder text to complete final questionnaire set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chief researcher will seek informed, telephone consent initially, which can be withdrawn&#xD;
      at any time. Consent will be discussed with potential participants during a telephone&#xD;
      consultation following being sent the PIS and screening tool. If potential participants are&#xD;
      interested and eligible the chief researcher will send out a consent form by means of written&#xD;
      consent where participants will be offered choice of returning in post or deposit in a&#xD;
      confidential box at the session. It will be highlighted that participants can withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any point.&#xD;
