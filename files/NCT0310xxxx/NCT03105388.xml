  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of difficult laryngoscopy and difficult intubation are higher among patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Precision in making the diagnosis and predicting difficult&#xD;
      laryngoscopy preoperatively may help to reduce anesthetic complications. This study was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of combined and non-combined radiological&#xD;
      parameter (mandibulohyoid distance) and STOP-BANG questionnaire as screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-one subjects who were at risk of OSA, undergoing general anaesthesia will be included&#xD;
      using STOP-BANG questionnaire. Mandibulohyoid distance and other radiological parameters will&#xD;
      be measured from lateral cephalometry. Evaluation for difficult laryngoscopy will be carried&#xD;
      out during anaesthesia.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SAMPLING METHODS All patients at risk of OSA who come for elective surgery and fulfilled the&#xD;
      selection criteria are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT OF SUBJECT AND INFORMED CONSENT SEEKING All patients who come for elective&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia and at risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea will be screened&#xD;
      using STOP-BANG questionnaires .Those that fulfilling the selection criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consents were obtained one day before the operation day. Sleep study not&#xD;
      part of the objective of this study. Consent will be taken one day before the operation day.&#xD;
      Patients will receive explanation about the objectives of the study, one lateral head and&#xD;
      neck x-ray will be taken one day before operation, while other procedures will match the&#xD;
      standard procedure. Normal laryngoscopy will be done to assess their airway using the Cormack&#xD;
      Lehance scoring, then they will be intubated using videolaryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AREA Operation theater of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFLICT OF INTEREST This study is done for the benefit of patient. There is no conflict of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who come for elective surgery under general anesthesia and at risk of&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea will be screened using STOP-BANG questionnaires .Those who are&#xD;
      fulfilling the selection criteria will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consents were obtained one day before the operation day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's medical information will be kept confidential by the study doctor and staff&#xD;
           and will not be made publicly available unless disclosure is required by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data obtained from this study that does not identify patient individually will be&#xD;
           published for knowledge purposes. Patient's original medical records may be reviewed by&#xD;
           the researcher, the Ethical Review Board for this study and regulatory authorities for&#xD;
           the purpose of verifying clinical trial procedures and/or data. Patient's medical&#xD;
           information may be held and processed on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROPOSED DATA ANALYSIS Group A for whom the intubation is easy, is limited to the patients&#xD;
      with a Cormack Lehance grade of 1 and 2 ( the glottis is immediately visible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B for whom the intubation is difficult would comprise of patients given a Cormack&#xD;
      Lehance grade of 3 and grade 4( poor visibility of the glottis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the values are shown as mean +/- SDs and as percentages. Independent sample t-test ,&#xD;
      cross-tabulation and chi square test are used for comparing the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P values &lt;0.05 are considered significant. A comprehensive evaluation is done by binary&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis and a multivariate test to see the effects of each independent&#xD;
      variable on the dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL Human ethical approval was obtained from HUSM's ethics committee to do the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      41 ASA class I and II (normal healthy patient or mild systemic disease) requiring general&#xD;
      anesthesia, with age range between 18 year old to 75 year old will be recruited.&#xD;
      Preoperatively, each patient will be interviewed by a research resident who completed the&#xD;
      first study questionnaire regarding the diagnosis of OSA, based on self- report by the&#xD;
      patient. For patients not previously tested/ diagnosed for OSA, the STOP-BANG questionnaire&#xD;
      will be used to determine a STOP-BANG score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the STOP questionnaire 4 will be used to construct the STOP score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Snore is considered affirmative if the participant reported snoring loudly (louder than&#xD;
           talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tiredness/sleepy during the day is affirmative if the participant reported yes to&#xD;
           feeling unrested during the day no matter how many hours of sleep he/she had (often and&#xD;
           almost always = yes; never, rarely, and sometimes = no) and reported feeling tired (all&#xD;
           of the time, most of the time, a good bit of the time = yes, and some of the time, a&#xD;
           little bit of the time, and none of the time = no).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observed stop breathing is defined as yes if participant answered affirmative to the&#xD;
           question &quot;based on what the participant have noticed or household members have told&#xD;
           them, are there times when they stop breathing during their sleep?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Pressure is defined as positive if the participant answered yes to being treated&#xD;
           with medication for high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BANG portion will be evaluated by assessing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (over 50 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck circumference (neck circumference &gt; 40 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender (male).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One point was assigned for each affirmative answer; 0 for no answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A STOP-BANG score of ≥ 3 affirmative is chosen for this study, as this score had a very high&#xD;
      sensitivity and negative predictive value for moderate/severe OSA, and had been suggested as&#xD;
      a good cutoff value for high OSA prevalence among surgical populations such as bariatric&#xD;
      patients (Chung et al 2012.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators exclude pregnant patients, those who were not fasted for at least 6 hours&#xD;
      prior to anesthesia, and those with GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's age, gender, ASA status, height, weight, BMI, Thyromental distance, and neck&#xD;
      circumference are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be made to sit up and stick out their tongue as far as they could, in order&#xD;
      to observe the internal structure of the pharynx under lighting. The findings can be&#xD;
      classified using the Mallampati scoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mallampati et al. classified the pharyngeal structure into 3 types, but Samsoon and Young&#xD;
      created a Modified Mallampati Test that divides the structure into 4 types .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class 1 is when the soft palate, the fauces, the uvula and the anterior and posterior&#xD;
           tonsillar pillars are visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class II is where all the class I structures are visible except for the tonsillar&#xD;
           pillars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class III is where only the base of the uvula is visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Class IV is where the uvula cannot be seen and only the soft palate is visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical assessment, Lateral Cephalometry (lateral head and neck x-ray) will be taken&#xD;
      in a neutral head position in radiological department. Mandibular-hyoid distance will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be well fasted overnight before the operation. No premedication with sedative&#xD;
      effects will be given on the operation day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring include: ECG, non-invasive automatic blood pressure monitoring, pulse&#xD;
      oximeter. The blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be performed by a skilled anesthesiologist who is not the investigator for&#xD;
      this study, and do not know the cephalometric measurement of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-oxygenation will be using 100% oxygen 5 L/ min for 2-3 min given a by a mask and this was&#xD;
      inspired by voluntary respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Fentanyl 1.5-2mcg per kg and IV Propofol 1-2mg per kg, will be administrated in titration.&#xD;
      After loss of consciousness, 0.9 mg/kg IV Rocuronium ( a muscle relaxant) will be given. When&#xD;
      the state of muscle relaxation is observed, guided by TOF nerve stimulator, the head will be&#xD;
      placed in the sniffing position to facilitate intubation. Then a size 3 curved laryngoscopy&#xD;
      will be use to maximize exposure of the glottis, and without pressing the thyroid cartilage,&#xD;
      the airway will be evaluated and graded following Cormack and Lehance grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cormack Lehane proposed grading the laryngoscopic view from grade I to grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade I is when the epiglottis and vocal cords are completely exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade II is when only rear of the vocal cords can be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade III is when only the epiglottis is exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade IV is when only the soft palate can be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently patient will be intubated using videolaryngoscope and with appropriate ETT size.&#xD;
      In standard practice , all patients will be intubated using conventional laryngoscopy, but in&#xD;
      our study , they will be intubated using videolaryngoscope which is a device to assist in&#xD;
      difficult intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intubation, mechanical ventilation will be performed with oxygen at 2L/min , with the&#xD;
      tidal volume 8ml/kg and the tidal rate 12 bpm. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      inhalational agent Sevoflurane at the MAC of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, all patients will be reversed using Suggammadex (a specific antidote for&#xD;
      Rocuronium) or standard reversal drugs mixture (1 mg atropine and 2.5 mg neogstigmine), this&#xD;
      was according to standard practice.&#xD;
