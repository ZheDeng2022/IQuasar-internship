    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I/IIa study is to assess the safety and tolerability profile of&#xD;
      TR399 in healthy volunteers and erectile dysfunction patients. This study will be conducted&#xD;
      via a single-arm and open-label fashion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several oral medications containing PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil (Viagra®, Pfizer),&#xD;
      vardenafil (Levitra®, Bayer) and tadalafil (Cialis®, Lilly), have been marketed for the&#xD;
      treatment of ED. Many considerations should be taken before patients are prescribed with PDE5&#xD;
      inhibitor medications, which may cause systemic side effects and should not be taken with&#xD;
      nitrates or alpha-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of TR399 is 5% Vardenafil HCl·3H2O. Non-clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that the topical use of TR399 can enhance erection and sexual behavior in&#xD;
      animal models without causing irritancy and phototoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a single-arm and open-label fashion in order to explore the safety&#xD;
      and PK of TR399 in healthy volunteers, as well as the safety, PK and efficacy of TR399 in&#xD;
      patients with ED.&#xD;
