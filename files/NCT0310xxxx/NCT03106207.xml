  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high success rates of gastric bypass in the short and long terms, little is known&#xD;
      about possible anatomopathological changes that can occur in these patients. The objective is&#xD;
      to investigate preoperative and postoperative endoscopic changes in patients undergoing&#xD;
      gastric bypass without a ring. Thirty obese patients from different regions of the country&#xD;
      with the surgical indication for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass will be studied prospectively.&#xD;
      All patients will be submitted to upper gastric endoscopy (UGE) two, six and 12 months after&#xD;
      the surgical procedure at the Kaiser Clinic. This study will identify whether there are&#xD;
      endoscopic changes within one year after the surgery and what they are. Changes, if they&#xD;
      exist, will be correlated with clinical data, in order to make an accurate prognosis of the&#xD;
      patient, thereby contributing to the outcomes of future patients submitted to this type of&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with severe or morbid obesity often fail to lose weight in the long term. Gastric&#xD;
      bypass is considered the gold standard in the surgical treatment of obesity. Despite the high&#xD;
      success rates of gastric bypass in the short and long terms, little is known about possible&#xD;
      anatomopathological changes that can occur in these patients. UGE has been used on a wide&#xD;
      scale in complementary evaluations of patients submitted to bariatric surgery. However, there&#xD;
      is still no consensus on the use of imaging tests such as UGE in the follow-up of these&#xD;
      patients after surgery. Considering the importance of gastric bypass in the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity, knowledge about possible preoperative and postoperative GI alterations identified by&#xD;
      endoscopy in these patients may contribute to the establishment of correlations with&#xD;
      symptomatology and with the success rate of this technique during follow-ups of up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization and infrastructure: This study is organized based on a single location: the&#xD;
      Kaiser Clinic and Day Hospital. This center is renowned for the treatment of diseases in the&#xD;
      areas of Gastroenterology, Proctology and General Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General: Demographic, clinical, nutritional, operative and endoscopic data will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific: The objective of this research will be to investigate preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative endoscopic changes in patients undergoing gastric bypass without a ring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: Thirty obese patients from different regions of the country with&#xD;
      surgical indication for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass will be studied prospectively. Patients&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate and, on agreeing, they will&#xD;
      sign Informed Consent Forms. The procedures will be performed only after patients give their&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of the patients Clinical history: Patients will be questioned about the&#xD;
      frequency and intensity of their symptoms. Commonly used medications will be noted as well as&#xD;
      drugs used for symptomatic relief (number of tablets). Any urgent/emergency events (such as&#xD;
      emergency room visits and/or hospital admission) will be investigated. Other clinical events&#xD;
      will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination:A physical examination (general and gastroenterological) will be&#xD;
      performed routinely in all patients participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures in the pre- and post-procedure phases: Patients will be submitted to a UGE before&#xD;
      the gastric bypass surgery without a ring. All changes related to the esophageal body, distal&#xD;
      esophagus and stomach will be analyzed. Biopsies will be performed of the distal esophagus&#xD;
      (two fragments 4 cm above the esophagogastric transition), gastric body (anterior and&#xD;
      posterior walls), incisura angularis and gastric antrum (large and small pre-pyloric&#xD;
      curvature). Furthermore, biopsies will be performed of any lesions detected in the esophagus&#xD;
      or stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be submitted to UGE two, six and 12 months after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      The following will be performed in postoperative endoscopies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- The mucosa of the esophageal body will be studied, biopsies of the distal esophagus (two&#xD;
      fragments) and small curvature (two fragments) will be performed and the gastric pouch width&#xD;
      and anteroposterior diameter and length of the small curvature will be evaluated; 2 - the&#xD;
      shape of the gastrojejunal anastomosis will be evaluated and the maximum diameter will be&#xD;
      measured and 3 - the jejunal loops will be studied in relation to mucosal changes and&#xD;
      afferent loop size and angulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exams will be performed at the Kaiser Clinic after patients have fasted for at least&#xD;
      eight hours and signed an informed consent form for the UGE. With the patient in left lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position, 10% xylocaine spray will be instilled followed by 50 mcg fentanyl EV and&#xD;
      5 mg midazolam EV. After sedation, an Olympus CV 180 endoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) will&#xD;
      be introduced orally. The images obtained will be transferred to a Olympus EVIS EXERA II&#xD;
      processor connected to a computer unit with the ZScan 5 program (Zscan Software Ltda,&#xD;
      Goi√¢nia, Brazil). When the patient regains his level of consciousness, he will be released in&#xD;
      the company of a responsible adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative clinical evaluation: After hospital discharge, all patients should return for&#xD;
      outpatient follow-ups including a clinical evaluation and endoscopy exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical visits will be scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - 2 months; Visit 2 - 6 months; Visit 3 - 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical complications / adverse events / clinical outcomes: For all patients, any possible&#xD;
      clinical complication will be promptly checked by the principal investigator.&#xD;
