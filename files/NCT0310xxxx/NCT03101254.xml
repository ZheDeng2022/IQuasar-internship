  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for advanced melanoma that was found to have a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K genetic mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY3022855&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vemurafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cobimetinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY3022855 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved vemurafenib and cobimetinib as treatment options for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LY3022855 is a colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor. It is a human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in the laboratory that&#xD;
      can locate and bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells. By binding to the tumor&#xD;
      cells, the antibody might prevent the tumor cell from growing and spreading. LY3022855 is&#xD;
      being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vemurafenib and cobimetinib attack different proteins that promote the growth of cancerous&#xD;
      cells. Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that works by blocking altered BRAF proteins from&#xD;
      stimulating the growth of melanoma cancer cells. Cobimetinib works by blocking a protein&#xD;
      called MEK that has been known to promote melanoma growth. In order to participate in the&#xD;
      study, participant's disease needs to be tested positive for a mutation (a permanent change&#xD;
      in the DNA sequence of a gene) of the BRAF gene that belongs to a class of genes known as&#xD;
      oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become&#xD;
      cancerous. Once the BRAF gene is mutated, the normal functioning of the BRAF protein may be&#xD;
      changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are combining LY3022855 with vemurafenib and&#xD;
      cobimetinib in the hopes that the LY3022855 will enhance how your cancer responds to&#xD;
      vemurafenib and cobimetinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase I portion: participants must have a histologically&#xD;
             confirmed melanoma with a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation (identified via NextGen&#xD;
             sequencing using the DFCI/BWH OncoPanel or any CLIA-certified method) that is&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase II portion: participants must have a histologically&#xD;
             confirmed melanoma with a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutation (identified via NextGen&#xD;
             sequencing using the DFCI/BWH OncoPanel or any CLIA-certified method) and cannot have&#xD;
             received prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolling to the phase I portion of the trial must have evaluable or&#xD;
             measurable disease (see Section 11 for definitions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolling to the phase II portion of the trial must have measurable&#xD;
             disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis&#xD;
             for nodal lesions) as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
             See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. As no dosing or adverse event data are currently available in&#xD;
             participants &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be&#xD;
             eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 1 (see APPENDIX A).&#xD;

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥ 100 K/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT-INR ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN (for participants on anticoagulation therapy, ≤ 1.5 ×&#xD;
             their baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  aPTT ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN (for participants on anticoagulation therapy, ≤ 1.5 ×&#xD;
             their baseline value)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a QTc of ≤ 470 msec on the screening EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of LY3022855 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4&#xD;
             months after completion of LY3022855 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have archival tumor tissue available. Participants without archival&#xD;
             tissue may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy, major surgery,&#xD;
             or another investigational agent within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin&#xD;
             C) prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered to ≤ CTCAE grade 1 or baseline from toxicity as a&#xD;
             result of previous cancer treatment prior to entering the study (with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia and peripheral neuropathy which can be ≤ grade 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to the phase II portion: participants who have received prior BRAF or&#xD;
             MEK inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have&#xD;
             been treated, are no longer taking corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging&#xD;
             for ≥ 4 weeks following the last date of treatment are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to LY3022855, vemurafenib, or cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LY3022855 is an anti-cancer agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with LY3022855, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with LY3022855. These potential risks may also apply to the other&#xD;
             agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known history of HIV are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with LY3022855, vemurafenib, and cobimetinib with&#xD;
             antiretroviral agents. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be&#xD;
             undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a personal or family history of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of a second primary malignancy. Exceptions include:&#xD;
             patients with a history of malignancies that were treated curatively and have not&#xD;
             recurred within 3 years prior to study entry; resected basal and squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas of the skin, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter&#xD;
             the absorption of vemurafenib and cobimetinib in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unable to swallow or retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants that require co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, as&#xD;
             these medications may alter vemurafenib and cobimetinib concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who require treatment with medications that are strong or moderate CYP3A&#xD;
             inducers, as these medications may alter the concentration of cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is&#xD;
             considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment/central serous&#xD;
             chorioretinopathy (CSCR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular&#xD;
             degeneration.&#xD;
