  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blind randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of the TurnCare Q2&#xD;
      System for the prevention of sacral region (sacral, coccygeal, and buttocks) pressure ulcers.&#xD;
      TurnCare Q2 System has 2 main components: 1. An Inflatable Skin Perfusion Enhancement Surface&#xD;
      and 2. An Adaptive Pressure Controller. The Skin Perfusion Enhancement Surface has a patented&#xD;
      design that accommodate human anatomy in the sacra region. The Adaptive Pressure Controller&#xD;
      is powered by APSAR technology that provides patient specific pressure relieve in the sacral&#xD;
      region.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, non-blinded randomized clinical trial. The study protocol and&#xD;
      the consent form were approved by the IRB at the study institution. Consecutive adult&#xD;
      patients admitted to the hospital with Braden Scale scores of 16 or less who did not meet&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were consented and enrolled in the study. All in-patients were either&#xD;
      scheduled admissions or were admitted through the emergency department. Upon admission, risk&#xD;
      assessments for pressure ulcers and total body surveys were performed by the hospital staff.&#xD;
      A Braden Scale score was determined for each patient by the hospital staff according to&#xD;
      standard hospital protocol. Both the control group and the treatment group patients received&#xD;
      standard care for pressure ulcer prevention according to hospital protocols, policies and&#xD;
      guidelines. Standard pressure ulcer prevention measures for this facility include a&#xD;
      methodology referred to as a &quot;S.K.I.N.&quot; Bundle (S-surface selection, K-keep turning,&#xD;
      I-incontinence management, N-nutrition.) This successful pressure ulcer prevention initiative&#xD;
      was developed within the parent health organization and standardized throughout its 131&#xD;
      hospitals. In accordance with the S.K.I.N. Bundle, all patients admitted to the study&#xD;
      hospital were repositioned every two hours, provided incontinence care, and given aggressive&#xD;
      nutritional management as indicated. All care measures were documented in the hospital's&#xD;
      electronic medical record (EMR) system. After obtaining informed consents, patients in the&#xD;
      treatment group had the Q2 System placed on their beds and chairs. Perfusion enhancement&#xD;
      surfaces were placed directly on hospital beds under the fitted bed sheets and were secured&#xD;
      to bed frames with disposable Velcro straps. A disposable &quot;chux&quot; pad and lifter sheet were&#xD;
      placed on top of the fitted sheets as is standard in most hospital settings. Adaptive&#xD;
      pressure controllers were secured to bed footboards or attached to bases of IV poles.&#xD;
      Specific settings for each patient were entered into the controllers. The controller settings&#xD;
      entered included patient body weight and bed position (degrees of incline). The bed position&#xD;
      included a bed setting (30 degrees incline) and a chair setting (90 degrees incline). When&#xD;
      applicable, a second perfusion enhancement surface was placed on a hospital chair so that the&#xD;
      Q2 solution could be utilized in a &quot;sitting mode&quot; while patients were sitting in hospital&#xD;
      chairs. The Q2 Systems remained in continuous operation during the trial period. Patient skin&#xD;
      did not contact any part of the Q2 system directly at any time.&#xD;
