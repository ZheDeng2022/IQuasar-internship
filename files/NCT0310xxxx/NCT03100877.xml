    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of melphalan and total marrow&#xD;
      irradiation and how well they work with autologous stem cell transplantation in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-risk multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Total marrow irradiation is&#xD;
      a type of radiation therapy and a form of total body irradiation that may deliver focused&#xD;
      radiation to the major marrow sites where cancer cells reside. Giving chemotherapy and&#xD;
      total-body irradiation before a peripheral autologous blood stem cell transplant helps kill&#xD;
      any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for&#xD;
      new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from&#xD;
      the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow&#xD;
      for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the&#xD;
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan and&#xD;
      fractionated total marrow irradiation (TMI) as conditioning regimen for autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT) in patients with high-risk or treatment-insensitive multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM). (Phase I) II. Evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing&#xD;
      adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing complication&#xD;
      including: infection, delayed engraftment and secondary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess complete response (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD) rates at 100 days&#xD;
      post ASCT in a phase II expanded cohort of patients treated at the MTD. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the predictive value of high risk features inclusive of fluorescent in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), International Staging System (ISS) stage,&#xD;
      gene expression profiling (GEP) for CR and minimal residual disease (MRD) for relapse free&#xD;
      survival/progression free survival/overall survival (RFS/PFS/OS) after melphalan TMI&#xD;
      (mel/TMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess MRD by positron emission tomography (PET), next generation sequencing (NGS),&#xD;
      and flow cytometry after mel/TMI, prior to maintenance and correlation with PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess in a descriptive fashion PFS and OS following mel/TMI and ASCT. IV. Evaluate&#xD;
      changes in fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) PET pre and post TMI/melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assessment of bone marrow residual damage. II. Assessment of immune recovery dynamics.&#xD;
      III. To conduct genetic profiling of myeloma cells. IV. Multimodal imaging for non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of treatment effect on bone and marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan and TMI followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOBILIZATION AND APHERESIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2&#xD;
      hours. Beginning 24 hours after cyclophosphamide administration, patients receive filgrastim&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) or IV. Patients also undergo apheresis over 4 hours on day 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive palifermin IV on days -8, to -6, undergo TMI on days&#xD;
      -5 to -2, and receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -1. Patients then undergo ASCT IV&#xD;
      on day 0, receive palifermin IV on days 1-3, and receive filgrastim SC or IV on day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 30 days after ASCT, patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO)&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
