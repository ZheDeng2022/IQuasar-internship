      1.0 BACKGROUND 1.1) Biliary duct injuries are a relatively frequent complications of&#xD;
      hepatobiliary surgery, most commonly laparoscopic cholecystectomy1. Such injuries can&#xD;
      manifest clinically in a number of ways including biliary leakage, biliary stricture&#xD;
      formation, or associated infectious complications. Biliary leakage is the most common of&#xD;
      these postoperative complications and is estimated to be clinically significant in 0.8 to&#xD;
      1.1% of such surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the development of more sophisticated endoscopic interventions, repeat surgery was&#xD;
      often necessary for management of biliary leaks. However, advances in technique and&#xD;
      technology in gastrointestinal endoscopy have largely replaced surgery as a first line&#xD;
      intervention for biliary leaks. The generally accepted goal in the endoscopic management of&#xD;
      biliary leaks is to equalize the pressure between the biliary system and the duodenum, so as&#xD;
      to allow bile to flow into the lower pressure small bowel and thereby affording the leak time&#xD;
      to close.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to best achieve this goal has been a topic of considerable interest. Randomized studies&#xD;
      have shown that endoscopic plastic biliary stent placement alone is highly efficacious and&#xD;
      equivalent to biliary stent placement with endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy. Thin (7&#xD;
      French[Fr]) and wide (10 French) diameter stents seem to have similar efficacy with regards&#xD;
      to leak resolution. Beyond these well-validated techniques, there are other variations in&#xD;
      clinical practice that are not supported by high-levels of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2) One area of variation is in whether the biliary stent should cross the papilla (with a&#xD;
      shorter stent) versus the site of the leak (with a longer stent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether placing a biliary stent across the leak versus across the papilla alone&#xD;
      improves the treatment of biliary leaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. All patients undergoing&#xD;
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the treatment of bile leaks will be&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion (see section and initial collection form). During the ERCP if&#xD;
      cholangiogram demonstrates a leak, the patient will be randomized to either A) papillary&#xD;
      stenting strategy or B) crossing the leak site strategy. Please see the diagram below to&#xD;
      complement the written description of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) In the papillary stenting strategy, regardless of where the leak is identified, a stent is&#xD;
      placed into the duodenal papilla and into the most distal (proximal to duodenum) portion of&#xD;
      the bile duct. The goal of this strategy is to use the stent to keep the papilla open,&#xD;
      thereby decreasing the pressure gradient and allowing for bile to flow preferentially into&#xD;
      the duodenum away from the leaking area. All stents in this strategy will be 7 Fr in diameter&#xD;
      and 5 cm long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) In the crossing the leak strategy (left), once the area of bile leakage is identified in&#xD;
      the biliary tree, a stent will be placed endoscopically across the leaking area. This&#xD;
      theoretically allows the underlying injured bile duct tissue to heal. The same diameter stent&#xD;
      (7Fr) as the papillary stenting strategy will be used but the length will vary in order to&#xD;
      bridge the leaking region (5-15cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision whether or not to perform sphincterotomy will be entirely determined by the&#xD;
      attending endoscopist and not part of the study. The 7Fr stents we are using may be easily&#xD;
      placed whether or not a sphincterotomy is performed. It will be recorded whether or not a&#xD;
      sphincterotomy was performed. All procedures evaluated in this study are done as part of&#xD;
      standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial ERCP intervention, the patients will receive routine post-procedural&#xD;
      care. They will have serial monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be a successful resolution of bile leak with the ERCP strategy. This&#xD;
      will require will require 2 criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. No further leakage of bile on the follow up ERCP at 5 weeks. Resolution is confirmed by&#xD;
      the demonstration of no leaking of contrast from the prior leakage site on cholangiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. No ERCP or other procedure has to be done between the initial ERCP and the 5 week ERCP to&#xD;
      treat the bile leak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients in each randomized arm with the resolution of bile leak at 5 weeks&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be several secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Time from ERCP to removal of surgical drain (days) B. Time from ERCP to complete cessation&#xD;
      of output from drain (days) C. Presence of other significant findings on the 5th week&#xD;
      cholangiogram. These include bile duct stone or biliary stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Requirement of surgery to treat the bile leak. E. Endoscopic complications of the 1st and&#xD;
      2nd ERCP including pancreatitis, bleeding perforation, cholangitis, and stent occlusion&#xD;
      within 5 weeks of initial or 2nd ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either the papillary stenting strategy group&#xD;
      or crossing the leak stenting strategy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichotomous outcomes including primary outcome (successful resolution of the bile leakage)&#xD;
      will be compared using a Fischer's exact or chi squared test. Continuous baseline&#xD;
      charactersistics or outcomes will be compared using a Wilcoxan rank sum test or T test&#xD;
      depending on distribution. If imbalances occur, logistic regression models will be developed&#xD;
      to control for these imbalances as covariates in the primary outcome model. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes involving time to clinical improvement in the arms will be compared using Cox&#xD;
      Regression analysis, allowing for the inclusion of covariates depending on degree of balance&#xD;
      of baseline characteristics. Analyses will be performed using SPSS v.23 and SAS v9; two-sided&#xD;
      p = 0.05 will be used for primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a retrospective query of the 32 consecutive previous cases of bile leaks managed at&#xD;
      the Los Angeles County hospital using stents which did or did not bridge the leak we used&#xD;
      G*Power to estimate that a total sample size of 88 will be adequate (2 sided alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      and beta of 0.2) to detect an 20% difference (80 vs 99%) in successful resolution of bile&#xD;
      leak in the two groups. Based on data from the past 1 year at Los Angles County hospital it&#xD;
      was estimated that there would be a 5% 5-week attrition thus the sample size was determined&#xD;
      to be 92 patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing ERCP for the treatment of suspected acute bile leaks will be&#xD;
             eligible for inclusion (bile leaks felt to be complications of surgical intervention).&#xD;
             A patient is suspected to have an acute bile leak if the patient is referred within&#xD;
             two weeks following the original surgery.. Legally authorized representatives may&#xD;
             serve as surrogates to consent for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bile leaks are suspected based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) Persistent, significant drainage of bilious fluid from post-surgical drains following&#xD;
        hepatobiliary surgery or cholecystectomy,.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) Compatible symptoms plus imaging findings on abdominal ultrasonography, computed&#xD;
        tomography, HIDA scanning, or MRCP of an abnormal intra-abdominal fluid collection in the&#xD;
        setting of recent hepatobiliary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bile duct transection (in which the duct has been totally severed into 2&#xD;
             parts) will be excluded as these are known to not be amenable to endoscopic therapy.&#xD;
             Further, suspected bile leaks of non-surgical etiology will be excluded from the study&#xD;
             (malignancy, trauma, spontaneous perforation, and other rarer causes). Bile leaks&#xD;
             suspected two weeks post surgery will also not be included. Additionally patients who&#xD;
             are pregnant, imprisoned, under age 18, unable to give informed consent, or have&#xD;
             undergone prior biliary diversion surgery will be excluded.&#xD;
