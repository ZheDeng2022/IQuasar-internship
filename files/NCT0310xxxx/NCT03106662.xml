      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in the treatment and prevention of graft-versus&#xD;
      host disease (GVHD). In this study the investigators aim to present the efficacy of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells in graft versus host disease prophylaxis and effect of engraftment in&#xD;
      haploidentical recipients. Forty patients aged older than 18 who have indications for&#xD;
      haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be included to the study. MSCs&#xD;
      will be isolated from donor bone marrows and infused to the patient after conditioning&#xD;
      regimen on day +6. If the haploidentical transplantation results improve with MSCs treatment&#xD;
      it would be possible to ameliorate the problem of HLA-matched donor paucity in Turkey and&#xD;
      prefer haploidentical donors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been utilized in the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (alloSCT). However, studies on MSC use in alloSCT from haploidentical donors (haploSCT) have&#xD;
      been limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim 1) to evaluate MSCs' efficacy in GVHD prophylaxis and&#xD;
      effect on engraftment of the haploidentical graft, 2) to improve the success rate of haploSCT&#xD;
      by further decreasing GVHD incidence and graft failure rate. With higher haploSCT success&#xD;
      rates, haploidentical donors would be important alternative graft sources in patients without&#xD;
      HLA-matched donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients who present to Ankara University, School of Medicine, Division of Hematology&#xD;
      with hematological malignancies and have indications for haploSCT will be included in the&#xD;
      study after informed consent is obtained. MSCs will be procured and isolated from donor bone&#xD;
      marrows. MSCs will be isolated, cultured, and stored in the good manufacturing practice (GMP)&#xD;
      laboratory in Ankara University Stem Cell Institute. Donor bone marrow will be harvested,&#xD;
      four to six weeks prior to transplantation, for MSC isolation and culture. Patients will&#xD;
      receive either an ablative or non-ablative induction regimen based on their age, diagnosis,&#xD;
      and the disease status at the time of transplantation. Donor bone marrow will be harvested a&#xD;
      second time on the day of transplantation and the procured bone marrow graft will be infused&#xD;
      to the patient the same day. GVHD prophylaxis will include post-transplantation&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (Cy) on days +3 and +4 (50 mg/kg/day), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil. Stored MSCs will be infused to the patient on day +6. The endpoints include graft&#xD;
      failure rate, GVHD incidence, transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, and&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the utility of MSCs in improving haploSCT results and to&#xD;
      enhance the reliability and success of haploSCT. Successful transplants from haploidentical&#xD;
      donors would ameliorate the problem of matched donor paucity in countries with a limited&#xD;
      number of hematopoietic stem cell donors, such as Turkey, and would establish haploidentical&#xD;
      donors an alternative donor source for patients without matched donors in Turkey. As&#xD;
      haploidentical donors may be parents or children, rapid and easy access to donors would&#xD;
      decrease wait times for alloSCT. Moreover, national current account deficit may be reduced&#xD;
      through using grafts obtained from haploidentical donors residing in Turkey instead of grafts&#xD;
      from foreign stem cell/umbilical cord banks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators seek to develop clinical therapy applications in&#xD;
      concordant with the ambition of &quot;renewal and repair of human cells, tissues, and organs&#xD;
      through cellular therapy and cellular products&quot; that is included in the The Scientific and&#xD;
      Technological Research Council of Turkey 1003 Call for Projects.&#xD;
