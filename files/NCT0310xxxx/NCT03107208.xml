  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A frequent complication in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes is rebound hyperglycemia (blood glucose over 180 mg/dL) which increases the&#xD;
      risk of re-developing DKA and can lengthen the hospital stay. The investigators want to study&#xD;
      whether giving the long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus®) early in DKA management (versus&#xD;
      after complete resolution of the DKA) helps prevent rebound hyperglycemia and makes the&#xD;
      transition to insulin injections easier. Participants will also have the option to wear a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during the study to help us understand blood glucose control&#xD;
      during and after DKA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the incidence of T1D is increasing. A frequent complication in&#xD;
      DKA management that is associated with in-hospital mortality and longer hospital stay is&#xD;
      hyperglycemia; specifically rebound hyperglycemia (defined as a serum glucose greater than&#xD;
      180 mg/dL) within 12-24 hours after correction of the DKA. Rebound hyperglycemia increases&#xD;
      the patient's risk of re-developing DKA. Few adult studies suggest that giving the&#xD;
      long-acting insulin analog (glargine or Lantus®) early in the management of DKA (i.e. while&#xD;
      still receiving intravenous insulin) can reduce rebound hyperglycemia without an increased&#xD;
      risk of hypoglycemia and result in a smoother transition from intravenous insulin to&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin. This has not been well-studied in children to date. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether giving glargine early in DKA management in children&#xD;
      results in reduced rebound hyperglycemia without an increased risk in hypoglycemia. The&#xD;
      investigators will do this by randomizing participants in DKA to either receive glargine&#xD;
      early in the management of DKA (study group) or after resolution of DKA (control group); the&#xD;
      latter is currently standard-of-care. Additionally, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      systems have not been studied in a pediatric population with DKA. These devices measure blood&#xD;
      sugar levels every 5 minutes and provide a great deal of information about blood sugar&#xD;
      control patterns over many days. Not only will the use of CGM in this study provide&#xD;
      meaningful information regarding blood sugar patterns during DKA treatment, it will also&#xD;
      broaden the investigators knowledge of whether CGM is a feasible and accurate tool to use in&#xD;
      this setting.&#xD;
