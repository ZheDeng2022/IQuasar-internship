  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited studies have evaluated potential exposure to secondhand e-cigarette aerosol, an&#xD;
      indication of impact on indoor air quality. Also limited are the studies regarding direct&#xD;
      passive exposure of humans and most of these studies have limitations, such as the small&#xD;
      number of participants, the different methodology and devices used, or the fact that they are&#xD;
      laboratory studies, where exposure parameters differ significantly from the actual user's&#xD;
      habit and device. Therefore, TackSHS Project has foreseen an intervention study of cross-over&#xD;
      design in similar to real-life conditions that aims to assess the mediating effect of&#xD;
      e-cigarette battery output on pulmonary outcomes and indexes to provide a better&#xD;
      understanding of the extent to which passive exposure to aerosols produced by use of&#xD;
      e-cigarette impacts exhaled NO and exhaled breath condensate metabolites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a part of a larger research project (TackSHS) funded by the European Union's&#xD;
      Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement No 681040). The current study&#xD;
      main aim is to assess the impact of passive exposure to aerosols produced by use of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes on indexes of lung function (respiratory mechanics and exhaled biomarkers) among&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this objective, a laboratory based intervention study of cross-over design will be&#xD;
      conducted at the &quot;George D Behrakis RESEARCH LAB&quot; of the Hellenic Cancer Society.&#xD;
      Specifically, three trial arms will be performed (no exposure to e-cigarette aerosols (1) vs.&#xD;
      low e-cigarette aerosols exposure (2) vs. high e-cigarette aerosols exposure (3)) with each&#xD;
      subject participating in each of the three trial arms. Each trial arm is based around two&#xD;
      battery power outputs, one of the key factors related to the production of e-cigarette&#xD;
      aerosols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will be 40 participants. The participants will be randomized to a sequence&#xD;
      of exposures, and thus all the participants are requested to participate in all three&#xD;
      trial-arms. In total, 120 person-exposures will take place (3 trial-arms x 40 adults) during&#xD;
      the duration of this study, leading to 240 pre and post measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place within a community setting in Athens (Greece) among volunteers.&#xD;
      Two types of participants are requested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healthy non-smokers - to be exposed to e-cigarette aerosols (secondhand exposure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy e-cigarette users - to create the e-cigarette exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention for the arms 2 and 3 will be a 30-minute exposure to aerosols produced by use&#xD;
      of e-cigarette by an experienced user. The difference between arm 2 and 3 exposure would lie&#xD;
      in distinct opposition to electric current of the e-cigarette battery (resistance), in&#xD;
      particularly, low (arm 2) and high (arm 3) battery resistance will be used. Each volunteer&#xD;
      will be given appropriate information on exposure and health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements will be performed at each arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled CO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oscillometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled NO (FeNO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental measurements - PM1, PM2.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment to be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bedfont microsmokelyser&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sidepak TSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viasys, Vmax series body-box system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viasys, Jaeger Masterscreen IOS system: (heated pneumotach, resistance=0.05 kPa/(L/s) at&#xD;
           10 L/s), in line with ATS/ERS task force guidelines 2005 25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECO Medics, AG CLD 88 chemilluminescense, Spiroware 3.021&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Turbo-Deccs EBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thermoscientific Deepfreezer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures will take place within a standardized exposure chamber successfully used with&#xD;
      similar protocols for exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke from conventional cigarettes. The&#xD;
      chamber will allow to control for the environmental conditions of exposures and verify that&#xD;
      the measures changes in outcomes will be attributable solely to the trial-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals taking part, will be informed by the responsible physician, regarding the&#xD;
      study, the specific tests they are about to undergo, their procedure, clinical significance&#xD;
      and impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also provide answers to any possible questions, as well as information&#xD;
      regarding the following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of the information to be collected, including aims, methods and implications&#xD;
           of the research;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent to which personal data is used and accessed by various partners (it will be&#xD;
           made clear that all data pertaining to them is stored and handled in an anonymous manner&#xD;
           using encrypted - not personally identifiable- codes);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant's right to access personal data and/or study data; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant's right to withdraw from participation in the study, at any point,&#xD;
           without consequences and without obligation of explanation or justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual agrees to participate, the participant will have to confirm this by reading&#xD;
      the information sheets and providing consent to the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the medical tests included in this study, will be given to all participants&#xD;
      along with the corresponding diagnostic interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals participating in this study can freely access their own personal data, but it&#xD;
      will be made clear to the study participants that no research results from the project will&#xD;
      be returned to the subjects. However, data related to the entire project will be publicly&#xD;
      disseminated once it has been processed and protected. This will be accessed through the&#xD;
      project website or through publications related to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be made clear that the subjects are completely free to withdraw their records from&#xD;
      participation at any time. It will be made clear that the consent given by participants in&#xD;
      the project can be withdrawn at any time, without any explanation or justification. In this&#xD;
      case all data pertaining to the subjects in question will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the medical tests included in this study, will be given to all participants&#xD;
      along with the corresponding diagnostic interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals participating in this study can freely access their own personal data, but it&#xD;
      will be made clear to the study participants that no research results from the project will&#xD;
      be returned to the subjects. However, data related to the entire project will be publicly&#xD;
      disseminated once it has been processed and protected. This will be accessed through the&#xD;
      project website or through publications related to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be conducted by trained clinical researchers. Besides the information&#xD;
      about sociodemographic characteristics, data on smoking consumption and e-cigarette use and&#xD;
      other tobacco variables will be also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be saved in electronic format and protected by password. Only a selected number of&#xD;
      pre- designated members of the data collection team will have access to these laptops. Once&#xD;
      data collection is complete, all data will be uploaded to a single database and reliably and&#xD;
      completely deleted from the laptops. Selected personal data, including the names of&#xD;
      respondents, will be collected to enable quality assurance procedures and to allow&#xD;
      participants willing to withdraw from participation in the survey to have their records&#xD;
      deleted from the database. Once quality assurance procedures are complete (within 4 months of&#xD;
      the completion of data collection), names and other unique personal identifiers (such as full&#xD;
      address) will be reliably and completely deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be focused on identifying both a deterministic effect as also&#xD;
      investigation into a potential dose-response effect between lower vs. higher exposures to&#xD;
      e-cigarette aerosols. Once the complete dataset of all participants has been merged and&#xD;
      cleaned, the data will be analysed using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific analyses will allow us to investigate the associations between exposure to&#xD;
      e-cigarette emissions and&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. indexes of lung mechanics (impedance, resistance, reactance, resonant frequency,&#xD;
           frequency dependence of resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. exhaled biomarkers (exhaled NO levels and EBC levels of 8-isoprostane). The model will&#xD;
           also allow for adjustment of any potential confounding subject-level factors and will&#xD;
           provide estimates of within and between subject variance components and correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
