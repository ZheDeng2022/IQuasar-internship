      To demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of nocturnal ventilation with oxygen (HFT -&#xD;
      high-flow-therapy) for the treatment of CSA in patients with HFrEF compared to placebo&#xD;
      (patient will breathe ambient air via nasal cannula that is not connected to the&#xD;
      high-flow-device).&#xD;

      In chronic heart failure (CHF) patients sleep disordered breathing mainly comprises two&#xD;
      different entities: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes&#xD;
      respiration (CSA). Being a rare disease in the general population, CSA is found with a&#xD;
      prevalence of up to 40% in CHF patients.1 This rise in prevalence is instigated by&#xD;
      pathophysiological overlapses. CSA is precipitated by hyperventilation and a highly sensitive&#xD;
      hypocapnea-induced apneic threshold, whereby apnea is then initiated by small transient&#xD;
      reductions in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Underlying mechanisms are not fully&#xD;
      understood, yet. Despite neurohumoral derangement such as altered chemoreflex cascades&#xD;
      (enhanced &quot;loop gain&quot; and &quot;controller gain&quot;) and circulatory delay, pulmonary congestion is&#xD;
      thought to play a role in the evolution of CSA. Caused by reduced cardiac output and/or&#xD;
      impaired left ventricular filling pattern, a rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure&#xD;
      (PCWP) with resulting interstitial pulmonary edema is closely correlated to the occurrence of&#xD;
      CSA. Furthermore, acute increase in pulmonary congestion by overnight rostral fluid&#xD;
      displacement to the lungs was found to lower sleep pCO2 and predisposed to CSA. Furthermore,&#xD;
      decreased blood oxygen tension stimulates the discharge of peripheral chemoreceptors and&#xD;
      gives rise to hyperventilation pattern of CSA. Conversely, hyperventilation increases the&#xD;
      propensity for central apneas by reducing the CO2-reserve. Underlining the importance of&#xD;
      hypoxemic chemoreceptor stimulation in the development of CSA, previous studies exemplified&#xD;
      this as a pathophysiological key element in patient with pulmonary artery hypertension, where&#xD;
      hypocapnia, periodic breathing and CSA is highly prevalent despite normal capillary wedge&#xD;
      pressure values. Also in heart failure patients this seems to be important: several&#xD;
      interventional studies showed an at least partial suppression of CSR using oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High flow therapy is a technique that provides a range of flows of heated, humidified air to&#xD;
      patients requiring respiratory support, delivered through nasal cannula range The high flow&#xD;
      ventilation therapy with an air/oxygen mixture at a rate of 20-50 L/min via a nasal cannula&#xD;
      is able to provide adequate oxygen flow rates to completely avoid hypoxemias. An increase in&#xD;
      oxygen saturation is associated with a reduced chemosensitivity of the glomus caroticum. This&#xD;
      may further help to improve Cheyne-Stokes respiration severity. Previous studies could reach&#xD;
      a reduction of 50% of the AHI with the use of 2 L/min of oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time the high flow ventilation therapy can attenuate inspiratory resistance by&#xD;
      potentially delivering positive distending pressure for lung recruitment without providing&#xD;
      excessive intrathoracic pressure (only 3-6 cm H2O, according to manufacturer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      But on the other hand the hyperoxemic state was also found to have some unfavorable&#xD;
      consequences such as an increase in infarct size after myocardial infarction and should&#xD;
      therefore be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FLOAT-CS study is a proof-of-concept study that investigates nocturnal high flow&#xD;
      ventilation therapy with oxygen (oxygen-HFT) as a novel therapeutic approach for HFrEF&#xD;
      patients with CSA by attenuation of the hypoxemic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high flow ventilation therapy via a nasal cannula with 20-50 L/min of a mixture of&#xD;
      ambient air and oxygen is titrated to achieve a target oxygen flow that leads to normoxemia&#xD;
      defined as a transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 91% and 98%. This is expected to&#xD;
      completely avoid hypoxemias without providing excessive intrathoracic pressure. For the&#xD;
      greatest possible comfort of the patients a humidifier is used and the mixture of air and&#xD;
      oxygen is warmed up to 37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the FLOAT-CS study investigates the hemodynamic effects of oxygen-HFT versus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the patients participating in the study are randomized in a 1:1 manner to therapy with&#xD;
      oxygen-HFT either during their first or their second study night, respectively. During the&#xD;
      other night they are treated with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the main focus of this investigation is treatment of CSA patients will undergo&#xD;
      fully-attended, in-hospital polysomnography to assess parameters related to sleep and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory events during sleep All subjects receive an arterial access of the Arteria&#xD;
      radialis that remains throughout their study participation. This allows for a continuous&#xD;
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring and frequent arterial blood gas analysis thus ensuring a&#xD;
      maximum of patient safety as well as precise and detailed records.&#xD;
