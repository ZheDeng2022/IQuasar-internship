      In total, 125 women aged between 20 and 40 years were recruited in this study. Participants&#xD;
      were considered eligible when they met the inclusion criteria of being diagnosed with&#xD;
      functional constipation, as defined by the Rome Foundation. The study was a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial carried out at Cairo University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose BMI exceeded 30 kg/m2 were included. In addition, they fulfilled the ROM&#xD;
      criteria of constipation, as follows: (1) Suffered from any 2 or more of the following&#xD;
      symptoms in the past 12 weeks (not necessarily consecutive), with the onset of symptoms at&#xD;
      least 6 months prior to diagnosis: a) straining during at least 25% of defecations, b) lumpy&#xD;
      or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations, c) sensation of incomplete evacuation for at&#xD;
      least 25% of defecations, d) sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of&#xD;
      defecations, e) requirement of manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations&#xD;
      (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor muscles), and f) fewer than 3&#xD;
      defecations per week; (2) Loose stools rarely occurred without the use of laxatives; (3)&#xD;
      Insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome; and (4) Women were sedentary (less than 1&#xD;
      hour/week of physical activity), with no evidence of participation in diet control/weight&#xD;
      reduction programs within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metabolic, endocrine, and neurologic constipation; current or past smokers;&#xD;
      those with any orthopedic limitation; and those with congenital megacolon,&#xD;
      pseudo-obstruction, and anorectal disorders were excluded from the study. Patients suffering&#xD;
      from constipation due to drugs, disabled patients, and those who had undergone any abdominal&#xD;
      surgery during the intervention or those who failed to complete the study protocol were also&#xD;
      excluded. All participants provided a written informed consent before enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A included 62 women who were&#xD;
      following a suggested protocol of physical activity and a low caloric diet in addition to the&#xD;
      routine standard care for constipation. The low caloric diet allowed 1000-1200 kcal/day,&#xD;
      divided as follows: 50%-60% carbohydrates, 20% protein, &lt;30% total fat, and 18 g of fiber&#xD;
      /1000 Kcal. The diet plans were revised every 2 weeks and the diet was modified while&#xD;
      ensuring that it was within the allowed caloric value, in addition to the routine standard&#xD;
      care for constipation. Group B included 63 patients who received only the standard medical&#xD;
      care for constipation and a low caloric diet as in Group A. Patients in both groups followed&#xD;
      their program for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intervention for Group (A) Each woman in Group A participated in the exercise&#xD;
      training program for 12 weeks, 3 times per week, with each exercise session lasting for 60&#xD;
      minutes. The participants were instructed not to eat for 3 hours before the exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise training program was in the form of walking on a treadmill without tightly&#xD;
      grasping the rails, because this action seemed to reduce the workload during any stage of the&#xD;
      exercise. To overcome this issue, the participants were asked to remove their hands from the&#xD;
      rails, close their fists, and place only 1 finger on the rails to maintain balance once they&#xD;
      were accustomed to walking on the treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise session was started by a 10-minute warm-up, which involved walking without any&#xD;
      resistance or inclination on the walkway of the treadmill, followed by 40 minutes of walking&#xD;
      with 15 degrees of inclination and a speed adjusted to reach 20%-40% of the target heart rate&#xD;
      (THR) in the first 6 weeks of the study; the speed was increased to reach 40%-60% THR in the&#xD;
      next 6 weeks of the study. The session ended by 10 minutes of recovery period, in which the&#xD;
      intensity of the exercise was reduced to the level of the warm-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment procedures performed before and after 12 weeks of intervention consisted of&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Patient Assessment of Constipation - Symptom (PAC-SYM) is a reliable and valid 16,&#xD;
           17 tool to measure the patient's perspective of constipation symptoms in terms of the&#xD;
           frequency and severity. It is a 12-item self-reported measure, which is divided into 3&#xD;
           manifestation subscales (i.e. abdominal, rectal, and stool). Items are scored on a&#xD;
           4-point Likert scale, with a score of 4 demonstrating the worst symptom severity 18, 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) is a comprehensive&#xD;
           measure of the constipation burden on the patient's quality of life (QoL) in terms of&#xD;
           functions, activities, and well-being. It is considered a valid and reproducible tool&#xD;
           with high internal consistency 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is well validated, reliable, does not require more time or&#xD;
           effort to be completed, and has been presented in several international studies 21- 23.&#xD;
           It is a 36-item questionnaire that measures the QoL across 8 scales (domains), which are&#xD;
           based on both physical and emotional aspects. The 8 domains of SF36 are concerned with&#xD;
           the following: physical functioning, role limitations owing to physical health or&#xD;
           emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing, social functioning, pain, and&#xD;
           general health. In addition, a single item is included to identify any perceived change&#xD;
           in health, making the SF-36 a useful indicator for change in QoL over time and&#xD;
           treatment. The scores of the SF-36TM physical component summary and SF-36TM mental&#xD;
           component summary are calculated by simply calculating the mean score of all of the&#xD;
           physically and emotionally relevant items 23- 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were calculated as the mean and standard deviation. Inferential&#xD;
      statistics evaluated the changes in constipation symptoms, QoL questionnaires, and BMI using&#xD;
      unpaired t-test between the 2 groups, while paired t-test was used to measure the changes&#xD;
      within a group. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and&#xD;
      direction of the relationship between BMI and PAC-SYM scores, and between BMI and QoL. All&#xD;
      data were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), with statistical&#xD;
      significance set at p â‰¤ 0.05.&#xD;
