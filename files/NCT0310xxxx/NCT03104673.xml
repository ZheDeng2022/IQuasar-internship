  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and is a major cause of neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. PTB results from heterogeneous influences. One of them is the&#xD;
      inherited predisposition of spontaneous PTB, and another is the change in the placental&#xD;
      microbial composition as this can cause infections, which lead to inflammation, a common&#xD;
      cause of preterm birth. Interestingly, maternal periodontal disease is an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for PTB, low birth weight and fetal growth restriction. Immune responses to infectious&#xD;
      events or inflammation as well as genetic predisposition to inherited conditions have&#xD;
      successfully been studied by using assessing genetic expression profiling. The molecular&#xD;
      signature is sets of genes, proteins, genetic variants or other variables that can be used as&#xD;
      markers for a particular phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child morbidity from malnutrition resulting in poor growth and stunting remains a major&#xD;
      public health issue that affects the local population just like PTB. While risk factors for&#xD;
      malnutrition are multifaceted, there is also a hypothesized causal link between early gut&#xD;
      microbiome disruption that leads to chronic malnutrition in otherwise healthy infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular signatures including the intestinal microbiome development of preterm infants will&#xD;
      be evaluated and compared to the term (â‰¥37 weeks' gestation) counterparts. Moreover, a&#xD;
      comprehensive examination of possible factors associated with poor growth and poor motor- and&#xD;
      neurodevelopment will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this extension study: The primary goal for the child is to evaluate the perturbation in&#xD;
      the development of the genomic profile including intestinal microbial habitat from children&#xD;
      in a rural and limited-resource setting from birth to two years of life.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of early life epigenetics is now recognized to have direct implications for&#xD;
      health in later life and a consistent limitation expressed in peer reviewed publications has&#xD;
      been the small sample size of the studies. Rather than establish a separate cohort to study&#xD;
      epigenetics in young children in this environment this extension study of TMEC 15-062&#xD;
      (Molecular signature of Karen and Burmese women on the Thailand--Myanmar border) aims to&#xD;
      build on the detailed sampling of the mothers to not only identify biomarkers of preterm&#xD;
      labor but also to understand high rates of stunting and anaemia in this area, and possibly&#xD;
      develop predictive tools or pave new ways for prevention in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a non-invasive intervention in the form of nutrition and WASH counselling may&#xD;
      provide information on whether this form of engagement can positively influence child&#xD;
      development, prevent malnutrition and whether perturbations in the infants molecular&#xD;
      signature can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the mothers exposed to the sampling procedure at birth in this study will be&#xD;
      able to make a well-informed decision about whether they wish to enrol the child in such a&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the planned samples in children born to mothers who participated in the&#xD;
      TMEC 15-062 study are summarized in the following text:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child gut microbiome and assessment of nutrition from stool samples (Risk-none) The&#xD;
      intestinal ecosystem is very dynamic, especially in the first period of life, as it needs to&#xD;
      evolve from scratch, hence investigators want to follow children and analyse stool samples in&#xD;
      first 24 month of life. investigators propose to assess what kind of impact the gut&#xD;
      microbiome has on the child's growth and development. Since exposure to helminths is common&#xD;
      in the study population, children stool samples will also be used to examine for helminthic&#xD;
      infestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This point would also include a home visit as part of nutrition evaluation by questionnaire&#xD;
      and direct observation (food preparation including hygiene, child food content, feeding&#xD;
      patterns) to relate to microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early childhood Transcriptome from capillary blood (Risk-minimum) This point will enable us&#xD;
      to understand whether preterm infants have different gene expression than their term&#xD;
      counterparts and if so, how it evolves in the early period of life. Moreover, specific&#xD;
      signals for children at risk for or suffering from malnutrition or stunting resulting from&#xD;
      gastrointestinal inflammation or barrier disruption could be picked up. Total blood 0.85 mL&#xD;
      in 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early childhood detection of anaemia from capillary blood (Risk-minimum) Anaemia will be&#xD;
      treated and iron supplement effect on gut microbiome analysed. Total blood 0.85 mL in 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early childhood detection of soil transmitted helminth infection from stool sample&#xD;
      (Risk-none) Helminth infection will be treated and the effect on gut microbiome analysed.&#xD;
      Stool sample each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child growth assessment and evaluation of motor and neurocognitive development (Risk-none)&#xD;
      Premature infants have a higher risk for lifelong health and development problems.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to follow the children's over the period of 2 years to assess their&#xD;
      growth and their neurocognitive and motor development. Preterm children's growth and&#xD;
      development will be compared to term neonates. The recommended schedule of growth assessment&#xD;
      in healthy children is (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months). In this study children will be&#xD;
      followed more frequently: monthly in the first year of life and 3 monthly in the 2nd year of&#xD;
      life (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 months). The reasons for this&#xD;
      include: the objective of the root study TMEC 15-062 which is on preterm infants who require&#xD;
      closer follow up, to relate perturbations of biomarkers to stunting, and in this mobile&#xD;
      population scheduled visits may be missed so a more flexible arrangement for checking&#xD;
      anthropometry at any monthly visit in the first year of life reduces the chance that poor&#xD;
      growth is not identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the growth and development of children born to mothers who had a febrile episode&#xD;
      during pregnancy will be compared to children whose mothers did not experience fever episodes&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with poor growth or malnutrition will be given supplementary nutrition and nutrition&#xD;
      advice will be given to the mother.&#xD;
