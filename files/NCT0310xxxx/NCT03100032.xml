    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-centre, randomised, controlled study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of NVD-001 for the treatment of low grade degenerative lumbar&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis by interbody fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1). The study consists of&#xD;
      a 12-month initialfollow-up period post-surgery and a subsequent 12-month long term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NVD-001 is an autologous cellular medicinal product obtained by culture of adipose tissue&#xD;
      (liposuction) leading to osteogenic cells after ex vivo isolation, expansion and&#xD;
      differentiation of pluripotent adipose-tissue stem cells (ASC), and combination with an&#xD;
      allogeneic fully demineralised bone matrix into a 3D bone implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II with an&#xD;
      indication for spinal fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1) who sign informed consent and&#xD;
      are eligible will be randomised either to the experimental group (surgical intervention for&#xD;
      spinal lumbar interbody fusion with NVD-001) or to the control group (commonly used surgical&#xD;
      intervention for spinal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF, PLIF, minimally invasive or open&#xD;
      approach) with one or two PEEK cage(s) filled and surrounded by locally harvested autologous&#xD;
      cancellous bone (laminectomy).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has an indication for spinal fusion of one vertebral segment (L1-S1) due to&#xD;
             symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I or II diagnosed by computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or dynamic&#xD;
             radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is suitable for surgical operation and incorporation of the PEEK cage(s) by&#xD;
             transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or posterior lumbar intervertebral&#xD;
             fusion (PLIF) by minimally invasive or open approach in one mobile segment (L1- S1)&#xD;
             with bilateral rigid fixation. No posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) technique is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is, in the Investigator's opinion, psychosocially, mentally and physically&#xD;
             able to fully comply with this protocol, including the postoperative regimen and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At screening, local laboratory safety test results are clinically acceptable and&#xD;
             serology results for HIV, HBV, HCV, HTLV I/II and syphilis are in accordance with&#xD;
             country specific requirements for donation of Human Body Material. At time of adipose&#xD;
             tissue collection, central laboratory serology and molecular test panel for HIV, HBV,&#xD;
             HCV, HTLV I/II and syphilis must be in accordance with Belgian specific requirements&#xD;
             for release of Human Body Material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) including peri-menopausal women who have had a&#xD;
             menstrual period within 1 year prior to surgery have to have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test. Results have to be available and negative for the patient to be entered in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP have to use an effective method of birth control 2 months prior to study entry&#xD;
             or to surgical intervention date and throughout the study duration (defined as a&#xD;
             method which results in a failure rate of less than 1% per year) such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)&#xD;
&#xD;

                  trial participant and that the surgical success of vasectomy has been confirmed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence For each case of delayed menstrual period, confirmation of&#xD;
                  absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. This recommendation also applies to&#xD;
                  WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles. In case a urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test is positive, a confirmatory blood pregnancy test is obligatory.&#xD;
