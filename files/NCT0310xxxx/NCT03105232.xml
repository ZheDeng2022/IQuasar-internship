      Side effects of opioids can from practical view be divided into short-term and long-term.&#xD;
      Nervous system disorders are manifested by psychological status changes of the patient and&#xD;
      may cause confusion, mental and somatic dependency, dizziness and so on. Influencing the&#xD;
      vegetative and cardiovascular system hypotension can occur what is manifestation of&#xD;
      vasodilation and decreased myocardial inotropic activity. Another clinical sign is&#xD;
      bradycardia and is characterized by general weakness, sweating, collapse can develop. Effects&#xD;
      of opioids may cause respiratory depression, bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction. Side&#xD;
      effects on the gastrointestinal tract are nausea, vomiting, constipation and less frequently&#xD;
      dry mouth. The constipation does not develop tolerance and has to be avoided (dietary&#xD;
      modification, laxatives prevention) respectively during long-term opioid treatment&#xD;
      obstipation should be affected by blocking peripheral opioid receptors in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract by application of an opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone, which does&#xD;
      not cross the blood brain barrier, or using naloxone, which is metabolized by &quot;first-pass&quot;&#xD;
      metabolism in the liver for example combined preparation containing oxycodone and naloxone&#xD;
      (Kulichová, 2012). Known side effects on parenchymatous organ especially on liver is&#xD;
      restricted biliary excretion caused by spasm of the biliary tract. Skin manifestations caused&#xD;
      by the effects of opioids are urticaria, dermatitis, and pruritus. Renal and urinary&#xD;
      disorders may develop as urinary retention and ureteral spasm. Rarely can occur disorders of&#xD;
      the immune system, which through the development of hypersensitivity may lead to the&#xD;
      development of anaphylactic shock (Kulichová, 2012). Opioids have a negative effect and the&#xD;
      endocrine system. Various studies have demonstrated the influence of opioids on regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms. Fundamental changes occur in hypothalamic-pituitary complex, which directs the&#xD;
      activities of all the endocrine system. Secretion of hormones of the pituitary gland&#xD;
      regulates the nervous system through the hypothalamus, which is the coordination center of&#xD;
      autonomic function. The pituitary gland has coordinating function in relation to other&#xD;
      endocrine glands, and by production of their hormones affects the peripheral endocrine organs&#xD;
      and the targeting tissues (Kulichová, 2012), (Colameco, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids decrease the secretion of gonadotropin-stimulating hormone, resulting in reduced&#xD;
      levels of luteinizing hormone. The result of these changes is reduced secretion of&#xD;
      testosterone and estradiol what results in symptoms of hypogonadism. Chronic administration&#xD;
      of exogenous opioids decreases the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol, as&#xD;
      well as their circadian rhythms. The result is a reduction in the response to stress. Effect&#xD;
      on prolactin is not entirely clear. Opioids can stimulate the hypothalamus through the&#xD;
      thyroid stimulating hormone, which may cause prolonged and increased response to opioids in&#xD;
      patients with hypothyroidism. Chronic use of opioids is associated with weight gain,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and diabetes can worsen (Kulichová, 2012). It may be related to central effects&#xD;
      through the sympathetic nervous system and impaired insulin secretion. New laboratory&#xD;
      measurements show the development of oxidative stress in patients receiving morphine and&#xD;
      related drugs (Merdin, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of these biochemical changes further negatively affect the clinical outcome&#xD;
      of the patients. They may become predisposed to excessive progression of previously latent&#xD;
      diseases whose manifestations in patients previously were not apparent and there is emergence&#xD;
      of new diseases. The present data are essential to create a clinical prospective&#xD;
      observational studies to clarify this issue and its conclusions would be essential for new&#xD;
      therapeutic options for adjuvant therapy in patients suffering from chronic pain.&#xD;

      The process of the study, the choice of the patients, the collection and the processing of&#xD;
      data A. Potential participants of study will be familiarized with the course of research in&#xD;
      every detail before entering the study and after signing of an informed consent they will be&#xD;
      examined by algesiologist. The patients will receive ID number generated by computer because&#xD;
      of preserving of anonymity for the purpose of statistical processing of the data. Monitored&#xD;
      clinical parameters: The current consumption of analgesics, examination of the type of pain&#xD;
      (nociceptive vs. neuropathic - completed questionnaire for PainDetect, DN4 and LANSS Pain&#xD;
      scales), demographic information (weight, height, age). Examination of biochemical parameters&#xD;
      (ALT, AST, GMT, bilirubin, urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance, antioxidant enzymes and&#xD;
      their substrates (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase, glutathione). These data will be entered into an online database. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the activities of the enzymes will determine the confidence interval (CI) of 95%.&#xD;
      Patients whose entrance numbers will be in this range will keep on in the study, remaining&#xD;
      patients will be excluded. The patients who will keep on in study will be divided into four&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: patients with chronic pain taking morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone Group B:&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain taking transdermal patch (Buprenorphine) Group C: patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain taking transdermal patch (Fentanyl) Group D: opioid rotation B. The first&#xD;
      inspection will be carried out 6 months after the beginning of taking of opioids for severe&#xD;
      pain. During the first inspection, clinical and biochemical parameters will be examined same&#xD;
      as during the input examination of the patient. The patient will fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      PainDetect, DN4 and LANSS Pain scales. C. The second inspection will be carried out 12 months&#xD;
      after the beginning of taking of opioids for severe pain. During the second inspection,&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical parameters will be examined same as during the previous two patient&#xD;
      examinations. The patient will fill out a questionnaire PainDetect, DN4 and LANSS Pain&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;
