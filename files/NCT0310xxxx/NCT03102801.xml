    <textblock>
      Glucose is a sugar carried in the blood stream that body uses for energy. If someone has&#xD;
      diabetes, blood glucose level can be erratic, sometimes becoming very low this is called&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia (or a &quot;hypo&quot;), and can happen when blood glucose levels drop below 4 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far in order to prove that a hypo happened for a patient, blood glucose level can only be&#xD;
      measured at time of the hypo and not after it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we are trying to identify certain chemical substances (biomarkers) in diabetic&#xD;
      patients that may be measured in blood tests of the patient up to after 24 hours of the hypo&#xD;
      and if we could prove that a hypo has happened we could adjust tablets and or insulin dosage&#xD;
      in a way to prevent further hypos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Diabetes Centre in Hull Royal Infirmary and will involve&#xD;
      three visits to the diabetes centre. The study can finish in a week time after the first&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 is the screening visit to identify eligibility to take part in the study. Visit 2&#xD;
      insulin infusion will be given to make participants blood sugar level fall lower than normal&#xD;
      for a short time and corrected quickly afterward. This is a stress for participant's body and&#xD;
      should stimulate certain chemicals that we are trying to identify during hypo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Visit 3, the main purpose of this visit which is done 24 hours after insulin infusion is&#xD;
      to take a blood sample and check how participants is after visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 25 Type 2 Diabetic patients and 25 none diabetics to compare both results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups should not have ischemic heart disease, underactive thyroid or seizures and on&#xD;
      stable dosage of medications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background information It is well recognised that patients with both type 1 and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes suffering repeated hypoglycaemia are at risk of death and significant morbidity (1).&#xD;
      This is of major clinical importance as currently, only the recording of a low blood sugar at&#xD;
      the time of hypoglycaemia gives confirmation that a hypoglycaemic event has taken place.&#xD;
      There are many instances when the confirmation or exclusion of a hypoglycaemic event would be&#xD;
      beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Landmark studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) )(2) in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and the in numerous large studies (UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT(1, 3-7)) designed to&#xD;
      look at whether intensive diabetes control in type 2 diabetes reduced microvascular and&#xD;
      macrovascular cardiovascular events, have helped in establishing glycaemic targets which will&#xD;
      contribute to preventing the development or worsening of retinopathy, nephropathy and&#xD;
      neuropathy. What these studies exemplified was that as glycaemic control became stricter, the&#xD;
      risk of hypoglycaemia increased (defined as a blood glucose fall to less than 3.9mmol/l&#xD;
      according to American Diabetes Association guidelines)(1, 6, 7). For many patients, the main&#xD;
      barrier to achieving optimal glycaemic targets to prevent complications are their increased&#xD;
      risks of hypoglycaemia that remains the most feared complication of intensifying diabetes&#xD;
      therapy for both patients and their health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hypoglycaemia has traditionally been considered a complication of the treatment for&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, it has recently been recognised as a problem in people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      particularly those on intensive insulin therapy (8). In type 1 diabetes, patients on average&#xD;
      experience two symptomatic events per week and one severe event, the latter of which is&#xD;
      responsible for 2-4% of deaths. In type 2 diabetes the risk of a severe hypoglycaemic event&#xD;
      is about 7% in the first few years following diagnosis rising to 25% thereafter. There are&#xD;
      multiple concerns on the impact that a hypoglycaemic event may have leading to pathological,&#xD;
      social and economic consequences. In the ACCORD study, the risk of death was significantly&#xD;
      increased in those with one or more episode of severe hypoglycaemia in both the intensive and&#xD;
      standard study treatment arms (1, 9). As plasma glucose falls to below 4.0mmol/L, a series of&#xD;
      defensive response mechanisms occur, at individualised glycaemic thresholds, to reverse&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia including a rise in catecholamine, cortisol and glucagon levels (10). This may&#xD;
      lead to hypokalemia, prolonged QT interval, and cardiac arrhythmias (11). It may also lead to&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress (12); impaired cardiovascular autonomic function for up to 16&#xD;
      hours afterwards (13); increased inflammatory markers (14); platelet activation (15) and&#xD;
      promote vascular damage. These changes might be clinically relevant as hypoglycaemia was&#xD;
      associated with cardiac ischemia (chest pain) when 72-h continuous glucose monitoring along&#xD;
      with simultaneous cardiac Holter monitoring were performed in people with ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease and type 2 diabetes treated with insulin (16). A few studies, in people with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and healthy controls, suggested an increase in platelet activation with&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (15, 17) emphasising the increased risk that hypoglycaemia may have on&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these changes may therefore result in the generation of biomarkers that may be able to&#xD;
      identify the occurrence of a hypoglycaemia event after the blood glucose has reversed to&#xD;
      normal or rebound hyperglycaemic levels have resulted. This will be of particular value in&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic unawareness, nocturnal hypoglycaemia and events of uncertain aetiology where&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia is part of the differential diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ability to determine whether a hypoglycaemic event has occurred through measurement of a&#xD;
      biomarker will be of major impact for the confidence of patients and their healthcare&#xD;
      providers allowing glycaemic control to be optimised and glycaemic targets to be reached&#xD;
      through more stringent diabetes therapeutic treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to identify nocturnal hypoglycaemia will be of particular value in all patients&#xD;
      and will circumvent the need for continuous glucose monitoring or enforced waking at 3am to&#xD;
      do blood glucose measurements that we currently have to rely on. Identification of biomarkers&#xD;
      for hypoglycaemia will be of great value in the elderly population where it is often&#xD;
      difficult to determine causes of, for example, feeling non specifically unwell, poor&#xD;
      concentration, falls or faints, particularly as there are often multiple morbidities that are&#xD;
      being treated at the same time (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an economic perspective it is recognised that hypoglycaemia directly accounts for 95% of&#xD;
      endocrine related emergency hospitalisations (19)and it is recognised that severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia is associated with a total cost of around Â£2,152 (20) It can then be seen that&#xD;
      a new method to determine hypoglycaemia through biomarker determination may help prevent&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemia by earlier recognition and prevent death and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising biomarker is that of endothelial Microparticles which are heterogeneous&#xD;
      population of vesicles playing a relevant role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases,&#xD;
      cancer and metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are released by virtually all cell types by shedding during cell growth, proliferation,&#xD;
      activation, apoptosis or senescence processes.(21) Microparticles are consistently present in&#xD;
      blood stream (22) they are the main regulators of cell to cell interactions, by carrying&#xD;
      specific membrane antigens from their host cells, thereby acting as diffusible vectors in the&#xD;
      trancellular exchange of biological information(23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microparticles expose membrane proteins of their mother cell for example CD31 is for&#xD;
      endothelial cells and a proportion of platelets.(24) CD105,CD106, CD142, CD54, CD62E all&#xD;
      Endothelial cells in nature.(25-28) An increased level of circulating Microparticles has been&#xD;
      suggested to be one of the procoagulant determinants in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (29)Circulating levels of CD31+ (PECAM-1), CD105+, CD106+ and 62E+&#xD;
      endothelial-derived MPs as well as increased concentrations of fibrinogen+, tissue factor,&#xD;
      P-selectin+ platelet-derived MPs have been shown to be significantly increased in T2DM&#xD;
      patients as compared with non-diabetic controls (25, 26)Indeed, platelets of patients with&#xD;
      T2DM are characterised by an hyperreactive phenotype with enhanced adhesion, aggregation, and&#xD;
      activation(30), that may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic&#xD;
      complications(31-33). Therefore, high levels of specific endothelial and platelets&#xD;
      Microparticles circulate in the blood of patients with atherosclerotic diseases, and can be&#xD;
      used as biomarkers of vascular injury and potential predictors of cardiovascular outcome,&#xD;
      especially in diabetic patients(34-37).&#xD;
