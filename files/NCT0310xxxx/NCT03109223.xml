      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether the mean weight gain over a 16-week interval&#xD;
      starting on or before 14 days of life differs between infants fed one of two infant formulas&#xD;
      as their sole source of nutrition: a commercial formula using a canola l fat blend (Control,&#xD;
      E23) or the same formula containing the human milk oligosaccharide (Test (HMO)&#xD;
      2-fucosyllactose (2FL). Mean weight gain also will be compared to that of a concurrently&#xD;
      enrolled reference group of exclusively breastfed infants.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY/ STUDY DESIGN: This study is double blinded-randomized controlled trial with two&#xD;
      arms and a reference breast fed group. The experimental variable is the composition of infant&#xD;
      formula fed to healthy term infants for a period of 16 weeks upon entering the study as their&#xD;
      sole source of nutrition. The formulations are a commercial control (Control, NPS-E23); and&#xD;
      the control formula containing the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 2-fucosyllactose (2FL) at&#xD;
      1g/L (HMO, NPS-E23XA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be enrolled on or before 14 days of age and fed a study assigned formula for 16&#xD;
      weeks. Weight, length and head circumference will be measured at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12&#xD;
      and 16 weeks of study entry. Formula volume will be recorded for a three-day period before&#xD;
      each visit. Fecal samples will be obtained at baseline (convenience samples) and at week 16&#xD;
      for all subjects and analyzed for microbial populations. Buccal cheek cells of all infants,&#xD;
      and mothers of breast fed infants, obtained by swab at week 16 will be genotyped for FUT2.&#xD;
      Information on adverse events and new/change of medications will be collected at in person&#xD;
      visits and by telephone interviews between in-person visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: It is estimated that approximately up to approximately 200 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the formula groups to obtain up to approximately 65 evaluable per protocol&#xD;
      subjects in each group. As non-randomized reference group of approximately 85 breastfed&#xD;
      infants will be enrolled to obtain approximately 65 evaluable infants.&#xD;
