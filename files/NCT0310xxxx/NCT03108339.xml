    <textblock>
      Low-back pain (LBP) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder commonly seen in primary health&#xD;
      care. Despite a variety of treatment options available, it seems that few of these prevent&#xD;
      recurrent LBP and chronicity. In addition, when comparing different treatment options, effect&#xD;
      sizes are not impressive, indicating that we either lack effective treatment for LBP,&#xD;
      diagnose poorly or that we measure the outcome of treatment incorrectly. Sub groups within&#xD;
      the heterogeneous group suffering from LBP need to be identified and also markers influencing&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. The project aims to conduct a cohort study with the objective to identify&#xD;
      prognostic markers and sub groups for a successful or poor outcome of low-back pain and&#xD;
      disability in short and long term. We aim to follow the trajectory of pain, to study&#xD;
      interactions of markers and associations with days of pain and activity level. We will&#xD;
      include people seeking physiotherapy care for a primary complaint of LBP to collect data on a&#xD;
      core set of outcome measurements concerning pain, functional limitations, health and quality&#xD;
      of life, self- efficacy and fear avoidance. The data will be collected at baseline, at 8&#xD;
      weeks and 6 and 12 months following an intervention of guideline recommended&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic care comprising information to &quot;stay active&quot; and exercises enhancing core&#xD;
      stability supervised by experienced physiotherapist. We aim to collect data on movement&#xD;
      control of the lower back and general excessive mobility of the joints at base line. We will&#xD;
      collect longitudinal data on days with troublesome pain and activity level through&#xD;
      text-messages sent every 2 weeks. We will analyze the data with mixed model regression&#xD;
      analyses and cluster analyses to be able to identify predictive factors and interactions to&#xD;
      sub group the participants.&#xD;

      OVERALL AIM This project aims to through a praxis study (aim 1), a cohort study of markers of&#xD;
      outcome (aim 2) tailor a patient cantered physiotherapy primary health care intervention (aim&#xD;
      3) in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Through a praxis study evaluate how physiotherapists in primary care use patient&#xD;
           reported instruments and clinical tests when targeting treatment in LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a nation-wide cohort study in primary care to identify markers at baseline to&#xD;
           predict a poor or a successful outcome of LBP in the long term of 12 months following&#xD;
           physiotherapeutic primary care. The aim is to collect and study longitudinal data on&#xD;
           pain and activity level through text-messages to investigate the trajectory of pain in&#xD;
           relation to outcome and prognostic factors. This study forms the base for aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on analyses from the cohort study in aim 2 aim conduct an randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial (RCT) designed to target treatment for sub groups of LBP with a poor outcome&#xD;
           following guideline recommended care. The RCT will be a two armed study with a tailored&#xD;
           intervention compared to guideline recommended care for those with a poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort study and the RCT are planned to be conducted as a national multicentre study&#xD;
      including primary health care settings all over Sweden. The cohort study may be considered a&#xD;
      feasibility study in order to form the base for a primary health care registry on LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort study and the RCT are planned to be conducted as a national multicenter study&#xD;
      including primary health care settings all over Sweden. The cohort study may be considered a&#xD;
      feasibility study in order to form the base for a primary health care registry on LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients' positive attitude towards the illness and treatment will achieve better&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiotherapists' positive attitudes towards the treatment will contribute to achieve&#xD;
           better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with low fear avoidance levels and high self-efficacy will achieve better&#xD;
           outcomes as compared with patients with high fear avoidance and low self- efficacy&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: A proxy study will be performed as a survey study sent to physiotherapist nation-wide.&#xD;
      A mail lists form the Swedish Association of Physiotherapist will be used and count on&#xD;
      sending the survey to approx. 5000 physiotherapists. A pilot is under hand. The questions are&#xD;
      on what patient reported instruments and clinical tests PTs use in their clinical reasoning&#xD;
      process and on what base they use these instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: A cohort studies with a longitudinal design, collecting data at baseline, at 8 weeks&#xD;
      and at 6 and 12 months and in addition a longitudinal data collection every 2 weeks using&#xD;
      text messages. Included patient will be able to log their longitudinal data in an application&#xD;
      to be used at the telephone or the computer and will also answer text-messages. The project&#xD;
      and data collection will be piloted during in fall 2016 in a primary care physiotherapy&#xD;
      clinic with 24 physiotherapists (PT) in Stockholm, Sweden. For the multicentre study several&#xD;
      primary health care clinics in Sweden will be included. At baseline all patients will meet&#xD;
      with an independent observer. The follow up questionnaires will be sent by mail or by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: People seeking primary health care (physiotherapy) for LBP with /without leg-pain&#xD;
      will be included. This recruitment strategy is used to ensure a broad representation of&#xD;
      patients. Participants are included regardless of symptom duration, as this will typify the&#xD;
      clinical primary health care setting. LBP is for the present trial defined as dominant&#xD;
      symptoms between the lower thoracic (T12) and the gluteal fold region, and/or dominant&#xD;
      symptoms in the lower extremity due to LBP as defined using the Glassman score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Males and females above15 years of age reporting pain of at least 2/10 on&#xD;
      a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) sufficient to cause them to modify their activities of&#xD;
      daily living, and seeking care for LBP, ability to read and speak the Swedish language.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Participants are excluded if they have serious spinal pathology (i.e.&#xD;
      fracture, metastatic disease), neurological disorders, severe spinal structural deformity,&#xD;
      previous lower back surgery, pregnancy or other diagnoses that would require modification of&#xD;
      the examination. Imaging is not required for participation in the study but will be logged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure /Intervention - Cohort study The main aim with the cohort study (aim 2) is to&#xD;
      follow current care i.e. guideline informed intervention used by physiotherapists in the&#xD;
      treatment of LBP in primary health care. The intervention will otherwise use a pragmatic&#xD;
      approach as the first study aim not primarily is to study efficacy of treatment. The&#xD;
      intervention will follow a framework of: 1) information of return to activity and to stay&#xD;
      active 2) instruction on posture in loaded and unloaded positions 3) information on work and&#xD;
      leisure based positions in activity and sitting 4) information on good sleeping position 4)&#xD;
      instruction of an individualized exercise program based on findings from the examination&#xD;
      enhancing core control 5) a choice of exercises as a home training program. The physiotherapy&#xD;
      protocol will include a question on how the physiotherapist expects the patient to recover.&#xD;
      What outcome do you expect for this patient? Choice of treatment, choice of exercises&#xD;
      (loaded, unloaded) and also number of treatments is logged will be logged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proposed core set of metrics for standardized outcome reporting is recommended in the&#xD;
      management of LBP. The data will be collected at baseline, at 8 weeks, at 6 and at 12 months.&#xD;
      In addition collect data at baseline from clinical assessment of movement control and general&#xD;
      mobility of the joints will be collected and also collecting longitudinal data employing the&#xD;
      method of sending text-messages every 14 days on pain and activity level. The rational for&#xD;
      this is to collect data at several time points to follow the trajectory of pain, recurrences,&#xD;
      and activity level. Text messages data will be collected for 12 months. To employ&#xD;
      text-messages in order to collect outcome data has previously been used and is considered&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables measured at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-assessed pain for the last 24 hours on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0-10) . A&#xD;
           successful outcome will be defines as &gt;2 measured on NRS. This cut off I previously used&#xD;
           in a study of prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disability will be measured using Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI) (0-100). A&#xD;
           successful outcome will be defines as &gt;20 measured on ODI. This cut off I previously&#xD;
           used in a study of prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables A generic questionnaire with questions on age, gender, body mass index,&#xD;
      pain duration, medication, previous low back pain, co morbidity with neck pain, sleep and&#xD;
      activity level and expectation of outcome with treatment will be filled out by all at&#xD;
      baseline. In addition the following instruments will be fillet out at baseline, at 8 weeks&#xD;
      and at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Self-assessed pain for the last 24 hours -Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10); Disability&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (0-100); Generic health-related quality of life The&#xD;
      European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Questionnaire, referred to as EuroQol or EQ-5D;The&#xD;
      Glassman protocol will be included at baseline to identify 1) symptoms 2) structural&#xD;
      pathology and 3) compression pathology; The Start Back originally intended for primary care&#xD;
      providers to permit identification of patients at risk for poor outcome using the yellow&#xD;
      flags with the highest prognostic values in this patient population; Fear Avoidance Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FABQ). Self-efficacy in relation to activity will be assessed to collect data&#xD;
      on the patients' level of self-efficacy for exercise/activity by the Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      (SES). Days of sick-leave for the 12 months will be collected through the national health&#xD;
      insurance Expectation with treatment A global question on expectation with treatment will be&#xD;
      included at baseline part of the generic base line questionnaire. (http://www.swespine.se).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction with treatment and with outcome: Patients' global satisfaction with treatment&#xD;
      will be measured following intervention by two global questions derived from the Treatment&#xD;
      Outcome Satisfaction Questionnaire (TOSQ) Clinical testing Movement performance testing will&#xD;
      be performed to understand if certain active movement directions provoke pain or symptoms.&#xD;
      Excessive mobility of the joints will be assessed with a modified Beighton protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text message data Following the base line all participants will be followed with text&#xD;
      messages every 14 days to collect data on 1) Number of days with pain during last 14 days 2)&#xD;
      Activity level during the last two week. The text message will be sent to the participants&#xD;
      starting 14 days following the first visit and every 14 days. If an answer is not received a&#xD;
      follow up text-message will be sent within 24 hours. The longitudinal data will be logged by&#xD;
      the participants in an application used either on the computer or at a cell phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The randomized controlled study The RCT will be conducted as a two-arm study with an A&#xD;
      - AB study design with one arm being treatment as guideline recommended physiotherapeutic&#xD;
      care (as in the cohort study) and the other arm with an amendment of strategies to enhance&#xD;
      the patients self-efficacy and possible fear-avoidance of activity building the exercises&#xD;
      following a graded protocol. The RCT will be nationally conducted including patients from&#xD;
      several primary care units in Sweden. We have collaboration with primary care settings in&#xD;
      Lund, Luleå, Stockholm, Umeå and Örebro. The patient reported outcome measurements described&#xD;
      will be used to collect data. The RCT will include participants based on the outcome from the&#xD;
      cohort study. The intervention will be for 8 weeks with a long term follow up of 12 months.&#xD;
      Longitudinal data will be collected by text messages as in the cohort study and logged in the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME TABLE Baseline data 8 week follow-up 6 month follow-up 12 month follow-up Text messages&#xD;
      every 14 days starting 14 days after first visit at PT and logging of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
