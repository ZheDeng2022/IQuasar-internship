  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Mokhuri intensive&#xD;
      treatment program regarding pain and function before and after treatment between a group&#xD;
      receiving the Mokhuri intensive treatment program (Chuna, acupuncture, and patient education)&#xD;
      for five weeks and another group receiving non-surgical conventional standard treatment&#xD;
      (drugs for pain relief, epidural steroid injection treatment, and physical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted through international cooperation between Mayo Clinic in the&#xD;
      United States and Mokhuri Oriental Medicine Hospital in Korea. All subjects in Korea and the&#xD;
      US will be selected based on the same inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. All subjects&#xD;
      in the treatment arm will receive the same treatment in Korea and the US. In collaboration&#xD;
      and with the support of Mayo Clinic's Department of Integrative Medicine and Health, and to&#xD;
      ensure treatment consistency between Korea and the US, an acupuncturist from the USA will&#xD;
      travel to Korea and train on-site for one month in Mokhuri hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial subjects who agree to participate in the clinical trial after providing informed&#xD;
      consent will receive the required examinations and tests according to the clinical trial&#xD;
      plan. If they are appropriate for this clinical trial and eligible based on the Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, they will be randomly assigned to the group that will undergo the focused&#xD;
      Mokhuri intensive treatment program and to the group that will receive non-surgical&#xD;
      conventional treatment on their second visit. All the subjects in this study will be educated&#xD;
      regarding the study procedure and scheduled visits and will participate in the allocated&#xD;
      treatments for five weeks. Afterwards, clinical outcomes of both groups will be evaluated&#xD;
      after end of the treatments from between a week and five weeks (within +7 days). The clinical&#xD;
      trial ends after the follow-up evaluations that will take place 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks,&#xD;
      and 96 weeks after the end of the treatment evaluation.&#xD;
