    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability, identify a&#xD;
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      and antitumor activity of Oregovomab vaccination in combination with Nivolumab as a novel&#xD;
      combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategy in in female patients with recurrent epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (EOC) who progressed after two or more prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;

      This study tests the hypothesis that the combination of Oregovomab and Nivolumab will improve&#xD;
      intracellular Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 antigen processing and elicit a stronger systemic CA&#xD;
      125-specific T cell response; in a manner that is synergistic, safe, and clinically&#xD;
      efficacious in patients with relapsed EOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase Ib/IIa, single-center study with dose finding and&#xD;
      dose expansion parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ib part, clinically recommended doses as monotherapy for Oregovomab (IV 2 mg&#xD;
      Q4W, dose level 1) and Nivolumab (IV 240 mg Q2W) will be the starting doses for their&#xD;
      combined use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified &quot;3+3&quot; dose finding design will be employed, with 2 lower dosages of Oregovomab&#xD;
      (dose level -1 at 1 mg Q4W; level -2 at 0.5 mg Q4W) specified in case of excessive toxicity&#xD;
      (defined as ≥ 2 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) out of first 3 patients, or all 6 patients)&#xD;
      encountered at dose level 1. Three patients will be initially enrolled into dose level 1. If&#xD;
      0 or 1 DLT is observed, another 3 patients will be enrolled into the same dose level;&#xD;
      otherwise de-escalate and enroll 3 patients at dose level -1. If ≤ 1 DLT is observed among&#xD;
      the 6 patients, dose level 1 will be the RDE/RP2D of Oregovomab to be combined with&#xD;
      Nivolumab. Likewise, in the event of de-escalation, if 0 or 1 DLT is observed at a lower dose&#xD;
      level, a further 3 patients will be enrolled for that level; if ≤ 1 DLT is observed out of&#xD;
      the 6 patients, that dose level will be the RDE/RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled in the dose finding part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 14 patients are to enroll in the dose expansion part wherein they will receive&#xD;
      Oregovomab at RDE/RP2D, combined with Nivolumab. In total, 20 patients from the dose finding&#xD;
      and dose expansion cohorts will be treated at RDE/RP2D, and be included in the phase IIa&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for survival and post-progression treatment(s) over a duration&#xD;
      of up to 36 months from the time of treatment initiation (i.e., Week 0 until up to 36&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
