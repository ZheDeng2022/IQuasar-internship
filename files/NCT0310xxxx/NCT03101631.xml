  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is, still today, barely established in the&#xD;
      standard practice. Although the different scientific societies recommend a CGA in elderly&#xD;
      population affected with cancer at first visit, the evidence regarding its transcendence is&#xD;
      limited. On the other hand, the components of this evaluation and the translation of their&#xD;
      findings in changes in the clinical practice are not stablished. This project intends to&#xD;
      implement a CGA in a group of patients to compare this group with an historical cohort that&#xD;
      reflects the standard practice, to evaluate the differences between both approaches. The&#xD;
      study also evaluate the feasibility and utility of this CGA. All these questions aims to&#xD;
      support the hypothesis that CGA impacts on the cancer treatment for elderly population&#xD;
      affected with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two groups of elderly patients affected with stage IV non-small lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC), stage III colon cancer and stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC): a prospective&#xD;
      experimental cohort and an historic control cohort. The sample size is 60 patients, 30&#xD;
      prospective and 30 retrospective. Of each cohort, 10 patients have stage IV NSCLC, 10 have&#xD;
      stage III colon cancer and 10 have stage IV CRC. Prospective patients will be recruited&#xD;
      longitudinally from January 2013 and retrospective patients are recorded longitudinally&#xD;
      backward in time from December 2012. Both groups are patients of Medical Oncology Service of&#xD;
      Hospital General Universitario de Elche, and both groups sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CGA is performed in the experimental group after the first visit with oncologist and prior&#xD;
      to therapeutic decision. This CGA includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional Assessment: Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Assessment: Get up and Go, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental&#xD;
           Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Karnofsky Scale, Walking one Block, Number of Falls&#xD;
           in last 6 months and Hearing Loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Assessment: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological status: Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social Support: Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity and Severity of Comorbidities: Charlson Comorbidity Index and Adult&#xD;
           Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation includes too age, haemoglobin, Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) and presence of&#xD;
      geriatric syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this evaluation allow to calculate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early mortality risk according to Soubeyran et al (JCO 2012, 30: 1829-1834) (MNA and Get&#xD;
           up and Go):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risk of early mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no risk of early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity to chemotherapy according to Hurria et al. (J Clin Oncol 2011, 29: 3457-3465)&#xD;
           (age, type of cancer, dose and number of chemotherapy drugs, haemoglobin, CrCl, hearing&#xD;
           loss, number of falls in last 6 months, ability to take medication without help (IADL),&#xD;
           walking one block and social support (MOS-SSS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  low risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medium risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frailty group according Köhne et al (The Oncologist 2008, 13: 390-402) (ADL, IADL,&#xD;
           comorbidity and severity of comorbidities and presence of geriatric syndromes). This&#xD;
           information dictates the therapeutic strategy for each experimental patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: modified treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental patients will be followed for six months from CGA and their toxicity and its&#xD;
      severity, occurrence of treatment modifications, number of hospitalizations and reasons for&#xD;
      hospitalizations and mortality and reason of mortality will be compared with the same items&#xD;
      of historic controls, followed too for six months from the moment the physician made the&#xD;
      therapeutic decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data to record for both groups: sex, age, origin, leucocytes, platelets, LDH, albumin,&#xD;
      CEA, Cr Cl, haemoglobin, subjective weight loss, corporal mass index, comorbidities, primary&#xD;
      tumor: stage, metastases location, treatment intent: adjuvant, palliative, number of drugs,&#xD;
      number of concomitant medications, PS according to ECOG and Karnofsky (some data are expected&#xD;
      to be missing for historic group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only for historic controls, physicians should answer one question : In wich category would&#xD;
      include the treatment recommendation? according to Köhne, The Oncologist 2008: Balducci, The&#xD;
      Oncologist 2000; J Clin Oncol 2012:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no treatment despite treatment is recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only for historic controls two more questions should be answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has a Geriatric Evaluation been performed? Yes or No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What sort of evaluation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial records too how long does it take each test and how long does it take to complete&#xD;
      CGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information is recorded in a database with anonymous code for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will consist of a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of both cohorts. It will be performed also non-parametric analysis comparing&#xD;
      this characteristics between the experimental groups. A descriptive analysis of daily life&#xD;
      characteristics in experimental group will be performed, and also a non-parametric analysis&#xD;
      comparing these variables between the experimental groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes due to CGA incorporation will be evaluated and the variables measuring the toxicity&#xD;
      and early mortality should be correlated to the coincidence or not of the treatment performed&#xD;
      with the one concluded by the geriatric evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contribution of the different elements of CGA will be evaluated. A multiple regression will&#xD;
      be performed in order to carry out an evaluation of the degree of contribution of each of the&#xD;
      elements of the CGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significance &quot;p&quot; less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some study limitations: size, missing data for historic patients, monocentric&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
