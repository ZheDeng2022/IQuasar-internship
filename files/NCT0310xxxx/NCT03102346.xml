  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home-based CR (HBCR) was reported to improve the clinical outcomes of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD) patients. There is no data published to investigate whether HBCR is also effective for&#xD;
      Chinese CAD patients who have been revascularized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at home for&#xD;
      Chinese patients who underwent PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) procedure. This is a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, controlled and observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have revealed that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial Cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR) after revascularization results in better clinical outcomes, and have&#xD;
      been strongly recommended for patients with coronary artery disease. In China, as compared to&#xD;
      the exponential increase of PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) volume, only a very&#xD;
      small amount of hospitals are able to develop CR programs. There is no large-scale study to&#xD;
      explore the feasible CR pattern either. Home-based CR might be more favorable and practical&#xD;
      for so many Chinese revascularized coronary artery disease (CAD) patients due to its&#xD;
      feasibility and flexibility as well as low medical cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CR program at home for&#xD;
      Chinese patients who underwent PCI procedure. This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      and observational study. The efficacy and safety of Home-based CR (HBCR) in revascularized&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated through observation of its clinical characteristics and safety&#xD;
      indicators. The study will involve 14 sites nationwide, with an expected sample size of 2,000&#xD;
      followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoints is the incidence of composite major adverse&#xD;
      cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE,death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, revascularization, stroke).Secondary endpoints are defined as decrease of&#xD;
      hospitalization due to refractory angina pectorisï¼Œthe improvements of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness,life quality,as well as angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized into 2 different groups, HBCR group and control group. After&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation, the orders from CR staff will be given. Besides the routine health&#xD;
      education in both groups, the subjects in HBCR group will be further introduced the&#xD;
      instructions of exercise training. The effect of HBCR on cardiorespiratory fitness,&#xD;
      improvement of angina, cardiac function, quality of life, levels of anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      as well as risk factor profile will also be evaluated. The investigators also aim to explore&#xD;
      the factors which influence the adherence of subjects to our HBCR program.&#xD;
