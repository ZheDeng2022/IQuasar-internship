  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of schizophrenia is challenging as the existing medications improve only the&#xD;
      positive symptoms with the limited benefit on cognitive and negative symptoms which have a&#xD;
      large bearing on the functional outcome. Recent research has suggested the association of low&#xD;
      level of vitamin D with schizophrenia but studies are few and marred by mixed results. Thus,&#xD;
      we propose to evaluate the effect of weekly vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with&#xD;
      first-episode schizophrenia through a randomised doubled blind placebo controlled&#xD;
      design.Fifty-six participants of either sex (19 - 50 years) with schizophrenia having vitamin&#xD;
      D insufficiency/deficiency (&lt; 30 ng/ml) will be randomly supplemented with Vitamin D3 or&#xD;
      placebo for 8 weeks in 1:1 pattern. The clinical treatment i.e., antipsychotic medications&#xD;
      will be continued as usual within the two groups. Participants in both the groups will be&#xD;
      assessed at study entry, at the end of the 04 and 08 weeks (after completing supplementation)&#xD;
      on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Computerized Neurocognitive Battery&#xD;
      (CNB) &amp; Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) subscale (CGI-I). Raters will be blind to the group&#xD;
      assigned to participants. Side effects will be monitored at every visit. The serum levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D will be measured at baseline and at the end of 08 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia as their first episode (&lt;7 years' duration of illness)&#xD;
      and receiving treatment from the Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi will be invited for&#xD;
      the study. The patients will be explained about the study and the patients giving the consent&#xD;
      for the study will be screened for vitamin D3 insufficiency/deficiency. The patient would be&#xD;
      selected for the study if 25 (OH) D is below 30 ng/ml and fulfils the clinical inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The patient would be recalled for enrolment in the study and the socio-demographic&#xD;
      details will be collected along with the baseline evaluation. The patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to either vitamin D3 or B-Complex group in a 1:1 proportion. Both the groups would be matched&#xD;
      for age and gender as these may affect clinical outcome of schizophrenia and will balance the&#xD;
      unknown confounding factors. The randomization scheme will utilize computer-generated random&#xD;
      numbers that will be available with the PI who will supervise the dispensing the medication,&#xD;
      the research assistant will be blind to the randomization numbers. This scheme will be stored&#xD;
      in a password-protected computer and password-protected file. Only PI will have access to&#xD;
      this file. The file will be opened only if a participant reports serious side effects. The&#xD;
      double-blind design will be continued through the study period. The medications will be&#xD;
      stored at room temperature and the investigators will supervise the dispensing of the study&#xD;
      medication to subjects and/or their caregivers. Patients randomized to vitamin D3 arm will&#xD;
      receive 4 tablets (containing 60,000 IU vitamin D3) on the first day of visit and after the&#xD;
      fourth week (visit 3) respectively to be taken by mouth on fixed days every week. This dose&#xD;
      is the recommended regimen by International Endrocrinological Society. The subjects will&#xD;
      receive either vitamin D3 or B Complex weekly for 08 weeks along with the antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications as determined by the treating team. The treating team will be encouraged to&#xD;
      maintain stable doses if feasible. After the duration of 08 weeks, the dosage of vitamin D3&#xD;
      will be continued as per the serum levels and the recommendation guidelines whereas the&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications will be continued as per the clinical response and decision of the&#xD;
      treating team.&#xD;
