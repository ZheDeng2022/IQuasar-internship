  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the sensory-mechanical responses to Eucapneic&#xD;
      Voluntary Hyperventilation (EVH) and Hypertonic Saline (HS) in individuals with cough variant&#xD;
      asthma (CVA) and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity (COUGH) and&#xD;
      compare these responses to a control group of healthy individuals without asthma or chronic&#xD;
      cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EVH and HS cause dyspnea, cough, small airway obstruction with resultant dynamic&#xD;
           hyperinflation, gas trapping and autoPEEP in individuals with CVA and COUGH, but not&#xD;
           healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sensory-mechanical responses to both hyperosmolar challenges (EVH and HS) are&#xD;
           comparable within groups (CVA, COUGH and healthy controls).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.&#xD;
      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,&#xD;
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which&#xD;
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of&#xD;
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic&#xD;
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals&#xD;
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do&#xD;
      not have asthma or CVA) (COUGH) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose&#xD;
      of this research is to further explore the pathophysiologic basis for cough in these&#xD;
      conditions using two 'indirect' inhalation challenge tests: eucapneic voluntary&#xD;
      hyperventilation (EVH) and hypertonic saline (HS), which induce osmotic and/or temperature&#xD;
      changes in airway. Specifically, this study will collect preliminary data on the&#xD;
      sensory-mechanical responses of individuals with CVA, COUGH and healthy controls to EVH and&#xD;
      HS challenge.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Time frame of the methacholine challenge varies between individuals. At provocative dose/ventilation causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PD20 and PC20 respectively). On average, these occur about 15-25 minutes into the challenge test</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be examined using responses to the challenge testing (Visit 2/3) in these subgroups by comparing the mid-expiratory flow difference between the partial (PEF) and full maximal flow-volume (MEF) loops at 40% above Residual Volume (RV) from the forced vital capacity (FVC) (PEF40 and MEF40 respectively) at provocative dose of 4.5% saline causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PD20 (HS)) and provocative minute ventilation causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PC20 (EVH)) with that recorded at baseline.</description>
