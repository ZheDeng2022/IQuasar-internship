      Hypothesis of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the presented results, the investigator hypothesises that HBO preserves neurons that&#xD;
      are not irreversibly damaged (i.e. severed) during initial trauma, thus enabling regain of&#xD;
      their function. The investigator predicts that HBO treatment protects and enhances motor&#xD;
      function in initially paralysed regions, including improvement in function of the extremities&#xD;
      as well as recovery of urinary bladder control and bowel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of the Proposed Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a prospective &quot;proof of principle&quot; trial, a total of 100 patients will be included.&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be recruited at the Division of Thoracic and Hyperbaric Surgery, Medical&#xD;
      University of Graz. In parallel, 50 control patients will be included at the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopaedics and Trauma, Paracelsus University Salzburg, Salzburger Landeskliniken (SALK),&#xD;
      Austria. Thereby, all patients that are admitted at the Medical University of Graz can be&#xD;
      treated and the enrolment of 50 patients into the treatment group can be implemented within&#xD;
      the outlined time frame. The active recruitment period is planned for three years. Both HBO&#xD;
      treated and control patients will undergo the same surgical and nonsurgical procedures. HBO&#xD;
      treatment will be started within 24 hours after the injury. A total of 21 consecutive daily&#xD;
      sessions will be applied, followed by routine rehabilitation programmes. By matching control&#xD;
      and HBO-treated patients, an evaluation of the treatment effect of HBO is possible. The&#xD;
      outcome will be evaluated by implementing the American Spinal Injury Association&#xD;
      (ASIA)-scores and magnet resonance (MR) imaging. Additionally, inflammatory and regenerative&#xD;
      blood markers will be analysed (neuroendocrine markers/neuro-transmitters: S100beta, Brain&#xD;
      Derived Neurotrophic Growth Factor [BDNF], Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein [GFAP], Reactive&#xD;
      Oxygen Species (ROS), norepinephrine; array of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines).&#xD;
