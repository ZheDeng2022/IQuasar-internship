    <textblock>
      The clinical objective of this study is to evaluate the RaindropÂ® Near Vision Inlay for the&#xD;
      improvement of near vision in presbyopic or pseudophakic patients treated with low dose&#xD;
      Mitomycin C immediately following femtosecond flap creation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The scientific objective of this study is to evaluate the postoperative incidence of corneal&#xD;
      reaction in patients treated with low dose Mitomycin C, immediately following femtosecond&#xD;
      flap creation (LASIK correction if needed), and before implantation with the Raindrop corneal&#xD;
      inlay in the non-dominant eye. The postoperative incidence of haze, visible by broad&#xD;
      tangential illumination of the slit lamp, is known to adversely impact the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Raindrop corneal inlay. Three main strategies have been employed to minimize&#xD;
      haze incidence after surgery: (i) perfection of the surgical technique, (ii) deeper&#xD;
      implantation in the cornea, and (iii) extension of the steroid regimen after surgery. Haze&#xD;
      has also been observed after another type of corneal refractive procedure, Photorefractive&#xD;
      Keratectomy (PRK). Several prospective studies have shown that Mitomycin C, applied&#xD;
      immediately following the PRK laser procedure, is effective in reducing the postoperative&#xD;
      incidence of haze.&#xD;
