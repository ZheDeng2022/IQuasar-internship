  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, and maintenance of effect&#xD;
      study of flexible daily dosing with Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in subjects 4 to 17 years&#xD;
      of age with partial onset seizures (POS). The study is designed to enroll subjects to receive&#xD;
      ESL as adjunctive treatment with the option to convert to ESL monotherapy after 6 months of&#xD;
      ESL adjunctive treatment. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately&#xD;
      75 subjects completing 1 year of treatment. At least 25% of subjects will be enrolled in each&#xD;
      age group (4 - 6, 7 - 11, and 12 - 17 years of age). An attempt will be made to enroll no&#xD;
      fewer than 30% of subjects in each gender. It is anticipated that approximately 50 subjects&#xD;
      will convert to monotherapy during the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential because she is premenarchal (as assessed by physical&#xD;
                  examination) and &lt; 7 y; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-childbearing potential because she is premenarchal (as assessed by physical&#xD;
                  examination), ≥ 7 y, and has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Childbearing potential; has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and&#xD;
                  agrees to satisfy one of the following requirements:&#xD;

                  • Complete abstinence from intercourse as a component of a habitually abstinent&#xD;
                  lifestyle; a minimum of 4 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of&#xD;
                  study drug, throughout the treatment period, and for a minimum of 8 weeks after&#xD;
                  completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug (abstinence must be&#xD;
                  part of an established abstinent lifestyle), and agrees to use a double-barrier&#xD;
                  method if she becomes sexually active; or&#xD;
&#xD;
                  • Established use of acceptable methods of contraception; a minimum of 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, throughout the treatment&#xD;
                  period, and for a minimum of 8 weeks after completion or premature&#xD;
                  discontinuation from the study drug. Acceptable methods of birth control are&#xD;
                  those with established failure rates of &lt; 1%per year and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Double barrier birth control, which is limited to a condom plus spermicide&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD). Note: Female subjects who are ≥ 7 y and&#xD;
                       premenarchal will not routinely undergo serum pregnancy tests and will only&#xD;
                       be administered a urine pregnancy test. A positive urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                       should be confirmed by a serum test in these subjects regardless of weight.&#xD;
                       Female subjects who are &lt; 7 y will not undergo a serum or a urine pregnancy&#xD;
                       test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: ESL may interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptive and therefore&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives are not sufficient for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Males must be willing to remain sexually abstinent (consistent with lifestyle) or use&#xD;
             an effective method of birth control (eg, male using condom and female using&#xD;
             diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, contraceptive pill, or intrauterine&#xD;
             device) from signing informed consent to at least 7 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug has been taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Stable environment with caregiver who can assist in completion of seizure diary and&#xD;
             other study assessments, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject and/or caregiver must read and write and possess an educational level and&#xD;
             degree of understanding of the local language at a level sufficient to complete study&#xD;
             related assessments or communicate suitably with the Investigator and study&#xD;
             coordinator. For subjects who do not meet this criterion, a caregiver must be able to&#xD;
             meet this requirement on the subject's behalf.&#xD;
