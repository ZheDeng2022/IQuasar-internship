    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 4 weeks (with the exception of participants on primidone at&#xD;
      baseline who will be allowed 6 weeks of screening to allow for safe discontinuation).&#xD;
      Screening results from all patients meeting the eligibility requirements will be further&#xD;
      assessed by the sponsor medical personnel for final approval of suitability for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study. Randomized participants will enter a 4 week double-blind dose-titration treatment&#xD;
      period, followed by a 1 week safety follow-up period following the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication, and a scheduled follow-up safety telephone call one week later.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 4 weeks (with the exception of participants on primidone at&#xD;
      baseline who will be allowed 6 weeks of screening to allow for safe discontinuation).&#xD;
      Screening results from all patients meeting the eligibility requirements will be further&#xD;
      assessed by the sponsor medical personnel for final approval of suitability for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study. Randomized participants will enter a 4 week double-blind dose-titration treatment&#xD;
      period, followed by a 1 week safety follow-up period following the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication, and a scheduled follow-up safety telephone call one week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. Group A will receive&#xD;
      titrating doses of CX-8998 up to 10 mg BID and Group B will receive placebo. Participant&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified by presence or absence of a single concomitant anti-tremor&#xD;
      medication and by site-type (sub-study vs non sub-study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremor will be assessed via The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) and&#xD;
      accelerometry. To reduce the potential for bias in the assessments of efficacy, all&#xD;
      participants will be videotaped during the TETRAS performance scale testing according to a&#xD;
      consistent script. The videotapes will be rated in a blinded manner by qualified, independent&#xD;
      raters. A subset of participants will participate in a digital biomarker sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened up to 4 weeks prior to initiation of dosing. Participants&#xD;
      taking primidone at screening who are otherwise deemed eligible for participation and are&#xD;
      willing to discontinue primidone will be allowed an additional 2 weeks of screening (a total&#xD;
      of 6 weeks) to ensure safe primidone discontinuation. At Baseline, participants will undergo&#xD;
      safety and tremor assessments prior to dosing, will receive their first dose of study drug&#xD;
      and will be monitored for safety for one hour following dosing. For one week participants&#xD;
      will receive 4 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily. Participants will return to the clinic&#xD;
      on Day 8 for safety monitoring and dose up-titration to 8 mg (or matching placebo) twice&#xD;
      daily. At Day 15 (Week 3) participants will return to clinic for safety and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments and final dose up-titration to 10 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily. The final&#xD;
      efficacy visit will occur at Day 28 (Week 4). A final safety visit will occur at Day 35 (Week&#xD;
      5). Should participants experience intolerable adverse events (AEs) at 4 mg BID, 8 mg BID or&#xD;
      10 mg BID, the dose may be decreased at Day 8 or Day 15 to the next lowest dose one time (or&#xD;
      2 mg BID in the case of the 4 mg BID dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized participants will have the opportunity to participate in an optional exploratory&#xD;
      sub-study designed to assess the utility of digital assessment tools for tremor (sub-study&#xD;
      addendum #1). Participants with Parkinson's disease tremor will be enrolled in a second&#xD;
      exploratory sub-study (addendum #2).&#xD;

    <description>The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale Performance Subscale (TETRAS-PS) was used to assess the efficacy of CX-8998 in reducing essential tremor as scored by the independent video raters. TETRAS-PS quantifies tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk. The overall subscale score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 64. A lower score is indicative of improvement and a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Kinesia ONE was developed to provide a quantitative measurement of motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Scores are presented as the sum of the scores of the left and right hands. A total of 4 tasks were performed on the left side and then on the right side to assess resting, postural, kinetic, and lateral wing beating tremor. Values for each test range from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). The total overall score is the sum of all individual items and ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 32. A lower score is indicative of improvement or a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Baseline and Day 28 on The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale Performance Subscale (TETRAS-PS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale Performance Subscale (TETRAS-PS) was used to assess the efficacy of CX-8998 in reducing essential tremor as scored by the independent video raters. TETRAS-PS quantifies tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk. The overall subscale score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 64. A lower score is indicative of improvement and a better outcome.</description>

        <population>TETRAS-PS was assessed using the Full Analysis Set. The number analyzed by Day 28 decreased due to participants that did not complete the study to that time point.</population>

        <description>Kinesia ONE was developed to provide a quantitative measurement of motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Scores are presented as the sum of the scores of the left and right hands. A total of 4 tasks were performed on the left side and then on the right side to assess resting, postural, kinetic, and lateral wing beating tremor. Values for each test range from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). The total overall score is the sum of all individual items and ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 32. A lower score is indicative of improvement or a better outcome.</description>

A total of 4 tasks were performed on the left side and then on the right side to assess resting, postural, kinetic, and lateral wing beating tremor. Values for each test range from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). The total overall score is the sum of all individual items and ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 32. A lower score is indicative of improvement or a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 28 in the Kinesia ONE Score</title>
        <description>Kinesia ONE was developed to provide a quantitative measurement of motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Scores are presented as the sum of the scores of the left and right hands. A total of 4 tasks were performed on the left side and then on the right side to assess resting, postural, kinetic, and lateral wing beating tremor. Values for each test range from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). The total overall score is the sum of all individual items and ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 32. A decrease or negative change in score is indicative of improvement or a better outcome.</description>
