  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of pomaglumetad in humans using methamphetamine. The goal of the&#xD;
      study is to determine if pomaglumetad is safe when administered with methamphetamine. If&#xD;
      shown to be safe with methamphetamine in the current study, a phase 2 clinical trial of&#xD;
      pomaglumetad would be done to begin to find out if pomaglumetad is effective in treating&#xD;
      methamphetamine use disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending-dose&#xD;
      study of pomaglumetad in 24 non-treatment seeking participants with methamphetamine use&#xD;
      disorder. Three cohorts of 8 participants each (total N = 24) will be enrolled and within&#xD;
      each cohort participants will be randomly assigned in a 6:2 ratio to undergo methamphetamine&#xD;
      infusions and assessments during treatment with pomaglumetad (N = 6 per cohort) or placebo (N&#xD;
      = 2 per cohort). Participants in cohort 1 will receive pomaglumetad 40 mg orally twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) or placebo, cohort 2 will receive pomaglumetad 80 mg BID or placebo, and cohort 3 will&#xD;
      receive pomaglumetad 160 mg BID or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing outpatient baseline and screening/eligibility assessments, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the UCLA Hospital and will remain hospitalized during all&#xD;
      experimental procedures (approximately 11 days and 10 nights).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A urine drug toxicology screen free of illicit substances (with the exception of THC) is&#xD;
      required for admission. Upon admission, participants will receive a sample/test infusion of&#xD;
      MA 30 mg IV. Participants tolerating the test infusion (no serious adverse advents and not&#xD;
      exceeding stopping criteria below) will be randomized to receive POMA (40 mg BID in cohort 1,&#xD;
      80 mg BID in cohort 2, and 160 mg BID in cohort 3) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following three days of MA abstinence and POMA/placebo dosing to achieve study medication&#xD;
      steady-state, participants will complete a MA self-administration session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two days for MA washout, participants will then have serial plasma samples collected&#xD;
      over 12 hours to assess PK for POMA. The next day, participants will receive a 30 mg MA&#xD;
      infusion followed by serial plasma sample collection over the following 48 hours for MA PK&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of cardiovascular response, subjective effects, and adverse events will be assessed&#xD;
      following all MA infusions during self-administration and PK sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the PK sample collection, participants will be discharged and a 14-day&#xD;
      post-discharge (± 7 days) follow-up outpatient visit will be completed for safety purposes.&#xD;
