  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the tolerability of nivolumab in&#xD;
      patients who have bladder cancer, were previously treated with BCG immunotherapy, and who&#xD;
      have a cystectomy (removal of all or part of the bladder) scheduled as part of their standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat metastatic (has spread) melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after the&#xD;
      disease has gotten worse while receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. The use of nivolumab in&#xD;
      this study is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 14 days (2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive nivolumab by&#xD;
      vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive nivolumab for up to 3 cycles before your scheduled surgery. You will no&#xD;
      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects&#xD;
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and at the visit before your surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaires. These will take about 10&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, urine or part of the above routine blood sample will be used&#xD;
           for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery (Cystectomy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 8 weeks after you join the study, you will have surgery for bladder cancer. You will&#xD;
      sign a separate consent form that describes the surgery and its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete the 2 quality-of-life questionnaires.&#xD;
