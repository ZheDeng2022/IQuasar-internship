      To establish a spine injury and spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment database; to complete pre-&#xD;
      and in-hospital evaluation of spine injury and SCI, develop and optimize first aid&#xD;
      procedures, form pre-and in-hospital standardized training program for the treatment of spine&#xD;
      injury and SCI; to develop first aid guidelines and establish an evaluation and treatment&#xD;
      system for early surgery, as far as possible to save the spinal cord function and reduce the&#xD;
      degree of disability; to form expert consensus on acute SCI and &quot;green channel&quot; patterns,&#xD;
      will be promoted in hospitals in Beijing and other cities of China, so as to improve the&#xD;
      level of first aid treatment of acute spine injury and SCI in Chinese cities, and to reduce&#xD;
      the occurrence of secondary injury and severe dysfunction due to improper treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized controlled trial. The target population&#xD;
      consists of 200 acute spinal cord injury patients undergoing pre-hospital treatment in the&#xD;
      Beijing Emergency Medical Center and Beijing Red Cross Emergency Rescue Center, and receiving&#xD;
      in-hospital treatment in the Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Third&#xD;
      Hospital, Beijing Friendship Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Chaoyang&#xD;
      Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, and Chinese PLA General Hospital, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History and current related studies Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) as a clinical common&#xD;
      disease is the difficulty of clinical treatment, and frequently occurs in young adults. The&#xD;
      incidence of acute SCI is 30-40/million people in Europe and USA, but 60.2/million people in&#xD;
      Beijing of China. The complete SCI is very dangerous, and there is no effective medical&#xD;
      therapy. At present, the effective treatment of acute SCI should be the first aid and&#xD;
      advanced rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hours is the best time to rescue spinal cord function after SCI, especially 3-8 hours&#xD;
      after injury is the golden opportunity. A large dose of hormone therapy in the 3-8 hours&#xD;
      after injury can reduce secondary injury, thereby reducing the degree of SCI. 24 hours after&#xD;
      injury, early surgery for relieving spinal cord compression can significantly improve the&#xD;
      recovery of spinal cord function. Timely and properly pre-hospital first aid, quick hospital&#xD;
      admissions and assessment, and timely surgery are essential for the rescue of spinal cord&#xD;
      function. Patients with incomplete SCI can be completely injured and lose the possibility of&#xD;
      recovery of spinal cord function due to improper first aid or untimely treatment. Complete&#xD;
      SCI will cause more severe injury due to improper treatment. It may be difficult to make up&#xD;
      for surgery or rehabilitation training. A sound and rapid treatment system is the basis for&#xD;
      improving the treatment level of SCI, but we still lack of this kind of system in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Beijing of China, pre-hospital treatment can be done by Beijing Emergency Medical Center&#xD;
      (120 first aid system) and Beijing Red Cross Hospital (999 first aid system). While&#xD;
      cooperating with each other, it is also faced with different mechanisms, different treatment&#xD;
      patterns and overlapping treatment regions. As for the in-hospital treatment, Beijing has a&#xD;
      large number of high-level hospitals, but these hospitals are overcrowding. There is no SCI&#xD;
      treatment specialist or professional hospital in Beijing City, so treatment basically relies&#xD;
      on various general hospitals. In pre-hospital first aid and in-hospital treatment of Beijing&#xD;
      City, the medical information transfer is not smooth; the treatment process is separated, and&#xD;
      it lacks of standardized treatment. The ability and level of medical personnels are not&#xD;
      consistent, the technology is backward, and there is lack of professional training. Thus, the&#xD;
      vast majority of patients with SCI cannot be treated within the optimal treatment time after&#xD;
      injury. It is also an important cause of higher mortality and disability in SCI patients in&#xD;
      China compared with the developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006, Professor Bao-guo Jiang, director of the Department of Orthopedics, Peking&#xD;
      University People's Hospital, led the establishment of the Traffic Medicine Center of Peking&#xD;
      University, involving Peking University People's Hospital, School of Public Health of Peking&#xD;
      University, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing&#xD;
      Traffic Management Bureau, and Beijing Emergency Medical Center in China. Reviewed by the&#xD;
      Health and Family Planning Commission, the &quot;National Center for Severe Trauma Training&quot; was&#xD;
      set up in 2015, and Bao-guo Jiang served as the director of the center. The Traffic Medicine&#xD;
      Center and two emergency centers in Beijing have cooperated for many years, and established&#xD;
      an epidemiological database for the treatment of severe trauma and the linkage mechanism of&#xD;
      pre-hospital and in-hospital. The treatment of spine injury and SCI is one of important&#xD;
      contents for treating severe trauma. With this center as a platform, the database of SCI&#xD;
      patients can be specialized; a unified standardized and rapid treatment can be carried out in&#xD;
      many participating medical units using the linkage mechanism with the emergency centers; a&#xD;
      high level of scientific research can be carried out, and a series of studies can be started,&#xD;
      concerning SCI epidemiology, treatment procedures and improvement in treatment effect.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the standardized training for pre-hospital and in-hospital first aid care&#xD;
      personnel in each research center and hospital can be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For nonstandard treatment process and path and poor information exchange, incoherent&#xD;
      pre-hospital care and in-hospital treatment, lack of professional training for treatment&#xD;
      personnel, and uneven comprehensive hospital treatment capacity, this trial aims to formulate&#xD;
      the standards for the treatment of spine injury and SCI through a standardized multicenter&#xD;
      study so as to improve the level of SCI treatment and to reduce the mortality and disability&#xD;
      of SCI patients in Beijing, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement data will be expressed as the case number (missing number), mean, median,&#xD;
           standard deviation, first quartile, third quartile, maximum, and minimum. The 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval of the rate will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Count data will be expressed as the frequency and relative number. The 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval of the rate will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Normally or non-normally distributed measurement data will be analyzed using paired&#xD;
           t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Count data will be analyzed using Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Ranked data will&#xD;
           be analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation In accordance with previous SCI treatment conditions in participating&#xD;
      units, we will recruit 200 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The database will be constructed and maintained by Peking University People's Hospital.&#xD;
           According to the data characteristics of the research program, the main researcher will&#xD;
           draft detailed data management and statistical plans, including data quality audit,&#xD;
           construct corresponding electronic database, completely and accurately input all&#xD;
           expected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each participating unit will be responsible for filling in the database of their&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The computer program combined with the manual method will be used to check the&#xD;
           consistency and logicality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any questions will be answered by the person in charge of the project and the main&#xD;
           staff, and returned to the data management center, and then the data manager will modify&#xD;
           and update the database. All inspection procedures need to be repeated several times&#xD;
           until there is no doubt. All changes and updates are required for recording and filing.&#xD;
           It is strictly forbidden to use correction fluid or correction tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All researchers are required to ensure that the data recorded in the case report forms&#xD;
           are authentic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peking University People's Hospital will organize training sessions before the study and&#xD;
           conduct unified training for all the participants. A person, as a coordinator, will&#xD;
           coordinate the whole research, prepare a research brief, regularly announce the progress&#xD;
           of the study, and solve the problems in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The responsible person will hold a regular meeting, summarize the work, communicate,&#xD;
           correct the problem, and make a request.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In order to follow the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, we will set up a regular&#xD;
           visit to each center to ensure compliance with research programs, Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
           and related laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and management&#xD;
&#xD;

           meeting of the heads of the participating units so as to carry out unified training for&#xD;
           the implementation of the project plan, and for the record and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The heads of the participating units will train specific operators on programs,&#xD;
           procedures, and instructions, develop training programs and manuals to ensure that the&#xD;
           team members are familiar with and grasp the relevant contents before the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The inspector is responsible for ensuring the smooth progress of the trial, controls the&#xD;
           whole process, and deals with emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each participating unit will perform its duties, strictly follow the clinical trial&#xD;
           program, and adopt standard operating procedures. Grading of quality-control staffs will&#xD;
           be set up; different grades of staffs will be responsible for different parts of work,&#xD;
           which will be inspected by the superior staff to ensure that the data will be input in&#xD;
           the database system within 24 hours after the incident and to ensure the authenticity&#xD;
           and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A new team member will be trained, concerning project plan and process, and timely&#xD;
           trained, concerning the updated content/process or content that needs to be&#xD;
           re-emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Standard operation procedure will ensure smooth handover if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The arbitrator will guarantee the rights of each participating unit, make sure true,&#xD;
           accurate, complete and correct data record and report, and ensure that the research&#xD;
           follows the relevant laws and regulations. The number of visits of the arbitrator will&#xD;
           meet the needs of quality control. The arbitrator after each visit will inform the&#xD;
           project leader the inspection results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality controller of each region will carry out internal inspection on scale filling&#xD;
           weekly according to the requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
