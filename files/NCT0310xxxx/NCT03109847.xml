      This pilot clinical trial studies how will metformin hydrochloride works in mitigating the&#xD;
      side effects of radioactive iodine treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;
      Metformin hydrochloride may reduce the metabolic activity of cancer cell and of surrounding&#xD;
      supportive tissues.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin) inhibits radioactive&#xD;
      iodine (RAI)-induced myelosuppression and induces faster recovery of white blood cell count&#xD;
      to baseline values, the blood counts will be compared in the pre- and post-treatment samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety and tolerability of metformin treatment in subjects undergoing RAI treatment&#xD;
      for differentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effect of metformin treatment on symptoms of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and&#xD;
      dysgeusia as assessed by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ), the modified Vanderbilt Head and&#xD;
      Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), University of Washington Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)-Head and Neck (H&amp;N)35.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer who have undergone total or&#xD;
             near-total thyroidectomy and are candidates for iodine I-131 (I-131) treatment at&#xD;
             Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) are eligible to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have previously undergone or plan to undergo thyroidectomy; for those&#xD;
             patients who have previously undergone surgery, pre-operative labs, including complete&#xD;
             blood cell count with differential must be available&#xD;

             enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be able to comprehend and sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received iodinated contrast dye. Metformin treatment can be started&#xD;
             the day after subjects complete iodinated contrast treatment. If a CT scan with&#xD;
             contrast is scheduled after screening and consent, the metformin treatment should be&#xD;
             stopped the day before iodinated contrast administration. Metformin can be resumed on&#xD;
             the day after last iodinated contrast was administered to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease and abnormal liver&#xD;
             function tests (previously documented alanine aminotransferase greater than 40 IU/dL&#xD;
             and/or plasma aspartate aminotransferase greater than 45 IU/d); patients who have a&#xD;
             history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease but whose most recent liver function&#xD;
             tests have been documented as normal will be eligible to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than 1.3 mg/dL&#xD;

             supplemental oxygen treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a current history (in the past 30 days) of heavy drinking which is&#xD;
             defined in accordance with CDC definition as more than 8 drinks per week for women and&#xD;
             more than 15 drinks per week for men. A standard drink contains .6 ounces of pure&#xD;
             alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in 12-ounces of beer,&#xD;
             8-ounces of malt liquor, 5-ounces of wine, 1.5-ounces or a &quot;shot&quot; of 80-proof&#xD;
             distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey). While on study,&#xD;
             patients should limit their alcohol consumption to no more than 8 drinks per week for&#xD;
             women and no more than 15 drinks per week for men. Patients who feel they cannot&#xD;
