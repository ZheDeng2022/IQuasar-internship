      Probiotics for spinal inflammatory end-plate changes, so-called Modic changes, a randomised&#xD;
      controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modic changes are inflammatory end-plate changes primarily affecting the lower lumbar levels.&#xD;
      They are associated with disc degeneration, disc herniation and age, and are only seen on&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, not on X-ray. Three different types of Modic&#xD;
      changes have been described, type 1, 2 and 3, the latter being rare [5]. It has been shown&#xD;
      that type 1, but not type 2, is associated with more intense low back pain (LBP) and worse&#xD;
      LBP outcome including a lower rate of return to work [7]. In addition, more inflammatory&#xD;
      cells have been identified in this type of structural abnormality [25]. Modic changes may&#xD;
      affect up to 20% of the general population and more than the double proportion in clinical&#xD;
      populations, type 1 and 2 being about equally represented [6]. The investigators have&#xD;
      estimated that at least 5,000 of the patients, who are referred to secondary health care in&#xD;
      Denmark for LBP per year, will suffer from type 1 Modic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a hypothesis of infection as the cause of Modic changes, a randomised clinical trial&#xD;
      with one year follow-up has been performed [16]. This trial documented significant effect of&#xD;
      long-term (100 days) broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid) in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 Modic changes. However, infection in Modic changes has not been&#xD;
      documented convincingly in this or in other studies, and almost all of the treatment effect&#xD;
      occurred after the antibiotic treatment was stopped. As yet, the study has not been&#xD;
      replicated. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment effect may have been caused by&#xD;
      an effect on the gut microbiom possibly explaining the delay of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics have been shown to influence interleukins in patients with inflammatory conditions&#xD;
      and in healthy volunteers [32, 36, 37].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are therefore performing a randomised trial to study the clinical effect of&#xD;
      probiotics on type 1 Modic changes as well as the effect on interleukin levels. The trial is&#xD;
      designed as a randomised, clinical, double blind, placebo-controlled trial taking place at&#xD;
      the Spine Center, Silkeborg Regional Hospital. Power calculation was based on a smaller&#xD;
      treatment effect than the effect found in the study above and resulted in the requirement of&#xD;
      including 94 patients. One-year follow-up is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (DicoflorÂ®) for the trial, as this strain&#xD;
      has been used in several clinical studies. The dietary supplement has been shown to influence&#xD;
      relevant interleukins significantly, and it has been proven to be stable in action and safe,&#xD;
      also in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive result of such a trial may have significant consequences. The perspective of using&#xD;
      probiotics instead of antibiotics in this common disorder is very attractive. At the time&#xD;
      being, many type 1 Modic patients in Denmark and other western countries are treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics. This is of great concern because of side effects and possible drug resistance&#xD;
      development of bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Technology Transfer Office of Aarhus University is involved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background information on trial preparation The bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is an&#xD;
      anaerobic gram-positive rod that among other areas exists as a part of the body's normal&#xD;
      intestinal flora. In the intestine the bacteria breaks down carbohydrates to form lactic&#xD;
      acid. The bacteria is tolerant to low pH conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus are used in industrial processing of milk products, and medically as&#xD;
      a probiotic in order to balance the natural intestinal flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus is considered to be very safe and has been used during pregnancy in&#xD;
      several studies [1, 2]. However, two cases of sepsis have been reported when using this&#xD;
      probiotic [1, 2], one case in a patient with diabetes and one case in a heart-surgery&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose In a placebo-controlled randomized study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether there are effects of prolonged treatment with probiotics in patients&#xD;
           with prolonged back pain and type 1 Modic changes in the lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether there can be measured a change in immunological activity in relation&#xD;
           to treatment, and whether this change is related to the treatment with probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether type 1 Modic changes transform differently on magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI) during the first year in participants receiving probiotics as compared to&#xD;
           participants who did not receive probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will be able to show the effect of 100 days of continuous treatment with&#xD;
           Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in participants with back pain of more than 3 months duration&#xD;
           and type 1 Modic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It can be shown that there is a difference in the activity of the immune system measured&#xD;
           by Interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and TNF-alpha dependent on whether&#xD;
           participants where treated with placebo or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On MRI, Modic changes in the probiotic group more often will change from type 1 to type&#xD;
           2 as compared to the control group during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Modic changes (MC) are inflammatory changes in the end plates of the vertebrae,&#xD;
      also known as end plate edema [3]. MC occur at a median of 6% in the general population and a&#xD;
      median of 43% in clinical populations in the secondary sector [4]. In patients on sick leave&#xD;
      do to lumbar back pain MC is detected in 60% [5]. The changes can be seen on MR imaging, but&#xD;
      not on X-ray [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MC occur more frequently in patients who have had a herniated disc and rarely occur when&#xD;
      there are no degenerative changes in the discs [6, 7]. They usually occur at the level of&#xD;
      L4-5 and L5-S1 and more frequently with age like degenerative changes [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      MC are divided into types 1, 2 and 3, the latter being rare. The classification is based on&#xD;
      histology and configuration on MR imaging [3, 7]. Histologically, fissures and granulation in&#xD;
      the end plate characterize type 1. In type 2 the destruction of the end plate is more&#xD;
      pronounced and there is a fatty degeneration extending into the bone marrow. In type 3 there&#xD;
      is a sclerosing of the bone tissue, which is also visible in x-rays, but can also have&#xD;
      another cause. On MRI, type 1 changes are low signalling on T1-weighted sequences and high&#xD;
      signalling on T2-weighted sequences, whereas type 2 changes are high signalling in both&#xD;
      sequences. Type 3 changes appear as low signalling on both T1 and T2-weighted sequences [8].&#xD;
      In addition, there are a so-called mixed type Modic changes with both type 1 and 2 in the&#xD;
      same lesion. Finally, Type 1 and Type 2 may occur in different vertebrae in the same patient&#xD;
      [9]. Type 2 are usually seen more often, but may also occur less frequent in some patient&#xD;
      populations. According to the literature, about 40% of MC type 1 change into type 2, up to&#xD;
      20% may disappear again, and 40-50% remained stable or increase in size during 1-2 years.&#xD;
      Type 2 and 3 may remain unchanged, disappear or change to a different type. Major changes&#xD;
      remain more stable than small change [9]. It has been shown that type 1, including the mixed&#xD;
      type, can result in severe degenerative changes [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cross-sectional studies MC are more closely associated with pain than other degenerative&#xD;
      changes in the spine, particularly type 1 [11, 12]. Patients with type 1 MC more often wake&#xD;
      up at night because of pain and are often bothered by more than one hour of morning stiffness&#xD;
      (inflammatory back pain). They also often experience pain in extension [13]. There have&#xD;
      published three studies including patients with type 1 MC clearly showing that type 1 MC is&#xD;
      associated with a poor one-year prognosis in regard to disability and pain [7, 11, 16], and&#xD;
      Modic changes have been shown to be an independent risk factor for a severe episode of back&#xD;
      pain [17]. Other degenerative manifestations hardly seem to adversely affect the prognosis&#xD;
      [14]. Finally, the investigators have shown that type 1 MC is associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of unsuccessful return to work also when adjusted for other established risk factors [5].&#xD;
      Another cohort study showed no prognostic significance of MC probably due to a low prevalence&#xD;
      of MC in that study (14%) [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous treatment of MC Since MC represent areas of inflammation, it has been recommended&#xD;
      that patients with MC should be less physically active and avoid weight load [16]. However, a&#xD;
      controlled, prospective study did not show differences in pain and function after a program&#xD;
      focusing on rest, compared with the usual active training program for lower back pain, which&#xD;
      is why this advice is no longer relevant [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are casuistic reports on temporary effect of treatment with corticosteroids, either as&#xD;
      tablets or injection into the disc, but no controlled studies [13]. Some retrospective cohort&#xD;
      studies [18, 19] have suggested a better effect of the back surgery in patients with type 1&#xD;
      compared with other patients, but other studies have suggested a lower rate of healing [9,&#xD;
      23]. There are no randomized prospective studies on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection hypothesis There is no evidence of bacteria in MC [20], but there is evidence of an&#xD;
      increased number of TNF-immunoreactive cells in type 1 changes as compared to type 2 changes&#xD;
      [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have identified bacteriae in disc tissue in up to 50% of patients underwenting&#xD;
      surgery for herniated disc, most frequently Proprionibacterium acnes, which is usually a&#xD;
      benign skin bacteria [21]. These findings have led to the hypotheses of a low-grade infection&#xD;
      as a possible cause of MC, since disc herniation has been shown to be a risk factor for&#xD;
      subsequent occurrence of MC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An uncontrolled study suggested effect of Bioclavid treatment [22], a commonly used drug&#xD;
      amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, which is commonly used for exacerbation of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease. January 2013, the results of a double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial with 1 year follow-up was published comprising of 160 patients with type 1 MC&#xD;
      showing efficacy of treatment with Bioclavid, 1 tablet twice daily for 100 days. There were&#xD;
      only moderate differences in pain and function during the treatment period with antibiotics,&#xD;
      but increasing difference between intervention and control group during the follow-up period&#xD;
      the following 9 months [16]. The treatment duration was chosen pragmatically from current&#xD;
      practice in patients with spondylodiscitis. However, Modic patients do not have fever or&#xD;
      elevated sedimentation rate. Included were only patients with verified herniated disc Â½ - 2&#xD;
      years previously, patients with pain of more than 6 months duration and back pain intensity&#xD;
      the previous 2 weeks â¥ 6 of 10. More than half of the patients had gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects, but there were no serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very modest impact of antibiotics during the first 100 days, but subsequently pronounced&#xD;
      effect during the follow-up period, gave the present investigators reason to assume that the&#xD;
      treatment effect was not caused by the antibiotic treatment itself, but rather by the&#xD;
      consequent changes of the intestinal flora. Usually, the effect antibiotic treatment in&#xD;
      infections occur more more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of the immune system IL-6 is a marker of inflammation, and plasma IL-6 can be&#xD;
      increased both by infections and by autoimmune activation [23]. Recent studies suggest that&#xD;
      the IL-6 by disc degeneration plays a role in the interaction with other cytokines,&#xD;
      particularly IL-1 and TNF-alpha [24], and in particular for the activation of macrophages&#xD;
      [25]. A cross-sectional study in patients with low back pain has shown an association between&#xD;
      IL-6 concentration, pain and poor sleep quality [26]. By measuring changes in IL-6 levels in&#xD;
      relation to treatment with probiotics or placebo, the investigators will be able to see&#xD;
      whether probiotics can reduce the overall IL-6 and TNF-alpha production in the body and&#xD;
      increase the production of IL-10. The investigators suspect that IL-6 and TNF-alpha will&#xD;
      decrease after the start of probiotic treatment, and that it will increase again after ending&#xD;
      treatment with probiotics, in contrast to IL-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion The investigators consider it important to clarify whether probiotic therapy has&#xD;
      clinically relevant effect on disability and pain in patients with type 1 Modic changes, and&#xD;
      whether this will result in detectable changes in inflammation markers and modifications to&#xD;
      Modic changes over time. A positive result may open up for an alternative effective, low-risk&#xD;
      and low-cost treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the probiotic The probiotic product Dicoflor Â® (Pharma Force Aps) is used, as it&#xD;
      contains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the most commonly used bacterial strain in clinical&#xD;
      trials. Each capsule contains 6 billion lactic acid bacteriae. The recommended dose is 1&#xD;
      capsule twice daily. The effect of this dietary supplement has been studied in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis [32] and demonstrated as an effect on TNF-Î± and IL-8 [27-29]. The&#xD;
      bacterial strain has been used for children with atopic dermatitis, with a demonstrated&#xD;
      effect on IL-10 [30]. Furthermore, the effect on the immune system has been studied in&#xD;
      healthy adults [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized double-blind clinically controlled study with 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up and 2&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Probiotic Dicoflor Â® twice daily for 100 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: Placebo twice daily for 100 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Web-based automated bloc randomization was established by the Data Manager&#xD;
      Jakob Hjort and created in the database RedCap, belonging to the Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Medicine, Aarhus University Department. Only one person, project assistant PhD Nanna Rolving,&#xD;
      Diagnostic Center, Regional Hospital Silkeborg, knows the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location Spine Center (The Research Unit), Diagnostic Center, Regional Hospital Silkeborg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ole Kudsk Jensen, MD PhD is sponsor-investigator. A junior doctor (MHA) is in charge of the&#xD;
      practical implementation of the project, which is planned as part of a PhD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Study participants are recruited among the patients referred to the Spine Center,&#xD;
      Silkeborg Regional Hospital, comprising the Surgical Unit (K-RYG), the Medical Unit (M-RYG)&#xD;
      and the Research Unit (F-RYG). After having received the usual intervention in the Spine&#xD;
      Center (surgical intervention not indicated), the patients are informed about the study and&#xD;
      given written information with a telephone number allowing them to contact the Research Unit,&#xD;
      if they are interested in participating in the study. Most participants are recruited from&#xD;
      the Medical Unit taking care of the vast majority of the patients of the Spine Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, an MRI of the lumbar spine is available when a referral from a general practitioner&#xD;
      is received. If MRI is not available, it usually will be ordered by a physician at the Spine&#xD;
      Center to clarify the condition in relating to clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual interventions of M-RYG and F-RYG are very similar. The patients complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire. A physician, chiropractor or physiotherapist, who subsequently conduct a&#xD;
      clinical back examination, take a medical history. The clinical issues and MR images are&#xD;
      discussed between physician, chiropractor and physiotherapist. If there is a need for further&#xD;
      tests or imaging, this is ordered. In M-RYG and F-RYG patients receive general information&#xD;
      about back pain, including both the general poor correlation between imaging and pain, the&#xD;
      importance of exercising, general exercise or training, and finally that psychological&#xD;
      factors can have an impact on back pain. Considerations are made whether medical pain&#xD;
      treatment needs adjustment, and whether assessment by a surgeon should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI is assessed by the examining physician and discussed with an affiliated physician&#xD;
      from the Department of Radiology at the Regional Hospital in Silkeborg [32].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient has received the usual intervention in M-RYG, F-RYG or in K-RYG, and Modic&#xD;
      type 1 or mixed Modic changes have been identified on MRI of the lumbar spine, the patient is&#xD;
      told that this structural change may be a contributing factor to pain and may cause the pain&#xD;
      and disability to be prolonged. The patient is then informed about the present Modic project&#xD;
      and offered an opportunity to participate. If the patient expresses interest in participating&#xD;
      they are given written information on the study. The information includes the phone number of&#xD;
      the secretary at F-Ryg. The patient is advised to contact if the secretary after reading the&#xD;
      information if still interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline When the patient phones the secretary of F-RYG, a visit at F-RYG is planned to&#xD;
      finally decide whether in- and exclusion criteriae are fulfilled. When meeting at F-RYG, the&#xD;
      participant-information is discussed. If the patient is still interested and there are no&#xD;
      exclusion criteriae, a medical record and a clinical back examination are performed.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a blood sample is taken. Afterwards, the patient is examined and guided by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist regarding plan for physical activity. If lab tests are normal and there are&#xD;
      no exclusion criteria, and all inclusion criteria are met, a consent form is signed, and the&#xD;
      participant is included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician ensures that the participant is given proper information in regard to back pain&#xD;
      in general and specifically in relation to the patient's situation. The medical pain&#xD;
      management is adjusted if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of function is recorded (self-assessed walking distance, maximum time sitting down,&#xD;
      nocturnal pain). The mobility of the spine is measured (modified Schober, side bending,&#xD;
      bending backwards), and it is registered whether there are signs of nerve root compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is informed about the possibility of an assessment by a surgeon during the study&#xD;
      period , if there is any worsening or no improvement of the condition. Indications for&#xD;
      referral to a surgeon adheres to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is on sick leave, the person is advised to resume work when possible. No case&#xD;
      manager is assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapist registers self-rated loss of functioning in percent, and evaluates the&#xD;
      pain response during testing in order to ensure that the patient is appropriately informed&#xD;
      about specific exercises, exercise in general and &quot;pacing&quot; principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up appointment with the physiotherapist is arranged after 14 days. Clinical data are&#xD;
      recorded in schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dispensing of capsules with dietary supplements / placebo After randomization, the capsules&#xD;
      are handed out to the participant in blister packs, and compliance is recorded in a diary.&#xD;
      The participants are advised to take the capsules at 08 and 18 at meals, and are recommended&#xD;
      to save emptied blister packs. The capsules are recommended to be stored in a refrigerator.&#xD;
      They can also be stored at room temperature. The capsules are designed so that placebo&#xD;
      capsules are indistinguishable from active capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is advised against the use of other preparations containing other lactic acid&#xD;
      bacteria, for example Paraghurt or Idoform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data in addition to clinical findings Questionnaire data: Before clinical&#xD;
      examination by the doctor and physiotherapist a comprehensive questionnaire is completed&#xD;
      including questions of back pain and leg pain during the preceding 14 days [33], limitations&#xD;
      of function at the examination day [34], possibly previous surgery for herniated disc, fear&#xD;
      avoidance, work, possibly sick leave and duration, questions about perceived cause of the&#xD;
      pain, questions about exercise during leisure time, type of housing, psychological symptoms,&#xD;
      tobacco and alcohol consumption and the use of pain medication. How these questions are&#xD;
      answered, have previously been shown to be important for prognosis [35, 36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Generally: If symptoms of nerve root irritation occur during the study, the&#xD;
      participant may contact the Research Unit for an additional clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 14 days: The physiotherapist makes adjustments to the exercise program. In addition,&#xD;
      blood samples are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 102 Days: The participant meets with project nurse and returns the emptied blister&#xD;
      packs, complete a questionnaire (pain, function, possibly other treatment), and blood samples&#xD;
      are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months after initiation of the treatment the project nurse records the level of pain and&#xD;
      function by phone or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 months after initiation of the treatment the participant attends for a new consultation&#xD;
      including a questionnaire, blood tests and a new standardized clinical assessment. A new MRI&#xD;
      scan is ordered of the lumbar spine to assess the extent to which the previously diagnosed&#xD;
      Modic type 1 change is unchanged or has changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the project is ended, the MRI changes will be described standardized [38] at baseline&#xD;
      and 1 year without knowledge of clinical information and intervention group (blinded&#xD;
      description).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status with regards to sick leave is determined based on the DREAM database [37].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are taken before starting treatment, partly as routine tests with regards to&#xD;
      inclusion, partly as project samples, which are then frozen. Routine tests include: CRP,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, ALAT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for the biobank: IL-6, IL-1 0 and TNF-alpha and an extra sample for future&#xD;
      reference and possible additional analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, additional blood samples are taken after 14 days, 102 days and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 4 x 7 ml of blood is taken for routine tests and 4 x 6 ml for project samples.&#xD;
      Project samples are stored in the biobank and destroyed at the end of the full study&#xD;
      including the research period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of possible adverse effects Unwanted side effects or possible side effects are&#xD;
      recorded as an adverse event in RedCap and reported to the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no available product summary, since the product is registered as dietary supplement.&#xD;
      There are no known side effects when using the product in people with a normally functioning&#xD;
      immune system. Therefore, any potential side effect will be an unexpected side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections during the study are assessed and treated by the general practiioner as usual. If&#xD;
      the participant is admitted at hospital for infection, the Research Unit should be contacted&#xD;
      with regard to evaluating possibly precautions. If there is an infection and bacteraemia with&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria or lactic acid bacteria, the medication will be discontinued and the&#xD;
      randomization code broken. The case will be reported to the Ethics Committee. Possible&#xD;
      causality should be assessed before unblinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects and possible discontinuation of the preparation is recorded in the journal and&#xD;
      in RedCap, which is used as 'Case Report Form'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data are made anonymous, so that each patient can only be identified by a&#xD;
      serial number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of power Power calculation is based on the findings of the placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study [16] and on the assumption that treatment with probiotics will be less effective than&#xD;
      treatment with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changing of the median values of function in the intervention group and the control group at&#xD;
      1 year were 8 and 1, respectively, in the previously mentioned study. It was assumed, that&#xD;
      the mean values were not different from the median values. The standard deviations were not&#xD;
      specified in the article [16], only the interquartiles that were comparable with data from a&#xD;
      previous study made by the investigators [5]. The standard deviation was 6.3 in that study.&#xD;
      Using a standard deviation of 6.5, a clinically relevant change was estimated to be 5 instead&#xD;
      of 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength calculation was made by STATA [38] (Î² = 0.8, Î± = 0.05): Requiring 42 patients in&#xD;
      each group, to be able to detect a difference of '5' in functioning after 1 year compared to&#xD;
      '1' in the control group. Assuming a drop-out rate at 10% will result in the need for a group&#xD;
      size of 47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The difference between 1-year function and baseline is analyzed by unpaired t-test, if the&#xD;
      data are normally distributed, and with Wilcoxon's test for unpaired data, if the data are&#xD;
      not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion with minimal loss of function is compared with Chi 2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. And 3) are analyzed by unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon's test for unpaired data, depending&#xD;
           on whether the data are normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) To be analyzed with Wilcoxon's test for unpaired data. 5) Compared by Chi 2 test. 6)&#xD;
      Difference in number of operated is tested with Fishers exact test, the figures are assumed&#xD;
      to be small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) Most significant change is the decrease or increase in IL-6 levels respectively after&#xD;
      starting treatment and after treatment discontinuation, which is tested with paired t-test&#xD;
      within the groups and unpaired t-test between groups, possibly with a Wilcoxon's test, if the&#xD;
      data are not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) And 9, 10) Compared by Chi 2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 'Intention to treat' principle will be used, which means all randomized patients are&#xD;
      included in the analysis, independent of their compliance with treatment or if operation was&#xD;
      necessary. In the case of lacking follow-up data, baseline data will be entered (last&#xD;
      observation carried forward).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significance level of 5% will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations It is considered consistent with good ethical standard to offer&#xD;
      participation in a randomized trial, which deals with a preparation that is usually well&#xD;
      tolerated and may have efficacy, and as an alternative to prolonged antibiotic therapy, which&#xD;
      is used in some places and is not without risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is good evidence that patients with type 1 Modic changes are at higher risk than other&#xD;
      back pain patients for persistent pain and disability and even problems with return to work.&#xD;
      The latter is of special importance, not only for the quality of life but also economically,&#xD;
      both for the individual patient and for society. It can be estimated that about 20% of&#xD;
      patients referred to secondary health care have type 1 Modic changes, and it is estimated&#xD;
      that at least 20,000 patients are referred to the hospitals in Denmark, due to low back pain.&#xD;
      This may imply that a therapy with clinically relevant effect may be offered to about 4,000&#xD;
      patients annually in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review and Approvals Application for approval by the Research Ethics Committee, Central&#xD;
      Jutland, and the experiment reported to www.ClinicalTrials.gov and the Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency. The Department of Health has announced that the trial should not be run as drug&#xD;
      trials, and therefore there is no need for supervision from GCP unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule Inclusion of the participants has started January 2016, and by now (end of&#xD;
      March 2017) 91 participants have been included. One-year follow-up of all participants will&#xD;
      end at April 2018. Data analysis and article writing are planned in 2018-19.&#xD;
