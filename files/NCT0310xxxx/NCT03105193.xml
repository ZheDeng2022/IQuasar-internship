      The aim of this study is to investigate the analgesic effects of intraperitoneal lignocaine&#xD;
      (IPL) compared with intravenous lignocaine (IVL) after laparoscopic colon resections. We plan&#xD;
      to run a 2 group randomized, double blind, clinical trial which will look into morphine&#xD;
      consumption as the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (IV lignocaine)- IV bolus of lignocaine and a 3 day post operative IV lignocaine&#xD;
      infusion. Intra peritoneal (IP) bolus of normal saline + 3 day post operative IP normal&#xD;
      saline infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (IP lignocaine)- IV bolus of normal saline and a 3 day post operative IV normal&#xD;
      saline infusion. IP bolus of lignocaine + 3 day post operative IP lignocaine infusion&#xD;

      Over the last 20 years, laparoscopic colonic surgery has become an accepted first-line&#xD;
      treatment for colon cancer. A population-based study showed that laparoscopic colonic&#xD;
      resections can be performed with lower hospital costs up to 90 days after discharge when&#xD;
      compared to open surgery. Laparoscopic colonic resections have also been associated with&#xD;
      fewer postoperative complications and lower mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New Zealand has one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world, and it is the second&#xD;
      highest cause of cancer deaths in New Zealand. With the implementation of a bowel screening&#xD;
      programme in New Zealand, the projected numbers of stage 1 bowel cancers are expected to&#xD;
      increase. More avenues to improve perioperative care need to be explored to improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlling postoperative pain effectively has been shown to reduce the length of hospital&#xD;
      stay and improve patient/clinical outcomes. Opioids work as μ-receptor agonists in the spinal&#xD;
      cord and brain, and although opioids are excellent at reducing pain, they are associated with&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, dizziness, decreased blood pressure, and urinary retention. Epidurals have&#xD;
      been incorporated into Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for controlling&#xD;
      post-operative pain. However, epidurals are an invasive procedure with significant side&#xD;
      effects such as hypotension, urinary retention, respiratory depression, motor blockade and&#xD;
      rarely epidural abscess and meningitis. It has also been shown that up to 30 percent of&#xD;
      epidural catheters dislodge, block or leak. These complications have led to a movement&#xD;
      towards other regional analgesia techniques which allow local anaesthetic (LA) to target the&#xD;
      abdominal wound specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA) has shown promise in reducing pain after colonic&#xD;
      surgery with a meta-analysis9, and a recent IPLA colorectal study conducted at Counties&#xD;
      Manukau health showing that it reduces pain and opioid use over and above the effect of an&#xD;
      epidural10, which is primarily aimed at the abdominal wound. After an IPLA bolus serum local&#xD;
      anaesthetic levels are detectable within 2 minutes. Some studies show reduced early&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid consumption with intravenous lignocaine infusion alone. The&#xD;
      question remains however if there is a benefit from using intraperitoneal local anaesthetic&#xD;
      compared to administering it intravenously as the IPLA should block both the intraabdominal&#xD;
      wound, via a local action, and the skin wound via a systemic action.. This has been&#xD;
      investigated in four studies, however none of these studies compared intravenous local&#xD;
      anaesthetic (IVLA) and IPLA for colon resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is that, by optimising analgesia regimes using local anaesthetic, we can improve&#xD;
      patient experience of pain and recovery thereby achieving an earlier discharge and early&#xD;
      recovery from surgery. This has significant economic benefits for all involved.&#xD;
