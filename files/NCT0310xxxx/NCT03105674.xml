  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test the magnitude and duration of analgesia provided by single dose&#xD;
      multi-drug analgesia administered for perianal block, and compare with standard solution&#xD;
      (Marcaine &amp; Lidocaine in 1:1 mixture - Total 60 ml), at post-operative period and also to&#xD;
      compare with the standard solution including their respective post-operative opioid or&#xD;
      non-opioid oral analgesic requirement. Local anesthesia via a perianal block using multi-drug&#xD;
      analgesia or standard solution will be compared using the Numeric pain rating scale on&#xD;
      Post-operative day 1, 3 and during follow up visit on day 7. The investigators hope to find a&#xD;
      better control of post-operative analgesia which will lead to better functional outcomes.&#xD;
      Possible decrease consumption of opioids in the post-operative period will perhaps decrease&#xD;
      the cost and chances of addiction and will increase patient comfort and compliance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-operative analgesia after anorectal surgery still poses a significant problem. Technical&#xD;
      or operator dependent factors have been proposed for causing severe pain post operatively.&#xD;
      Many factors such as height of anastomosis, incorporation of smooth muscle, size of doughnut,&#xD;
      and inclusion of squamous epithelium were considered to cause pain specially after&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy. However, in spite of standardizing the techniques, patients still&#xD;
      experience moderate to severe pain after anorectal surgery. Effective post-surgical pain&#xD;
      control is critical to patient recovery, and can contribute to improved healing, faster&#xD;
      patient mobilization, reduced hospital stays and health care costs. Effective multimodal&#xD;
      techniques have been devised to maximize pain relief, lower the risk of adverse events, and&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes. These techniques (wound infiltration with local anesthetic being&#xD;
      most common) is short lived, maximum up to 12 hours. Post-operative pain usually lasts for 72&#xD;
      hours and thus the systemic opioids remain the mainstay pain control post-operatively.&#xD;
      Although effective analgesics, they are associated with unwanted and potentially adverse&#xD;
      events, such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, cognitive impairment, urinary&#xD;
      retention, sleep disturbances, and respiratory depression. Also, narcotic addiction remains a&#xD;
      concern for surgical patients. Some patients would like to have effective analgesia and thus&#xD;
      also avoid narcotics.Multi-drug analgesic combinations are used in orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      (Ropivacaine, Ketorolac, and Morphine, with adrenaline) and during hemorrhoidectomy&#xD;
      (extended-release liposome Bupivacaine) which showed decrease in post-operative analgesia&#xD;
      requirement. However, no studies that used multi-drug analgesia show any effect on the pain&#xD;
      medication consumption after discharge for ambulatory surgery. The investigators have&#xD;
      designed a novel multi-drug anesthetic formulation to achieve long-acting postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia with single-dose administration intra-operative via perianal block and wound&#xD;
      infiltration.&#xD;
