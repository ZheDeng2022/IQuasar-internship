  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) need a safe and&#xD;
      effective long-term treatment regimen. Unfortunately, there are still no disease-specific&#xD;
      treatment for ADPKD approved in the US. A rational step towards identifying such agents is to&#xD;
      test therapies that have a proven safety profile with mechanisms of action that can counter&#xD;
      the disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether drinking increased amounts of water&#xD;
      (water loading) might slow down polycystic kidney growth or kidney function decline. Water&#xD;
      loading can cause the suppression of a pathway that causes fluid buildup and cyst growth.&#xD;
      High water intake has been safely used in the clinical setting, such as in the case of kidney&#xD;
      stone therapy. New York State tap water is widely available and safe, making it highly&#xD;
      cost-effective as well.&#xD;

      The study will involve 11 visits to the study site over 19 months. Participants will need to&#xD;
      follow specific dietary and fluid recommendations. There will be physical examinations and&#xD;
      medical history assessments at each visit. Testing will include undergoing magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), blood and urine tests. Study participants will be compensated for their time.&#xD;
      Detailed study procedures will be reviewed upon contact with the study team.&#xD;
