      Aim: To develop a nurse-led, home-based self-management psychosocial education programme,&#xD;
      entitled HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme (HOM-HEMP), and evaluate its&#xD;
      effects on improving heart failure self-care, cardiac self-efficacy, health-related quality&#xD;
      of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, perceived social support, and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      among patients with heart failure in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The number of elderly people is expected to increase in the coming decades, and&#xD;
      so too the prevalence of with chronic heart failure (HF) is expected to increase. Since HF is&#xD;
      a chronic condition, there is a need to develop programmes that will improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of older patients who have to manage this condition for years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A stratified, three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HOM-HEMP is designed a six-week home-based psychosocial education programme comprising of&#xD;
      a specifically developed HF education and self-management toolkit and three biweekly home&#xD;
      visits by the research nurse. In addition, participants in experimental group B will receive&#xD;
      a supplementary smartphone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consecutive sample of 213 patients with HF will be recruited from the cardiac ward of a&#xD;
      tertiary public hospital in Singapore. They will be randomly assigned to the control group,&#xD;
      or experimental group A (HOM-HEMP without App) or the experimental group B (HOM-HEMP with&#xD;
      App). A research nurse will be delivering the HOM-HEMP intervention to the participants in&#xD;
      the experimental groups, while another research assistant who is blinded to participants'&#xD;
      group assignment will be responsible for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline, at 6 weeks from baseline (i.e. immediate after the&#xD;
      intervention), and at 3 and 6 months from the baseline. At the end of the programme, a&#xD;
      process evaluation will be conducted to assess the acceptability, strengths and weaknesses of&#xD;
      the HOM-HEMP based on the participants' perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: It is expected the proposed RCT will make a contribution to knowledge development&#xD;
      of the effectiveness of the HOM-HEMP and the active ingredients of the programme.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a nurse-led, home-based self-management psychosocial education programme,&#xD;
           entitled HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme (HOM-HEMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine its effectiveness on improving HF self-care, cardiac self-efficacy, anxiety&#xD;
           and depression levels, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), perceived social support,&#xD;
           and clinical outcomes among patients with HF in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomised into one of the three groups: a Control Group&#xD;
      (receiving usual care), an Experimental Group A (receiving HOM-HEMP without a supplementary&#xD;
      smartphone App), and an Experimental Group B (receiving HOM-HEMP with a supplementary&#xD;
      smartphone App).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that participants in the Experimental Group A or B as compared with&#xD;
      participants in the Control Group will have significantly:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Better HF self-care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Better cardiac self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lower levels of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Better HRQoL&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Better perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Better clinical outcomes, including improved NYHA functional class, and less unplanned&#xD;
           health service utilization (i.e. unplanned medical consultation, emergency department&#xD;
           visit due to heart disease, and hospital readmissions due to heart disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach adopted in the development of HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme&#xD;
      (HOM-HEMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HOM-HEMP, is designed as a six-week home-based psychosocial education programme&#xD;
      comprising of a specifically developed HF education and self-management toolkit and three&#xD;
      biweekly home visits by the research nurse. The duration of the programme is determined based&#xD;
      on the literature, in which the psychosocial interventions for patients with HF varied from&#xD;
      two to 16 weeks across studies, with the average length being six weeks. In addition,&#xD;
      participants in Experimental Group B will receive a supplementary smartphone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOM-HEMP Education and Self-Management Toolkit Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toolkit will be developed for the participants to use whenever they encounter problems&#xD;
      related to their condition at home. Participants can always read the education manual in the&#xD;
      toolkit by themselves or with their family members/caregivers repeatedly to reinforce the&#xD;
      learning of key information. The toolkit is therefore an important element of the whole&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the content of the toolkit will follow patient-centred principle, which&#xD;
      will be driven by patients' needs. The results of our recent study exploring the needs and&#xD;
      living experiences of patients with HF in Singapore will be used to guide the research team&#xD;
      to develop the toolkit. This is an important part of the development of the toolkit because&#xD;
      it is crucial to ensure that the information presented is updated and relevant for local&#xD;
      patients. This will help patients to make the necessary changes (e.g. healthier local food&#xD;
      options instead of their current unhealthy choices) in their lifestyle, which is a key part&#xD;
      of the recovery process. Another key emphasis of the development of the HF education manual&#xD;
      is the psychosocial-related content which includes relaxation techniques, stress management,&#xD;
      family and social support, and symptoms monitoring (e.g. shortness of breath, angina).The&#xD;
      content of the HOM-HEMP education manual will include: (1) HF facts (e.g. definition, risk&#xD;
      factors, signs and symptoms), and self-care principles, (2) stress and anxiety management&#xD;
      (e.g. stress coping strategies, relaxation techniques), (3) medication management (e.g.&#xD;
      effects and side-effects of medication), (4) physical exercises, (5) dietary and fluid&#xD;
      management including practice tips, (6) smoking cessation (for smokers), and (7) family and&#xD;
      social support (for family members and caregivers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel of experts will be invited to validate the content of the toolkit to ensure it is&#xD;
      relevant and helpful. The panel will include cardiologist, cardiac advanced practice nurse&#xD;
      (APN), cardiac case manager, and one researcher who have experience in developing and running&#xD;
      psychosocial education programmes. Special attention on the readability of the manual for&#xD;
      older people will be considered when we design the manual, e.g. large-type print, short&#xD;
      sentences, avoidance of medical terminology and jargon. Two lay HF patients will be also&#xD;
      invited to review the drafted content. It is assuming that the educational level of most&#xD;
      potential users would be at the lower end of reading skill required the easy use of written&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOM-HEMP Smartphone App Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      A smartphone app will be developed by a team of software engineers from School of Computing,&#xD;
      National University of Singapore. The content and scope of the app will be mainly guided&#xD;
      based on the content of the toolkit. The proposed functions included in the app are: (1)&#xD;
      visual material including video clips of educational talks given by heart experts (e.g.&#xD;
      triggering factors of CHF, signs and symptoms of CHF), relaxation techniques (e.g. deep&#xD;
      breathing, meditation, muscle relaxation), stress management techniques (e.g. stress&#xD;
      alleviating exercise) and recommended physical exercises (e.g. walking exercise, exercise&#xD;
      logs) and Dietary matters (e.g. practical tips of selecting food, healthy recipes to try);&#xD;
      (2) fluid calculator, (3) individualized scheduled reminders for doing exercise and&#xD;
      relaxation, taking medication, medical appointment; salt/fluid targets; (4) weight/vitals&#xD;
      logs (e.g. weight monitor, blood pressure and heart rate monitor with the use of&#xD;
      Bluetooth-enabled devices such as Polar H7 or Wahoo Tickr) and (5) chat room with the&#xD;
      research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app will be designed as &quot;elderly friendly&quot; with features like large font size, using&#xD;
      videos and pictures, and sound/voice reminders. There will be a monitoring function when&#xD;
      participants log in the system. After the development of the app, it will be uploaded to&#xD;
      mobile app stores, and users can download it from Googleplay (for Android users) or Apple app&#xD;
      store (for IOS user) Technical issues such as compatibility, ease of use, potential causes of&#xD;
      crashes will be tested. Once the test is completed, a field test will be conducted with 5&#xD;
      participants and/or their caregivers. They will be required to provide their overall&#xD;
      evaluation of the app, and their feedback regarding the utilization of the app will guide the&#xD;
      study team to further revise the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design, Setting and Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified randomised controlled, three-arm, pretest and repeated posttest design will be&#xD;
      used in this project with both quantitative and qualitative measures. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at the cardiac ward of one of the largest acute public hospitals in Singapore.&#xD;
      After the baseline measurements, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      three groups using stratified randomization. These three groups are: the Control Group, in&#xD;
      which participants will receive usual care; the Experimental Group A, in which participants&#xD;
      will receive usual care and the HOM-HEMP intervention but without the supplementary&#xD;
      smartphone app; the Experimental Group B, in which participants will receive the usual care,&#xD;
      the HOM-HEMP intervention and the supplementary smartphone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One research nurse (RN) will be trained to conduct the intervention, and another research&#xD;
      assistant (RA) will conduct the data collection. The RN will be responsible for delivering&#xD;
      the HOM-HEMP to the participants (i.e. intervention), while the RA will be responsible for&#xD;
      data collection. The RA will be blinded to participants' group assignment to prevent&#xD;
      subjective bias stemming from the knowledge of grouping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four measurements will be conducted at the baseline prior to the intervention (T0), at 6&#xD;
      weeks from baseline, i.e. immediate after the intervention (T1), at 3 months from the&#xD;
      baseline (T2), and at 6 months from the baseline (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include: Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), Cardiac Self-efficacy&#xD;
      Scale (CSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Minnesota Living with Heart&#xD;
      Failure Questionnaire (MLCHFQ), Short Form of the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6), NYHA&#xD;
      Functional Classification, and unplanned Health service use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at 6 weeks (immediate after the intervention), 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBM SPSS 24.0 will be used for data analysis. Baseline categorical demographic&#xD;
      characteristics across the 3 groups will be examined using Chi-squared or Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      test; quantitative variables using ANOVA if normality and homogeneity assumptions satisfied&#xD;
      otherwise Kruskal Wallis test will be used. General Linear Mixed Model (GLM) will be used to&#xD;
      compare the study outcomes between 2 intervention groups against the Control group using&#xD;
      Dunnett test at each individual time point. To correct for type 1 error on the multiple&#xD;
      comparisons for each time point, statistical significance is set at p &lt; 0.01. For the&#xD;
      differences in the unplanned health service use between the experimental two groups against&#xD;
      the control group, logistic regression will be performed adjusting for relevant covariates. A&#xD;
      repeated measurement analysis will be performed to analyse the trend of groups' numerical&#xD;
      outcomes over time setting significance level at p&lt;0.05 and at two-tailed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all qualitative data obtained from the face-to-face interviews, all audio taped&#xD;
      interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Latent content analysis, which involves an&#xD;
      interpretative reading of the symbolism underlying the surface structure in the text, will be&#xD;
      used for the qualitative data-set. There are three basic steps involved in content analysis&#xD;
      namely, developing meaningful units, developing the set of categories, and developing the&#xD;
      rational and illustration to guide the coding of data into categories. This principle will&#xD;
      guide the researcher to analyze the qualitative data gained from the interviews.&#xD;
