  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-site randomized clinical trial will investigate and compare three treatments for&#xD;
      insomnia in patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for sleep apnea: online&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (OCBT), therapist-directed cognitive behavioral therapy (TCBT),&#xD;
      and standard clinical care. 384 patients will be recruited and will attend up to 15 visits&#xD;
      over 10 months. Visits will include baseline assessment, treatment visits, and post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Visits will involve completion of questionnaires, meeting with therapists,&#xD;
      and a physical exam.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This dual-site randomized clinical trial will use a &quot;SMART&quot; design to test a stepped care&#xD;
      model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1)&#xD;
      augmentation of PAP therapy with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy improves short-term&#xD;
      outcomes of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea(OSA)/insomnia; and (2) providing a higher&#xD;
      intensity 2nd-stage cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to patients who show sub-optimal&#xD;
      short-term outcomes with OCBT+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. After completing&#xD;
      baseline assessment, the 384 comorbid OSA\insomnia patients enrolled will be randomized to a&#xD;
      1st-stage therapy that includes usual care PAP + OCBT (n=288) or UC (usual care PAP + sleep&#xD;
      hygiene education; n=96). Insomnia and OSA will be reassessed after 8 weeks. OCBT recipients&#xD;
      who meet &quot;remission&quot; criteria will continue PAP but be offered no additional insomnia&#xD;
      intervention and will complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8-weeks and&#xD;
      at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT recipients classified as &quot;unremitted&quot; after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd-stage treatment consisting of continued, expanded&#xD;
      engagement in OCBT or a switch to therapist-directed CBT (TCBT). Those receiving the&#xD;
      2nd-stage intervention as well as the UC group will be reassessed after another 8 weeks and&#xD;
      at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points.&#xD;
