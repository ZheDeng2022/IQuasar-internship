  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 500 patients with active psoriatic arthritis in an estimated 80 to&#xD;
      100 trial centers are to be enrolled. Selection of centers will be made by the sponsor's&#xD;
      medical section. To increase the quality of the data and to reduce distribution of the data&#xD;
      collected, centers to be included will be those which can enroll at least 5 patients. Care&#xD;
      will be taken to ensure a balanced regional distribution. The proposed observation period for&#xD;
      the trial is approx. 52 weeks per patient. Estimated patient enrolment is also 52 weeks. The&#xD;
      duration of the follow-up period will be extended from approx. 52 weeks to approx. 100 weeks&#xD;
      to gain further information about the long-term use of Otezla®. For this extension of the&#xD;
      follow-up period 2 new visits (visits 6 and 7) are proposed.Thus, proposed duration from&#xD;
      first patient in (FPI) to last patient out (LPO) is 36 months-&#xD;
