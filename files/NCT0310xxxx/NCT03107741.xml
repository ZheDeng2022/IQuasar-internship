  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious public health problem in Hong Kong and worldwide.&#xD;
      Older adults, the age group with the highest prevalence of MetS, may prefer specific exercise&#xD;
      modalities that are suitable for their regular participation to manage MetS. This project&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi, a very suitable exercise for older adults, to&#xD;
      alleviate MetS in older population&#xD;

      PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious public health problem in Hong Kong&#xD;
      and worldwide. Older adults, the age by specific exercise modalities that are suitable for&#xD;
      regular participation. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi to&#xD;
      alleviate MetS in older population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN &amp; METHODS: This study is a three-arm assesscer blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Older adults aged 50 years or above with abdominal obesity will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      passive control, active control and Tai Chi groups. Subjects assigned to Tai Chi and active&#xD;
      control groups will receive a 12-week intervention of Tai Chi and generic fitness,&#xD;
      respectively. No intervention will be given to the passive control group. Outcome measures&#xD;
      including waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, triglyceride and high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (6&#xD;
      months after the end of intervention) assessments in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that: 1) improvements of waist circumference and other indicators&#xD;
      of MetS are found in Tai Chi group but not in passive control group and 2) improvements of&#xD;
      waist circumference and other indicators of MetS are more profound in Tai Chi group than&#xD;
      active control group.&#xD;
