  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cobimetinib and atezolizumab work in treating&#xD;
      participants with rare tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) or that&#xD;
      does not respond to treatment (refractory). Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cobimetinib and&#xD;
      atezolizumab may work better in treating participants with advanced or refractory rare&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (COTEZO) in cohorts of advanced&#xD;
      rare tumors using objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors&#xD;
      per RECIST v1.1 and immune-related (ir)RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine overall survival (OS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DOR) on COTEZO in&#xD;
      cohorts of advanced rare tumors per RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine objective response rate (ORR) per immune-related RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine safety profile and adverse events encountered by patients with advanced rare&#xD;
      tumors treated with COTEZO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To collect and bank tumor tissue and peripheral blood for future correlative analyses&#xD;
      from patients with advanced rare tumors treated with COTEZO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and atezolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants followed up every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;

             guidelines. Patients must be able to comply with the requirements and assessments of&#xD;
             the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have histologically or cytologically documented rare tumor as defined per&#xD;
             protocol that is metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable. Patients with&#xD;
             locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that are technically resectable but&#xD;
             in whom surgery is expected to lead to substantial function impairment or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be refractory or intolerant to standard lines of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have completed prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy at least&#xD;
             14 days prior to start of treatment and all toxicity must be resolved to Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grade 1 (with the exception of&#xD;

             specimens in paraffin blocks (blocks are preferred) or at least 4 unstained slides,&#xD;
             with an associated pathology report, for testing of tumor PD-L1 expression (tumor&#xD;
             tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is therefore not&#xD;
             acceptable). b. Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor&#xD;
             content. Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion, bone&#xD;
             metastases, and lavage samples are not acceptable. For core-needle biopsy specimens,&#xD;
             at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation. c. Patients who do not have&#xD;
             tissue specimens meeting eligibility requirements must be willing to undergo a biopsy&#xD;

             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly&#xD;
             (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine devices).&#xD;
             At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception may include&#xD;
             total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures compliance.&#xD;
             (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation&#xD;
             methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception)&#xD;
