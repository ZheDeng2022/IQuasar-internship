  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading cause of female cancer and female death by cancer in France.&#xD;
      Despite the improvement in early detection and therapeutic arsenal, the mortality of this&#xD;
      cancer remains high with 11 886 deaths estimated in 2012. Breast cancer is most often a&#xD;
      carcinoma born from the lobular or ductal epithelium and is classified In two main&#xD;
      categories: non invasive and invasive. Invasive breast cancers account for 75% of the cases.&#xD;
      They are usually ductal (75%) and more rarely lobular (25%). The cancer cells are then no&#xD;
      longer circumscribed to the galactophoric canals or glands but have invaded neighboring&#xD;
      tissues. If they are not treated in time, these cancers can then spread: the cancerous cells&#xD;
      will then migrate either by the lymphatic vessels to reach the neighboring ganglia or through&#xD;
      the blood vessels to give metastases in other tissues In the liver, lungs and bones). The&#xD;
      mortality associated with breast cancer is not due to the growth of the primary tumor but&#xD;
      rather to the occurrence of metastases. The study of the mechanisms leading to metastatic&#xD;
      invasion (i.e. migration and invasion) is therefore of considerable importance. The&#xD;
      development of metastases depends on the acquisition by the cancer cells of various&#xD;
      capacities including that of being able to migrate, involving a remodeling of the&#xD;
      cytoskeleton highly dependent on the intracellular calcium (Ca2 +) concentration. Several&#xD;
      types of signals are able to induce mobilization of Ca2 + from the extracellular medium or&#xD;
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reserves. At the intracellular level, some of these signals are&#xD;
      generated by inositol (1,4,5) -trisphosphate (IP3) from the activation of G protein-coupled&#xD;
      receptors or certain receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Has been shown that the&#xD;
      expression, activity and regulation of IP3R receptors (IP3Rs) are involved in the cancerous&#xD;
      processes of many tissues, in particular in the phenomena of proliferation of breast cancer&#xD;
      cells. Overall, altered expression and / or activity of IP3Rs can be used for the survival,&#xD;
      growth, proliferation and migration of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, the investigator showed that regulation of the expression of subtype 3&#xD;
      (IP3R3) by 17Î²-estradiol (E2) is involved in the growth of the human mammary cancer line&#xD;
      MCF-7. E2 triggers the release of Ca2 + in an IP3-dependent mechanism, while prolonged&#xD;
      exposure to E2 leads to an increase in the expression of IP3R3. At the same time, the&#xD;
      reduction in the expression of IP3R3 cancels the proliferative effect of E2 on MCF-7 cells.&#xD;
      More recently, the investigator has established that IP3R3 regulates the proliferation of&#xD;
      cells of the human MCF-7 mammary cancer cell line via a molecular and functional interaction&#xD;
      with the Ca2 + -dependent BKCa potassium channel. The determination of IP3Rs, including&#xD;
      subtype 3, as a mediator / marker of breast carcinogenesis appears to be a major clinical&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
