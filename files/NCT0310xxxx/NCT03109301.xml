      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) can cause serious medical problems. The only known&#xD;
      treatment is surgery. But completely removing a GIST tumor with surgery is often not&#xD;
      possible. Researchers want to see if a new drug, selumetinib, can help treat these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if selumetinib shrinks or slows the growth of GIST tumors and to see its side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 and over who have one or more GIST tumors and may have neurofibromatosis type I&#xD;
      (also called NF1). Their NF1 GIST has shown some growth or cannot be completely removed with&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with heart and eye tests and scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be told what foods and medicines they cannot take during the study.&#xD;
      Participants will keep a diary of the medicine they take during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take selumetinib capsules twice daily on an empty stomach for 28 days in a&#xD;
      row. This is 1 cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cycles, participants will have study visits. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans of their tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography scan. They will be get radioactive glucose an IV line. They will&#xD;
      lie quietly in a darkened room for 50-60 minutes then have the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about how they are feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study until they have bad side effects or their tumor grows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing treatment, participants will be watched for side effects for 30 days.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the&#xD;
           gastrointestinal tract, and traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy is not effective.&#xD;
           Patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing GIST, and&#xD;
           surgery remains the only standard treatment option for NF1-related GIST. While the&#xD;
           tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and sunitinib prolong survival in patients&#xD;
           with KIT/PDGFRA mutated GIST, they have no documented efficacy in patients with NF1&#xD;
           related GISTs, which lack KIT/PDGFRA mutations. Radiation therapy also seems to be&#xD;
           ineffective. Therefore, new therapies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib (AZD6244 hyd sulfate), a novel orally bioavailable mitogen activated protein&#xD;
           kinase inhibitor, is a specific inhibitor of MEK 1/2, which is currently undergoing&#xD;
           evaluation in adults with refractory cancers, in adults and children with NF1 and&#xD;
           plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and children with brain tumors. Evaluation of selumetinib&#xD;
           in children and young adults with NF1 related plexiform neurofibromas (PN) has&#xD;
           demonstrated activity with most patients demonstrating some PN shrinkage, and a partial&#xD;
           response rate of 71%. Selumetinib has also demonstrated activity in children with NF1&#xD;
           and low-grade gliomas. It is thus possible that selumetinib may mediate anti-tumor&#xD;
           effects in NF1 GIST by inhibition of downstream signaling of Ras.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To estimate the response rate (radiologic response as defined by RECIST v1.1) of&#xD;
      selumetinib in children and adults with measurable NF1-mutated GIST which is unresectable,&#xD;
      progressive or metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are greater than or equal to 3 years of age and able to swallow capsules,&#xD;
           with a histologically or cytologically confirmed measurable GIST without Kit or PDGFRA&#xD;
           mutation, who have a clinical diagnosis of NF1 or a mutation of NF1 in the GIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients tumors must demonstrate progression within the past 12 months or be metastatic;&#xD;
           patients who do not meet this criterion will be followed, on the NF1 Natural History&#xD;
           Study if appropriate; in the event that they demonstrate subsequent progression they may&#xD;
           be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have adequate major organ function, adequate performance status, and&#xD;
           normal LVEF by ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior medical therapy is required; patients should have surgical resection if this is&#xD;
           deemed feasible without unacceptable morbidity. Patients must meet the time requirements&#xD;
           since prior therapy and have recovered from prior therapy toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK1/2 inhibitor is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib will be administered at a starting dose of 50 mg/dose orally in patients 18&#xD;
           years or older and 25 mg/m^2/dose in children &lt; 18 years of age; drug will be given&#xD;
           twice daily continuously in the absence of toxicity or disease progression, using 28-day&#xD;
           cycles. The pediatric dose is the recommended phase II dose of selumetinib determined in&#xD;
           a CTEP sponsored phase I trial of selumetinib for children and young adults with NF1 and&#xD;
           inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and the adult dose is equal to that used in our&#xD;
           phase II study of adults with NF1 and inoperable PN. Adults will be allowed a one-time&#xD;
           intrapatient dose escalation to 75mg BID provided the drug is well tolerated during the&#xD;
           first cycle. Patients will be asked to co-enroll on POB protocol 10-C-0086:&#xD;
           &quot;Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of a&#xD;
           Repository for Related Biological Studies and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and&#xD;
           Longitudinal Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type&#xD;
           1&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be monitored for toxicity and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response will be assessed on a regular schedule. FDG-PET will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
           prior to therapy, on day 11 (+/- 3 days) to assess for early FDG-PET response&#xD;
           (optional), after 3 cycles and as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will use a Simon optimal two-stage phase II design with a target response&#xD;
           rate of 25%, enrolling a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 16 evaluable patients. A maximum&#xD;
           accrual of 20 patients may be accrued allowing for a small number (4) of inevaluable&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

             meets criteria for progressive or metastatic disease. Metastatic disease refers to&#xD;
             disease outside the GI tract, not simply a multifocal primary tumor. Testing performed&#xD;
             by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI, unless previously conducted by a CLIA/CAP&#xD;
             external laboratory; analysis will include evaluation of 4 exons of KIT (9, 11, 13,&#xD;
             17) and 3 exons of PDGFRA (12, 14, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Progressive disease: GIST has demonstrated progression as defined by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
                  within the past 12 months. Patients whose tumors do not meet this criterion, and&#xD;
                  have a diagnosis of NF1, may enroll on the NF1 Natural History study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status: ECOG less than or equal to 2 (Patients greater than or equal to 16&#xD;
             years of age must have a Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to 70%&#xD;
             (or ECOG less than or equal to 2), and children less than or equal to 16 years old&#xD;

                    -  Age (years): &gt;15; Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL): 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients will be eligible if tumor is metastatic, unresectable,&#xD;
             progressive, or if complete tumor resection is not considered to be feasible without&#xD;
             substantial risk or morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and GIST,&#xD;
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical&#xD;
                  therapy directed at their GIST. Patients who have had prior GIST-directed surgery&#xD;
                  may enroll provided they have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there&#xD;
                  will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for GIST or other&#xD;
                  tumor manifestations associated with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,&#xD;
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other&#xD;
                  targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have&#xD;
                  elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN and patients who&#xD;
                  received previous GIST-directed therapy must either demonstrate progression as&#xD;
                  defined by RECIST, or be unable to tolerate their previous therapy. Patients who&#xD;
                  received effects of all prior therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 before&#xD;
                  entering this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy last dose must have been received at least 28 days prior&#xD;
                  to enrollment, their last dose of biological therapy, immunomodulatory agents,&#xD;
                  vaccines, differentiating agents, used to treat their cancer at least 7 days&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment, their last dose of a monoclonal antibody at least 30 days&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment, and their last dose of any investigational agent at least 30&#xD;
                  days prior&#xD;
&#xD;
        to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not have&#xD;
             been administered within the 7 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received any&#xD;
             prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of good wound&#xD;
             healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of selumetinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
                  and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of&#xD;
                  birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
                  participation, and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. Women of&#xD;
                  child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry.&#xD;
                  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform her treating&#xD;
                  physician immediately. Please note that the selumetinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used for 16&#xD;
        weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if&#xD;
             sun exposure is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other&#xD;
             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the&#xD;
             study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Although not a requirement, participants will be asked to also participate in protocol&#xD;
             10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and Establishment of&#xD;
             a Repository for Related Biological Studies. Patients with NF1 will be asked to&#xD;
             coenroll&#xD;
&#xD;
        on the NF1 Natural History Study and 08-C-0079: Natural History Study and Longitudinal&#xD;
        Assessment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of another malignancy or benign tumor requiring chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy are excluded; however, those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma&#xD;
             requiring treatment will be eligible as selumetinib has documented activity in&#xD;
             plexiform neurofibromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of NF1 and GIST who do not meet other eligibility criteria&#xD;
             may enroll on the NF1 Natural History Study, and will be followed on this study.&#xD;
             Should they require therapy for GIST based on evidence of progression, they may then&#xD;
             enroll on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with selumetinib or another specific MEK inhibitor is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to selumetinib or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous MEK, RAS, or RAF inhibitor use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first three&#xD;
             cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation may&#xD;
             affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject inevaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the following cardiac conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (Adults: blood pressure [BP] of greater than or equal&#xD;
                  to 150/95 despite medical support/management. Participants 18 years of age and&#xD;
                  younger should have a blood pressure less than or equal to 95th percentile for&#xD;
                  age, height and gender. Preexisting hypertension in adults should be controlled&#xD;
                  (either with pharmacological or nonpharmacological methods) at the time of&#xD;
                  enrollment.)&#xD;

                  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 55%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function&#xD;
                  (LVEF less than 50% on echocardiography or equivalent on Multi-Gated Acquisition&#xD;
                  Scan [MUGA]) even if full recovery has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe valvular heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate greater than 100 bpm on ECG at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ophthalmological conditions as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current or past history of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED)/central&#xD;
                  serous retinopathy (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than 21 mmHg or uncontrolled glaucoma&#xD;
                  (irrespective of IOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of optic glioma, malignant glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath&#xD;
                  tumor,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such&#xD;
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing orbitotemporal&#xD;
                  PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a significant&#xD;
                  abnormality for the purposes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination&#xD;
                  (performed by an ophthalmologist) should be discussed with the Study Chair for&#xD;
                  potential eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases&#xD;
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that may&#xD;
             significantly alter the absorption of study agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 and UGT 1A1 and 1A3, P-glycoprotein, or&#xD;
             BCRP are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is&#xD;
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No supplementation with vitamin E is permitted because the selumetinib capsules&#xD;
             contain vitamin E&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of selumetinib on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with selumetinib. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic&#xD;
             therapy directed at the tumor. Those patients with a plexiform neurofibroma requiring&#xD;
             treatment will be eligible, as selumetinib has documented activity in plexiform&#xD;
             neurofibromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.&#xD;
