    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive&#xD;
      cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (LN-145)&#xD;
      followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing&#xD;
      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent,&#xD;
      metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma. The cell transfer therapy used in this study&#xD;
      involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by&#xD;
      infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.&#xD;
