    <textblock>
      The hysteroscopy used was rigid continuous flow diagnostic hysteroscopy (Tuttligen, Karl&#xD;
      Storz, Germany). It has a 30o panoramic optic which is 4mm in diameter and the diagnostic&#xD;
      continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in lithotomy position with the buttocks projecting slightly beyond the&#xD;
      table edge. A reflex camera (Olympus) with an objective that has a focal length varies from&#xD;
      f70 to f140 together with (Karl Storz) special zoom length, adapter to Hopkins telescope and&#xD;
      a suitable cableware used with computer flash unit. The hysteroscopic picture which appeared&#xD;
      through the optic, transmitted on the monitor by the camera which is fitted on the eyepiece&#xD;
      of the optic where the panoramic diagnostic hysteroscopy could be informed with better&#xD;
      visualization and accuracy. The light generator which is a metal halide automatic light&#xD;
      source with a 150 watt lamp (model G71A,Circon ACMI, Germany) was switched on and the high&#xD;
      cable was attached to the hysteroscope. Dilatation of the cervix was avoided whenever&#xD;
      possible to avoid leakage of the medium into the vagina. The hysteroscope was then introduced&#xD;
      into the external os and advanced under vision along the axis of cervical canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the cavity was entered, an overview of the uterine cavity was performed. This was&#xD;
      followed by systematic examination for fundus then tubal ostia on both sides then the uterine&#xD;
      wall through slow rotatory movements of the telescope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic laparoscopy was done in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle .The&#xD;
      patients were placed in the dorsal lithotomy position to allow vaginal access for uterine&#xD;
      manipulation; the legs positioned so that the thighs are slightly flexed no more than 90o&#xD;
      from the plane of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the complete horizontal position, Veress needle was placed through&#xD;
      the umbilicus and into the peritoneal cavity, the primary trocar with sleeve (5mm in&#xD;
      diameter) was placed at a similar angle in to the Veress needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary trocars were used, 2 secondary trocars were placed. The trocars were placed&#xD;
      laterally, approximately 8 cm from the midline and 8 cm above the pubic symphysis to avoid&#xD;
      the epigastric, vessels which are 5.5 cm from the midline at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then laparoscopic dye chromotubation was performed&#xD;

      The hysteroscopy used was rigid continuous flow diagnostic hysteroscopy (Tuttligen, Karl&#xD;
      Storz, Germany). It has a 30o panoramic optic which is 4mm in diameter and the diagnostic&#xD;
      continuous flow outer sheath is 6.5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in lithotomy position with the buttocks projecting slightly beyond the&#xD;
      table edge. The perineum and vagina were gently swabbed with povidone-iodine. The cervix was&#xD;
      exposed was exposed with a posterior wall retractor and a tenaculum was applied to its&#xD;
      anterior lip. The telescope was inserted into the sheath then flushed with distension media&#xD;
      (saline) to expel any air. The technique used to provide uterine distension involved&#xD;
      attaching plastic bags of saline to dual blood infusion tubing. Each bag was then wrapped in&#xD;
      a pressure infusion cuff similar to that used to infuse blood under pressure with a pressure&#xD;
      used 100mmHg. A reflex camera (Olympus) with an objective that has a focal length varies from&#xD;
      f70 to f140 together with (Karl Storz) special zoom length, adapter to Hopkins telescope and&#xD;
      a suitable cableware used with computer flash unit. The hysteroscopic picture which appeared&#xD;
      through the optic, transmitted on the monitor by the camera which is fitted on the eyepiece&#xD;
      of the optic where the panoramic diagnostic hysteroscopy could be informed with better&#xD;
      visualization and accuracy. The light generator which is a metal halide automatic light&#xD;
      source with a 150 watt lamp (model G71A,Circon ACMI, Germany) was switched on and the high&#xD;
      cable was attached to the hysteroscope. Dilatation of the cervix was avoided whenever&#xD;
      possible to avoid leakage of the medium into the vagina. The hysteroscope was then introduced&#xD;
      into the external os and advanced under vision along the axis of cervical canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the cavity was entered, an overview of the uterine cavity was performed. This was&#xD;
      followed by systematic examination for fundus then tubal ostia on both sides then the uterine&#xD;
      wall through slow rotatory movements of the telescope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination was considered normal if the endometrial cavity was easily distended by the&#xD;
      medium with complete separation of its walls and vision of both tubal ostia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agglutination of the uterine walls or the presence of thick bands extending across the cavity&#xD;
      or occlusion of ostial area or upper cavity indicated intrauterine adhesions (IUAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal filling defect extending from the fundus downwards to a variable level&#xD;
      indicated a uterine septum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any other pathological lesions such as polyps, submucous myomas were described according to&#xD;
      their site, size and vascularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the hysteroscope was slowly withdrawn through the cervical canal&#xD;
      which was visualized to detect any lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic laparoscopy was done in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle .The&#xD;
      patients were placed in the dorsal lithotomy position to allow vaginal access for uterine&#xD;
      manipulation; the legs positioned so that the thighs are slightly flexed no more than 90o&#xD;
      from the plane of the abdomen. The buttocks were slightly over the edge of the table but the&#xD;
      sacrum was completely supported to the table, to avoid back strain. Once the primary trocar&#xD;
      was placed, the patient was placed in no more than 25o Trendelenberg position to help keeping&#xD;
      the bowel of the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clipping of the pubic hair was done, 3 - 4 cm above the symphysis pubis. Standard anti-&#xD;
      septic preparation of the abdominal skin and the vagina were followed by placement of&#xD;
      specially designed fenestrated laparoscopy drapes. Vaginal instruments were placed for&#xD;
      uterine manipulation and then draped to keep the abdominal field separated from the lower&#xD;
      vaginal field, followed by changing gloves, to avoid contamination of both the abdominal&#xD;
      field and instruments placed into the abdominal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the complete horizontal position, Veress needle was placed through&#xD;
      the umbilicus and into the peritoneal cavity, avoiding both the retro peritoneal vessels and&#xD;
      the intestinal tract. The abdominal wall was elevated by manually grasping the skin and the&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue to maximize the distance between the umbilicus and retroperitoneal&#xD;
      vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In persons of average weight, the lower anterior abdominal wall was grasped and elevated and&#xD;
      the Veress needle was inserted toward the hollow of the sacrum at 45o angles. In patients who&#xD;
      were obese, a more vertical approach, approximately 70-80o was required because of the&#xD;
      increased thickness of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct placement of the Veress needle was confirmed by a number of methods, such as the&#xD;
      hanging drop test, or injection and aspiration of fluid through the Veress needle. After a&#xD;
      pneumo-peritoneum has been achieved with a Veress needle, the primary trocar with sleeve (5mm&#xD;
      in diameter) was placed at a similar angle in to the Veress needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary trocars were used, after identifying the epigastric vessels by transillumination&#xD;
      and intraperitoneal observation, 2 secondary trocars were placed. The trocars were placed&#xD;
      laterally, approximately 8 cm from the midline and 8 cm above the pubic symphysis to avoid&#xD;
      the epigastric, vessels which are 5.5 cm from the midline at this level. Insertion of the&#xD;
      trocar and removal of the sleeves were performed under direct laparoscopic visualization&#xD;
      while observing for signs of hemorrhage. In case of bleeding, bipolar electro surgery was&#xD;
      used to achieve hemostasis. Inspection of the whole peritoneal cavity, uterus, tubes ovaries,&#xD;
      Douglas pouch, urinary bladder small and large intestine as well as the liver was done. Any&#xD;
      abnormalities were noted and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then laparoscopic dye chromotubation was performed to assess tubal patency bilaterally, by&#xD;
      injecting methylene blue via the uterine catheter and observing spill through the fimbrial&#xD;
      ends of the tubes. In case of negative spill, bluish discoloration and distention of the&#xD;
      proximal parts of the tubes were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, carbon dioxide inflation was stopped and the 2ry trocars were&#xD;
      withdrawn under direct visualization, followed by deflation of the patient's peritoneal&#xD;
      cavity and withdrawal of the 1ry trocars. Sutures were placed at the sites of 1ry and 2ry&#xD;
      trocars to avoid incisional hernia.&#xD;
