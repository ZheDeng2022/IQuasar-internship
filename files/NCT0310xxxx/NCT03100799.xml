  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory non-drug, interventional biomarker study in approximately 30 eligible&#xD;
      patients with active osteoarthritis to investigate the degree of senescence-associated&#xD;
      disease. Patients will provide blood and urine and undergo MRI imaging with and without&#xD;
      gadolinium enhancement. Following imaging, arthrocentesis of both knees and an arthroscopy of&#xD;
      the target knee will occur to obtain fluid, synovium and cartilage for analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory non-drug, interventional, hypothesis generating biomarker study. No&#xD;
      Investigational Product will be administered in the study, however, there are study related&#xD;
      procedures which are interventional such as arthroscopy, arthrocentesis and infusion of a&#xD;
      gadolinium-containing contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented patients who meet the selection criteria undergo MRI imaging with and without&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast of both knees. Approximately seven days following the MRI imaging,&#xD;
      patients undergo an arthrocentesis of both knees to obtain synovial fluid and then an&#xD;
      arthroscopy of the target knee to obtain synovial and non-weight bearing cartilage tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return to the clinic approximately seven days following the arthroscopy and&#xD;
      arthrocentesis procedures for a routine safety follow-up.&#xD;
