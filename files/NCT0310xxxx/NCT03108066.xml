  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall response rate (ORR) of von&#xD;
      Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors in VHL&#xD;
      patients treated with PT2385.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of PT2385 in&#xD;
      patients with VHL disease who have at least 1 measurable VHL disease-associated ccRCC tumor&#xD;
      (as defined by RECIST 1.1). PT2385 will be administered orally and treatment will be&#xD;
      continuous. Changes in VHL disease-associated non-ccRCC tumors will also be evaluated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has at least 1 measurable ccRCC tumor and no solid ccRCC tumor greater than 3.0 cm,&#xD;
             based on radiologic diagnosis (histologic diagnosis not required); may have VHL&#xD;
             disease-associated lesions in other organ systems&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease, based on a germline VHL alteration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had prior radiotherapy or systemic anti cancer therapy for ccRCC (includes&#xD;
             anti-VEGF therapy or any systemic investigational anti cancer agent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a prior or concomitant non-VHL disease-associated invasive malignancy with the&#xD;
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ or any other malignancy from which the patient has remained disease&#xD;
             free for more than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any history of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had radiotherapy to any non-ccRCC site within 4 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
             or has not recovered from adverse events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had any surgical procedure for VHL disease or any major surgical procedure&#xD;
             completed within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or has any surgical lesions from&#xD;
             recent major surgical procedures that are not well healed&#xD;
