  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects must be scheduled to undergo an orthopedic surgical procedure. Subjects in the&#xD;
      non-control group must have previously received an MRI with MultiHance or ProHance with at&#xD;
      least 1 month between the last administration and the scheduled surgery. Subjects who have&#xD;
      never received MultiHance or ProHance or any other gadolinium agent will also be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects must have a test of their kidney function (SCr) at the time of the last MRI&#xD;
      examination or at the time of enrollment if they never received gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of bone and skin will be collected from the scheduled surgery and tested for the&#xD;
      amount of gadolinium. An additional sample of skin will be collected for testing the presence&#xD;
      of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject enrolled will already be scheduled to undergo a hip, shoulder or knee&#xD;
      replacement, limb amputations or other orthopedic surgical procedures and each subject&#xD;
      enrolled in the non-control group will have retrospectively undergone one or more&#xD;
      administrations of MultiHance or PROHANCE with the last dose administered at least 1 month&#xD;
      before their scheduled surgery. In order to classify the subjects' renal status, the serum&#xD;
      creatinine (SCr) value and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of last&#xD;
      MRI with MultiHance or ProHance must be available and collected. The control subjects'&#xD;
      documented SCr values will be collected prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone and skin tissue sample(s) collected (during the subjects surgery) will be blinded to&#xD;
      gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure and sent to a central laboratory where they&#xD;
      will be tested for gadolinium (Gd) and other analytes including calcium, phosphorous, sodium,&#xD;
      iron, zinc, and potassium. The Gd deposition of the resected bone and skin tissue will be&#xD;
      analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The bone and skin tissue&#xD;
      will also be analyzed for other analytes using ICP-MS. These sample(s) will be stored at the&#xD;
      central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate sample of the skin tissue collected (during the subjects' surgery) will also be&#xD;
      sent to a central dermatopathologist who will be blinded to GBCA exposure and test for any&#xD;
      possible NSF related abnormalities. These skin tissue sample(s) will be stored with the&#xD;
      central dermatopathology laboratory.&#xD;
