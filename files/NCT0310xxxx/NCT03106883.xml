  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biased attention toward negatively valenced information has been considered as a mechanism&#xD;
      for risk and relapse in depression. Those with depression tend to focus their visual&#xD;
      attention first, more frequently, and for longer periods of time, if it connotes negative&#xD;
      (particularly sad) mood. To this end, investigators have recently discovered that this bias&#xD;
      might be modifiable. However, the existing literature is mixed with regard to effectiveness.&#xD;
      The investigators propose in this study a novel approach to modifying attention bias in&#xD;
      depression by using real time feedback with eye tracking technology. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine if, compared to a sham condition, rewarding attention toward positive stimuli results&#xD;
      in improved mood and reductions in attention bias. Following three sessions of either sham&#xD;
      training or active attentional bias training, the investigators hypothesize that participants&#xD;
      in the active training condition will experience a) reductions in negative attentional bias,&#xD;
      and b) to an improved mood state and increased quality of life, compared to those in the sham&#xD;
      training condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The existence of a negative affective bias in depression has been consistently supported&#xD;
      throughout literature and has been identified as one of many factors that are associated with&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology. A negative affective bias in depression refers to the fact that&#xD;
      individuals with depression or depressive symptoms are more likely to focus on negative&#xD;
      stimuli and less likely to pay attention to positive stimuli. Typically, this bias is most&#xD;
      prominent and consistent in relation to sad stimuli, as opposed to other negatively valenced&#xD;
      stimuli, such as anger or fear. Affective bias has been found to play a role in both the&#xD;
      onset and maintenance of depressive disorders, and extends to information interpretation,&#xD;
      memory, and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such findings regarding the influence of this negative affective bias on depressive symptoms&#xD;
      has spurred further research that aims to reduce or 'correct' this bias in an attempt to&#xD;
      improve mood state and reduce depressive symptoms. This research has generally focused on the&#xD;
      use of dot-probe attention bias modification (ABM) paradigms, which are forms of cognitive&#xD;
      bias modification that attempt to 'train' attention towards positive stimuli and away from&#xD;
      negative stimuli through a manipulation of the dot-probe. ABM paradigms have found success in&#xD;
      a number of studies, and have been shown to be effective in decreasing the attentional bias&#xD;
      for negative information, increasing attention for positive stimuli, and decreasing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms leading to improvements in mood. Thus, ABM research represents a&#xD;
      promising avenue for treating depressive symptoms through the elimination of the negative&#xD;
      affective bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the diverse methodology, stimuli, and design of existing research has led to&#xD;
      conflicting and inconsistent results, with some studies being either unable to manipulate&#xD;
      attention at all or failing to significantly improve mood. The use of the dot-probe paradigm&#xD;
      as a means of modifying or training behaviour has been contested, with some findings&#xD;
      suggesting that it is unable to induce either a positive or a negative attention bias.&#xD;
      Moreover, single-session dot-probe paradigms in particular often fail to achieve any&#xD;
      significant effects, which may be a result of insufficient durations to produce a change in&#xD;
      attention. Additionally, designs that use negatively valenced emotions other than sadness may&#xD;
      be weakened due to the fact that an attentional bias towards negative emotions other than&#xD;
      sadness in depression has not been consistently demonstrated. Finally, it is common for&#xD;
      similar studies to make use of either dysphoric populations or undergraduate populations with&#xD;
      varying degrees of non-clinical depressive symptoms. Oftentimes, such studies fail to produce&#xD;
      robust effects, which may be a result of an affective bias being less pronounced in&#xD;
      non-clinical populations, or a result of a floor effect, in which less-depressed participants&#xD;
      with lower initial depressive scores do not experience statistically significant changes. It&#xD;
      would be premature to dismiss the effectiveness of attention modification training for&#xD;
      affective biases in depression without addressing, clarifying, and improving upon such&#xD;
      potential weaknesses in design and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed novel attention bias modification study seeks to administer a novel training&#xD;
      paradigm that utilizes a reward-based, naturalistic, free-viewing design. It is expected that&#xD;
      the design of this study will improve upon past research in four ways: 1) by overcoming the&#xD;
      limits of the dot-probe through a free-viewing paradigm; 2) by utilizing only stimuli that&#xD;
      represent 'sadness' and no other negatively valenced stimuli; 3) by providing multiple&#xD;
      training sessions to induce a meaningful effect on attention; and 4) by providing treatment&#xD;
      to individuals with MDD who might be more likely to benefit from ABM for a negative affective&#xD;
      bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place over five sessions over approximately two weeks: a pre-training&#xD;
      assessment, three sessions of affective bias or sham training, and a post-training&#xD;
      assessment. Participants will be asked to complete a brief, at-home measure of mood state on&#xD;
      each day between pre- and post-assessments. Participants will be told that the study involves&#xD;
      attention and learning, but to preserve blinding, they will only be told that the study is&#xD;
      specifically an &quot;attention training&quot; study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arriving in the lab for the pre-treatment session, participants will be asked to read&#xD;
      letter of information regarding the study. Once they have read the letter and their informed&#xD;
      consent is provided, a trained researcher will collect demographic information and then&#xD;
      provide the participant with the BDI, Rumination Scale, and Sheehan Disablity Scale forms to&#xD;
      complete privately. Following completion of the forms, participants will be led into a&#xD;
      separate room containing the eye-tracker to complete a baseline assessment of affective bias&#xD;
      and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessment: Participants will complete the Emotional Verbal Learning Test . The&#xD;
      EVLT is a measure of emotional learning and memory. It involves the oral presentation of&#xD;
      emotional words by an experimenter to a participant. Participants will then engage in a&#xD;
      short-delay (immediate) and long-delay (after 20 minutes) free recall of the words.&#xD;
      Participants will then complete digit span and digit symbol coding tasks, which are widely&#xD;
      used measures of attention and will take approximately 7 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affective bias assessment: First, affective bias will be assessed using a free-viewing&#xD;
      eye-tracking paradigm that is similar in design to the subsequent training sessions. During&#xD;
      each trial, a black fixation cross will appear in the centre of the white screen for 500ms.&#xD;
      Four unique faces in a drawn from the NimStim Set of Facial Expressions will then appear in a&#xD;
      2x2 grid in the four quadrants of the screen, depicting one positive (happy) face and three&#xD;
      negative (sad) faces. The location of the happy face will be randomized to any of the four&#xD;
      quadrants over each trial. Participants will be told to freely view the faces and data will&#xD;
      be collected via the eye-tracker on variables such as location of first fixation, total&#xD;
      fixation duration on each type of valenced image, and total number of fixations on each type&#xD;
      of image. Each set of faces will remain on the screen for a total of 3500ms before a new&#xD;
      trial will begin. There will be a total of 120 trials, separated into two blocks of 60 trials&#xD;
      with a 30-second break between blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the parallel line task will be used as a measure of affective bias towards sad&#xD;
      stimuli. In this task, 32 sad stimuli and 32 neutral stimuli will be presented. On either&#xD;
      side of the picture, short grey lines will be presented, and each line will be tilted&#xD;
      slightly to the left or right. In half of the trials, the lines will be tilted in the same&#xD;
      direction (parallel), and in the remaining trials the lines will be tilted in opposing&#xD;
      directions. Subjects will be asked either to indicate whether the type of picture being shown&#xD;
      is sad or neutral (and thus ignore the lines), or to indicate whether the lines are parallel&#xD;
      or different (and thus ignore the picture content). The reaction times to each type of&#xD;
      display will be analyzed. Participants will complete 256 different trials for a total task&#xD;
      time of about 22 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Sessions: Affective attentional training will be completed by participants in-lab&#xD;
      using an eye-tracker in three different sessions over the course of approximately one week.&#xD;
      The attention training paradigm to be used was developed for the present study. The modified&#xD;
      ABM task was developed to train participants' attention away from negative stimuli and&#xD;
      towards positive stimuli through punishment and reward, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active training task will include one positively and three negatively valenced faces&#xD;
      (showing either happiness or sadness, respectively), selected from the NimStim Set of Facial&#xD;
      Expressions, will be presented in a random orientation in a 2x2 grid on the screen.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to view the images naturally. All four faces will originally&#xD;
      appear slightly blurred. Participants will be told that the purpose of the training is to&#xD;
      enhance their ability to focus on images that become clearer while avoiding those that become&#xD;
      blurrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each trial in the active training group will begin with a black fixation cross in the centre&#xD;
      of a white background. The cross will appear alone for 500ms. After the 500ms, the four&#xD;
      valenced faces will appear, with one in each quadrant of the screen, equally spaced from the&#xD;
      central fixation cross, and participants will begin freely viewing the stimuli. If&#xD;
      participants fixate on any of the three negative faces for more than 300ms, the face will&#xD;
      undergo a processing of blurring for 500ms or until the participant looks away. This is meant&#xD;
      to &quot;punish&quot; the participant by removing the social stimuli, and influence them to adjust&#xD;
      their focus to more rewarding stimuli. If the participant fixates on the positive face for&#xD;
      300ms, then this image become clearer over a span of 500 to 1500 ms or until the participant&#xD;
      looks away. This is meant to &quot;reward&quot; participants for focusing on positive stimuli. If&#xD;
      participants maintain their attention on the positive face until it becomes fully clear, the&#xD;
      trial will be successful and the images will disappear, and the program will move on to the&#xD;
      next trial. If a positive fixation does not occur within 4500ms, the trial will automatically&#xD;
      end and the next trial will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sham training group, the paradigm will function exactly the same as the active&#xD;
      training group, except that the stimuli will be neutral, non-affective, non-social photos&#xD;
      (i.e., cars), with a photo type (i.e., forward facing car) being chosen as the &quot;rewarding&quot;&#xD;
      stimulus and the remaining three photos acting as &quot;punishing&quot; stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training will be delivered through five five-minute blocks separate by 90-second rest&#xD;
      periods. Participants will complete as many trials as they are able within each five-minute&#xD;
      block. Each training session should take approximately 35 minutes, for a total of 105 minutes&#xD;
      of attention training throughout the course of the week long training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-assessment: The post-assessment will be conducted in-lab during the week following the&#xD;
      training sessions. It will consist of a re-administration of the same procedures at baseline.&#xD;
