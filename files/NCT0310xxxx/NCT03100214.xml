  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies demonstrate that exercise increases the maximal oxygen uptake, peak oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, reduce effort-induced lactic acid production, and increase skeletal muscle&#xD;
      oxidative capacity, as well as psychological aspects such as increased self-esteem and&#xD;
      improvement of the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature there is only one study involving rehabilitation in hospitalized pediatric&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis. Thus, more information on in-hospital rehabilitation is&#xD;
      required in adult cystic fibrosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the effects of an early rehabilitation program, based on&#xD;
      aerobic training and muscle strength training, in adolescent and adult patients with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis hospitalized at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre for exacerbation of lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      After completing the study inclusion criteria, the individual will be invited to participate&#xD;
      and will receive the consent form for signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be submitted to the following evaluations: quality of life questionnaire for&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis, spirometry, Shwachman-Kulczycki score, modified dyspnea questionnaire&#xD;
      (Modified Medical Research Council), maximum repetition test, six minute walk test and blood&#xD;
      sample for the determination of inflammatory markers. These evaluations should be performed&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and will be repeated on the last day of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the period up to 48 hours after hospital admission, patients will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the intervention group or the control group.&#xD;
