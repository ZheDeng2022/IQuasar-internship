    <textblock>
      To study the impact of case management on the outcome of the care of chronic hepatitis C in&#xD;
      people who inject drugs (PWID). By creating the function of case manager, the investigators&#xD;
      will target all the barriers to care of the HCV care continuum. Partial objectives are to&#xD;
      measure the impact of case management on the uptake for screening, the uptake and outcome of&#xD;
      treatment, and the rate of reinfection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is nowadays one of the leading causes of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease, with prevalence of liver cirrhosis still increasing. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is&#xD;
      primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. In the Western world, overall&#xD;
      prevalence of HCV antibodies is low. In Belgium, prevalence of HCV in the general population&#xD;
      is estimated around 1% by expert opinion. However, in high-risk populations prevalence of HCV&#xD;
      increases. Data for HCV antibody prevalence in Belgium show rates of 60-80% in people who&#xD;
      inject drugs (PWID). Populations at increased risk of HCV infection include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PWID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recipients of infected blood products or invasive procedures in health-care facilities&#xD;
           with inadequate infection control practices (western world: before 1992)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children born to mothers infected with HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  people with sexual partners who are HCV-infected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  people with HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prisoners or previously incarcerated persons&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  people who have used intranasal drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  people who have had tattoos or piercings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on international guidelines, the Belgian Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL)&#xD;
      recommends targeted screening for these populations to assess HCV prevalence. This is not yet&#xD;
      executed in Belgium, despite the severe health and economic burden accompanied with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection (CHC). In response to this lacuna in the Belgium health care, the&#xD;
      &quot;Hepatitis C Plan (2014-2019)&quot; was developed. This action plan aims to improve the following&#xD;
      goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uptake for screening in high-risk populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creation of a national systematic screening procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of an HCV expertise network to improve care and linkage-to-care Furthermore,&#xD;
           in April of 2015 the federal government of Belgium distributed a pact with the&#xD;
           pharmaceutical industry, called &quot;The Future Pact&quot;. This pact between industry and&#xD;
           government focuses on accessibility to care, specifically for high-risk groups. Goals&#xD;
           are to create a national registry for therapy and develop patient support programs, next&#xD;
           to the expansion of reimbursement of therapy for HCV infection in fibrosis stadium II.&#xD;
           However, despite the international guidelines and despite the strategic aims in the&#xD;
           Hepatitis C plan and the Future Pact, no specific actions are described, and screening&#xD;
           is not systematically executed in high-risk groups in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this screening cannot be underestimated as HCV is now curable, with success&#xD;
      rates of 60-100% according to other associated factors (e.g. use of direct acting antivirals&#xD;
      (DAAs), severity of liver disease, HCV genotype, resistance). Furthermore, different studies&#xD;
      state that treatment of patients with CHC in an early stage has the potential to be&#xD;
      cost-effective, as hospitalization costs after development of liver disease far exceed the&#xD;
      cost of antiviral therapy. Nonetheless, treatment uptake also remains low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the reasons why PWIDs were excluded from treatment in the past was stigmatization&#xD;
      based on greater risk of reinfection. Latest studies show low rates of reinfection among&#xD;
      PWID, even with continued injection drug use during and after treatment. The pooled HCV&#xD;
      reinfection risk was 2.4 per 100 person years, combined for six studies, across the UK,&#xD;
      Australia, the Netherlands and Greece, suggesting that HCV treatment should not be withheld&#xD;
      due to concerns about reinfection alone. However, with ongoing risk behaviour, current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend monitoring with annual HCV RNA assessments. Furthermore, data from the&#xD;
      National Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database show that an increasing significant minority&#xD;
      of PWID continue to inject post-SVR at an intensity which leads to either hospitalisation or&#xD;
      death and increased risk of reinfection. Thus, harm reduction and counselling remain&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this trial, the investigators want to evaluate a possible approach to reach the&#xD;
      different goals defined in the Hepatitis C plan and the future pact. The investigators will&#xD;
      study the impact of case management on the outcome of care for HCV infected PWID in Belgium.&#xD;
