  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recent introduction of novel anti-multiple myeloma (MM) agents, high risk MM&#xD;
      remains with poor prognosis and a therapeutic challenge. Elotuzumab (ELO) is a humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that recognizes CS1/CD139, a molecule highly expressed in MM cells. The&#xD;
      ELO (10 mg/kg), lenalidomide (LEN) and dexamethasone (DEX) combination achieves high overall&#xD;
      response rates (ORR) and long progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory disease (RR) MM and those with impaired renal function. However, its&#xD;
      efficacy for MM patients with high risk characteristics is still unknown. Pomalidomide (POM)&#xD;
      is a recently approved immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) that produces response rates for&#xD;
      high-risk RRMM patients when used in combination with DEX and other agents, including the&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (BTZ). POM has also demonstrated activity for LEN&#xD;
      refractory patients. Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a potent second generation PI that has shown to be&#xD;
      efficacious for IMiD and BTZ refractory patients as well as high risk patients carrying&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities. In this study, we propose to evaluate efficacy and safety of ELO&#xD;
      in combination with POM, DEX and CFZ for high-risk RRMM patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study with six patients safety&#xD;
      lead-in cohort to evaluate efficacy and safety of elotuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      pomalidomide, carfilzomib and dexamethasone among high risk relapsed and refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll previously treated patients that currently show evidence of&#xD;
      progressive disease and have been diagnosed with high risk multiple myeloma. Thirty-nine&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, six patients will be enrolled and used as a lead-in cohort for the safety evaluation&#xD;
      and MTD re-determination (if necessary). The results of the safety lead-in cohort will be&#xD;
      evaluated after the 6th patient has completed one full cycle of treatment. Recruitment of&#xD;
      patients will be withheld during safety data analysis. Enrollment of the remaining 33&#xD;
      patients will be contingent upon safety committee's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day treatment cycles; 3) a&#xD;
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be administered on a 28-day cycle schedule throughout the study. Subjects&#xD;
      eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of eight 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Subjects are to be treated for 8 cycles of therapy without demonstrating&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
