  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI&#xD;
      655130 following subcutaneous administration (Test, T) compared to BI 655130 following&#xD;
      intravenous infusion (Reference, R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters between all tested treatments.&#xD;

                  and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
