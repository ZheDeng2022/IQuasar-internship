  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the global burden of Cervical Cancer (CC), 85% occurs in developing countries,&#xD;
      representing 12% of cancer in women. In Mexico CC ranks second in incidence and mortality&#xD;
      among women. The National Institute of Cancer in Mexico (lNCAN) receives annually about 500&#xD;
      patients with CC, 80% of which are diagnosed with locally advanced disease. Furthermore, 10&#xD;
      to 20% of these present kidney deterioration. The main reason for kidney disease is ureteral&#xD;
      obstruction, other causes include age and comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
      The standard treatment for locally advanced disease consists in concomitant&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy based on cisplatin (QT-RT), followed by brachytherapy, with an absolute&#xD;
      benefit of 10%. However, the use of cisplatin in patients with renal disease may be&#xD;
      questionable, considering it is a nephrotoxic treatment. Given that renal dysfunction limits&#xD;
      the standard treatment efficiency because of the widely known nephrotoxicity of cisplatin, in&#xD;
      most Cancer Centers of our country, patients with renal dysfunction receive only radiation&#xD;
      therapy, even though it has proven less effective than concomitant QT-RT, limiting&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival of these patients. Venook et al. used gemcitabine as a&#xD;
      radiosensitizer in patients with cancer and renal dysfunction. Our group, has observed&#xD;
      encouraging results using gemcitabine as an alternative to cisplatin in concomitant treatment&#xD;
      with radiotherapy, in CC patients with renal insufficiency. 89% of patients had complete&#xD;
      response and improvement in renal function, with an enhanced creatinine clearance after&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the safety of gemcitabine as an alternative&#xD;
      treatment for CC patients with locally advanced disease and renal deterioration. We propose&#xD;
      this clinical trial to assess the safety of treatment with gemcitabine and specifically on&#xD;
      renal function in patients with renal deterioration. It is important to take into&#xD;
      consideration that CC in advanced stages produces pain, transvaginal fetid discharge and&#xD;
      general discomfort. It also causes side effects secondary to renal failure such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, fatigue, anemia, among others. These effects have a significant impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of these patients. Cancer treatment and its side effects, besides the&#xD;
      implications of a nephrostomy catheter or ileostomy bag, determine the deterioration in the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patient, during and sometimes after treatment. Thus it is of utmost&#xD;
      importance to evaluate the factors that could help improve the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      and explore the factors that deteriorate it. This clinical trial aims to generate scientific&#xD;
      evidence to help make the best decisions concerning the treatment of patients with cervical&#xD;
      cancer and renal impairment, and the impact on their quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Mexico, cervical cancer (CC) is the second most frequent cause of death among women, with&#xD;
      a mortality rate of 4000 women/year. Concerning the treatment of these patients, there is&#xD;
      evidence about the benefit of addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced CC, with an absolute benefit of 10% in overall survival and a significant&#xD;
      reduction in local recurrence. Cisplatin is currently the standard treatment for CC. Evidence&#xD;
      supports that the benefit of chemotherapy is achieved in those patients who receive at least&#xD;
      3 cycles of cisplatin at a dosage of 40mg/m2 weekly. The side effects of cisplatin include&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting, ototoxicity, electrolyte disturbance, and&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia. For this reason, the choice of using cisplatin as a radiosensitizer&#xD;
      requires careful consideration of the renal function of the patient, prior to the initiation&#xD;
      of treatment. The glomerular filtration rate deteriorates with age and many patients have&#xD;
      comorbid medical illnesses that further compromise the kidney. Gemcitabine has been tested as&#xD;
      a single agent in CC for its radiosensitizing properties. Clinical profit has been reported&#xD;
      along with reasonable tolerance to gemcitabine during radiotherapy. So it can be considered a&#xD;
      good alternative treatment for the management of patients with ureteral obstruction and&#xD;
      possible renal failure. Even though gemcitabine is well tolerated, the dosage for these&#xD;
      patients should be considered with caution, since a specific dosage has not yet been&#xD;
      recommended for cancer patients with renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate the safety of chemo-radiotherapy (QT-RT) concomitant with gemcitabine&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer IB2-IVA and renal deterioration. Our&#xD;
      particular objectives are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the renal function before, during and after treatment with QT-RT concomitant&#xD;
           with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the safety of concomitant QT-RT with gemcitabine, according to the common&#xD;
           toxicity criteria in CTCEA v4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the objective and clinical response rate after treatment with QT-RT&#xD;
           concomitant with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the incidence of percutaneous nephrostomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the clinical and cabinet criteria established by the protocol for the&#xD;
           application of percutaneous nephrostomy or double J catheter and its impact on renal&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Determine the frequency of complications during and after treatment with QT-RT&#xD;
           concomitant with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is based on the following hypothesis. Patients with locally advanced CC IB2-IVA and&#xD;
      renal dysfunction, that receive concomitant QT-RT with gemcitabine, tolerate the combination&#xD;
      with a glomerular filtration rate of &gt;60ml/min/1.73m2, show limited toxicity (Grade l-lll)&#xD;
      and a response rate of at least 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. It is a Phase II clinical trial, open, single-arm, national, nonrandomized,&#xD;
      single-center; to evaluate the safety of gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced CC&#xD;
      (IB2-IVA) and renal dysfunction, referring to the National Institute of Cancer in Mexico&#xD;
      (INCAN). 18 patients will be included, with cervical malignant tumors of epithelial origin in&#xD;
      the neck of the uterus, with renal impairment; candidates for QT-RT. Recruitment of patients&#xD;
      will be performed in the first 12 months, with a follow up of 12 months, including 3 patients&#xD;
      per month, to complete the total sample in one year (2017-2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment. Based on treatment evidence the best dosage of gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      adequate renal function is 300 mg/m2, prepared in 0.5 liters of sodium chloride 0.9%, IV&#xD;
      administered in 30 minutes weekly for a maximum of 6 weeks, starting in the first week of&#xD;
      radiotherapy or as soon as the blood count has recovered after blood transfusion. In our&#xD;
      study design, patients will receive concomitant radiotherapy using an external beam releasing&#xD;
      40-50.4 Gy in 20-28 fractions: 1.8 Gy/day for 5 days/week, during 4 to 6 weeks. Intracavitary&#xD;
      brachytherapy will be added to reach a total EQD2 dosage (α/β=10) of 78-86 Gy. In case&#xD;
      retroperitoneal or para-aortic lymphnodes appear, patients will be treated with extended&#xD;
      fields of radiotherapy at conventional doses. Dose will be adjusted up to 75% of the complete&#xD;
      dosage in case of grade 3 (G3) leucopenia, G3 neutropenia, G3 thrombocytopenia, G3 diarrhea,&#xD;
      radioepithelitis, or other G3 non hematological toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case toxicity is not resolved within a week, treatment application may be delayed up to&#xD;
      two weeks. If toxicity persists, subsequent doses will be suspended and the patient will&#xD;
      receive only radiation therapy. Acute toxicity will be evaluated according to CTCAE (v. 4.03)&#xD;
      toxicity criteria. When possible, chemotherapy treatment will coincide with radiotherapy. We&#xD;
      will make every reasonable effort to ensure that radiotherapy treatment continues without&#xD;
      interruption. Use of colony stimulating factor is allowed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      researcher, it should not be administered within 24 hours prior or after treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. During each cycle, in all cases, creatinine clearance will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, gemcitabine infusion will be&#xD;
      immediately stopped and replaced by saline solution. A physical examination including vital&#xD;
      signs will be performed every 15 minutes, until the the patient's condition improves. Airways&#xD;
      will be kept free. If a local reaction occurs (hives and angioneurotic edema), epinephrine&#xD;
      and diphenhydramine should be administered. In case of bronchospasm, epinephrine,&#xD;
      diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and oxygen will be administered. In case&#xD;
      of fever, antipyretic maneuvers will be performed and if the patient presents trembling,&#xD;
      dipyrone will be administered. Emergency treatment will be evaluated and individualized by&#xD;
      the immediate attention medic, who will administer the treatment that he deems pertinent to&#xD;
      stabilize the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of other drugs will be performed if the physician considers it&#xD;
      appropriate, however patients will not receive any other anti-cancer therapy under research,&#xD;
      while participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation. A sample space of 18 patients will be included if prior consent is&#xD;
      acquired and if they meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consider patient replacement in the following situation: if an adverse event&#xD;
      occurs that prevents the patient to start the treatment previously described in the protocol&#xD;
      after she has signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. A univariate analysis will be performed to describe the study&#xD;
      population. Descriptive statistics will be used to obtain measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion, as well as frequency of distribution for qualitative variables. A Bivariate&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to observe the influence among variables. Kruskal-Walliss test&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate variables of interest for different time points, before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment. To assess differences in clinical response, we will use Zarah Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative variables. All&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be constructed with a confidence of 95% (α=0.05). The&#xD;
      interpretation of the study results will be responsibility of researchers. An interim&#xD;
      analysis and a final report are planned; the first analysis will be made once the first 17&#xD;
      patients are included, and the final analysis is planned at 12 months after the last patient&#xD;
      is included. Data processing and analysis will be performed with the SPSS package (version&#xD;
      19.0®) for Microsoft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis. Safety will be assessed in all patients who have received at least one&#xD;
      chemotherapy application. To determine the safety of gemcitabine the following will be&#xD;
      evaluated: to assess the safety of renal function, glomerular filtration rate will be&#xD;
      evaluated; to assess systemic safety, number of required blood transfusions, clinical adverse&#xD;
      events (including laboratory abnormalities), severity of each adverse event according to the&#xD;
      toxicity criteria of CTCEA version 4.0, complications presented, and chronic toxicity&#xD;
      according to RTOG criteria (Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria). These will be&#xD;
      evaluated 3 months after completing concomitant QT/RT treatment, in follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients inclusion. Patients may start treatment within 21 days after being enrolled in&#xD;
           the study. During the first seven days prior to the inclusion of the patients in the&#xD;
           study, clinical history, complete physical examination including vital signs, weight,&#xD;
           and general condition according to the ECOG scale, will be performed. Laboratory data&#xD;
           (hematic biometry, serum electrolytes, glucose, serum creatinine, BUN, arterial blood&#xD;
           gas, liver function enzymes, general urine test, urine culture, creatinine clearance in&#xD;
           24 hours, pregnancy test and HIV), will be measured within the first 14 days, prior to&#xD;
           inclusion. Serum Cystatin C and urine albumin will also be determined at the National&#xD;
           Institute of Cardiology in Mexico, within 21 days prior to inclusion. Imaging studies&#xD;
           (PET-CT) will be performed to assess the tumor. To evaluate renal function, a bilateral&#xD;
           renal ultrasound and a renal gammagraphy will be performed within 28 days prior to&#xD;
           inclusion in the study. Additionally, thorax radiography will be required. If the&#xD;
           patient presents hydronephrosis G3-4, a double J stent will be used for continent&#xD;
           diversion, or a percutaneous nephrostomy procedure, and the patient may start treatment&#xD;
           within the first 24-48 hours. Patients who meet the selection criteria will be included&#xD;
           in the study to start treatment. Before initiating QT-RT, quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
           will be applied. To have a more accurate nephrological examination, the results of all&#xD;
           the laboratory tests previously mentioned for each patient, will be initially evaluated&#xD;
           by nephrologists from the National Institute of Cardiology and the National Institute of&#xD;
           Nutrition in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits during the study. After signing the informed consent, the patient will be&#xD;
           informed when she will begin participating in the study (screening visit). If the&#xD;
           patient complies with the inclusion criteria, a total of 21 visits will be scheduled. Of&#xD;
           these, 8 visits will be given during treatment (an initial visit, 6 visits for QT-RT, 2&#xD;
           to 5 visits for brachytherapy), and 8 follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring. Patient visits after QT-RT will be every 3 months during the follow-up year.&#xD;
           Laboratory tests will be performed every visit (hematic biometry, serum electrolytes,&#xD;
           glucose, serum creatinine, BUN, liver function enzymes, and general urine test). In case&#xD;
           of clinical suspicion of progression, image studies (PET-CT), bilateral renal ultrasound&#xD;
           and creatinine clearance calculation will be requested. The information obtained during&#xD;
           this period will be limited physical examination, performance status assessment (ECOG),&#xD;
           weight, measurement of tumor lesions by imaging studies, and date of progression or&#xD;
           recurrence. Late adverse events will be evaluated at each scheduled visit. EORTC QLQ-30&#xD;
           and QLQ Cx-24 questionnaires will be applied during follow-up every 3 months for the&#xD;
           first two years, and every 6 months for the following 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample collection. No tissue or additional blood samples will be obtained, other than&#xD;
           the blood samples used as part of the routine clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent acquisition. In the first visit, the consent will be read and explained&#xD;
           to the patient, clarifying the risks and benefits involved in the study. Two witnesses,&#xD;
           independent from the study, will be present when the consent is read and explained to&#xD;
           the patient. The patient will have the choice to not participate or withdraw from the&#xD;
           study at any time, her decision will not affect the quality of care and treatment that&#xD;
           the attending physician will provide. The researcher will be governed by the ethical&#xD;
           principles established in the Helsinki Accord. The physician will adequately respond all&#xD;
           the matters of interest to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations. The Research Committee and the Ethics Committee of the National&#xD;
      Institute of Cancer in Mexico has approved the protocol and the informed consent document.&#xD;
      The approval will be valid for one year with the possibility of re-approval. Authorization&#xD;
      from the national regulatory authority, the Federal Commission for the Protection against&#xD;
      Health Hazards (COFEPRIS), will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will be informed, through the informed consent, of all&#xD;
      the details concerning this trial. The patients who agree to participate in the trial will&#xD;
      express their willingness by signing the informed consent document, being clarified that they&#xD;
      can leave the trial at any time, if they wish to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory considerations. This study abides by the ethical principles established by the&#xD;
      international community, in accordance to the Good Clinical Practices, the Nüremberg Code,&#xD;
      the Helsinki Accord, the Statement of Compliance with International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the Regulations of the General Law&#xD;
      of Health in the matter of research for health.&#xD;
