    <textblock>
      Incretin-based therapy is currently one of the most popular diabetes treatment approaches.&#xD;
      However, differences of response ware found in previous studies. We hypothesis that SNPs of&#xD;
      DPP-4, GLP-1 and GLP-1R genes may play crucial roles in the response differences. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study aims to investigate the correlation of incretin-related gene polymorphism and&#xD;
      individual differences in the response of DPP-4 inhibators (take Sitagliptin as an example).&#xD;
      In addition, The distribution differences of the SNPs in diabetics and non-diabetics are&#xD;
      evaluated to study the relationships between the SNPs and diabetes onsets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) plays an important role in the differences of clinical&#xD;
      manifestations and drug responses of diseases. The vast majority of SNP sites are located in&#xD;
      the non-coding region of the gene (about 95%), which is called SNP(non-coding SNP (ncSNP),&#xD;
      while the other part of SNP is located in the coding region of the gene, which is called&#xD;
      coding SNP (cSNP). Furthermore, cSNP can be divided into two categories: SNP that does not&#xD;
      change the encoded amino acid sequence is called synonymous SNP(synonymous SNP, SSNP); SNP&#xD;
      that changes amino acid sequence is called SNP(non-synonymous SNP (NSNP). Although not&#xD;
      involved in coding amino acid, some ncSNPs may also affect the regulation of protein&#xD;
      expression. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the effects of NC SNP and cSNP on&#xD;
      the occurrence and development of diseases and drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 enzyme inhibitor is combined with DPP-4 enzyme in human body to reduce hydrolysis of&#xD;
      active GLP-1, thus increasing the level of endogenous active GLP-1. Active GLP-1 combines&#xD;
      with its receptor GLP-1R to promote insulin release and inhibit glucagon release in&#xD;
      hyperglycemia state, and produces opposite effect in hypoglycemia state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above principles, we speculate that SNP of genes that may affect the&#xD;
      hypoglycemic effect of DPP-4 enzyme inhibitor are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SNP of DPP-4 enzyme gene. SNP of DPP-4 enzyme gene may affect the enzyme activity and/or&#xD;
           protein expression level of DPP-4. Assuming that the effect of DPP-4 enzyme inhibitor is&#xD;
           sufficient, patients with higher DPP-4 enzyme activity are more sensitive to DPP-4&#xD;
           enzyme inhibitor drugs; However, for patients with low DPP-4 enzyme activity, DPP-4&#xD;
           enzyme inhibitor drugs cannot play a stronger role in lowering blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SNP of GLP-1 gene. SNP of GLP-1 gene may affect activity or expression level of GLP-1.&#xD;
           Patients with high GLP-1 level are more sensitive to DPP-4 enzyme inhibitor drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SNP of GLP-1R gene. SNP of GLP-1R gene may affect activity or expression level of&#xD;
           GLP-1R. Patients with high GLP-1R level are also more susceptible to DPP-4 enzyme&#xD;
           inhibitor drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies on the hypoglycemic effect of DPP-4, GLP-1 and their receptors on DPP-4&#xD;
      enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of T2DM are rare, which is not conducive to the evaluation&#xD;
      of individualized treatment of such drugs. Therefore, this chapter intends to select SNP&#xD;
      sites with high mutation frequencies of DPP-4, GLP-1 and GLP-1R genes to study the mutation&#xD;
      frequencies of these SNPs in diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients and their effects on&#xD;
      DPP-4 enzyme inhibitor sitagliptin's hypoglycemic effect on T2DM patients.&#xD;
