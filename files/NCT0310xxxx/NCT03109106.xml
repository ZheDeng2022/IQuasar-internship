  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics are overused in hospitals nationwide, leading to unnecessary drug costs and&#xD;
      adverse events. Antibiotic stewardship is now a national and international priority and&#xD;
      regulatory authorities are mandating antibiotic stewardship programs in all hospitals.&#xD;
      Respiratory infections account for a large percentage of antibiotic overuse. Procalcitonin&#xD;
      has been shown to help providers significantly shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy in&#xD;
      respiratory infections. As such, this institution seeks to evaluate the impact of PCT-guided&#xD;
      antibiotic management on antibiotic use in subjects with acute Lower Respiratory Tract&#xD;
      Infection (LRTI) with or without sepsis. Multiple studies have been conducted in Europe and&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety of the PCT-guided antibiotic management in pneumonia as well as&#xD;
      sepsis. This study will apply PCT-guided therapy to those populations in an all-US study&#xD;
      evaluating patient outcomes along with safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 200 patients in the Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided care cohort and 200&#xD;
      patients in the control cohort, using alternating 2 week time blocks until enrollment targets&#xD;
      are reached. Patients during control or non-intervention periods will be prospectively&#xD;
      identified and enrolled for the purposes of medical record review and follow up, but will not&#xD;
      undergo PCT testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Identification/ Recruitment: Intervention Periods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified either by the PI, research assistant, or co-investigator using an&#xD;
      Epic system list of patients admitted to a medical service (intensive care unit (ICU) or&#xD;
      ward) within the past 48 hours with a diagnosis of respiratory infection and receiving&#xD;
      antibiotics for &lt;24 hours, or via referrals from the Emergency Department and admitting&#xD;
      teams. Candidate patients will have evidence of an acute lower respiratory tract infection&#xD;
      (pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis) as defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o New onset within past 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      -At least one respiratory symptom: cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic&#xD;
      chest pain, wheezing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plus: At least one :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  auscultation abnormality suggestive of pneumonia (rales, ronchi, egophony)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OR a new consolidation on chest radiology consistent with pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OR at least one sign of systemic infection: fever &gt;38.1 or white blood cell (WBC) count&#xD;
           &gt;10,000 or &lt;4,000 o AND provider initiating empiric antibiotics The PI or&#xD;
           co-investigator will contact the primary provider, if the patient was not referred by&#xD;
           the team, and ask permission to approach the patient to discuss study participation. The&#xD;
           PI or consenting delegate will then obtain written consent from the patient within 48&#xD;
           hours of antibiotic initiation. Baseline PCT will be added on to admission blood&#xD;
           obtained prior to initiation of antibiotics after consent is obtained, Patients will be&#xD;
           included if first PCT is performed on blood drawn between 0-24 hours prior to antibiotic&#xD;
           initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial PCT levels will be obtained and antibiotic decisions guided as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inpatient Non-ICU units (Figure 1) - Med A, Med B, Bridgeview Unit,&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Antibiotic initiation and de-escalation for patients admitted with moderate severity&#xD;
           respiratory infections (CURB-65 = 2-3 pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
           (COPD) exacerbations), based on a Day 0 value and a Day 2 value (repeat q48 hours up&#xD;
           through D7 if previous values are &gt;0.25 ug/L). Withhold antibiotics for initial values&#xD;
           &lt;0.1-0.25 (recommend a repeat value 4-6 hours later if antibiotics are held),&#xD;
           discontinue antibiotics when PCT drops 80% from the peak value or to an absolute value&#xD;
           of &lt;0.25 ug/L. [Not routine care] i. If a patient is planned to discharge from the&#xD;
           hospital prior to the 48 hour PCT level, the team may draw the lab early for the&#xD;
           purposes of discharge antibiotic decisions, provided the values are drawn at least 6&#xD;
           hours apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Recommend use in conjunction with blood cultures in select patients, universal&#xD;
           respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel, urine Streptococcal and&#xD;
           Legionella antigens, and sputum cultures (&quot;the diagnostic bundle&quot; similar to Gelfer 2015&#xD;
           and Branche 2015). [Routine care]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intensive Care Unit (Figure 2) -MICU/Cardiac Intensive Care unit (CICU)/ Progressive&#xD;
           Care Unit (PCU)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Antibiotic de-escalation for patients with severe sepsis and community acquired&#xD;
           pneumonia (CAP)/ hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) / ventilator associated pneumonia&#xD;
           (VAP)/COPD exacerbations, based on a Day 0 value, with daily follow up levels.&#xD;
           Discontinuation recommended for a PCT decrease by ≥80% of peak value over the Day 0&#xD;
           value, or to &lt;0.5 ug/L.[Not routine care] i. Recommend use in conjunction with blood&#xD;
           cultures, universal respiratory viral PCR panel, urine Streptococcal and Legionella&#xD;
           antigens, and sputum cultures (&quot;the diagnostic bundle&quot; similar to Gelfer 2015 and&#xD;
           Branche 2015). [Routine care]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emergency Department (ED): No antibiotic prescribing decisions will be made in the&#xD;
           Emergency Department using the PCT-guided algorithm for this study. The ED will only be&#xD;
           a site of patient identification, referral, and recruitment as well as lab collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Identification/ Recruitment: Control Periods Patients will be identified either by&#xD;
      the PI, research assistant, or co-investigator using the same EPIC screening process and&#xD;
      inclusion strategy described above. The PI, research assistant, or co-investigator will&#xD;
      approach the patient and obtain verbal consent to enroll the patient in the comparison&#xD;
      cohort. The study team member will notify the primary provider of the patient's consent, but&#xD;
      no PCT will be ordered. The patient will receive antibiotics at the provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians overrides will be considered algorithm-compliant if during the initial prescribing&#xD;
      decision any of the following conditions exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory or hemodynamic instability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCT &lt; 0.1 μg/l: CAP with pneumonia severity index (PSI) V or (Confusion, uremia,&#xD;
           respiratory, blood pressure (CURB) 65 &gt;3, COPD with Global Initiative for Chronic&#xD;
           Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Class IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCT &lt; 0.25 μg/l: CAP with PSI ≥IV or CURB 65&gt;2, COPD with GOLD Class &gt; III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians may deviate from the algorithm at any point, but deviations for other reasons will&#xD;
      be considered &quot;provider discretion.&quot; In case of overruling or deviation, a repeated PCT&#xD;
      measurement and early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy after 3, 5,or 7 days will be&#xD;
      suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success of procalcitonin use requires confidence and leadership by the physician leaders in a&#xD;
      given area, support from ancillary staff (nursing) to obtain timely blood draws and cultures,&#xD;
      and prompting for algorithm use by clinical pharmacists or the stewardship team. Since&#xD;
      procalcitonin has already been in use at JHBMC for several years, many clinicians are&#xD;
      familiar with the test, but are not confident in its utility based on a lack of clinical&#xD;
      guidance/ protocol development. The project would require physician champions in each of the&#xD;
      service areas in order to educate providers on its use, help distribute the diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithms, and encourage implementation. The Antibiotic Stewardship Team is committed to&#xD;
      providing needed education and support for all clinical areas, and following up on&#xD;
      procalcitonin levels as able.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic Stewardship Team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate pocket cards with PCT algorithms, inclusion, and exclusion criteria (to&#xD;
           include Figure 1 + Detailed exclusion criteria on the floor; Figure 2 + detailed&#xD;
           exclusion criteria for the ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prepare educational materials for providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To educate providers on the PCT protocol and evidence for use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect antibiotic use data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology Lab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To provide a list of all procalcitonin values to designated person in each unit every day&#xD;
      (via secure means).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician Lead (2 housestaff, 2 hospitalists, 1 CICU, 1 MICU, 1 PCU):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assist with the distribution of algorithms and prompt providers in their service area&#xD;
           to use the algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To appoint a person to review the PCT results from their unit every day (ideally a&#xD;
           Clinical Pharmacy Specialist, or a charge registered nurse (RN), chief resident, etc)&#xD;
           and prompt providers to de-escalate antibiotics accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
