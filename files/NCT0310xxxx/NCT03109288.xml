      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In people with multiple sclerosis (MS), brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers&#xD;
      indicate inflammation or disease. Researchers want to see if 4 drugs given alone or combined&#xD;
      affect MS biomarkers. They want to see if a change in biomarker levels can predict which&#xD;
      drugs a person with MS might respond to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if signs of inflammation in CSF help predict a person s response to different drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are in protocol 09-I-0032&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have progressive MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can stand and walk a few steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take an MS drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in protocol 09-I-0032.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take 1 of the 4 study drugs. Researchers will call after 1 month to see how&#xD;
      they are doing. Some will start a second drug. They may take each drug or combination for up&#xD;
      to 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 visits a year for up to 6 years. Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays and scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam and tear collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle inserted between back bones removes some CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphocytapheresis: Blood is removed through a needle in one arm and run through a&#xD;
           machine. The blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sensor on the forehead records blood flow and oxygen use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may get a device for testing at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stop taking the drugs if they have taken 2 drugs together for 18 months or&#xD;
      if they do not do well on the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called 3 months later to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms drive progression of disability in&#xD;
      fully established multiple sclerosis (MS); therefore, it is unlikely that a single&#xD;
      therapeutic agent will be curative. Analogous to cardiovascular diseases, effective&#xD;
      treatments for evolved MS will likely require individualized combination therapies that&#xD;
      target pathogenic processes active in the particular patient. Ability to reliably measure&#xD;
      such pathogenic processes in living patients is a prerequisite for a precision-medicine&#xD;
      approach to MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using combinatorial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, we identified and validated&#xD;
      molecular diagnostic tests of MS and its progressive stage, tests that correlate with&#xD;
      clinical disability and brain atrophy (i.e., molecular tests of MS progression) and tests&#xD;
      that predict future rates of disability progression (i.e., molecular tests of MS severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These proteomic tests showed that intra-individually heterogeneous processes, different from&#xD;
      those that drive MS susceptibility, underlie continuous accumulation of disability and brain&#xD;
      atrophy in patients with progressive MS (PMS), or patients with relapsing-remitting (RRMS)&#xD;
      treated with current disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). These processes include&#xD;
      compartmentalized inflammation, activation of innate immunity such as myeloid lineage,&#xD;
      complement and coagulation cascade, toxic astrocytosis, restructuring of the extracellular&#xD;
      matrix in the form of fibrosis, and the re-expression (or lack of it) of developmental&#xD;
      pathways related to neurogenesis and remyelination. These alternative, likely pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms are essentially unaffected by current DMTs, consistent with observations of&#xD;
      declining efficacy of FDA-approved DMTs with advancing age of MS patients, so that&#xD;
      collectively, they offer no benefit on disability progression after age of approximately 53&#xD;
      years. Consequently, the objectives of this protocol are: 1. To develop clinical trial&#xD;
      methodology that allows economical screening of prospective therapeutic agents for their&#xD;
      efficacy on biological processes related to MS disease severity using CSF biomarkers; 2. To&#xD;
      develop knowledge base of intrathecal effects of current DMTs and novel treatments targeting&#xD;
      varied mechanisms of MS progression; and 3. To establish and validate framework for&#xD;
      development of effective combination therapies for MS via precision-medicine paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with MS who continue to accumulate clinical disability while untreated (e.g., PMS&#xD;
      subjects) or on FDA approved immunomodulatory therapies and can travel to NIH every 6 months&#xD;
      and undergo serial lumbar punctures (LP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has an adaptable workflow that allows simultaneous assessments of multiple&#xD;
      therapeutic agents while maximizing potential therapeutic benefit to the studied subjects and&#xD;
      providing knowledge necessary for rational development of future combination therapies for&#xD;
      MS. The protocol studies drugs whose mechanism of action (MOA) has the potential to inhibit&#xD;
      identified processes underlying MS disease severity. Patients will be assigned to one of the&#xD;
      drugs that are not contra-indicated based on existing comorbidities and to which the patient&#xD;
      has a therapeutic target (e.g., treatment that inhibits activation of myeloid lineage will be&#xD;
      assigned only to patients who have elevated CSF biomarkers of myeloid lineage). Longitudinal&#xD;
      measurements of CSF biomarkers will determine if the applied treatment(s) exert the desired&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in the intrathecal compartment. Drugs that do not reproducibly&#xD;
      effect CSF biomarkers will be dropped from further study (or will be tested in higher dose,&#xD;
      if possible), and replaced by new agents under protocol amendments, while drugs with&#xD;
      measurable intrathecal PD activity will be combined to evaluate additive or synergistic&#xD;
      effects. Subjects who are treated by drugs that were found to be ineffective will be switched&#xD;
      to alternative/new drug and their monotherapy or combination therapy period will be restarted&#xD;
      with the goal of each subject finishing 18 months of monotherapy and additional 18 months of&#xD;
      combination theapy with effective drugs only. Safety, tolerability, and pilot&#xD;
      clinical/imaging efficacy data will evaluate surrogacy of the biomarkers and collect data for&#xD;
      power analysis for future definitive trials. The increased understanding of biomarker biology&#xD;
      will be utilized to derive process-specific combinatorial biomarkers and biomarker signatures&#xD;
      predictive of clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be the change in Combinatorial Weight-adjusted dIsability ScalE&#xD;
      (CombiWISE) progression at the end of monotherapy + combination therapy period in comparison&#xD;
      to projected baseline disability progression. The acquired longitudinal data will be used for&#xD;
      assessment of biomarker surrogacy, for identification and validation of PD markers for&#xD;
      development of new therapeutic entities and for power analysis of future/definitive clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in 09-I-0032 protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically definite MS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 at time of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1.0-7.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented sustained clinical progression of at least 0.5 CombiWISE points/year&#xD;
             (measured by greater than or equal to 4 time-points regression analysis of CombiWISE&#xD;
             values spanning at least 1.5 years in total)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form&#xD;
             of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who desire to continue their current FDA-approved DMTs based on its perceived&#xD;
             (partial) therapeutic benefit will be enrolled with the understanding that the&#xD;
             underlying FDA-approved therapy must remain stable during this protocol. If patient&#xD;
             desires and/or his/her medical condition requires changing FDA-approved DMT during the&#xD;
             duration of this protocol, the drugs administered under this protocol will be&#xD;
             withdrawn, to establish new baseline of CSF biomarkers under changed therapy, and, if&#xD;
             necessary, to establish new progression rate. New baseline of CSF biomarkers on&#xD;
             changed therapy can be established after 6 months of new therapy. Because the efficacy&#xD;
             of current DMTs decreases with patient s age so that on average, zero percent efficacy&#xD;
             on disability progression occurs after age 53, only those patients who change to&#xD;
             higher potency therapy (i.e., treatment escalation) before age 53 will need to repeat&#xD;
             the entire process of establishing baseline progression rate: go back to greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 1.5 year baseline period on new DMT to verify that the rate of progression&#xD;
             remains greater than or equal to 0.5 CombiWISE points/year. Following therapeutic&#xD;
             change that occurs before age 53 will be considered treatment escalation: 1.&#xD;
             Initiation of any FDA-approved DMT in previously untreated subject or 2. Change from&#xD;
             any low potency (i.e., copaxone, teriflunamide, interferon beta preparations, dimethyl&#xD;
             fumarate and fingolimod) to any high potency drugs (i.e., natalizumab, ocrelizumab,&#xD;
             rituximab, alemtuzumab, siponimod and mitoxantrone). All other therapy changes (i.e.,&#xD;
             parallel change from low efficacy to low efficacy or from high efficacy to high&#xD;
             efficacy, as well as discontinuation of treatment after age 53) will require new CSF&#xD;
             baseline (6 months after such therapy change), but will not require 18 months to&#xD;
             calculate new CombiWISE slope. After new CSF baseline, and, if necessary, new&#xD;
             CombiWISE progression slopes are established, patient can be matched to the same&#xD;
             monotherapy or combination therapy regimen they were on before the immunomodulatory&#xD;
             DMT change.&#xD;
