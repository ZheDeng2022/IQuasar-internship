  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an instrument (semi-structured&#xD;
      interview) called Workload Analysis Instrument (WAI) (Análisis de Carga de Trabajo ACT), in&#xD;
      detecting the presence of occupational risk in patients presenting an upper-limb&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorder. The test instrument was developed by Asociación Chilena de&#xD;
      Seguridad (ACHS). This instrument will be applied to the worker when he or she visits the&#xD;
      ACHS health care facility. The test administration is performed by an ergonomics specialist&#xD;
      previously trained in WAI. WAI is the index test and the gold standard will be the Estudio de&#xD;
      Puesto de Trabajo (EPT) resolution. The hypothesis of the study is that WAI is able to&#xD;
      correctly label the occupational origin (rule in or rule out) of an upper-limb&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorder. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value will be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional and prospective study where both the application of the index and&#xD;
      reference instruments will be performed after the complete planning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated assuming 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity of the WAI, based on&#xD;
      experience with a similar instrument prior to WAI and on which WAI is built, which was used&#xD;
      at the Hospital del Trabajador. For an absolute precision of 5%, the necessary sample size of&#xD;
      people who actually have a work-related illness and those who do not actually have that&#xD;
      origin should be 246. If 6% preciiosion is accepted that sample size should be 171.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of ULMD qualified as from occupational origin is under 10% among patients who&#xD;
      consult at the centers of the Metropolitan Region, according to the ACHS. Thus, the&#xD;
      calculated final sample was approximately 1700 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the project's budget, 900 applications of the WAI are to be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will successively recruit patients: up to 246 true positives or 900 patients&#xD;
      (whichever is reached first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 75 WAI evaluations could be performed per month, with an average of 3.4&#xD;
      per day. Consequently, the sample of 900 would be achieved after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLOW OF PATIENTS Patients will be recruited in an ad hoc facility at the Hospital del&#xD;
      Trabajador located in the Metropolitan Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry of a participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each worker / patient who consults the facility or an emergency center of the ACHS agencies&#xD;
      with a claim of professional illness involving a musculoskeletal disorder of the upper&#xD;
      extremity (ULMD), within a pre-established range of time in a day and on pre-established days&#xD;
      of the week, will be recruited for the study. The worker must voluntarily file a claim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Derivation All consecutive workers with a suspicion of ULMD should be referred to the study.&#xD;
      Once the attending physician verifies the patient meets the inclusion criteria, he or she&#xD;
      will immediately refer the patient to the WAI evaluation without previously providing any&#xD;
      information about the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for work reasons or force majeure the worker cannot immediately go to the place where the&#xD;
      WAI evaluator is, an appointment will be made for another day according to the worker's&#xD;
      availability. The rest of the medical treatment and other referrals will be indicated&#xD;
      according to the regular medical procedure, thus preventing this new evaluation (WAI) from&#xD;
      interfering with the patient's usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be asked by the same evaluator. The process will be carried out in a&#xD;
      room designated by the ACHS protecting the privacy of the participant. In this contact, the&#xD;
      evaluator will spend approximately 10 minutes explaining the study objectives and asking for&#xD;
      consent. Afterwards, the patient must read the informed consent document and he may refuse,&#xD;
      doubt or accept to participate. In case of doubt the evaluator will inform the patient that&#xD;
      one of the researchers will contact him or her within the next 24 hours and, if necessary,&#xD;
      another appointment will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient accepts immediately, he or she must sign the informed consent form and the&#xD;
      evaluator will then proceed to the application of the WAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study external personnel to the ACHS (evaluators) will be contracted and supervised&#xD;
      by Medwave Estudios Limitada, and trained by the ACHS. Hired evaluators must be titled&#xD;
      Kinesiologists with postgraduate experience in Ergonomics or Occupational Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the instrument:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WAI will be applied in the office designated by the ACHS. The evaluator will have&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes for this interview, in which he must collect all the necessary&#xD;
      information. Application of the instrument will be done in accordance with the WAI manual&#xD;
      prepared by the ACHS Workforce Survey team of evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment and materials The room where the WAI is applied must be provided with a table and&#xD;
      at least one chair with enough comfort for the patient to be seated during the duration of&#xD;
      the interview and for the interviewer to ask the questions, listen to the answers and&#xD;
      translate them into the document form which must be available in digital format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS The general background of the worker and his place of work will be evaluated, as&#xD;
      well as the worker´s sociodemographic characteristics. For the description of his work the&#xD;
      occupational history and the type of work that he carries out will be evaluated emphasizing&#xD;
      about schedules and rest arrangements. Job description will emerge from the detailed&#xD;
      interview, considering tasks and times of effective and total work, breaks and overtime. The&#xD;
      evaluator must not make a diagnostic hypothesis about the occupational origin of the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAI INTERPRETATION Once the WAI evaluation is obtained, it should be sent in the&#xD;
      pre-established digital format to the ACHS office where it will be reviewed by a professional&#xD;
      evaluator from the ACHS staff who must not be part of the final Qualification committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important for a diagnostic accuracy study to preserve the masking of people who&#xD;
      apply or interpret the instruments of the study in each stage of its conduction. The ACHS&#xD;
      will have special responsibility in helping to maintain the masking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final professional evaluator (ACHS) must issue an opinion with three possibilities: 1)&#xD;
      possible occupational origin, 2) discarded occupational origin and 3) doubtful. This final&#xD;
      result of the WAI must be available not later than 15 business days, always before the result&#xD;
      of the final evaluation (gold standard). Once the opinion is issued, each WAI will be sent to&#xD;
      the Medwave Estudios Limitada headquarters for data processing and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRAINING Training on the use of the WAI will be carried out by ACHS staff, led by the&#xD;
      kinesiologist Patricia Ferreira. They were in charge of the preparation of the WAI and its&#xD;
      manual. This training will take place during the month of April.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT Once the approval of the Ethics Committee is obtained, and the WAI evaluators trained,&#xD;
      we will proceed to perform the pilot phase whose objective will be to gauge all the&#xD;
      inconveniences that emerge during the application of the instrument. The pilot will be&#xD;
      carried out in the same facilities prepared for the study. Patients will meet the same&#xD;
      inclusion criteria as those to be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABOUT THE GOLD STANDARD (WORKPLACE STUDY AND QUALIFICATION COMMITTEE) Patients who arrive for&#xD;
      consultation with ACHS physicians for ULMD with a claim of work origin must undergo a&#xD;
      &quot;qualification process that includes several activities that the governing bodies must&#xD;
      fulfill in order to determine the occupational or common origin of the diseases allegedly of&#xD;
      professional origin&quot; as set out in Circular 3241 of the Superintendence of Social Security,&#xD;
      Chile, dated July 27, 2016. This circular:&quot; instructs the administering agencies of Law&#xD;
      Insurance 16744 on the protocol of minimum standards of evaluation that must be complied in&#xD;
      the process of qualifying the origin of the diseases denounced as professionals &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualification process will begin with the presentation of an individual claim of&#xD;
      Professional Illness by the employer, the worker, their beneficiaries or others consigned in&#xD;
      the circular. It includes a specific study of the workplace and must end with the final&#xD;
      result given by a Qualification Committee which must determine the common or labor origin of&#xD;
      the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations must be carried out by professionals with specific competencies. - The study&#xD;
      of workplace consists of the detailed analysis by observation in the field, the&#xD;
      characteristics and environmental conditions in which a particular worker performs his job&#xD;
      and the activities, tasks or operations that he performs. The qualification process must be&#xD;
      concluded in full within a maximum period of 30 calendar days from the submission of the&#xD;
      Individual Claim for Occupational Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above means that for each subject evaluated by the WAI, the final opinion of the&#xD;
      Qualification Committee would have a maximum of 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opinion of the Qualification Committee is the gold standard of the study for the&#xD;
      definition of whether or not it is a pathology of possible occupational origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once obtained the opinion of the Qualification Committee, the counterpart of the ACHS,&#xD;
      coordinated in this case by Patricia Ferreira, will be in charge of weekly reports to the&#xD;
      central office of data analysis located in Medwave Estudios. In this office, the data will be&#xD;
      received by Matías Goyenechea, or whom he appoints. If, after a week has elapsed, no&#xD;
      information has been received, the reception manager will monitor what happened during that&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing includes a database with all relevant data obtained from the WAI and the&#xD;
      final result. Statistical analysis comprises the estimation of sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
      predictive values with their corresponding confidence intervals. Estimations will be made for&#xD;
      the final diagnosis (occupational origin or not) as a whole and for each of the upper limbs&#xD;
      segments considered where possible.&#xD;
