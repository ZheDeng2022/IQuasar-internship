  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to compare the proposed algorithm for preventing and treating&#xD;
      spinal hypotension with normal anesthesia management of a spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed algorithm mainly will depend upon the left ventricular end diastolic area&#xD;
      measurement by transthoracic echocardiography to assess the left ventricular preload status&#xD;
      and its usefulness in preventing and treating spinal hypotension.&#xD;

      Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare an echocardiography based algorithm of hemodynamic management as compared to&#xD;
      standard practice in decreasing the incidence of spinal hypotension (number of patients&#xD;
      developing a decrease in MAP &gt;20% of baseline or MAP &lt;60 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the number of episodes, magnitude of hypotension (lowest value of BP) and&#xD;
           duration of hypotension in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the amount of fluids and vasopressors administered to maintain hemodynamic&#xD;
           stability in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as prospective, randomized intention to treat trial. After obtaining&#xD;
      written informed consent, a total of 60 patients, above 40 years of age presenting for&#xD;
      elective lower abdominal or lower limb surgery and eligible to receive a subarachnoid block&#xD;
      at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh from 1st January&#xD;
      2016 to March 31st 2017 will be enrolled in this study. Patients with contraindications to a&#xD;
      central neuraxial block such as pre- existing coagulopathy, local sepsis at site of&#xD;
      insertion, ongoing hemodynamic instability (defined as systolic blood pressure&lt; 90 mm Hg or&#xD;
      MAP&lt; 65mm Hg), unwillingness to undergo a regional anesthesia, co- existing pregnancy, spinal&#xD;
      dysraphism or, previous history of spinal instrumentation or surgery, chest deformity,&#xD;
      demonstrated systolic dysfunction on screening echocardiography (defined as left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction &lt;50% or, fractional shortening &lt; 25%), valvular heart disease (known or&#xD;
      diagnosed on screening echocardiography), chronic renal or liver disease and unwilling to&#xD;
      participate in the trial will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After standard preoperative fasting of 8hr, all patients will receive intravenous access and&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure monitor set to be recorded automatically every 2 minutes, five&#xD;
      lead continuous electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and capnography for non-intubated&#xD;
      patients inside OR. In addition, a screening echocardiogram for right and/ or left heart&#xD;
      dysfunction (fractional shortening&lt; 25% or ejection fraction &lt; 50%/ and tricuspid annular&#xD;
      plane systolic excursion &lt; 17 mm) and exclusion of valvular heart disease will be performed.&#xD;
      If an abnormality is detected patient will be excluded from the study at this point,&#xD;
      enrolment proceeding on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter the patients will be randomized into either of two groups using computer generated&#xD;
      random number and sealed envelope method: Gr (E) echocardiography based fluid and hemodynamic&#xD;
      management or, Gr (S) standard anaesthetic management. In group E patients, before&#xD;
      administering spinal anesthesia, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the LVEDA using the mid papillary parasagittal short axis (PSAX) view. The average&#xD;
      of at least 3 LVEDA measured on above view by an experienced anesthesiologist in TTE will be&#xD;
      used for fluid management, as per the proposed algorithm . If spinal hypotension does occur&#xD;
      in patients in group E, it will be managed according to the same proposed algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE PROPOSED ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY BASED ALGORITHM :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The left ventricular end diastolic area (LVEDA) will be measured by Transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography using the parasternal short axis view. If the LVEDA is more than 10 square&#xD;
      centimeters, the left ventricular preload status will be deemed adequate and administration&#xD;
      of spinal anesthesia will be proceeded as usual. If the LVEDA is less than 10 square cms, a&#xD;
      fluid(NS/Balanced salt solution) bolus of 250 ml will be administered and LVEDA reassessed.&#xD;
      If more than 10 square cms, spinal anaesthesia will be administered. If less, a second bolus&#xD;
      of 250 ml fluid will be given and then LVEDA reassessed. If more than 10 square centimeters,&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia will be administered, if not the patient will be considered fluid&#xD;
      unresponsive and spinal anesthesia will be administered after giving a phenylephrine iv bolus&#xD;
      of 1-2µg/kg and then spinal anaesthesia administered. In the event of postspinal hypotension&#xD;
      within 30 minutes of giving spinal anaesthesia, the LVEDA will be reassessed. If more than 10&#xD;
      square centimeters, volume status will be considered adequate and patient will be given a&#xD;
      vasopressor bolus of 1-2µg/kg of phenylephrine. If less than 10 square centimeters, the&#xD;
      patient volume status will be considered low and a fluid bolus of 250ml and LVEDA reassessed&#xD;
      and managed as in a prespinal LVEDA of less than 10 square centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in group S will receive fluid and vasopressor therapy (if required) as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the attending anaesthesiologist. The attending anaesthesiologist will be will&#xD;
      target a MAP, such that it does not fall below 60 mm Hg nor below &gt;20% of its baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetic management protocol will be standardized for both the groups namely all&#xD;
      patient will receive 3.0ml of local anaesthetic fentanyl mixture [2.5ml of 0.5%bupivacaine +&#xD;
      0.5ml(25µg) of fentanyl], ringer lactate/ any balanced salt solution(BSS) for fluid&#xD;
      management and phenylephrine 1-2µg/kg intermittent boluses to treat hypotension. No i.v&#xD;
      sedative or analgesic medication will be administered until completion of study. Patient&#xD;
      position will be kept supine till end of the study period and surgical incision will be given&#xD;
      thereafter. The attending anesthesiologist managing case will be not be involved in the study&#xD;
      and will be blinded for the goal and parameters recorded in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient demographic data characteristics such as age, sex, height, weight, observed&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters, LVEDA and changes in LVEDA following bolus volume&#xD;
      administration will be noted. The echocardiographic parameters will be recorded for later&#xD;
      analysis. The hemodynamic parameters will be recorded for every 1 minutes for 1st 10 minutes&#xD;
      of spinal drug administration and thereafter at 5 minutes interval till the study period. The&#xD;
      number of episodes of hypotension and the total fraction of time spent below target values in&#xD;
      the first 30 minutes post spinal block (defined by decrease in MAP exceeded &gt;20% from&#xD;
      baseline and absolute value &lt;60 mm Hg), magnitude of hypotension (lowest value of BP), volume&#xD;
      of crystalloid / colloid, number of times vasopressors were used and total doses of&#xD;
      vasopressors required will be noted. Any side effect like nausea/ vomiting, persistent&#xD;
      hypotension defined by decrease in MAP exceeding &gt;20% from baseline for 5 minutes or more&#xD;
      will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure values within 30 minutes of administering spinal anesthesia will be&#xD;
      considered and analysed for study purposes, to exclude the effect of surgical factors on&#xD;
      hemodynamics.&#xD;
