      Somatostatin analogues are a last resort for medical intervention in hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      hypoglycemia (HH). The hypoglycemia is very debilitating and can be even life threatening.&#xD;
      There is limited experience with pasireotide in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (only one&#xD;
      publication); there is more experience with octreotide, both in adults and children&#xD;
      successful interventions with octreotide in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been&#xD;
      published. Pasireotide via its different somatostatin receptor binding profile has clear&#xD;
      effects on insulin, glucagon and incretin secretion and can ultimately lead to hyperglycemia.&#xD;
      This mode of action (especially the effects on insulin and incretin secretion) could be very&#xD;
      useful in the setting of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia as a complication of gastric bypass surgery has been reported&#xD;
      to occur between 6 months to 8-10 years after gastric bypass surgery. Although reported as a&#xD;
      rare complication from surgery, the incidence is likely higher due to the condition being&#xD;
      missed in many patients or being misdiagnosed as dumping syndrome. Unlike dumping syndrome&#xD;
      which often presents early in the post-operative course and improves with dietary&#xD;
      modification, patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have severe postprandial&#xD;
      hypoglycemia and sometimes fasting hypoglycemia with symptoms worsening over time despite&#xD;
      dietary modification. Calcium stimulation testing often localizes the area of the pancreas&#xD;
      where hyperinsulinemia is occurring due to islet cell dysfunction. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      islet cell hypertrophy with Nesidioblastosis is poorly understood. One theory is an increase&#xD;
      in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration may be responsible for islet cell expansion&#xD;
      and subsequent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia is incapacitating where patients are restricted&#xD;
      from driving, are unable to work, and must always have someone present with glucagon due to&#xD;
      the acute severe onset of neuroglycopenia. Surgery to resect the area of the pancreas with&#xD;
      Nesidioblastosis has a low success rate of about 60% with many patients developing type 1&#xD;
      diabetes as a result of pancreatic resection. Medical treatment options include calcium&#xD;
      channel blockers, Diazoxide, and Octreotide yet patients often fail these treatments as well.&#xD;
      Pasireotide would likely be a better option than the current medical therapy available. With&#xD;
      Pasireotide, the inhibition of insulin release through inhibiting the somatostatin receptors&#xD;
      as well as possible GLP-1 inhibition causing hyperglycemia should reduce hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes in these patients.&#xD;

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. If the patient is a sexually active male he is excluded unless he agrees to use a&#xD;
             condom during intercourse while taking pasireotide and for 3 months after stopping&#xD;
             pasireotide medication . They should not father a child in this period. A condom is&#xD;
             required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug&#xD;
             via seminal fluid&#xD;
