    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the safety and response to the investigational drug&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) following chemo-radiation therapy for patients with MSS stage II to IV&#xD;
      rectal cancer. Durvalumab recognizes specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells and&#xD;
      triggers the immune system to destroy the cancer cells. The chemoRT portion of the treatment&#xD;
      will be completed just before the course of durvalumab is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to learn more about certain characteristics of rectal cancer tumors, this study&#xD;
      includes special research tests using samples from diagnostic tumors, a tissue sample from&#xD;
      tumors removed during surgery, fresh tumor samples from an area where the cancer has&#xD;
      recurred, and blood samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FR-2 study is designed as a phase II, open label, single arm study in patients with&#xD;
      microsatellite stable (MSS) stages II-IV rectal cancer, to assess the activity of PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibition with durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy after standard chemo-radiotherapy&#xD;
      (chemoRT). The study's primary aim is to determine the safety and efficacy of durvalumab&#xD;
      immediately following chemoRT in patients undergoing subsequent surgery with stage II-IV&#xD;
      rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of durvalumab will be given every 2 weeks for four total doses beginning within 3-7&#xD;
      days of completing chemoRT. Surgery for all patients must occur within 8-12 weeks of the&#xD;
      final dose of RT. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical recovery is at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a safety run-in, the first 6 patients will be closely followed for 30 days after last&#xD;
      dose of durvalumab without further accrual of patients. Patients will receive durvalumab&#xD;
      (750mg IV infusion once every 2 weeks) for 4 total doses. No other concurrent anti-neoplastic&#xD;
      medications or treatments aside from standard supportive care will be allowed during the&#xD;
      durvalumab treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety run-in portion of the study will proceed to full enrollment at the proposed study&#xD;
      therapy dose, (750 mg IV infusion every 2 weeks), if one or less dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      or significant safety concern attributable to durvalumab is identified during the observation&#xD;
      period of the first 6 patients. If there are two or more DLTs, accrual to the study will stop&#xD;
      with reassessment of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 44 patients will be enrolled in this study for a sample size of 41 surgically&#xD;
      evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required tissue and blood samples will be collected at specific time points and submitted for&#xD;
      correlative science studies. Optional tumor and blood samples will be collected from&#xD;
      consenting patients upon disease recurrence or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing use of non-operative therapy for patients with rectal cancer who achieve&#xD;
      a complete clinical response and in order to maximize the inclusion of patients participating&#xD;
      in this trial, we changed the primary endpoint from NAR score to modified NAR score (mNAR).&#xD;
      The mNAR score substitutes values from clinical staging for the pathologic T-Stage and&#xD;
      N-Stage for those patients who don't go to surgery because of a complete clinical response&#xD;
      and consequently have no pathology. Additionally, because of enrollment challenges related to&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic and the exploratory nature of including stage IV patients, we are moving&#xD;
      the stage IV analysis to exploratory and reducing the number of patients needing to be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study to approximately 44.&#xD;
