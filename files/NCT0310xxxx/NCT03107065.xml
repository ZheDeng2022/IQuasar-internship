    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open-label, and single-center, single-treatment prospective evaluation of&#xD;
      the electrocoagulation of axillary sweat gland tissue using the ThermiRF device to improve&#xD;
      excessive sweating of the axilla(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, &quot;Temporary Relief&quot; is defined as improvement on the DLQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty male and female subjects between 18 and 50 years old will be enrolled. A total of five&#xD;
      visits are planned for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A punch biopsy will be collected (prior to and post treatment and analyzed to determine the&#xD;
      degree of impact to the tissue after the electrocoagulation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be collected using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) a 10-point scale,&#xD;
      and adverse events reports (observed or reported).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of the study is approximately 4 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open-label, and single-center, single-treatment prospective evaluation of&#xD;
      the electrocoagulation of axillary sweat gland tissue using the ThermiRF device to alleviate&#xD;
      or improve symptoms associated with axillary sweating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, &quot;Temporary Relief&quot; is defined as improvement on the DLQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 male and female healthy volunteers between the age of 18 and 50 will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Subjects who sign the informed consent form and meet all entry&#xD;
      criteria will be assigned a unique number/code to preserve confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of five visits are planned for this study as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Screening visit - (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Single Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Day 30 (± 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4: Day 60 (± 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5: Day 90 (± 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A punch biopsy will be collected at Visit 1(screening), Visit 2 (post-treatment) and Visit 4&#xD;
      (Day 60). The purpose of the punch biopsy is to evaluate the degree of impact to the axillary&#xD;
      organ after the electrocoagulation treatment when compared to pre-treatment at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be collected using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) a 10-point scale,&#xD;
      and adverse events reports (observed or reported).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of the study is approximately 4 months.&#xD;
