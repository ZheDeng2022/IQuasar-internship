    <textblock>
      In recent years more and more collaboration between hospitals performing bariatric surgery&#xD;
      occur and more exchange of knowledge on pre and postoperative care is shared. Different&#xD;
      countries have many different protocols to select and guide patients through bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, and even within countries differences exist. These are most commonly based on expert&#xD;
      opinions and cultural influences. Although many outcomes of the different approaches are&#xD;
      known, the pathways the patient has to take and the accessibility to bariatric surgery are&#xD;
      unclear for each country as well as how the care for these patients is financially arranged.&#xD;
      As a progressive research collaboration, we would like to gain more insight into these&#xD;
      different approaches. With this study we would like to gain more insight into the&#xD;
      accessibility and restrictions to accessibility to both bariatric surgery and body contouring&#xD;
      surgery after massive weight loss that exists in all 51 European countries, as well as why&#xD;
      this disparity exists.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery not only gives patients a new chance in life, but also facilitates&#xD;
      improvements in social and mental status. Initially, guidance towards this life-changing&#xD;
      surgery was often performed by the surgeons themselves. Before surgery, the patient had a&#xD;
      short consultation and was given only limited information about the surgery and the expected&#xD;
      results. The surgeon was often the only health care professional who made a judgment on&#xD;
      whether a patient was suitable for bariatric surgery. On average, patients had annual or&#xD;
      bi-annual postoperative follow-up. These visits focused in particular on weight loss and&#xD;
      reduction in comorbidities. Today we know that this way of selecting and preparing patients&#xD;
      for bariatric operations was inadequate. Many questions remained unanswered and patients did&#xD;
      not know what to expect. In particular, many patients were unable to cope with the&#xD;
      psychological adaptation required to undertake dietary and lifestyle changes to maximise&#xD;
      weight loss. Because the number of follow-up visits were limited, many problems were not&#xD;
      overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong need for patients to have access to specialized professionals. In addition,&#xD;
      it is very important to have patients screened by a multidisciplinary team before undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. This team can quickly identify problems and can give advice on how to&#xD;
      manage these. Although we all agree that morbid obese patients should have access to&#xD;
      professional healthcare, we do not know the pathways the patient has to go to gain access. It&#xD;
      seems logical that each country in Europe has his own pathways, but which one results in the&#xD;
      best outcomes? As described above, there has been rapid growth in the number of patients&#xD;
      undergoing bariatric surgery. Proper regulation of screening, follow-up and frequent&#xD;
      counselling seems to strongly influence outcomes, like average weight loss. In the long term,&#xD;
      a continuous supply of care is important to prevent weight gain. This has resulted in&#xD;
      significant logistical issues for many hospitals, as care for each patient must be properly&#xD;
      regulated and guaranteed. This care should be given for life, to identify and manage problems&#xD;
      as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years more and more collaboration between hospitals occur and more exchange of&#xD;
      knowledge on pre and postoperative care is shared. Different countries have many different&#xD;
      protocols to select and guide patients through bariatric surgery, and even within countries&#xD;
      differences exist. These are most commonly based on expert opinions and cultural influences.&#xD;
      Although many outcomes of the different approaches are known, the pathways the patient has to&#xD;
      take and the accessibility to bariatric surgery are unclear for each country as well as how&#xD;
      the care for these patients is financially arranged. As a progressive research collaboration,&#xD;
      we would like to gain more insight into these different approaches. With this study we would&#xD;
      like to gain more insight into the accessibility and restrictions to access to both bariatric&#xD;
      surgery and body contouring surgery after massive weight loss that exists in the different&#xD;
      European countries, as well as why this disparity exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore accessibility to bariatric surgery and quality of care in different European&#xD;
      countries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To gain insight into the referral system for bariatric surgery in each European country&#xD;
           for morbidly obese patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the differences in inclusion criteria and registries for bariatric&#xD;
           surgery per European country&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the funding of bariatric and contouring surgery in each European country&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify the differences in the multidisciplinary team providing care for bariatric&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify the differences in the number of operations per surgeon and per hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Money:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The amount of money which is used for reimbursement of bariatric surgery / Total&#xD;
                amount of money in each healthcare system . This needs to be set in context with&#xD;
                the population who does fulfil the criteria to undergo bariatric surgery according&#xD;
                to (inter?)national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Methods to calculate reimbursement data: (Data from insurance companies: How much&#xD;
                on average for a procedure? x Procedures (number and type) being performed a year&#xD;
                (data from official register or society) per country&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Guideline differences and Evidence)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. How does the country comply with the evidence and/or International Federation for&#xD;
                Surgery on Obesity (IFSO) Consensus Statement?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Are there specific national Guidelines?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. What are the criteria for reimbursement? Do they comply to national Guidelines?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the patient's journey:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. First contact to the bariatric surgeon... to bariatric surgery. (Differences in the&#xD;
                system (self-referral, General Practitioner (GP) referral, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Time interval from first contact to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Waiting time for elective surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient collective (Are there differences? Baseline BMI / Co-morbidities?)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Outcome (register: no register)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. How many patients undergo surgery in a centre&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. How many patients undergo surgery in an University Hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Plastic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. How is referral arranged?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Is it reimbursed and secondly how?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed by the six researchers mentioned above. A questionnaire has been&#xD;
      specifically designed for the purpose of this study (see appendix 1). Also, an inventory will&#xD;
      be made as to who the national representatives for bariatric surgery are who can be&#xD;
      interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 51 countries have been divided between the six participants in this study and each&#xD;
      participant will within six months gather the data required per country. Data will digitally&#xD;
      be send to the research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IFSO secretary will be contacted to ask them to participate in this study and let us sent&#xD;
      the questionnaire to all members. Secondly, the industry (Johnson and Johnson) will be asked&#xD;
      to contact their connections on a nationwide scale to also sent the same questionnaire. If&#xD;
      these are insufficient, we will try to contact insurance companies and/or patient groups to&#xD;
      gain more data.&#xD;
