  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syndactyly is the most common hand abnormality in children. During development, two or more&#xD;
      fingers do not separate in the usual way and remain connected by skin. Surgery is needed to&#xD;
      separate the fingers. Usually, it is performed between 6 months and 3 years of age, depending&#xD;
      on the severity of the syndactyly. During the surgery, the fingers are separated; however,&#xD;
      there isn't enough skin to completely cover the fingers once they are separated. There are&#xD;
      two areas on the fingers that need to be covered after separation, and there is a standard&#xD;
      method, and now a new technique to cover these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard current technique that surgeons use to cover the newly separated fingers is to&#xD;
      apply a small section of the patient's own skin taken from a different area of their body&#xD;
      (this is known as a skin graft).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technique called Hyaluronic acid matrix (Hyalomatrix®) is a U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approved, commercially available, skin graft substitute that is&#xD;
      currently being used both in the US and in Europe. The Hyalomatrix (or skin graft substitute)&#xD;
      is sutured into place using a stitch on each corner, over the areas left without skin&#xD;
      covering during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare effectiveness, wound healing, scar formation and&#xD;
      potential associated complications of the current skin graft technique with the new technique&#xD;
      called Hyalomatrix (or skin graft substitute) following surgery.&#xD;

      Background/Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syndactyly is a congenital condition where children are born with webbing between their&#xD;
      fingers. Syndactyly is the most common congenital hand condition in Caucasian children.&#xD;
      Treatment for syndactyly is a syndactyly separation surgery, most commonly between 6 months&#xD;
      and 3 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndactyly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syndactyly release surgery is typically performed by rearranging skin on the fingers and hand&#xD;
      to cover the separated digits. However, there is seldom enough skin to cover all surfaces&#xD;
      after separation of the digits and 2 similarly size defects are left, one at the base of each&#xD;
      finger. The gold standard for covering these remaining defects has been full-thickness&#xD;
      autograft skin. However, harvesting the graft, closing the defect at the harvest site and&#xD;
      suturing the grafts into place requires considerable time (the investigators estimate a total&#xD;
      of 60 minutes per web space). With recent concerns arising over prolonged anesthesia and&#xD;
      brain development in young children, pediatric surgeons are searching for ways to limit&#xD;
      anesthesia exposure. In addition to the prolonged anesthesia time for harvesting and suturing&#xD;
      the autograft, the donor site is left with a scar that could be avoided if a skin graft&#xD;
      substitute were available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid matrix (Hyalomatrix®) is a FDA approved, commercially available, relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive skin graft substitute. Each 1 inch by 1 inch sheet costs approximately $250.00&#xD;
      and could be used to cover both defects in most cases. It is sutured into place over a defect&#xD;
      with a stitch on each corner. Although good results for use of HA matrix in syndactyly&#xD;
      surgery have been reported in the European literature, no comparison has been made with the&#xD;
      gold standard full thickness skin autograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare a Hyaluronic acid matrix skin graft substitute with&#xD;
      full thickness autograft in the surgical treatment of syndactyly. While there are reports of&#xD;
      successful use of this skin graft substitute for syndactyly surgery, it is important to&#xD;
      compare any new treatment to the gold standard. The investigators wish to assess scar&#xD;
      formation in syndactyly release surgery after use of a skin graft substitute (Hyalomatrix®)&#xD;
      compared with the gold standard full-thickness skin graft. If the results with Hyalomatrix®&#xD;
      are at least as good, or better, than full thickness skin graft, use of this skin graft&#xD;
      substitute may significantly reduce surgical time, donor site morbidity, surgical suite&#xD;
      expense, and anesthesia exposure to the developing brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Goals and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of skin graft substitute (i.e.,&#xD;
      Hyalomatrix®) in syndactyly release surgery to the current gold standard full-thickness skin&#xD;
      autograft. Utilization of a skin graft substitute following syndactyly surgery is presumed to&#xD;
      be a safe and inexpensive method to promote wound healing, reduce scar formation, and&#xD;
      consequently limit complications and scarring associated with skin autograft. Circumvention&#xD;
      of the full-thickness skin graft not only decreases donor site morbidity, but is also&#xD;
      expected to reduce the duration of surgery compared to using skin grafting alone, thus&#xD;
      minimizing concerns associated with prolonged sedation in children. Currently, a single web&#xD;
      syndactyly release takes approximately 2 hours, with approximately 1 hour of time for graft&#xD;
      harvest and placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there is no significant difference in scaring; healing and&#xD;
      scar formation between the FDA approved skin graft substitute, Hyalomatrix®, and the gold&#xD;
      standard full-thickness skin graft when used during syndactyly release surgery. This will be&#xD;
      measured by comparing scores (on the Patient/Parent and Observer Scar Assessment (POSAS), the&#xD;
      modified Hamilton burn scar rating by photographic analysis and the Web Creep Assessment) of&#xD;
      the sites with full-thickness skin graft versus sites with Hyalomatrix. These measurement&#xD;
      tools assess the thickness, color (darkness), pliability, appearance, and vascularity&#xD;
      (redness) of a scar compared to normal skin and includes assessments by both provider and&#xD;
      participant (parent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, single-blinded, within-subject controlled study will be performed to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of skin graft substitute to the gold standard full-thickness skin&#xD;
      autografts for children requiring syndactyly release surgery. The study will have two phases.&#xD;
      Phase one will serve as a feasibility study and will include n=10 children undergoing&#xD;
      surgical intervention for one, or more, syndactylized webs on their hand(s). Phase one will&#xD;
      serve as a feasibility study to conduct power analysis, potential adverse events and identify&#xD;
      issues in the protocol. The investigators do not have any specific safety concerns, as&#xD;
      Hyalomatrix is FDA approved for use in children. However, the investigators do not have&#xD;
      personal experience in its use. Preliminary analyses will be done after initial inclusion of&#xD;
      10 webs, or approximately 5 children and again following the inclusion of all 10 children in&#xD;
      phase one. Phase two will implement improvements identified in phase 1, and will include n=30&#xD;
      new participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases, the participants and caregiver(s) will remain as blinded as possible to the&#xD;
      specific location of the full-thickness skin graft and skin graft substitute (i.e., radial or&#xD;
      ulnar side of the syndactyly-released web) until after the study has been completed. The&#xD;
      provider removing the bandage will attempt to remove the silicone sheet from the Hyalomatrix&#xD;
      site with the postop dressing. Thus each web will have an internal control, or gold-standard&#xD;
      graft. This within-subject comparison is expected to minimize variability in intra- and&#xD;
      inter-patient healing irregularities, as well as intra- and inter-surgeon performance and&#xD;
      therefore provide a more valid comparison of the equivalency of the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed clinically, per standard of care, with the exception of&#xD;
      long-term follow up (i.e., 24 month post-surgery assessments), in which parents will be asked&#xD;
      to answer a set of questions online via a secure data collection tool called REDCap. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from parent(s) or legal guardian(s) for children under the age of 18&#xD;
      year old. Written assent will be obtained from study participants between the ages of 8 years&#xD;
      old through 16 years old. For participants who are 8 and older and unable to sign the assent&#xD;
      form, verbal consent will be documented on the assent form by the person leading the consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, caregivers and providers will regularly complete the outcome measures below, at&#xD;
      the treating surgeons' post-surgical standard of care follow-up visit schedule. Standard of&#xD;
      care visits typically occur 0-4 weeks, and approximately at 8 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and&#xD;
      24 months post-surgery. Scheduled completion of outcome measures is denoted below. Please&#xD;
      note, the first post-operative visit is intended to remove the initial cast which may or may&#xD;
      not require recasting. Due to variability in patient care, outcome measure for the study will&#xD;
      not be collected beyond photographs and documenting any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For consented and enrolled participants, each web that requires surgical-intervention will&#xD;
      receive both a skin graft substitute (Hyalomatrix®) and a full-thickness skin autograft. The&#xD;
      location of each (i.e., radial or ulnar side of the web) will be randomized and blinded. The&#xD;
      participant and family will be blinded to which side of the web receives either the&#xD;
      full-thickness graft or the skin substitute. The skin substitute will be sutured into place&#xD;
      with standard absorbable sutures at the corners of the skin substitute. The skin substitute&#xD;
      will overlap the edges of the normal skin by a few millimeters. At the three week visit, the&#xD;
      Hand Service Nurse, surgeon, or trained staff will personally remove the cast of all&#xD;
      participants enrolled in the study, along with the Hyalomatrix® backing (visible layer not&#xD;
      present on the full-thickness graft, which may unblind the family), prior to the family&#xD;
      seeing the wound. This precaution is intended to keep the family blinded to the specific&#xD;
      location of the graft substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study at 24 months post-surgery, parents will first be asked to&#xD;
      self-identify the location of the gold-standard vs the skin graft substitute for each web,&#xD;
      and both the parents and observers will complete a satisfaction/preference questionnaire,&#xD;
      followed by formal unbinding via a letter. For participants who prematurely discontinue their&#xD;
      participation prior to the conclusion of the study, the same unblinding letter will be sent&#xD;
      the home revealing the location of the skin graft substitute and traditional graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDCap will be used for the randomization of each web requiring surgical release.&#xD;
      Specifically, for each web undergoing surgery, REDCap will assign the specific location&#xD;
      (i.e., radial and ulnar side of each of the surgically released web) that the skin substitute&#xD;
      and full-thickness skin graft are to be placed for each of the webs. Consequently, one side&#xD;
      of a single web will have the gold-standard full-thickness skin autograft (i.e., control side&#xD;
      of the web), and the other side will have the skin substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include, participants' demographics, clinic visit information&#xD;
      including radiographs, and surgery related measures. A satisfaction questionnaire will also&#xD;
      be given to participants/families and observers at the end of the study to assess preferred&#xD;
      grafted side (Hyalomatrix® vs full-thickness graft), equivalency of the two graft sites and&#xD;
      donor scar, and surgical technique (for the observer only). These outcomes will be used in&#xD;
      sub analyses or co-variates for the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analyses, the sample size will utilize matched-pairs of surgically operated&#xD;
      webs (i.e., full-thickness skin graft versus Hyalomatrix®), rather than participants. It is&#xD;
      expected that the sample size of webs will exceed the number of participants enrolled in the&#xD;
      study (i.e., n=40 participants may result in approximately 60 webs). Preliminary statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed at the conclusion of phase one, and will determine whether the&#xD;
      sample size of n=30 participants provides sufficient statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of skin graft substitute (i.e., Hyalomatrix®) in syndactyly release surgery&#xD;
      compared to the current gold standard full-thickness skin autograft will be assessed by&#xD;
      comparing the Patient Scar Assessment Scores, Observer Scar Assessment Scores, Hamilton&#xD;
      scores and web creep for each web. The summated total scores of these tools will be compared&#xD;
      using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests with a matched pair (hyalomatrix vs full-thickness graft)&#xD;
      design over time (8 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post-surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe participant demographics, clinic visit&#xD;
      information, adverse events, and satisfaction surveys at the completion of the study.&#xD;
