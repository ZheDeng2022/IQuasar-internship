  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomized double-blind study was to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of the preoperative administration of dexketoprofen trometamol (DKT) on the pain perceived by&#xD;
      patients after oral surgery for implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Method: Single oral doses of 25 mg DKT or PLACEBO were administered 15 minutes&#xD;
      before the performance of conventional implant surgery to assess the influence of the DKT on&#xD;
      pain as reported by the patients. One hundred patients who required single-implant treatments&#xD;
      were randomly distributed into one of the two blinded groups following a preliminary&#xD;
      examination. Fifteen minutes before surgery, the patients in the test group were given 25 mg&#xD;
      DKT (DKT group), and those in the control group were given 500 mg vitamin C as a placebo&#xD;
      (PLACEBO group). The patients' pain intensities were measured using a subjective visual&#xD;
      analogue scale of 100 mm in length, and pain was measured over a period of 7 days.&#xD;
      Inflammation was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale on days 2 and 7.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 consecutive patients (November 2013 to October 2015) scheduled for implant&#xD;
      surgery in the University Dental Clinic (Murcia, Spain) were included in this study. All&#xD;
      patients were older than 18 and were free of medical and surgical contraindications and&#xD;
      systemic disease that would conflict with treatment (American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) risk I or II). All participants in the study were able to read, understand and respond&#xD;
      to the health questionnaire and were able to sign an informed consent document. This study&#xD;
      was performed in accordance with the 2014 revision of the Declaration of Helsinki (General&#xD;
      Assembly of the World Medical Association, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical materials The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University&#xD;
      of Murcia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted with a double blind randomized design using a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) of 100 mm to measure pain intensity. The degree of inflammation was measured using a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale (extremely inflamed, very inflamed, inflamed, somewhat inflamed, and not&#xD;
      inflamed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients signed two informed consent forms, one for the implant surgery, and the other for&#xD;
      participation in the study; the latter explicitly mentioned the patients' ability to leave&#xD;
      the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A local anaesthetic composed of lidocaine hydrochloride and epinephrine (20 mg/ml + 0.0125&#xD;
      mg/ml, respectively) was applied (never alveolar nerve block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All implants had sandblasted and acid-etched surfaces (TiCare Inhex®, Mozo Grau / Ticare,&#xD;
      Valladolid, Spain). All implants were placed by the same surgeon (ASP) following the&#xD;
      recommendations of the manufacturer (total = 100 implants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test group received a dose of 25 mg DKT in an oral suspension 15 minutes before surgery,&#xD;
      and the control group received 500 mg vitamin C 15 minutes before surgery. Both solutions&#xD;
      were administered in an orange disposable cup to mask the small difference in colour.&#xD;
