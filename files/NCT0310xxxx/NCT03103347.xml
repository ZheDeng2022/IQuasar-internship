  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the relationship between a certain oscillatory brain rhythm&#xD;
      (13-30 cycles/sec) that emerges prominently in patients with Parkinson's disease and symptoms&#xD;
      of slowness of movement. The investigators are recruiting patients with a range of severity&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease symptoms to perform electroencephalography (EEG), in which the study&#xD;
      team records brain waves using electrodes placed on the scalp, while patients sit at rest or&#xD;
      perform certain hand tasks. The investigators will analyze the recorded brain waves to&#xD;
      extract the brain rhythm of interest and relate it to motor symptom severity as well as study&#xD;
      its behavior during rest and hand movement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disease. The&#xD;
      hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc),&#xD;
      which disrupts motor circuit processing in the basal ganglia and results in motor dysfunction&#xD;
      including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. This disruption of motor circuit processing is&#xD;
      reflected in abnormal oscillatory neural activity. For example, recordings of local field&#xD;
      potentials with electrodes implanted in the basal ganglia reveal a substantial elevation of&#xD;
      beta frequency (15-35 Hz) oscillatory activity in persons with PD, and this increased beta&#xD;
      frequency activity is suppressed following levodopa treatment and deep brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the link between the frequency and amplitude of abnormal oscillations and the degree&#xD;
      of Parkinsonian symptoms is unclear. For example, magneto-encephalography revealed that&#xD;
      beta-frequency oscillatory activity is elevated over the motor cortices even in persons with&#xD;
      early-stage PD, and there were not any clear differences in beta frequency oscillations&#xD;
      between newly diagnosed and under treatment PD. However, this study did not address any&#xD;
      changes in the frequency of oscillations or distribution of power across frequencies. For&#xD;
      example, a recent study has suggested that variability of ongoing beta-frequency oscillatory&#xD;
      activity, in this case recorded from the STN, may be more strongly correlated with symptoms&#xD;
      than the amplitude of beta frequency oscillations. Therefore, the objective of the&#xD;
      investigator's proposed study is to determine whether there are changes in the&#xD;
      characteristics of beta frequency oscillatory activity in the EEG over the motor cortex&#xD;
      across differing degrees of Parkinson's disease. Such information is critical to&#xD;
      understanding the (possible) link between abnormal oscillatory brain activity and symptom&#xD;
      severity, as these signals could be used as potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy and&#xD;
      to inform the design of new methods of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, prospective evaluation of the beta content in routine 20-40 minute&#xD;
      EEG recordings from patients with PD for varied periods of time. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      running data collection for 4-6 months in an outpatient movement disorders clinic. Subjects&#xD;
      will be identified by their physician and then referred to the study team. Patients that&#xD;
      agree to participate will be screened and have all questions answered at the time of their&#xD;
      routine appointment. If the patient decides to participate and informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      a clinic appointment will be made for study data collection at a later date. Patient will be&#xD;
      instructed not to take their normal dopamine replacement medications for 12 hours prior to&#xD;
      the EEG study visit as this can interfere with the brain wave activity being studied. At the&#xD;
      study clinic encounter, routine recordings will be made from a total of 33 PD patients; 11&#xD;
      with &lt;3 years of PD diagnosis, 11 with &gt;5 but &lt;10 years of PD diagnosis, and 11 with advanced&#xD;
      &gt;10 years of PD diagnosis. EEG will be recorded using an FDA template system to facilitate&#xD;
      EEG lead placement by research coordinators. Clinical description of PD severity and duration&#xD;
      will be collected from each subject through questionnaire and from review of clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. A UPDRS score may be determined for each participant. Following the data&#xD;
      collection period, the EEG recordings will be indexed, de-identified, and randomly ordered to&#xD;
      blind the subsequent analyses. These indexed EEG segments will be quantitatively analyzed to&#xD;
      determine the relative contribution of beta frequency to the recordings, and comparison&#xD;
      between the duration and severity of PD symptoms and beta content will also be made.&#xD;

    <description>The study team recorded 19 channels of brain surface activity using electroencephalography. The 19 channels were distributed over the scalp. The data streams were analyzed in the frequency domain to determine the extent of beta frequency (13-30Hz) oscillatory content. Prior to the recording, each patient's off-medication motor severity score using Part III of the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was assessed.</description>
