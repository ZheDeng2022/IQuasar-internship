  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the rate and amount of nicotine uptake with 10-minute ad libitum use of four&#xD;
      different marketed electronic cigarettes. Furthermore, to measure overall product liking by&#xD;
      subjects to assess potential willingness to seek out the Electronic Cigarette (EC) again in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel study during which up to 140&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects, consisting of 35 subjects per marketed EC product, will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for plasma nicotine uptake, as well as overall product liking. The&#xD;
      study will involve the use of four (4) marketed EC products in tobacco consumers who are&#xD;
      exclusive smokers (i.e., naïve EC users) or dual users of cigarettes and ECs (i.e.,&#xD;
      intermittent EC users).&#xD;
