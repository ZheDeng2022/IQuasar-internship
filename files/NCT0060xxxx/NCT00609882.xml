  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the success rate for keeping babies extubated (without a breathing tube&#xD;
      for assisted mechanical ventilation), defined as the proportion of infants remaining&#xD;
      extubated for a minimum of 72 hours, will be equivalent among infants managed with nasal CPAP&#xD;
      compared to humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure remains a common problem in the neonatal ICU. Among premature infants&#xD;
      with respiratory failure the use of mechanical ventilation has been associated with increased&#xD;
      risk for secondary lung injury and subsequent development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD). As reported by Avery et al and Van Marter et al, early application of nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has been shown as an effective non-invasive mode of&#xD;
      respiratory support in this population.(1, 2) Additionally, in the premature sheep and baboon&#xD;
      models of BPD, the early use of nCPAP is accompanied by significant improvement in subsequent&#xD;
      lung development and alveolization.(3) In light of these findings, there has been a concerted&#xD;
      effort in most NICU's to avoid prolonged ventilator support through the early application of&#xD;
      nCPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, nCPAP systems are not always easily applied or tolerated in the preterm&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties with the application of nCPAP include bulky head wraps, positional problems,&#xD;
      compression of the nose, marked dilation and tissue breakdown of the nares, and apparent&#xD;
      agitation, often leading to the use of potentially neurotoxic medications.(4) Previous&#xD;
      studies have suggested that NC flows at 1-2 lpm may also generate a positive pressure in the&#xD;
      airway of preterm infants.(5) The use of NC flow to generate positive airway pressure would&#xD;
      minimize many of the application issues of nCPAP. However, standard NC systems used in&#xD;
      neonates routinely employ gas that is inadequately warmed and humidified, limiting the use of&#xD;
      such flows due to increased risk of nasal mucosa injury, and possibly increasing the risk for&#xD;
      nosocomial infection.(4, 6) The development of humidified high flow via nasal cannulas&#xD;
      (HHFNC) systems may obviate these problems and provide a safe, effective alternative to nCPAP&#xD;
      in the preterm infant. Unfortunately, HHFNC does not allow the measurement of distending&#xD;
      pressure without an invasive process such as an esophageal pressure catheter. Two recent&#xD;
      reports have suggested that HHFNC does not provide excessive distending pressure.(7, 8) The&#xD;
      study by Saslow and colleagues found that work of breathing and lung compliance were improved&#xD;
      in preterm infants on HHFNC up to a maximum of 5 lpm compared to nCPAP at 6 cm H2O.(7) In&#xD;
      comparison to nCPAP, the maximum positive distending pressure measured was 4.8 cm H2O and was&#xD;
      not significantly increased with HHFNC flows up to 5 lpm. Kubicka and colleagues also&#xD;
      demonstrated that the maximum distending pressure measured during support with HHFNC up to 8&#xD;
      lpm was &lt; 5 cm H2O.(8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication has suggested that HHFNC can safely and effectively be applied in the&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory management of premature infants with respiratory dysfunction.(9) In&#xD;
      this retrospective analysis evaluating over 1000 infants, Shoemaker et al reported a&#xD;
      significant decrease in ventilator days among the group of infants managed with HHFNC&#xD;
      compared to infants previously managed with nCPAP. Additionally, they found no increased&#xD;
      adverse effects noted such as air leak, intraventricular hemorrhage, nosocomial infection or&#xD;
      BPD. In a smaller prospective study, Campbell et al did not find a benefit from high-flow NC&#xD;
      among a group 40 infants &lt; 1250 grams.(10) However, they did not use adequate humidification&#xD;
      and the maximum &quot;high-flow&quot; applied was &lt; 2 lpm. The previously noted study by Woodhead et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that HHFNC decreased respiratory work effort and was more effective at&#xD;
      preventing reintubation than high-flow from a standard, non-heated, non-humidified nasal&#xD;
      cannula.(4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus HHFNC, with flow rates as high as 8 lpm, is being used clinically in a large number of&#xD;
      NICU's, including all of the units participating in this study, for management of a variety&#xD;
      of neonatal respiratory problems. The introduction of HHFNC into clinical practice has not&#xD;
      been accompanied by apparent changes in neonatal outcome, but this has not been&#xD;
      systematically studied in a randomized, controlled approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the clinical impact of&#xD;
      applying HHFNC to that of nCPAP among a group of infants requiring continuing non-invasive&#xD;
      respiratory support in the NICU.&#xD;
