  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of a procedure called radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation on kidney tumors from patients who are undergoing antiangiogenic treatment.&#xD;
      Antiangiogenic treatment is a type of treatment that inhibits formation of new blood vessels&#xD;
      that are required for tumor growth. Radiofrequency ablation (RF ablation) involves inserting&#xD;
      a needle into tumor tissue and administering heat to the tumor tissue that is sufficient to&#xD;
      kill the tumor cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Participants will undergo a RF ablation procedure of one or more of their tumors that&#xD;
           have not gone away while they have been undergoing antiangiogenic treatment. The RF&#xD;
           ablation procedure will be performed in the operating room at one of the&#xD;
           Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center hospitals and will be performed under general&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will also be drawn 2-4 weeks before the procedure, at the time of teh procedure&#xD;
           and 2-4 weeks after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RF ablation procedure will be performed at specified times in relation to the&#xD;
           participants antiangiogenic treatment (sorafenib or sunitinib): a) If the participant is&#xD;
           taking sorafenib, they will be asked to stop taking it 2-5 days prior to the RF ablation&#xD;
           procedure; b) if the participant is taking sunitinib, they will be asked to stop taking&#xD;
           it 4-7 days prior to the RF ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an MRI or a CT scan of their tumor(s) within 2-4 weeks of the&#xD;
           procedure and 2-4 weeks after the procedure. The MRI or CT will scan the tumor(s) to&#xD;
           determine how much blood flow is going to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of RF ablation, participants will have a biopsy of their tumor(s) and will&#xD;
           receive a CT scan in the area the ablation was performed after the procedure to assess&#xD;
           for any bleeding. They will also be monitored for 4 hours after the RF ablation&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
