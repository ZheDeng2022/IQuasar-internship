    <textblock>
      This study is a 3-period crossover drug interaction study between GSK376501 and simvastatin&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects. This study will examine if repeat doses of GSK376501 affects the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and if repeat doses of simvastatin affects the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of GSK375601.&#xD;
