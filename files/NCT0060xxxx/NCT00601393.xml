      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      program in treating mothers with depression who have young children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being a mother of a young child can be very stressful. Many women find that being a parent&#xD;
      may not be as enjoyable as expected and that they feel persistently tired or sad. Because of&#xD;
      the possible &quot;lows&quot; of recent motherhood, new mothers are particularly prone to depression.&#xD;
      The impact of depression on recent mothers is significant, including emotional distress for&#xD;
      the woman as well as possible disturbances in the child's development. If left untreated, the&#xD;
      mother's depression may cause strain on family life and her relationship with her child.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that can be used to treat people&#xD;
      with depression, aims to modify thoughts and behaviors. Despite the availability of helpful&#xD;
      CBT programs, most depressed people do not receive treatment. To make these treatments more&#xD;
      accessible to mothers who may lack the means to seek help, this study will adapt CBT for&#xD;
      depression to an at-home computer-based program. This study will evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the computer-based CBT program in improving the moods of depressed mothers and their&#xD;
      children and enhancing the quality of time shared between mother and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this single-blind study will last at least 8 weeks. A computer, modem,&#xD;
      monitor, and Internet connection will be installed in the homes of all participants.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either immediate treatment or delayed&#xD;
      treatment, which will begin after a wait-list period. Treatment will be delivered on a&#xD;
      computer, which will allow the participants to chat online with other parents and their&#xD;
      program coach. There will be 11 CBT-related lessons over 8 weeks, taking between 8 and 11&#xD;
      hours total to complete. The lessons will promote self-learning and will include content of&#xD;
      particular relevance to mothers of young children, including how to handle stress and improve&#xD;
      mood. Participants will be required to contact their coach at least every 2 weeks to review&#xD;
      the lessons learned. There will be three assessments, occurring at pretreatment, immediately&#xD;
      post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment. Participants assigned to delayed treatment will&#xD;
      complete one additional assessment prior to beginning the wait-list period. Each assessment&#xD;
      will involve both parent and child and will include play interactions, questionnaires, and&#xD;
      interviews about parenting, feelings, child behavior, moods, and self-esteem. Another&#xD;
      caretaker of the child and the child's teacher will also be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      about the child's and/or parent's behavior.&#xD;
