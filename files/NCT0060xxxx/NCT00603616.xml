  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics have been used to treat Crohn's disease symptoms with the best studied&#xD;
      antibiotics being Cipro and Flagyl. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed oral antibiotic that is&#xD;
      FDA approved for travelers' diarrhea. It works by inhibiting bacterial reproduction. It is&#xD;
      very poorly absorbed and over 97% of the drug taken orally is excreted in the feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits and safety of Rifaximin for&#xD;
      the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of Crohn's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease&#xD;
      conventionally categorized into Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). CD affects&#xD;
      nearly 630,000 people in North America with up to 50,000 new people being diagnosed every&#xD;
      year. It is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by abdominal pain, malnutrition,&#xD;
      bloody diarrhea, fistula formation, intestinal perforations and strictures, and even&#xD;
      extra-intestinal manifestations such as joint pains and skin rashes. Nearly 80% of people&#xD;
      with CD will need surgical treatment at some point in their disease process. The majority of&#xD;
      CD subjects are diagnosed in young adulthood thereby subjecting them to many decades of&#xD;
      discomfort and medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics have been used to treat CD with variable response rates. The basis for antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy is that breakdown of the integrity of the mucosal barrier in the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tract leads to a heightened inflammatory response to commensurate luminal bacteria. By&#xD;
      changing the composition or bacterial load in the intestinal lumen, it may be possible to&#xD;
      alter the immune response. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl) are the best&#xD;
      studied antibiotics that have shown efficacy, but the effect is temporal and long term use&#xD;
      can lead to serious side effects. Rifaximin is a recent FDA approved antibiotic with broad&#xD;
      spectrum of activity, excellent safety profile, and minimal absorption from the GI tract.&#xD;
      Open label and small studies in IBD subjects show response rates up to 80% in CD subjects.&#xD;
      These studies were limited however in that they were not randomized placebo controlled&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized placebo controlled crossover trial of&#xD;
      rifaximin in CD subjects to assess initial clinical response compared to placebo.&#xD;
