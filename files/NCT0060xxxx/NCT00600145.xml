    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if Mirtazapine will produce a decrease in&#xD;
      interest in the drug, a decrease in mood elevation, and/or a decrease in reward when given&#xD;
      before methamphetamine compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a psychiatric interview, medical history and physical,&#xD;
      laboratory tests, drug of abuse screen and, if female, a urine pregnancy test. They will be&#xD;
      provided written informed consent. They will be studied in a within-subjects examination of&#xD;
      the subjective mood responses of mirtazapine and methamphetamine. Interactions between&#xD;
      methamphetamine and mirtazapine will be assessed by pharmacokinetic studies. Each participant&#xD;
      will be introduced to rating scales and cognitive tasks described below. Participants will&#xD;
      remain in the research unit for 5 hours on each day that they receive study medication or&#xD;
      placebo. They will spend five days in total on the research unit, one day separated by at&#xD;
      least one day; then in two day blocks separated by at least one day from another two day&#xD;
      block. A venous catheter will be placed for blood draws. Blood pressures and heart rates will&#xD;
      be recorded and assessed. Participants will be randomized and double blinded to receive&#xD;
      either placebo or mirtazapine orally two hours prior to the administration of randomized and&#xD;
      double blinded methamphetamine or placebo in order to have the peak effects of the drugs&#xD;
      overlap. VAS-mood, ARCI, GRS, POMS and POMS-E, neurocognitive tasks Trails A and B and Symbol&#xD;
      digits modalities test will be administered prior to the mirtazapine or placebo dose, and&#xD;
      repeated after the administration of methamphetamine or placebo. After the administration of&#xD;
      methamphetamine or placebo, vital signs will be assessed every 15 minutes and the measures&#xD;
      will be repeated until 120 minutes have passed from the initial dose of methamphetamine or&#xD;
      placebo. Blood will be drawn at one, three and four hour marks for pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
      This will be repeated on each testing day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine dependence is a major health problem in the US. Methamphetamine's reinforcing&#xD;
      effects associated with its abuse liability depend upon activation of the cortico-mesolimbic&#xD;
      dopamine (CMDA) system. Medications that antagonize CMDA function might have therapeutic&#xD;
      potential Mirtazapine appears to affect this pathway. Mirtazapine works through serotinergic&#xD;
      (5-HT) mechanisms 5HT 2 and 3, alpha 2 and H1 antagonist and has been noted to decrease&#xD;
      excitatory responses in methamphetamine challenged animals. Mirtazapine increases dopamine&#xD;
      release in the prefrontal cortex by 5HT receptor activation. Additionally, in a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial; individuals taking mirtazapine for amphetamine detoxification were&#xD;
      found to have significant improvements in hyper arousal and anxiety subset score when&#xD;
      discontinuing the stimulant. Methamphetamine has been given safely to healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct the first preliminary human laboratory study to determine if&#xD;
      mirtazapine 15 mg diminishes methamphetamine (20 mg) induced positive subjective interest,&#xD;
      mood elevation and reinforcing value. This dose of methamphetamine has been used by other&#xD;
      investigators in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary trial is the first in a sequence of studies to characterize the dose&#xD;
      dependent effects of mirtazapine as a treatment agent for methamphetamine dependence. If this&#xD;
      study is successful, it would afford us a scientific platform and rationale for progressing&#xD;
      with testing efficacy for mirtazapine among methamphetamine dependent individuals both in the&#xD;
      human laboratory and in clinical trials. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      systematically the neurobehavioral basis and dose-response effects of mirtazapine acutely on&#xD;
      methamphetamine-induced interest, mood elevation and reward. This study employs a&#xD;
      well-validated, state-of-the-art, human laboratory technique to determine the extent to which&#xD;
      mirtazapine blocks methamphetamine induced euphoria, reinforcement, and cue craving in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers tested in a controlled hospital environment under medical supervision.&#xD;
