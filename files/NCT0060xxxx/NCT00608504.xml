  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study how certain factors, including money, the amount of drug available&#xD;
      and the amount of work effort, affect opiate drug choice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A drug dependent person chooses to take drug more often (and suffer its long-term bad&#xD;
      consequences) than choosing to engage in healthy activities (which have better long-term&#xD;
      consequences). The present research will be conducted in a controlled laboratory setting with&#xD;
      heroin abusers who are not seeking treatment to understand what factors guide their choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research focuses on environmental (i.e. non-medication) factors that affect choosing a&#xD;
      drug versus money. Findings from this research are likely to be important in developing a&#xD;
      theoretical and practical basis for behavioral interventions as part of drug abuse treatment.&#xD;
      HYD is a drug that is currently used as a cough suppressant and to relieve pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have&#xD;
      the opportunity to choose HYD or money. On the first two experimental days, prior to choice&#xD;
      sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. During&#xD;
      test sessions, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money.&#xD;
      Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart&#xD;
      rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice trials. Self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed at different times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be maintained on buprenorphine throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week&#xD;
      lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week detoxification after study completion.&#xD;
