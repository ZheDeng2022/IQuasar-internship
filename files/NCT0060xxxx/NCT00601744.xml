    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn about the social and emotional factors that may&#xD;
      affect the quality of life of patients with cancer of the eye or eye area who have had their&#xD;
      facial appearance changed due to an orbital exenteration.&#xD;

      Family Members:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will meet with a research staff member&#xD;
      (preferably in person, or else by phone) for an interview. During the interview, you will be&#xD;
      asked questions about your demographic information (such as your age, education level, and&#xD;
      marital status). You will be asked about your family member's medical history, emotional&#xD;
      well-being, appearance, and the types of social relations and support in his/her life (such&#xD;
      as relationships with friends and family).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked if and how these social relations may have been affected by his/her&#xD;
      cancer experiences after the orbital exenteration. The interview should take about 2 to 2 1/2&#xD;
      hours. It will be audio-taped, and the interviewer will be taking notes. Your responses in&#xD;
      the interview will not be shared with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your interview responses show that you may be having emotional difficulties or depression,&#xD;
      you will be provided with names of mental health providers in case you would like to receive&#xD;
      mental health screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 people (20 patients and 20 family members) will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, a research staff member will schedule you for an&#xD;
      interview. During the interview, you will be asked questions about your demographic&#xD;
      information (such as your age, education level, and marital status) and medical history. You&#xD;
      will also be asked about your emotional well-being, how you feel about your appearance, how&#xD;
      you are coping with the cancer, and the types of social relations and support you have in&#xD;
      your life (such as relationships with friends and family). The interview should take about 2&#xD;
      to 2 1/2 hours. It will be audio-taped, and the interviewer will be taking notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your responses in the interview will not be shared with your doctor. If you feel you need a&#xD;
      doctor's opinion about anything that is asked about in the questionnaire (such as mental or&#xD;
      emotional difficulties), please contact your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your interview responses show that you may be having emotional difficulties or depression,&#xD;
      you will be provided with names of mental health providers in case you would like to receive&#xD;
      mental health screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview for Family Members:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each eligible patient who agrees to take part in this study, one family member must also&#xD;
      agree to participate. Researchers will ask you for a family member whom researchers can&#xD;
      contact by phone to ask if he or she would agree to take part in this study. Your family&#xD;
      member's participation would involve being interviewed about his or her opinions of the same&#xD;
      questions that you were asked about in your interview. If your family member agrees, his or&#xD;
      her interview will be scheduled. If that family member does not agree to take part, another&#xD;
      family member may take part in his or her place. If no family members agree to take part,&#xD;
      your interview will not be scheduled and you will not be enrolled on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you complete the interview, your participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 people (20 patients and 20 family members) will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
