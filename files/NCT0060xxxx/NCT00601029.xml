      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop a normative database for serum creatine kinase (CK) responses to basic military&#xD;
           training (BMT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine the incidence of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) among a large cohort of&#xD;
           recruits undergoing BMT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assess the impact of climate on the incidence of ER during BMT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. determine the incidence of candidate genes that may be associated with an increased risk&#xD;
           of ER.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on our review of scientific information, we have identified several genetic varieties&#xD;
      or polymorphisms that may be associated with an increased risk of muscle injury and/or heat&#xD;
      illness. As part of our recruitment process we have provided you with this written study&#xD;
      information, and will present to you a brief oral and PowerPoint presentation of the study&#xD;
      design and schedule, and the time to address any questions not yet answered prior to issuing&#xD;
      consent forms for those agreeing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is entirely voluntary; either agreeing or refusing to participate&#xD;
      will have absolutely no effect on your status as a recruit or your standing in basic&#xD;
      training. You will not be paid for your participation in this study. While your drill&#xD;
      sergeant and company commander will be aware of all those who are participating in the study,&#xD;
      this will occur only for scheduling purposes so that you and fellow participants can be&#xD;
      excused for the 3 blood draws that will take place after basic physical training has begun.&#xD;
      When you consent to participate in this study, you may place limitations on the use of your&#xD;
      blood sample by selecting one of the options provided on the last page of the consent form.&#xD;
      If at any point you decide not to continue in the study, detailed instructions for withdrawal&#xD;
      are in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks: Participation in this study itself will not increase your risk of developing&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis. If you or any other participant should develop either rhabdomyolysis or very&#xD;
      high CK levels, we will perform additional DNA analyses for certain conditions associated&#xD;
      with exercise intolerance. Several of these are inherited muscle diseases that may not be&#xD;
      diagnosed until adulthood and may only first become apparent after an episode of exercise&#xD;
      intolerance. Diagnosis of any of these conditions is grounds for dismissal from the Army, but&#xD;
      it is essential that you and your family be aware of these hereditary conditions if present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks Associated With Genetic Analysis: There are certain additional risks that are uniquely&#xD;
      associated with any study involving genetic testing. Using advanced genetic analysis,&#xD;
      information about your DNA structure (genetic information) can help determine your risk of&#xD;
      developing certain genetic diseases that run in families. This genetic information is unique&#xD;
      to you and may indicate changes in your future health status or life expectancy, as well as&#xD;
      possibly, that of your children and other relatives. Besides medical risks, genetic testing&#xD;
      carries certain social risks. It can affect insurability, employability, personal family&#xD;
      planning, family relationships, immigration status, instigate paternity lawsuits, and be&#xD;
      associated with social stigmatization. Finding out that either you do or do not carry a gene&#xD;
      associated with a serious illness can cause both significant stress and psychological harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and Confidentiality: All information provided, as part of this study will be&#xD;
      confidential and protected to the fullest extent provided by law. Information and other&#xD;
      records related to this study will be accessible to those persons directly involved in&#xD;
      conducting this study and members of the Eisenhower Army Medical Center Institutional Review&#xD;
      Committee (IRC), USUHS Research Department, and other governmental agencies, which provides&#xD;
      oversight for protection of human research volunteers. All questionnaires, forms, and charts&#xD;
      will be kept in a restricted-access, locked cabinet while not in use and blood samples will&#xD;
      be stored in a restricted access, locked freezer at USUHS for up to five years, depending on&#xD;
      how participants wish their blood to be used. After five years all remaining blood samples&#xD;
      will be destroyed along with the code logbook. To enhance privacy of the information, all&#xD;
      data will be entered into a database in which individual responses are not identified. After&#xD;
      verification of the database information, all paper copies containing identifiers will be&#xD;
      shredded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not be informed of the general results of the study since this is a research study,&#xD;
      but may review the literature for published results. However, if the results reveal that you&#xD;
      have a mutation in any gene that indicates susceptibility to specific disorders (malignant&#xD;
      hyperthermia, CPT II deficiency, McArdle's, AMP deaminase deficiency and MCAD deficiency),&#xD;
      you will be informed; we will also inform your General Medical Officer (GMO). If you need a&#xD;
      genetic counselor, we will arrange for this as well through your GMO. The genetic results&#xD;
      that are not associated with dismissal from military service will not be released to anyone&#xD;
      including you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete confidentiality cannot be promised, particularly for military personnel, because&#xD;
      information bearing on your health may be required to be reported to appropriate medical or&#xD;
      command authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: Data storage and analysis will be conducted on a desktop computer. The&#xD;
      computer storing these data will be backed up daily and only the PI and the data manager will&#xD;
      have access to the hard drive or discs. One copy of the disc will be maintained in a secure&#xD;
      locked office. A copy of the data set will also be stored on one the of the USUHS servers by&#xD;
      using a secure site, which is backed up daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data files will be converted to SPSS™ datasets for processing and merging with other&#xD;
      participant research data. For the written questionnaires and forms, the project will use a&#xD;
      computer data management and analysis system composed of digital scanning technology with&#xD;
      Teleform™. This technique minimizes data entry errors and cleans data files on an on-going&#xD;
      basis. In addition, built-in range detection strategies will identify outliers that may&#xD;
      represent errors. In brief, forms completed by participants will be scanned by an optical&#xD;
      scanner and interpreted by Teleform™ Reader, which then checks for missing, illogical, and&#xD;
      out-of-range values. The Reader also identifies data that have been (1) incorrectly&#xD;
      completed, or (2) mistakenly marked, and (3) characters that do not satisfy the Reader's&#xD;
      confidence level. Those that do not meet these parameters are held for manual review and&#xD;
      correction. Correction is done with the Teleform™ Verifier. Once verification is complete,&#xD;
      the data are exported to SPSS™ database software for statistical analysis. The database is&#xD;
      programmed to check for illicit values and to calculate parameters derived from raw data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of Participant Samples: Your blood samples will be stored in appropriate conditions.&#xD;
      All samples will be given a numerical code and stored without participant name or any other&#xD;
      identifiers. This code will be entered into a logbook maintained by Dr. William Campbell or&#xD;
      appropriate persons. All samples will be stored at the USUHS for 5 years unless otherwise&#xD;
      instructed by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Sample by Investigators: The protocol has specified the genes to be examined. However,&#xD;
      over the course of the study, other candidate genes with identified polymorphisms may appear&#xD;
      in the literature. If there is a clear justification for examining them for an association to&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis, we will carry out the analysis after contacting you and obtaining your&#xD;
      permission. All of our analyses will relate specifically to the stated objectives and not&#xD;
      unrelated research efforts. There will not be any secondary use of the samples obtained from&#xD;
      the subjects since samples will not be shared with other investigators outside this study.&#xD;
      The blood samples obtained from this research will not be used for any commercial purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from Research: You have the right to withdraw from the study and have the option&#xD;
      of withdrawing your blood sample(s) at any time. If you decide to stop your participation in&#xD;
      the study, you need to contact the medical monitor and/or one of the members of the research&#xD;
      team and inform any one of them of your decision. They will withdraw you from the study and&#xD;
      no further blood samples, questionnaires or muscle exams will be performed. If your&#xD;
      participation in this study is stopped before the end of the study, any information that has&#xD;
      already been collected will be kept by the research team and included in study results. This&#xD;
      information will be maintained for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Resource: Members of the study team will be available to answer questions from&#xD;
      you at any time during the study, and in particular, during the three brief exams and blood&#xD;
      draws while in the field. In addition, the medical monitor of the study, Dr. Michael&#xD;
      Campbell, will also serve as the study ombudsman and be available as a resource to you or any&#xD;
      study participant.&#xD;
