      RATIONALE: Gathering information over time about cancer-related pain from patients in a&#xD;
      hospice and their caregivers may help doctors learn more about pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well standard pain control works in hospice&#xD;
      patients with cancer-related pain.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain prospective data describing standard pain management methods and outcomes in&#xD;
           the hospice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Data regarding pain and pain management is obtained from three sources: the patient,&#xD;
      the caregiver(s), and the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient assessment*: At baseline, patients provide demographic data and complete the&#xD;
           Pain Assessment Form verbally via interview. The form addresses average pain, worst&#xD;
           pain, pain relief, hours in pain, pain-related distress, and barriers to pain control.&#xD;
           Patients are asked to rate pain control. Patients also complete the Pain Communication&#xD;
           Survey to assess how they communicate with health care providers about their pain. After&#xD;
           the baseline assessment is completed, pain is assessed by the research nurse through&#xD;
           home visits* 3 times weekly and telephone interviews twice weekly. During each visit or&#xD;
           telephone contact, patients are interviewed to complete the Pain Assessment Form.&#xD;
           Patients are followed until the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *If a patient is not available for the scheduled home visit, the interview will take&#xD;
      place over the phone; if a patient is hospitalized or transferred to the inpatient hospice&#xD;
      facility, the patient interview will take place there.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary caregiver assessment**: At baseline, primary caregivers complete a demographic&#xD;
           survey, a Pain Assessment Form, the Pain Communication Survey, Caregiver Self-Efficacy&#xD;
           in Pain Management Scale (CSEPMS), the Caregiver Pain Management Questionnaire (CPMQ),&#xD;
           and the Stressful Caregiver Adult Reactions to Experiences of Dying (SCARED). Caregivers&#xD;
           are then interviewed by the study nurse using the Pain Assessment Form as a guideline.&#xD;
           Follow-up data from caregivers is obtained through a daily diary, interviews, and&#xD;
           structured surveys. Primary caregivers complete the Pain Assessment Form daily and are&#xD;
           instructed to provide their assessment of the patient's pain. In addition, caregivers&#xD;
           are interviewed daily by a study nurse, who reviews the daily Pain Assessment Form and&#xD;
           obtains detailed information regarding the adequacy of patient pain control, side&#xD;
           effects of medication, barriers to pain control, and caregiver concerns and burdens.&#xD;
           Primary caregivers also complete CSEPMS, CPMQ, and SCARED questionnaires at the end of&#xD;
           weeks 1, 2, and 4 as part of follow-up. Primary caregivers are contacted after the&#xD;
           patient's death to assess pain control at the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary caregiver assessment: At baseline, secondary caregivers complete the same&#xD;
           baseline evaluation as primary caregivers over the phone. They complete the Pain&#xD;
           Assessment Form weekly and the CSEPMS, CPMQ, and SCARED questionnaires at the end of&#xD;
           weeks 1, 2, and 4. Secondary caregivers also undergo a post-mortem interview based on&#xD;
           the Pain Assessment Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chart review: Chart review is conducted by the research Nurse after a patient's death.&#xD;
           Cancer and cancer-related treatment are obtained and documentation about pain management&#xD;
           is recorded. From the time of study entry, all staff notes are reviewed to document:&#xD;
           pain assessment, calls to physicians or other support personnel (including pharmacy&#xD;
           calls), identified barriers to pain control, and treatment modifications (including&#xD;
           medications to treat side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: **Patients and primary caregivers are interviewed independently.&#xD;
