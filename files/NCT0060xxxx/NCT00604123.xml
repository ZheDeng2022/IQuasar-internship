      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-17166864 in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to prove the hypothesis that JNJ-17466864, as compared to placebo, can&#xD;
      provide a 16% or greater improvement in nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. This is&#xD;
      a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-center outpatient study in adult&#xD;
      men or women who have seasonal allergic rhinitis and have 2 year history (or longer) of mild&#xD;
      to moderate allergic reaction to mountain cedar pollen. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      mountain cedar pollen season. 72 qualified patients will be admitted to the single-blind&#xD;
      7-day Run-in Period (placebo twice daily) to establish the Baseline allergic rhinitis symptom&#xD;
      scores. Patient eligibility to enter the double-blind treatment phase will be based on&#xD;
      patients' baseline nasal symptom scores. At least 66 eligible patients whose daytime average&#xD;
      nasal symptom scores (of nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and sneezing) is 2 or&#xD;
      greater, with the daytime nasal congestion symptom score 2 or greater, on at least 4 of the 7&#xD;
      Run-in days will be admitted to the double-blind treatment phase, and randomized to either&#xD;
      the JNJ-17166864 or placebo treatment group. During the Treatment Phase, patients will&#xD;
      self-administer study medication (0.5 mg JNJ-17166864 or placebo per nostril) twice daily for&#xD;
      2 weeks, record allergic rhinitis nasal and ocular symptom scores, and complete the&#xD;
      Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), to establish the In-Treatment&#xD;
      scores. Pharmacokinetic and biomarker samples will be collected during treatment phase.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assessed.&#xD;
