  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is one of the most common eating disorders, with millions of&#xD;
      affected Americans. The majority of people who binge eat are mildly to severely overweight,&#xD;
      but people of normal weight can also have BED. People with BED frequently eat excessive&#xD;
      amounts of food in a short period of time, often feeling a loss of control over their urge to&#xD;
      eat. Following a binge eating episode, the person usually experiences feelings of guilt,&#xD;
      depression, embarrassment, and disgust. Beyond the psychological distress caused by binge&#xD;
      eating, people who binge eat are at a higher risk for more serious health problems associated&#xD;
      with weight gain, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol,&#xD;
      and stroke. Previous studies on BED have found cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be the&#xD;
      most effective treatment in improving binge eating habits, attitudinal features of eating&#xD;
      disorders, and psychological functioning. However, CBT alone has not been nearly as effective&#xD;
      in producing clinically significant weight loss in those who are overweight. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of adding nutritional counseling to CBT in treating obese people&#xD;
      with BED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this 1-year study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
      CBT plus general nutrition counseling (CBT+GN) or CBT plus low energy density diet counseling&#xD;
      (CBT+LED). All participants will receive 21 hourly individual treatment sessions over a&#xD;
      6-month period. Sessions will be weekly for Weeks 1 to 16 and every other week for Weeks 17&#xD;
      to 26. Each treatment session will include 40 minutes of CBT and 20 minutes of nutritional&#xD;
      counseling (GN or LED). Assessments will include interviews and questionnaires about symptoms&#xD;
      and height and weight measurements. These assessments will occur at baseline, monthly during&#xD;
      treatment, and at 6 months post-treatment. At the end of treatment, participants will also&#xD;
      have blood drawn to determine lipid levels and will be asked to complete two food intake&#xD;
      interviews by phone.&#xD;
