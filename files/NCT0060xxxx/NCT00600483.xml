    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gentamicin-collagen sponge is safe and&#xD;
      effective in preventing sternal wound infections in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who&#xD;
      are at a greater risk of developing sternal wound infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sternal wound infection (SWI) is a significant problem in cardiac surgical subjects,in&#xD;
      particular in those with risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. There is a long unmet&#xD;
      need for an intervention that can reduce the incidence and severity of SWIs in high-risk&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.&#xD;
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin-collagen sponge is a thin&#xD;
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and containing gentamicin. When&#xD;
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is released at the&#xD;
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of antibiotic at the&#xD;
      surgical site may prevent an infection at the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside of the United States more than 3,500 subjects have received treatment in clinical&#xD;
      studies with the gentamicin-collagen sponge, primarily for orthopedic, intraabdominal, and&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgeries or wound infections following surgical procedures or traumatic&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all subjects will be given treatment that is normally given to prevent&#xD;
      surgical infections. For subjects randomly assigned to the gentamicin-collagen sponge&#xD;
      treatment group, 2 sponges will be placed between the sternal halves during surgery.&#xD;
      IMMEDIATELY before insertion of the sponge the surgeon should wet the sponge with saline as&#xD;
      shown in the training/certification document. This wet sponge SHOULD BE INSERTED INTO THE&#xD;
      STERNUM WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 15 SECONDS (AFTER THIS TIME IT MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO&#xD;
      HANDLE). All subjects will be followed for 90 days after surgery to determine whether they&#xD;
      develop a sternal wound infection.&#xD;
