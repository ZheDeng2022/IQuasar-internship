    <textblock>
      The primary aim of our study is to test the hypothesis that wound healing is impaired in the&#xD;
      patient who has experienced massive weight reduction following gastric bypass for morbid&#xD;
      obesity. Specifically we will document post-surgical local complications and evaluate&#xD;
      multiple wound healing parameters in two patient populations in a prospective fashion. The&#xD;
      test group will consist of patients who have undergone dramatic weight loss and are much in&#xD;
      need of a panniculectomy due to excessive skin redundancy. The control group will consist of&#xD;
      patients within normal weight ranges who are seeking an abdominoplasty.&#xD;

      The morbidly obese patient after successful weight reduction surgery represents a poorly&#xD;
      understood patient population that presents unique quandaries. Prior to gastric bypass&#xD;
      surgery, many of these patients have Type II diabetes, frequent skin infections from poor&#xD;
      hygiene, and multiple medical co-morbidities. Fortunately, numerous problems resolve during&#xD;
      the period of the rapid weight loss. Typically the Type II diabetes comes under control&#xD;
      without medication and patients experience improvement in mobility and psychosocial&#xD;
      adjustment. Unfortunately new dilemmas can rise such as vitamin deficiencies due to many&#xD;
      months of starvation, residual end glycosylation products in diabetic skin and massive skin&#xD;
      redundancies in multiple locations. Excessive skin is prone to infection. Patients continue&#xD;
      to be plagued with postural problems, functional problems (improper personal hygiene,&#xD;
      continued difficulties in ambulation) and psychosocial problems associated with a poor body&#xD;
      image. Body contouring can provide such patients with marked improvements in lifestyle. The&#xD;
      post-bariatric patient population is rapidly increasing in number, yet their wound healing&#xD;
      responses to accidental or surgical trauma are unreported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have documented clinical suspicions that the post-bariatric patient is at an&#xD;
      increased risk for wound healing complications following body contouring procedures. The most&#xD;
      recent retrospective study of 30 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessed post-surgical outcomes following body contouring procedures in multiple body&#xD;
      locations and noted a 20% incidence of wound breakdown and a 16% incidence of seroma (1). An&#xD;
      earlier retrospective study comparing panniculectomy in post bariatric patients to those&#xD;
      receiving a simultaneous panniculectomy plus gastric bypass documented wound infections&#xD;
      (16%), dehiscence (13%) and skin necrosis (6%) in the post bariatric group (2). A prospective&#xD;
      study of ten post-bariatric patients who were given a circumferential abdominoplasty likewise&#xD;
      experienced wound complications: (33% seromas, 16.6% dehiscence, and infections 8.2%) (3). An&#xD;
      11 patient dermalipectomy series for body contouring after bariatric surgery showed a 27%&#xD;
      incidence of infection and seroma (4). To date, the highest rate of wound healing&#xD;
      complications was reported in 46 out of 55 (86%) dermolipectomy patients (5). Taken together&#xD;
      these reports provide clinical evidence that wound healing is impaired in the post-bariatric&#xD;
      patient population. We are prepared to undertake a quantitative evaluation of wound repair&#xD;
      characteristics in this select population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple reasons to suspect that the skin itself may be defective in these patients&#xD;
      who have undergone massive weight reduction. A lifetime of stretched out skin can thin the&#xD;
      density of epidermal appendages and peripheral nerve endings, alter the vascular network,&#xD;
      diminish the elasticity and alter the weave of the collagen bundles in the reticular dermis.&#xD;
      Such negative circumstances may impede the delivery of oxygen and nutrients and ultimately&#xD;
      hinder tensile strength. Nutritional deficiencies from the forced starvation are thought to&#xD;
      decrease anabolic processes and impair the inflammatory processes, factors that also govern&#xD;
      the timing and quality of wound repair. Dehiscence rates could be negatively impacted by this&#xD;
      synergy of alterations. While the post-bariatric patients can electively seek body contouring&#xD;
      surgery, it is certain that the ever increasing number of post-bariatric patients will&#xD;
      experience unexpected trauma or non-elective surgical procedures - all circumstances that&#xD;
      also challenge the body to repair itself. We maintain that it will be important to document&#xD;
      wound healing deficiencies so that optimal treatment plans can be implemented when the need&#xD;
      arises.&#xD;
