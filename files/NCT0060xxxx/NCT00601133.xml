      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the change in functional tests of postural control of cancer patients who have&#xD;
      completed acute inpatient rehabilitation or complete rehabilitation through mobile team from&#xD;
      discharge at 21-60 days (+/- 3) after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the correlations between the functional tests of postural control, the balance test&#xD;
      and the amount of exercise per week.&#xD;

      To be enrolled in this study, you must be able to walk with or without an assistant device&#xD;
      (such as a cane or a walker).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will do a combination of&#xD;
      walking and balance tests twice, once on the day you leave the rehabilitation center or&#xD;
      hospital, and again at a return visit 21-60 days (+/-3) later. For the first test, you will&#xD;
      get up from a chair and walk 10 feet as quickly, but as safely, as possible. You will then&#xD;
      return to the chair and sit again. For the second test, you will walk 25 feet, turn around,&#xD;
      and walk back to the starting point as fast and as safely as you can. Both tests will be&#xD;
      timed by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also do a balance test on a machine. You will stand on a platform with a rail to&#xD;
      hold on to. You will shift your weight and try to keep your balance and center of gravity,&#xD;
      which will be shown on a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a diary to record any physical exercise you are doing from the time you&#xD;
      leave the rehabilitation center to your return visit 21-60 days (+/-3) later. You will be&#xD;
      asked to record what kind of exercises (home exercise, home health therapy, or outpatient&#xD;
      therapy treatment) you do and for how many hours. It should take about 5 minutes to fill out&#xD;
      the diary each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete a questionnaire that asks you about your symptoms, such as pain. You will&#xD;
      complete it when you leave the rehabilitation program and again at the study visit 21-60 days&#xD;
      (+/-3) later. It should take about 5 minutes to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be off study after you complete the second questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 58 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
