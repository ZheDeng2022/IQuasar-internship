      RATIONALE: Vandetanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vandetanib together with&#xD;
      temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vandetanib and&#xD;
      temozolomide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of concurrently administered vandetanib and&#xD;
           temozolomide in patients with unresectable, advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effects of therapy on angiogenesis-related translational endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive escalating doses of oral vandetanib once daily on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and prior to each treatment course for correlative&#xD;
      laboratory studies, including evaluation of plasma VEGF levels by ELISA, serum angiogenesis&#xD;
      assay, and measurement of circulating endothelial cell populations (CD133, CD34, CD146).&#xD;
      Frozen serum and plasma samples are also stored for future research studies.&#xD;
