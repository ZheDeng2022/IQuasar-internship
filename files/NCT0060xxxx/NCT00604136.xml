  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumors from patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with anti-tumor reactivity. These TIL&#xD;
      can be expanded in the laboratory to large numbers, and reinfused to the patient. Using a&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen that selectively kills lymphocytes, a single institution Phase II study&#xD;
      of 35 patients showed a 51% objective response rate to TIL and interleukin-2 injection. In&#xD;
      the present trial we would like to investigate whether we can achieve similar results in a&#xD;
      Hadassah Phase II study, and to determine the feasibility of applying this approach to&#xD;
      patients with advanced melanoma who currently have few treatment options.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have a melanoma metastasis resected and cultured in IL-2 in vitro. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from these cultures will be assessed for tumor reactivity and those with such activity will be further expanded and adoptively transferred. Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day x2 days IV)and fludarabine (25 mg/mE2/day IV x5days). Following this regimen, patients will receive an intravenous adoptive transfer of at least 10E9 tumor-reactive lymphocytes followed by high dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg/dose IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses).</description>

                  being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who&#xD;

                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV&#xD;
                  seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus are less responsive to&#xD;
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;

                  stress test (stress thallium, stress MUGA, dobutamine, echocardiogram or other&#xD;
                  stress test)&#xD;

               -  Similarly, patients who are 50 years old or greater with an LVEF &lt; 45% will be&#xD;
                  excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have a prolonged history of cigarette smoking or symptoms of&#xD;
                  respiratory dysfunction will be excluded if they have an abnormal pulmonary&#xD;
