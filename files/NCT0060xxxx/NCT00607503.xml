  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gain experience with the use of terbutaline in children with&#xD;
      T1D and to determine that there is not a frequent serious, unexpected, uncontrollable effect&#xD;
      on short-term glycemic control. Some information also will be obtained with regard to whether&#xD;
      terbutaline, in the dosing being used in the study, is sufficiently well tolerated to expect&#xD;
      that adherence will be satisfactory in a large randomized trial. In addition, this pilot&#xD;
      study will provide data on the accuracy of a continuous glucose monitor during terbutaline&#xD;
      use to verify that the drug does not impact on sensor function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10 children will be recruited from five centers in the United States to&#xD;
      participate in this study. The data collected in this pilot study will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether to proceed to a randomized trial using the dose of terbutaline being used in the&#xD;
      pilot study or the need for additional pilot testing with a lower dose of terbutaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a chid enters the study, the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After eligibility is determined, informed consent and assent are obtained from the&#xD;
           parent/guardian and subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An unblinded CGM will be used and blood ketones will be checked each morning by the&#xD;
           subject for at least one week. Subjects may be asked to wear an Actiwatch monitor each&#xD;
           night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Terbutaline will be initiated during a CRC admission and continued following the CRC&#xD;
           stay for 21-28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Subjects weighing between 25 and 45 kg will be treated with a nightly oral dose of 2.5&#xD;
           mg and subjects who weigh more than 45 kg will be treated with 3.75 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The CRC admission will last approximately 18-20 hours and include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring of effects of terbutaline by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
                blood and interstitial glucose, lactate, ketones, NEFA, B-OH butyrate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of the accuracy of the CGM by comparing sensor glucose values to blood&#xD;
                glucose values&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The outpatient phase will last 21-28 days and include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nightly use of terbutaline as described above&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of an unblinded CGM on a daily basis to monitor the glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects may be asked to wear the Actiwatch monitor overnight&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of blood ketones each morning&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phone calls to each subject on the first outpatient day of terbutaline use and then&#xD;
                approximately every 3 days (twice a week) until the end of the subject's follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Second CRC admission to mirror the first admission between 21 and 28 days after&#xD;
           initiation of terbutaline&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow up for 1-2 weeks after discontinuation of terbutaline until glucose control is&#xD;
           back to prestudy level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures at home after hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Terbutaline will be taken orally each day prior to bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each subject will continue to use a CGM, with instructions to use it as close to 24/7 as&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior to each phone call, the subject will be instructed to download the CGM and either&#xD;
           email or fax the file to the clinic so that the glucose data can be reviewed during the&#xD;
           phone contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each subject will be provided with an HGM and test strips. The HGM will be used for&#xD;
           calibration of the CGM and to confirm high and low values on the CGM prior to acting on&#xD;
           them. It will be downloaded at the end-of-study CRC admission. The subject will be asked&#xD;
           to measure blood ketones each morning using the meter and strips that will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each subject may be asked to wear an Actiwatch each night to measure movement while the&#xD;
           subject is sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Phone calls to each subject will be made after the first outpatient day of terbutaline&#xD;
           use and then approximately every 3 days (twice a week) until the end of the subject's&#xD;
           follow up plus an about 7 days after terbutaline is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Prior to the end-of-study CRC admission, follow-up visits can occur at any time at the&#xD;
           discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-of study CRC admission will occur after 21-28 days of the outpatient phase.The&#xD;
      protocol will be identical to the protocol for the first CRC admission. The dinner and&#xD;
      breakfast meals will be identical to the meals given during the first admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensors will be removed prior to discharge, unless the investigator decides it would be&#xD;
      beneficial to continue a CGM for 1-2 weeks to assist in the maintenance of glucose control&#xD;
      after terbutaline has been stopped.&#xD;
