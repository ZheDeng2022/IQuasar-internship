      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the effects of lumbopelvic&#xD;
      manual therapy on lower extremity biomechanics and arthrogenic muscle response. As a result&#xD;
      of this study, we also hope that physical therapists, athletic trainers, and other physical&#xD;
      medicine rehabilitation providers will gain a better understanding of lower extremity&#xD;
      injuries and have the scientific evidence to provide patients with techniques which would&#xD;
      allow for efficient return to activities of daily living without restrictions and possibly&#xD;
      prevent future injuries and minimize risk of osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the amount and duration of arthrogenic muscle response of quadriceps muscles&#xD;
           following lumbopelvic joint manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of lumbopelvic joint manipulation on temporospatial parameters of&#xD;
           gait such cadence, step length, velocity and mean peak lower extremity joint moments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if a correlation exists between patellofemoral joint pain and lumbopelvic&#xD;
           joint dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the amount of change in clinical outcome measure scores following lumbopelvic&#xD;
           joint manipulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that musculoskeletal dysfunction at one joint is not limited to the joint&#xD;
      itself and can be related to dysfunction at joints proximal or distal in the kinetic chain.&#xD;
      Recent research has focused on the relationship of altered lower extremity kinematics and&#xD;
      common musculoskeletal pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is often associated with musculoskeletal pathologies and is one of the strongest stimuli&#xD;
      affecting functional activities in a negative manner. Following injury or chronic&#xD;
      dysfunction, inhibitory neurons decrease the ability of musculature to fully recruit&#xD;
      excitatory motor neurons. This can lead to aberrant movement patterns and different&#xD;
      activation of muscles. Muscle inhibition has been attributed as a possible source of altered&#xD;
      motor activation patterns. Pain can be a result or cause of musculoskeletal dysfunction and&#xD;
      does not necessarily precede inhibition, but can have a contributing effect. The presence of&#xD;
      muscle inhibition is considered a limiting factor in the rehabilitation of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pathologies. If muscle inhibition is properly addressed, individuals and athletes alike,&#xD;
      should be able to more appropriately meet the demands of the activities with a decreased risk&#xD;
      of future injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One technique used to determine presence of muscle inhibition is to measure the ability of&#xD;
      the muscle to produce a maximal voluntary isometric contraction and compare values with the&#xD;
      ability of the contralateral muscle. Since the contralateral limb may also experience muscle&#xD;
      inhibition,it is difficult to obtain an accurate measurement of the amount of muscle&#xD;
      inhibition occurring in the ipsilateral limb. A suggested solution is utilize the&#xD;
      burst-superimposition technique which provides the muscle with a supramaximal stimulus to&#xD;
      recruit any remaining muscle fibers which have not been stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of muscle inhibition is multifaceted. Utilization of manual therapy techniques such&#xD;
      as joint manipulation or mobilization directed at the lumbopelvic region have been shown to&#xD;
      be successful in disinhibiting lower extremity muscles. Previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      sacroiliac joint manipulation disinhibited the quadriceps muscle in individuals with anterior&#xD;
      knee pain. One of the limitations was these studies only observed an immediate decrease of&#xD;
      quadriceps inhibition and the duration of the treatment effect was unknown. Effects of&#xD;
      disinhibition of other lower extremity muscles and duration of disinhibition have not been&#xD;
      determined at this time. It is also unknown what effects manual therapy treatments directed&#xD;
      at the lumbopelvic region have on functional activities such as walking, squatting, or&#xD;
      ascending/descending stairs. By examining these effects, we will be attempting to provide&#xD;
      scientific evidence to validate common clinical practices in rehabilitative medicine.&#xD;
