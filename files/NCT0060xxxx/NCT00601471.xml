  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to determine the effect of a tibiofibular joint&#xD;
      manipulation on the neuromuscular response of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic ankle instability. Another aim of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      long term effects of a tibiofibular joint manipulation on range of motion and self-reported&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a manipulation applied at the distal tibiofibular joint will result in&#xD;
      greater muscle activation, improved functional dorsiflexion ROM, and increases in FAAM scores&#xD;
      compared to a tibiofibular joint manipulation applied at the proximal joint. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that both distal and proximal tibiofibular joint manipulations will result in&#xD;
      greater muscle activation, improved functional dorsiflexion ROM, and increases in FAAM scores&#xD;
      than no treatment at all.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness is a common impairment following injury to a joint. Individuals with lateral&#xD;
      ankle sprains have been shown to demonstrate weakness and inhibition of the fibularis longus&#xD;
      and soleus muscles. Recently, changes in the positional alignment of the talus, tibia, and&#xD;
      fibula have been implicated in a subpopulation of individuals with chronic ankle instability&#xD;
      (CAI). Clinically this manifests as a decrease in the posterior glide of the talus and&#xD;
      decreased dorsiflexion ROM. Another positional fault has been noted to occur between the&#xD;
      distal tibiofibular joint. A subpopulation of individuals with a history of CAI have&#xD;
      demonstrated a slight anterior displacement of the fibula relative to the tibia. The cause of&#xD;
      the malpositioning is unknown, but manual therapeutic interventions may offer the ability to&#xD;
      restore normal joint arthrokinematics and muscle function. It is unknown if the correction of&#xD;
      this positional fault will have an effect on muscle inhibition about the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since muscle inhibition is a neurological reflexive reaction, it is thought that traditional&#xD;
      strengthening treatment techniques may not fully address this dysfunction. Manual therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions can have dual effects on the neuromuscular system and restore normal joint&#xD;
      arthrokinematics. Evidence suggests a joint manipulation is able to disinhibit or even&#xD;
      facilitate local and distant muscles. This likely occurs due to the afferent response from&#xD;
      the structures in and around the manipulated joint. Comprehensive treatment interventions&#xD;
      which restore normal joint function, optimal motoneuron pool excitability, strength, and&#xD;
      pain-free previous level of function need to be developed to prevent future dysfunction and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently no study has examined the effects of tibiofibular joint manipulation on the&#xD;
      neuromuscular response of ankle musculature or the effects on range of motion and function.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the acute effects of a tibiofibular joint&#xD;
      manipulation on the neuromuscular response of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles and to&#xD;
      determine the long term effects on range of motion and function in individuals with CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first research question will address how a tibiofibular joint manipulation immediately&#xD;
      affects the activation of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles. The second question will&#xD;
      address how this joint manipulation affects range of motion and functional outcomes over a&#xD;
      three week period. Changes in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), navicular drop, Step&#xD;
      Down Test, Balance Error Scoring System, and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) will&#xD;
      be used to determine if clinically significant changes occurred during the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
