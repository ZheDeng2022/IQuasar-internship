    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I clinical trial of IPI-504 in combination with docetaxel&#xD;
      (Taxotere).The purposes of the study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety profile,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the highest dose of IPI-504 that can be given with docetaxel without causing severe side&#xD;
           effects, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to recommend a Phase II dose of the combination in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an emerging and&#xD;
      recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a&#xD;
      central role in maintaining the proper folding, function and viability of various &quot;client&#xD;
      proteins&quot;. Many of the client proteins stabilized by Hsp90 are oncoproteins and&#xD;
      cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalating study in which patients will be treated&#xD;
      with a fixed dose of docetaxel followed by IPI-504 following one of three dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an MTD has been defined, up to 20 additional patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) will be enrolled.&#xD;
