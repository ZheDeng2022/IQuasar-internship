      Background: The literature indicates that, in relation to motor learning, healthy subjects&#xD;
      benefit more from random practice than from constant practice. However, this effect is not&#xD;
      well known in post-stroke patients. Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of practice structure on motor learning in post-stroke patients. Methods:&#xD;
      Participants included an experimental group (EG) of post-stroke patients: 17 males and&#xD;
      females; and a control group (CG) of healthy individuals: 17 males and females. At the&#xD;
      acquisition phase, all participants performed 30 trials of a coincident timing task. Nine&#xD;
      individuals from each group practiced constantly (C) at a stimulus propagation speed of 3&#xD;
      mph, and eight from each group practiced randomly (R) at speeds of 2, 3, and 5 mph.&#xD;
      Subsequent phases included: 1) transfer, 2) retention after 15 minutes, and 3) retention&#xD;
      after 3 days. Each of these phases included 20 trials: 10 at a speed of 1 mph, and 10 at a&#xD;
      speed of 4 mph. Intra- and inter-group comparisons were made employing an alpha level of 0.05&#xD;
      (5%).&#xD;

      Utilized was Bassin's anticipation timer (Lafayette Instruments #50575), which is comprised&#xD;
      of a control screen, one 1.52 m gutter with 32 diodes placed on it linearly, and a response&#xD;
      button. The screen has a digital display, with commands that permit the operator to control&#xD;
      the stimulus propagation speed and the preparatory interval speed. Once activated, the screen&#xD;
      exhibits an alert signal, and, after the preparatory interval, it initiates the propagation&#xD;
      of a luminous stimulus, lighting the 32 diodes successively. The task required participants&#xD;
      to press the response button simultaneously with the illumination of the last diode. The&#xD;
      digital display showed the error measure (em): that is, the difference between the&#xD;
      illumination of the last diode and the response.&#xD;
