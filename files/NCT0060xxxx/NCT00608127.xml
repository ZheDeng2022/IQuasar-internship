  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease primarily&#xD;
      affecting women of childbearing age, and associated with severe morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      its victims. The existing therapy, however, is not specific and its inevitable side effects&#xD;
      may themselves be fatal. Therefore, it is a widely recognized need for, and it would be&#xD;
      highly advantageous to have a safe, specific rapidly effective and well-defined treatment of&#xD;
      SLE, devoid of the disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown that VRT101 a peptide present in the extracellular laminin is a target for&#xD;
      pathogenic lupus autoantibodies. Using this peptide we have developed the LupusorbTM - an&#xD;
      immune-adsorption column which specifically binds pathogenic antibodies from monoclonal&#xD;
      cultures as well as from patients' plasma. The investigational product named LupusorbTM&#xD;
      Column is a sterile medical device for single use and can be classified into category IIb&#xD;
      (synthetic ligands, peptides) according to Annex IX of the European Medical Device Directive&#xD;
      42/93/EEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study, a pilot non-randomized open label study, will test the safety,&#xD;
      Tolerability and short term efficacy of a single immunoadsorption procedure in SLE patients.&#xD;
