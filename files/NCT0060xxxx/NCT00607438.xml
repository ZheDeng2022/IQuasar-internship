  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will be 4 weeks in length. Patients will receive Abraxane weekly for 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will not receive Abraxane during week 4 (rest week). Nexavar will be given&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be radiologically evaluated every 8 weeks for response. Patients will continue&#xD;
      to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
