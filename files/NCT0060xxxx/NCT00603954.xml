      I. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims at comparing two nonmyeloablative regimens currently used in 2 major&#xD;
      HCT centers in the US for patients with HLA-matched related or unrelated donor: the one from&#xD;
      the Seattle group consisting of 2 Gy TBI with fludarabine (90 mg/m²) versus the one from the&#xD;
      Stanford group combining 8 Gy TLI with ATG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. DESIGN OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter, randomized phase II study, comparing two conditioning regimens.&#xD;
      Sixty patients with HLA-matched donors will be randomized between the TBI or the DLI regimen.&#xD;
      There will be a stratification between centers. There will be a stopping rule for graft&#xD;
      rejection &gt; 15% at day 180 (in each group separately), and for nonrelapse mortality &gt; 35% at&#xD;
      day 180 (in each group separately). If the stopping rules are not triggered after 60 patients&#xD;
      and no statistically significant differences are seen between the 2 arms in terms of acute&#xD;
      GVHD, graft rejection and survival, a second cohort of 40 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.1. Pre-transplant procedures Peripheral blood mononucleated cells from the patient as&#xD;
      well as from the donor will be collected before conditioning, as per standard practice for&#xD;
      all routine allogeneic HSC transplants. Part will be cryopreserved in 10 % DMSO and stored at&#xD;
      -180°C in liquid nitrogen. The other part will be devoted to identification of specific donor&#xD;
      and patient markers to be used in later measurements of chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.2. Conditioning regimens The conditioning regimens used will be either the one developed&#xD;
      in Seattle (TBI arm) or the one developed by the Stanford group (TLI arm). These 2 regimens&#xD;
      have been extensively reported in major medical journals. In the TBI arm, conditioning will&#xD;
      consist of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -4, -3 and -2 (total dose 90 mg/m2), followed by a&#xD;
      singe dose of 2 Gy TBI administered on day 0, at a low dose-rate (≈ 7 cGy/min), before&#xD;
      infusion of cells. In the TLI arm, conditioning will consist of 8 Gy TLI and ATG. TLI will be&#xD;
      administered by linear accelerator at a dose of 80 cGy daily, starting 11 days before&#xD;
      transplantation, until a total of 10 doses (800 cGy) has been delivered. The irradiation will&#xD;
      consist of a supradiaphragmatic mantle field, a subdiaphragmatic field including an inverted&#xD;
      Y and splenic ports, encompassing all major lymphoid organs, including the thymus, spleen,&#xD;
      and lymph nodes, as used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease (Kaplan HS, Cancer Research&#xD;
      26:1268-1276, 1966). The Waldeyer ring is not included. ATG (Thymoglobulin®, Genzyme), at a&#xD;
      dose of 1.5 mg/kg/d, will be given intravenously on days -11 through -7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.3. PBSC collection and transplantation PBSC mobilization and collection in the donor will&#xD;
      be performed as per standard practice for all routine allogeneic HSC transplants. This is&#xD;
      briefly described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor will be given SC injections of G-CSF at a dose of 10-15 µg/kg for 6 days (days -5&#xD;
      through 0). Additional doses of G-CSF may be given on days +1 and +2 if the first 2&#xD;
      leukaphereses do not yield sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells. G-CSF will generally be&#xD;
      administered :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the evening on days -5, -4, -3, -2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before 7:00 on days -1 and 0 (and on days 1 and 2 if necessary). Collection of PBSC will&#xD;
           be carried out on day -1 and in the morning on day 0. Leukaphereses will be performed&#xD;
           using a continuous flow blood cell separator and following a mononuclear cell collection&#xD;
           protocol. The volume of blood processed will be 15-20 liters if donor is an adult or 10&#xD;
           liters/m2 if donor is a child. Anticoagulation will be performed with the ACD-A&#xD;
           solution. The PBSC from the first day of harvest will be stored overnight at 4°C in the&#xD;
           patient's own plasma. After the second harvest, PBSC from the first and second day of&#xD;
           harvest will be infused into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous reports suggesting that higher dose of CD34 cells are associated with&#xD;
      better outcomes after nonmyeloablative HCT, high doses of CD34+ cells (&gt;6.5 x 106/kg) should&#xD;
      be ideally administered. Nevertheless, to limit donor procedures, only two leukaphereses are&#xD;
      required. However, in case the required minimal number of cells (3 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg&#xD;
      recipient) cannot be obtained with the first two collections, additional leukaphereses should&#xD;
      be carried out unless contra-indicated for the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells will be infused through a central catheter according to standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4. Other treatments of the recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.1. Immunosuppressive therapy The immunosuppressive regimens used will be the one used&#xD;
      in standard practice for routine NM-HCT at our centers, i.e. an association of tacrolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF will be administered orally from the evening of day 0 through day 28 (sibling recipients)&#xD;
      or day 42 (alternative donor recipients) at the dose of 15 mg/kg t.i.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus will be given orally at the dose of 0.06 mg/kg bid starting on day -3. The dose&#xD;
      will then be adapted according to through whole blood values following standard procedures&#xD;
      (between 15 and 20 ng/ml the first 28 days and between 10-15 ng/ml thereafter). Full doses&#xD;
      will be given until day 100 (sibling recipients) or 180 (alternative donor recipients). Doses&#xD;
      will then be progressively tapered to be definitely discontinued by day 180 (sibling donors)&#xD;
      or 365 (alternative donor recipients) in the absence of GVHD. Tacrolimus may be stopped&#xD;
      earlier in case of disease progression or graft rejection or continued longer in case of low&#xD;
      donor T-cell chimerism or GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD will be assessed according to standard criteria. Therapy for acute or chronic GVHD will&#xD;
      use standard procedures/current protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.2. Growth factors Growth factors will be used as per standard practice for all routine&#xD;
      NM-HCT. No myeloid growth factor will be administered unless the granulocyte count falls&#xD;
      below 1000/µl. Patients may then be treated with 5 µg/kg/day of G-CSF to maintain the&#xD;
      granulocyte count &gt; 1,000/µl. Erythropoietin may be administered as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.3. Infection prophylaxis Infection prophylaxis against bacterial, fungal, viral and&#xD;
      parasitic agents will be carried out as per standard practice for all routine NM-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.4. Donor lymphocyte infusion Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will be given as per&#xD;
      standard practice for all routine NM-HCT. DLI may be given in case of poor T-cell chimerism&#xD;
      or disease progression according to standard procedures/current protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. PATIENTS' FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.1. Quality controls of cell products&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.1.1. Peripheral blood of donor on days of PBSC collection As per standard practice for all&#xD;
      routine allogeneic PBSC transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.1.2. Leukapheresis product As per standard practice for all routine allogeneic PBSC&#xD;
      transplants including determination of the number of TNC, CD34, CD3 , CD4 and CD8 cells&#xD;
      transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.2. Toxicities of cell infusions Potential toxicities associated with PBSC infusions will&#xD;
      be carefully monitored per the standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.3. Chimerism The chimeric status of hematopoietic cells will be carefully monitored&#xD;
      post-transplant, as per standard practice for all routine allogeneic transplants. Donor&#xD;
      chimerism will be measured in whole blood as well as bone marrow. In addition, peripheral&#xD;
      blood cells will be separated by RosetteSep procedure (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,&#xD;
      Canada) to determine the proportion of donor and recipient cells in pure population of T&#xD;
      (CD3+) cells. Fluorescent in-situ hibridization (FISH) for X and Y chromosome will be used&#xD;
      preferentially for sex-mismatched HCT, while PCR techniques based on short tandem repeat&#xD;
      (STR) markers will be used for sex-matched HCT. Pre-transplant donor and recipient peripheral&#xD;
      WBC will serve to identify specific markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We define complete chimerism as the presence of &gt;95% of T cells of donor origin and mixed&#xD;
      chimerism as the presence of 6-94% of T cells of donor origin. Graft rejection is defined as&#xD;
      the occurrence of T cell chimerism &lt; 5% and engraftment as the occurrence of more than 5% T&#xD;
      cells of donor origin in the first month following the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of donor chimerism will be determined at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. peripheral blood :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Days 28, 42, 60, 100, 180 and 365 post-transplant : whole blood and CD3+ cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analyses on day 60 are only necessary when chimerism is &lt; 80% on days 28 and/or 42;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analyses on whole blood on days 42, 100, 180 and 365 are only necessary when bone&#xD;
                marrow analyses are not feasible/successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. bone marrow : • Days 42, 100, 180 and 365 post-transplant : whole bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.4. Clinical data Patient will be carefully observed and the following clinical parameters&#xD;
      will be recorded (see appendices B and C). Appendices B and C should be send not more than 3&#xD;
      months after the patient achieved the target day after HSCT (day 100, day 180, 1-yr, 2-yr,&#xD;
      3-yr, 4-yr and 5-yr) to Frederic Baron at the fax # 32-4-366 8855.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, timing and severity of acute GVHD, its treatment and outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, timing and severity of chronic GVHD, its treatment and outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, timing and severity of cytopenia, its treatment and outcome; number of&#xD;

           platelets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of hospitalization, if any;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of bacterial infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of fungal infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of CMV infections (by quantitative PCR) and CMV disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of other viral infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of other infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of the primary malignant disease : response, relapse, its treatment and&#xD;
           outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other serious complication associated with the transplant procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.5. Immunologic data. In patients transplanted at the university of Liège, immune&#xD;
      reconstitution in the patient will be monitored as per standard practice at ULg for all&#xD;
      routine allogeneic transplants. For patients transplanted outside of the University of Liège&#xD;
      and willing to participate to the immune recovery study, 50 mL of fresh heparinized blood&#xD;
      collected on days 42, 100, 180, 365 and 730 can be send at room temperature to Olivier&#xD;
      Dengis, Department of Clinical Hematology, CHU Sart-Tilman, B4000 Liège.&#xD;
