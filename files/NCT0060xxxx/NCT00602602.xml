      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bevacizumab together with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bevacizumab&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and radiation therapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicity of bevacizumab with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, when therapy&#xD;
           is given before chemoradiotherapy, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicity of bevacizumab with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and concomitant&#xD;
           radiotherapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival of&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the percentage of potentially resectable patients who are ultimately able&#xD;
           to proceed to successful resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the relationship between markers of apoptosis in tumor cells (including&#xD;
           MIF, CREB, HIF-1-alpha expression/polymorphism, and others) and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define response rates in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes and bevacizumab IV&#xD;
           over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity. Between 4-6 weeks after completion of initial therapy, patients undergo&#xD;
           radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5-6 weeks. Beginning within 48 hours after&#xD;
           initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously through&#xD;
           completion of radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours&#xD;
           on days 1, 15 and 29 and bevacizumab IV on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Four to six weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo&#xD;
           resection of the tumor. Patients with no evidence of disease progression and who undergo&#xD;
           successful surgical intervention (i.e., R0 resection) proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
           within the next 6-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant therapy: Patients receive gemcitabine and bevacizumab for 4 courses as in&#xD;
           neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue samples at the time of diagnosis, prior to&#xD;
      treatment by endoscopic ultrasound or laparoscopy, or during surgical resection following&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens obtained at baseline are&#xD;
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry to assess tumor vascularity and angiogenic activity. Tumor&#xD;
      vascularity is assessed via immunostaining of tumor specimens with the pan-endothelial cell&#xD;
      marker, anti-CD34, for evaluation of tumor blood vessels. Angiogenic activity is assessed by&#xD;
      analyzing pERK1/2, Ki67, and the pericyte coverage index in tumor specimens. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo blood collection to determine plasma levels of VEGF at 4 weeks prior to initial&#xD;
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab, at up to 48 hours prior to chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab,&#xD;
      and at up to 48 hours prior to adjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for the first year,&#xD;
      and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
