  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for doing this study is to learn whether raising a person's vitamin D level from&#xD;
      below normal to normal levels will improve his or her body's ability to use sugar. Vitamin D&#xD;
      is well known to be an important vitamin for the development and maintenance of bones.&#xD;
      Recently, scientists have learned that vitamin D may have a role in the prevention of cancer,&#xD;
      diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. The investigators are specifically interested in studying&#xD;
      this question in the overweight/obese population as they are at greater risk for both vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency and impaired ability to metabolize sugar (glucose intolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D repletion (increasing the serum 25(OH)D level from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml) will&#xD;
      improve insulin sensitivity in individuals who are overweight/obese and insulin resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Vitamin D repletion will improve biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and inflammation&#xD;
      (directly altering macrophage cytokine production and/or indirectly as a result of&#xD;
      improvement in insulin sensitivity.) 2.30,000 IU (0.25 mg) weekly of cholecalciferol (vitamin&#xD;
      D3) will raise serum 25(OH)D levels from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml overweight/obese&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonsmoking men and women, ages 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m² and within 10% of maximum weight&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum 25(OH)D level ≤ 20 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum insulin level ≥ 7.2 mU/l&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to maintain current body weight for the duration of the study&#xD;

             including low-dose daily aspirin, for at least ten days prior to each admission (due&#xD;
             to the potential effects of these agents on inflammatory markers.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to avoid the use of all over-the-counter or prescription vitamins, dietary&#xD;
             supplements, and herbal products during the study, with the exception of a basic&#xD;
             multivitamin supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If of childbearing potential, willingness to use highly effective contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;
