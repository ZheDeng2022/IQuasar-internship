    <textblock>
      This study will test the use of a radioactive substance called [11C]dLop for measuring&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The P-gp protein acts&#xD;
      as a pump in cells, affecting a variety of functions, such as limiting drug absorption and&#xD;
      elimination and decreasing drug penetration into certain tissues, such as the brain. It is a&#xD;
      major obstacle to successful chemotherapy because it can pump cancer drugs out of the cells,&#xD;
      interfering with treatment. Decreased P-gp function may contribute to disorders such as&#xD;
      Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease, whereas higher levels of the protein have been&#xD;
      found in patients with epilepsy and in several forms of drug-resistant cancer tumors. This&#xD;
      study will determine uptake and clearance of [11C]dLop and the radiation exposure to organs&#xD;
      of the body to assess its possible use in further studies of P-gp function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 51 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG): A test of the electrical function of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain PET scans: PET imaging uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a&#xD;
           tracer that labels active areas of the brain so the activity can be seen with a special&#xD;
           camera. The tracer used in this study is [18F]FMPEP-d(2). Before starting the scan, a&#xD;
           catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to inject the tracer and another&#xD;
           catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to obtain blood samples during the scan.&#xD;
           For the procedure, the subject lies on the scanner bed. A special mask is fitted to the&#xD;
           head and attached to the bed to help keep the person s head still during the scan so the&#xD;
           images will be clear. A brief scan is done just before the tracer is injected to provide&#xD;
           measures of the brain that are helpful in calculating information from subsequent scans.&#xD;
           After the tracer is injected, pictures are taken for about 2.5 hours, while the subject&#xD;
           lies still on the scanner bed. Blood and urine tests are done after 24 hours after the&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI scan is done within 1 year (before or after) of&#xD;
           the PET scan. This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of&#xD;
           the brain. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a tube-like&#xD;
           device), wearing earplugs to muffle the noise of the machine during the scanning&#xD;
           process. The test takes about 1 hour....&#xD;

      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and is the major efflux&#xD;
      pump in the blood-brain barrier. P-gp has several physiological roles such as limiting drug&#xD;
      absorption, active drug elimination, and limits drug penetration into sensitive tissues&#xD;
      (e.g., brain and testis) (Fromm, 2004). Reduced activity or expression of P-gp may contribute&#xD;
      to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s disease. The reduced&#xD;
      activity of P-gp (i.e., decreased neuroprotection at the blood brain barrier) may allow&#xD;
      harmful pesticides access to the brain which can damage the brain s dopaminergic cell groups&#xD;
      possibly leading to Parkinson s disease (Betarbet et al., 2000; Kortekaas et al., 2005). The&#xD;
      increased deposition of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer s disease, may be due in part, to the&#xD;
      decreased elimination of cerebral beta-amyloid in brain (Vogelgesang et al., 2002).&#xD;
      Conversely, an overexpression of P-gp has been found in epilepsy and in several forms of&#xD;
      multi drug resistant cancer tumors (Brandt et al., 2006; Szakacs et al., 2006). In vivo&#xD;
      evaluation of P-gp function in the brain and throughout the body is important in disease&#xD;
      states, and in therapeutic and diagnostic drug evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-gp function has been assessed in healthy volunteers with positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      using [11C]verapamil, nevertheless, accurate quantification of this PET radioligand is&#xD;
      difficult due to the large contribution of radiometabolites and low signal (Ikoma et al.,&#xD;
      2006; Lee et al., 2006; Lubberink et al., 2007). Therefore, we have recently developed&#xD;
      [11C]dLop as an alternative radioligand for imaging P-gp function, which will allow a more&#xD;
      accurate quantification of P-gp with a higher signal and less contribution of&#xD;
      radiometabolites. In the current protocol, we wish to evaluate [11C]dLop in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers to determine the kinetics of brain imaging of P-gp function. In order to simulate&#xD;
      P-gp dysfunction in healthy volunteers we will administer the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar. We&#xD;
      will perform brain PET scans using [11C]dLop before and after P-gp blockade in order to&#xD;
      quantify P-gp function at the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
