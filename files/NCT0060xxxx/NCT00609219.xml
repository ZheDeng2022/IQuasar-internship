  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called nasopharyngeal cancer. This cancer has come back or not&#xD;
      gone away or is at high risk for coming back after treatment (including the best treatment we&#xD;
      know for nasopharyngeal cancer). We are asking patients to volunteer to be in a research&#xD;
      study using special immune system cells called EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a new&#xD;
      experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with nasopharyngeal cancer show evidence of infection with the virus that&#xD;
      causes infectious mononucleosis, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), before or at the time of their&#xD;
      diagnosis of nasopharyngeal cancer. EBV is found in the cancer cells of most patients with&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancer, suggesting that it may play a role in causing this cancer. The cancer&#xD;
      cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.&#xD;
      We want to see if special white blood cells (called T cells) that have been trained to kill&#xD;
      EBV-infected cells can survive in the patient's blood and affect the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have treated other patients with different EBV positive cancers and have had variable&#xD;
      results. Some patients have had some response to the treatment. Some patients have been cured&#xD;
      by the treatment. It is not possible for us to predict if this treatment will work for&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to find the largest safe dose of EBV specific cytotoxic T&#xD;
      cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help&#xD;
      patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will first test a biopsy of the tumor (that has already been done) to see if your tumor&#xD;
      cells are EBV positive. If the patient is eligible, we will then take 60-70 ml (12-14&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood from them. We will use this blood to grow more of the T cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory. We will first grow an EBV-infected cell line by infecting the blood with EBV&#xD;
      virus. This line will then be irradiated so it cannot grow and used to stimulate the T cells.&#xD;
      This stimulation will train the T cells to kill cells with EBV on their surface. We will then&#xD;
      grow these EBV-specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells and a growth factor&#xD;
      called Interleukin 2. Next, we will test the T cells to make sure that they kill the&#xD;
      EBV-infected cells. If the number of T cells produced is low, we may need to obtain&#xD;
      additional blood samples to make these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells (which are the patient's own T cells) will be injected into them over 10 minutes,&#xD;
      after pretreatment with Tylenol and Benadryl. A total of two doses will be given two weeks&#xD;
      apart. All of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow the patient in the clinic after the injections. To learn more about the way&#xD;
      the T cells are working and how long they last in the body, an extra 10-60 mls (2-12&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and 3-4 days after the infusion (this&#xD;
      is optional). Up to 40 ml (8 teaspoons) of blood will also be drawn at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-infusion, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The blood may be drawn from the patient's&#xD;
      central line at the time of the regular blood tests. We will use this blood to look at the&#xD;
      immune response to the patient's cancer. Over the course of the study, up to 29 tablespoons&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have repeat scans at 8 weeks after the first injections. If these show&#xD;
      stable or improving disease they may (if the patient wishs) receive up to 6 extra doses of&#xD;
      cells. These would be given every 1-3 months. If the patient has additional injections of&#xD;
      cells after the first two infusions, we will take extra blood tests before each infusion, at&#xD;
      the end of each infusion, 3-4 days after each infusion (day optional depending on patient&#xD;
      preference), and at 1 and 2 weeks after each infusion. We will also do an extra scan between&#xD;
      1 and 3 months after the last infusion. Follow up will then continue every 3 months and will&#xD;
      continue until 12 months after the last infusion.&#xD;
