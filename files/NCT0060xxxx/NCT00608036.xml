  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many teenagers have unhealthy eating habits and do not get enough physical activity. This&#xD;
      study will examine whether the neighborhood in which a teenager lives affects his/her quality&#xD;
      of life, physical activity levels, and eating habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an increasingly important health problem in the United States, particularly among&#xD;
      adolescents. Previous studies among adults have shown that people who live in neighborhoods&#xD;
      with good &quot;walkability&quot; and recreational environments have increased physical activity&#xD;
      levels, and some studies have suggested that there is a relationship between the neighborhood&#xD;
      food environment and eating patterns. While these concepts have been studied in adults, more&#xD;
      research is needed on the effect of the neighborhood environment on adolescents. In this&#xD;
      study, adolescents who live in select neighborhoods in Seattle-King County, WA and&#xD;
      Baltimore-Washington, DC will be enrolled. Forty-eight neighborhoods in these areas will be&#xD;
      studied, with researchers taking into account the neighborhoods' walkability levels (e.g.,&#xD;
      combination of street connectivity, residential density, land use mix, retail floor area&#xD;
      ratio) and median income levels. Study researchers will examine and create formulas to&#xD;
      measure walkability, pedestrian infrastructure, public recreation space, and nutrition&#xD;
      environment quality. Researchers will also examine crime and weather patterns; psychosocial&#xD;
      variables; parent support; and perceived neighborhood, school, and home environments.&#xD;
      Overall, this study will evaluate the ability of a research model to explain the variation in&#xD;
      physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, dietary patterns, and weight among adolescents,&#xD;
      with an emphasis on neighborhood environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no study visits for this study: participation will take place entirely through&#xD;
      the mail, phone, or internet. Participants will include adolescents between the ages of 12&#xD;
      and 16 years old and their parents, all of whom live in the identified study neighborhoods.&#xD;
      At the time of study entry, adolescents will complete a questionnaire on neighborhood and&#xD;
      safety issues, diet, physical activity habits and places where activity occurs, grades,&#xD;
      school policies and parental rules that affect physical activity and eating, and the support&#xD;
      they get from people regarding healthy eating and physical activity. One parent of each&#xD;
      adolescent will also complete a neighborhood information questionnaire. Adolescents will&#xD;
      measure their height, weight, and waist circumference and send the measurements to study&#xD;
      staff along with the questionnaire. Next, a 4-week period, study staff will call adolescents&#xD;
      on three random days and collect information on their diet in the previous 24 hours. During&#xD;
      this period, adolescents will wear an activity meter and a GPS monitor for 7 consecutive days&#xD;
      and will mail the devices to study staff for analysis.&#xD;
