      The usefulness of diagnostic vitrectomy in patients with suspected sarcoidosis with posterior&#xD;
      segment involvement (in whom a diagnosis cannot be determined by conventional methods) has&#xD;
      not been well described. We hypothesized that diagnostic vitrectomy would help establish the&#xD;
      diagnosis in these challenging cases. Herein, we evaluated the diagnostic yield of vitreous&#xD;
      biopsy in patients with suspected sarcoidosis-associated uveitis that affected the posterior&#xD;
      segment.This is a retrospective interventional case series. Cases of intermediate, posterior&#xD;
      or panuveitis that could not be characterized by clinical examination, ancillary, and&#xD;
      laboratory tests were considered for diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy. Retrospective chart&#xD;
      review was conducted on consecutive eyes that underwent diagnostic, or diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic vitrectomy by a single surgeon from January 1989 to June 2006.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We obtained approval to conduct this non-comparative, interventional, retrospective case&#xD;
      series from the Duke University Institutional Review Board. We used an established database&#xD;
      of patients with uveitis and the operative reports from a single surgeon (GJJ) to identify&#xD;
      all consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy from January 1989 to&#xD;
      June 2006. We excluded patients with acute postoperative or traumatic endophthalmitis from&#xD;
      this study. Cases were included if intraocular vitreous specimens were obtained for&#xD;
      diagnostic testing. After identifying 150 patients, we reviewed the medical records of these&#xD;
      individuals as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic data and clinical history were recorded at the time of initial visit. A&#xD;
      complete ophthalmic history and examination were performed by a single examiner (GJJ). The&#xD;
      examination included slit-lamp biomicroscopy and dilated fundus examination with indirect&#xD;
      ophthalmoscopy. Anterior segment inflammation was graded using the system described by Hogan&#xD;
      and colleagues. The system previously described by Nussenblatt et.al. was used to grade&#xD;
      vitreous opacity. Fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and ultrasonography&#xD;
      were performed as indicated. A differential diagnosis was compiled for each case, based on&#xD;
      clinic findings. Additional laboratory tests were ordered depending on the constellation of&#xD;
      clinical history, exam findings, and results of previous ancillary testing. Anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      therapy was initiated in an empiric or diagnosis-specific manner, and the clinical response&#xD;
      was followed carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic vitrectomy was performed on eyes with intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis in&#xD;
      which an etiology could not be characterized by clinical examination, laboratory, and/or&#xD;
      ancillary testing. In addition, diagnostic vitrectomy was performed on eyes that did not&#xD;
      adequately respond to empirical therapy, or those in which intraocular malignancy or&#xD;
      infection was suspected. Therapeutic vitrectomy was performed in conjunction with diagnostic&#xD;
      vitrectomy when clinically indicated, for example to repair retinal detachment, to remove&#xD;
      epiretinal membranes, to decrease vitreous opacity, or to insert an intraocular sustained&#xD;
      drug-delivery implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, vitreous samples were collected in the operating room using a standardized&#xD;
      technique which has been previously reported. Briefly, three-port, 20-gauge pars plana&#xD;
      vitrectomy instrumentation was utilized. An infusion line was inserted into one sclerotomy&#xD;
      and secured to the globe. A second sclerotomy was made, and a fiberoptic light pipe was&#xD;
      immediately inserted to minimize vitreous egress. A third sclerotomy was created, and the&#xD;
      vitreous cutter was inserted. To obtain an undiluted vitreous sample, the vitreous was cut&#xD;
      mechanically with the vitreous cutter, while the assistant surgeon simultaneously manually&#xD;
      aspirated the vitreous. The tip of the vitreous cutter was viewed at all times with the&#xD;
      wide-field viewing system during the procedure. After sufficient undiluted sample was&#xD;
      obtained, infusion fluid was allowed to enter the eye and a diluted vitreous sample was&#xD;
      obtained in a similar manner. The samples were personally carried to the clinical&#xD;
      laboratories by the operating surgeon. Vitreous fluid analysis was guided by clinical&#xD;
      suspicion based on the pre-operative differential diagnosis and the intraoperative posterior&#xD;
      segment appearance. Cytopathology was used to identify granulomatous inflammation or tumor&#xD;
      cells. A thin-prep was prepared, processed through a membrane filter apparatus (Millipore&#xD;
      Corp, Bedford, MA) and then stained with Papanicolaou stain. Gram stain, KOH preparation and&#xD;
      culture were used to diagnose intraocular infection. Where appropriate, instructions were&#xD;
      given to the clinical laboratory for specific sample processing (e.g., suspected slow-growing&#xD;
      bacterium, such as Propionibacterium acnes or suspected fungal infection). Genomic&#xD;
      amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at the University of Colorado&#xD;
      (Boulder, CO), or Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, TX) to test for the presence of Herpes&#xD;
      simplex virus, Herpes zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. PCR was performed for Toxoplasma&#xD;
      gondii at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (Palo Alto, CA) as previously described. Toxocara&#xD;
      canis antibody levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). For Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara&#xD;
      canis, simultaneous serum samples were also collected and sent to the respective&#xD;
      laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis was based upon the results of the directed diagnostic testing of the&#xD;
      vitreous sample. A positive diagnostic vitrectomy result was based upon the identification of&#xD;
      a specific etiologic agent through the testing modalities previously described. Sarcoidosis&#xD;
      is a diagnosis of exclusion without a known etiologic agent. There are no definitive&#xD;
      laboratory tests that unequivocally confirm a diagnosis of sarcoid. Therefore, a diagnostic&#xD;
      specimen was deemed positive for sarcoid-related inflammation if the following criteria were&#xD;
      satisfied: 1) if all other vitreous testing was negative 2) if the clinical features were&#xD;
      such that sarcoidosis was included in the differential diagnosis based on pre-operative&#xD;
      clinical appearance, and 3) if the cytopathology specimen was consistent with a pattern of&#xD;
      sarcoid-related inflammation such as non-caseating granuloma formation, as established by the&#xD;
      cytopathologist.&#xD;
