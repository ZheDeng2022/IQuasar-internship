      The purpose of this study is to test whether a saline nebulization (breathing in a mist of&#xD;
      moist air through a mask) will help an individual cough up a better sputum sample to test for&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB). In addition, this study will test whether samples obtained with saline&#xD;
      nebulization are better at finding TB in people with HIV infection. The study will enroll up&#xD;
      to 600 individuals, aged 12 and older, with suspected pulmonary TB. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to cough up a sample of sputum into a container. Then, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      breathe a mist of moist air from an oxygen mask followed by moist salty air, which will help&#xD;
      individuals to cough up a second sputum sample. This mist of moist air will contain&#xD;
      salbutamol, a medicine to help open up the airways. The sputum samples will be sent to a&#xD;
      laboratory to test for TB. Additionally, participants will be tested for HIV with a blood&#xD;
      sample collection. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 61&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early case detection, treatment, and prompt household contact investigation, depend on rapid&#xD;
      microbiological confirmation, by direct smear microscopy of acid-fast bacilli, in patients&#xD;
      with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Since delayed diagnosis may result in death due to&#xD;
      lack of appropriate therapy, rapid microbiological diagnosis is especially critical in&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons. Improved rapid diagnostic methods are also crucial for the success of&#xD;
      epidemiological studies; trials of preventative interventions, such as novel vaccines; and&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions, since the diagnostic endpoints of such trials may require&#xD;
      microbiological confirmation of tuberculosis. In clinical practice, early therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention might reduce the risk of death, especially in patients co-infected with HIV. In&#xD;
      this study, researchers propose to test a simple diagnostic modality for rapid diagnosis of&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adolescents and adults. Researchers&#xD;
      will test whether induced sputum will improve the diagnostic yield of smear positive&#xD;
      tuberculosis. This low-cost technology augments spontaneous sputum production by inhalation&#xD;
      of a nebulized saline solution. The primary objective of this study is to quantify and&#xD;
      compare the diagnostic yield of smear positive tuberculosis from induced sputum, with that of&#xD;
      routine sputum, in HIV-infected patients with suspected tuberculosis. Researchers believe&#xD;
      that induced sputum will increase the diagnostic yield from direct smear microscopy in this&#xD;
      patient population. The secondary objective of the study is to quantify and compare the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of smear positive tuberculosis from induced sputum, with that of routine&#xD;
      sputum, in all patients with suspected tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status. Researchers&#xD;
      believe that induced sputum will increase the diagnostic yield from direct smear microscopy&#xD;
      in all patients in this population, regardless of HIV status. Approximately 1200 individuals&#xD;
      (male or female gender), aged 12 years and older, with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, will&#xD;
      be screened in order to enroll 600 eligible participants at 2 district health services&#xD;
      clinics near the town of Worcester, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Informed consent for&#xD;
      participation will be sought from adolescents and adults with suspected pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis who present to public sector community health services for investigation. A&#xD;
      rapid HIV test, with pre- and post-test counseling, will be performed. A routine spontaneous&#xD;
      expectorated sputum sample and an induced sputum sample (obtained after nebulization of&#xD;
      sterile 5% saline via mask) will be collected. A second routine sputum will be collected on&#xD;
      the following morning. Direct smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture of sputum will be&#xD;
      performed in an accredited microbiology laboratory. HIV rapid test results will be used to&#xD;
      classify participants for evaluation of the primary outcome, positive direct smear&#xD;
      microscopy, and the secondary outcome, positive culture of M. tuberculosis. Diagnostic yields&#xD;
      for each routine and induced sputum sample will be calculated, as a proportion of all&#xD;
      patients who are culture-positive for M. tuberculosis, and compared in a pair-wise and&#xD;
      sequential manner. Results will be reported as differences in yield and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for the difference in those proportions. The primary endpoint will be sputum direct&#xD;
      smear microscopy positive for acid-fast bacilli. The secondary endpoint will be sputum&#xD;
      culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Study duration will be 4 years with&#xD;
      individual subject participation approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
