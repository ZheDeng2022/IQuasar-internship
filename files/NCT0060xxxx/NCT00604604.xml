  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother)&#xD;
      support on the prevention of postpartum depression among mothers identified as high-risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many new mothers from diverse cultures experience postpartum depression (PPD), a serious form&#xD;
      of maternal morbidity with well documented health consequences for the mother, child, and&#xD;
      family. While the cause of PPD remains unclear, research consistently demonstrates the&#xD;
      importance of psychosocial variables. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother) support on the prevention of PPD among mothers&#xD;
      identified as high-risk. Public health nurses using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale&#xD;
      (EPDS) screened mothers who were less than 2 weeks postpartum in the regions of Toronto,&#xD;
      Peel, Halton, York, Windsor, Sudbury, and Ottawa. Eligible and consenting mothers were&#xD;
      randomized to either a control group (usual postpartum care) or experimental group (usual&#xD;
      postpartum care plus telephone-based support from an experienced mother who has participated&#xD;
      in a 4-hour training session). Diverse study outcomes, including depressive symptomatology&#xD;
      and health service utilization, were assessed at 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. The results from&#xD;
      this trial will make substantive contributions in six areas: (1) develop the body of&#xD;
      knowledge concerning the effectiveness of peer support in the prevention of PPD among at-risk&#xD;
      mothers; (2) advance our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using peer&#xD;
      volunteers as a complementary form of health care; (3) provide an economic evaluation of a&#xD;
      peer support intervention; (4) offer a detailed analysis of peer support interactions&#xD;
      including supportive functions provided, types of relationships developed, and health&#xD;
      benefits perceived; (5) investigate the utility of screening at-risk mothers using the EPDS&#xD;
      in general public health nursing practice; and (6) present valuable information regarding PPD&#xD;
      among a multicultural Canadian population.&#xD;

    <description>Mothers allocated to the peer support group had access to all of the standard community postpartum services in addition to having received telephone-based support from a peer volunteer (a mother who has previously experienced, and recovered from, postpartum depression and has participated in a 4-hour training session). Telephone contact with a new mother was initiated within 48 to 72 hours of trial enrolment and then as frequently as the dyad deemed necessary; a minimum of four contacts were required.</description>
