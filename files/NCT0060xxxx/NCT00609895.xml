  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis for at least 1 year Administration of&#xD;
             insulin glargine for at least 2 months prior to screening; subjects must be on a&#xD;
             stable dose of insulin glargine, + or - 15%, for at least 1 week prior to screening,&#xD;
             given once daily at bedtime, and the dose must remain unchanged (+ or - 15%) during&#xD;
             the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subjects are taking a short-acting insulin (e.g., regular human insulin, insulin&#xD;
             lispro, or insulin aspart) or oral antidiabetic agents (e.g., a sulfonylurea,&#xD;
             metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, or a metiglinide), the&#xD;
             subject must have been receiving these medications for at least 2 months prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects taking an oral antidiabetic agent, the dose must be unchanged for the 2&#xD;
             weeks (4 weeks for a thiazolidinedione) prior to screening and should not be expected&#xD;
             to be changed from the screening visit (day 14) through the final visit (day 11). The&#xD;
             dose of any short-acting insulin may be changed if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or non-pregnant females between the ages of 6 and 75 years; women must be&#xD;
             postmenopausal for more than 2 years, surgically sterile, or agree to use a reliable&#xD;
             contraceptive measure for the duration of the study. Reliable contraceptive measures&#xD;
             include the following: systemic contraceptive (oral, implant, injections), diaphragm&#xD;
             with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, intrauterine device, or condom with&#xD;
             spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to perform blood glucose profiles using a plasma glucose meter&#xD;
             provided at home over 11 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c &lt; than or = to 8.5% at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any other intermediate- or long-acting insulin (e.g., NPH, Ultralenter, Lenter)&#xD;
             within the last 2 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by&#xD;
             the study protocol (e.g., systemic corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypoglycemia unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (as determined by a serum pregnancy test at the screening visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the 2 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, endocrine, or other major&#xD;
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired hepatic function, as shown by but not limited to serum glutamic-oxaloacetic&#xD;
             transaminase (SGPT, also known as alanine transaminase [ALT]) or serum&#xD;
             glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGOT, also known as aspartate transaminase [AST]) above&#xD;
             2x the upper limit of normal range (ULN) measured at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal function, as shown by, but not limited to serum creatinine &gt; than or =&#xD;
             to 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromol/L) [males] or &gt; than or = to1.4 mg/dL (124 micromol/L)&#xD;
             [females] measured at the screening visit. Mental condition rendering the subject&#xD;
             unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.&#xD;
             Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to&#xD;
             return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who work the night shift.&#xD;
