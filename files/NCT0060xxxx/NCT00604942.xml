      Recent work at St. Thomas' has validated an innovative new design of a multichannel&#xD;
      intraluminal impedance (MII) catheter that is sensitive to variation in oesophageal volume in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients. This project will establish the clinical value of volume&#xD;
      sensitive MII (vMII) compared to conventional MII acquired simultaneously by the same&#xD;
      catheter (ROC analysis). Studies will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The accuracy of volume measurements and correlation between symptoms and the volume of&#xD;
           bolus retention in patients with dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The accuracy of volume measurements and correlation between symptoms and reflux volume&#xD;
           in patients with reflux disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up studies after appropriate treatment will assess whether symptomatic improvement is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in oesophageal volume retention/reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vMII technique will be applied with high resolution manometry (HRM). These investigations&#xD;
      are complementary in that vMII assesses the success or failure of bolus transport (or&#xD;
      occurrence of reflux) and HRM can assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the oesophageal dysfunction that results in bolus escape&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the abnormal events at the gastro-oesophageal junction (reflux barrier) that allow&#xD;
           reflux to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      with a reduction in oesophageal volume retention / reflux.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing problems and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are common in the community&#xD;
      with important effects on health, quality of life and NHS costs. Furthermore, these problems&#xD;
      may explain the increasing rate of oesophageal cancer. These concerns highlight the&#xD;
      importance of appropriate investigation and management of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications that suppress gastric acid relieve symptoms in many patients; however this does&#xD;
      not improve oesophageal function or reduce 'non-acid' reflux from the stomach. At least 1 in&#xD;
      4 patients have symptoms despite treatment and further management of these individuals is&#xD;
      challenging. Conventional multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) studies assess swallowing&#xD;
      function and reflux, but cannot assess volume. This is important because larger volumes of&#xD;
      food stuck in the oesophagus and failure to clear larger amounts of irritant reflux from the&#xD;
      stomach are more likely to cause symptoms and damage to the lining of the oesophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project builds on recent work at St. Thomas' in which a new MII technique was&#xD;
      shown to detect changes in oesophageal volume. The aim is to assess whether this volume&#xD;
      sensitive MII (vMII) is useful in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with swallowing problems and reflux symptoms will undergo vMII and High Resolution&#xD;
      Manometry in unison in a combined Catheter Assembly during a test meal containing barium&#xD;
      (known as videofluoroscopy) as it is visible on x-ray. The volume of fluid stuck in the&#xD;
      oesophagus or refluxing from the stomach will be measured by both vMII and videofluoroscopy&#xD;
      and the problems with motility will be assessed with HRM. The results will be compared and&#xD;
      the link between oesophageal volume, dysmotility and symptoms will be examined. Finally the&#xD;
      studies will be repeated after treatment (videofluoroscopy being offered only males and women&#xD;
      over 40) to see if improvements are linked to reduced volume measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In routine clinical practice, successful vMII would reduce the need for barium swallows&#xD;
      (therefore reducing exposure to radiation) and improve the ability to link oesophageal&#xD;
      dysfunction and reflux events with symptoms, and thus guide further management in patients&#xD;
      that fail to respond to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing measurements of oesophageal function assess the presence or absence of acid (pH),&#xD;
      bolus transport (HRM) or fluid (conventional MII) in the oesophagus, but are not sensitive to&#xD;
      volume change. It is thought that this explains the failure to establish the cause of&#xD;
      oesophageal symptoms in some patients (Sifrim Gut 06). Firstly because retention and reflux&#xD;
      of large volumes in the oesophagus is more likely to cause symptoms. Secondly because&#xD;
      conventional MII lacks sensitivity in patients with poor emptying of residual fluid in the&#xD;
      oesophagus much of the time (e.g. achalasia, post-fundoplication). Volume sensitive MII&#xD;
      (vMII) is a novel adaptation of catheter technology that is sensitive to volume changes in&#xD;
      the oesophagus of healthy volunteers (Fox DDW 06). It is a non disposable catheter which is&#xD;
      3mm in diameter and is very similar to the impedance and pH manometry catheters routinely&#xD;
      used at St Thomas' and many other hospitals and are well tolerated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology Studies will be performed in two, well-defined patient&#xD;
      populations that represent the two cardinal presenting symptoms in oesophageal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) related to achalasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with reflux symptoms referred for consideration of fundoplication. Individuals&#xD;
           (age 18-65 years) referred to the oesophageal laboratory for investigation will be&#xD;
           invited to participate. All participants will undergo complete physical and mental&#xD;
           health questionnaires, and an assessment of predominant complaint and symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test two key issues in order to compare the clinical value of volume&#xD;
      measurements by vMII to existing techniques in these two patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stationary: The accuracy of volume measurements acquired by vMII in patients with&#xD;
           oesophageal disease compared to videofluoroscopy (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ambulatory: The association of volume measurements with symptoms compared to&#xD;
           conventional pH / MII measurements before and after treatment.&#xD;
