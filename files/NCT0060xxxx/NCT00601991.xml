      RATIONALE: Aflibercept may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well aflibercept works in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced refractory, relapsed, or untreated acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rate to aflibercept as a single agent in adult patients with&#xD;
           advanced refractory, relapsed, or untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the 3-month progression-free survival following treatment with at least 4&#xD;
           courses of aflibercept in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is any correlation between pre-treatment expression of VEGFR1 or&#xD;
           VEGFR2 by marrow myeloblasts and disease response to aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) pre-treatment correlates with&#xD;
           disease response to aflibercept, and if any decrease in MVD following treatment&#xD;
           correlates with changes in bone marrow blast percentage (disease response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and circulating endothelial&#xD;
           progenitor cells (EPC) as pharmacodynamic markers of aflibercept activity and possible&#xD;
           correlates of disease response to aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure blood levels of free VEGF versus VEGF bound by aflibercept post-treatment to&#xD;
           determine if the chosen dose of aflibercept is sufficient to bind all detectable soluble&#xD;
           VEGF in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of aflibercept with its associated&#xD;
           interpatient variability and to explore for demographic and clinical covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To derive individual estimates of the duration over which VEGF-saturating aflibercept&#xD;
           concentrations were systematically present and to examine their distribution across the&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the potential relationship between the systemic-free and bound aflibercept&#xD;
           levels and safety and efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo bone marrow and blood sample collection periodically for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are analyzed for peak plasma-free&#xD;
      aflibercept levels after the first infusion, trough plasma-free and bound aflibercept levels&#xD;
      prior to each subsequent infusion and 60 days after the last infusion, and anti-aflibercept&#xD;
      antibody via ELISA methods; circulating endothelial cells (CEC's) via ELISA and flow&#xD;
      cytometry to determine if there is correlation between changes in circulating endothelial&#xD;
      cells and changes in bone marrow blast percentage (i.e., disease response); myeloblast&#xD;
      expression of VEGFR-1 and VRGFR-2 via immunohistochemistry (IHC); endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells colony forming units (EPC-CFU's) to determine via in situ staining if changes in&#xD;
      circulating endothelial progenitors following treatment with aflibercept correlates with&#xD;
      disease response, and if there is a subpopulation of patients identified by pre-treatment&#xD;
      circulating EPC-CFU's that may benefit from aflibercept; and bone marrow microvessel density&#xD;
      (MVD) determination via immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days.&#xD;
