    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of diets with different glycemic load (GL) on&#xD;
      body composition and biochemical markers in overweight and obese subjects during a 12-month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, experimental, parallel design conducted in a group of Mexican&#xD;
      subjects during a 6-month period. Anthropometric and biochemical data will be determined at&#xD;
      0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight or obese adults were assigned into two groups: LGL diet and HGL diet. Subjects who&#xD;
      were pregnant or had diabetes, cancer, psychiatric disorders or physical disabilities were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets and Dietary Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two diets were designed including LGL and HGL diets. GI values of each food were estimated&#xD;
      from the tables by Foster-Powell et al. Daily GL was determined by the product of total&#xD;
      dietary carbohydrate (grams) and GI of each food and adjusted to energetic intake using the&#xD;
      following formulas: GI = Σ (GI of each food X proportion of total carbohydrate contributed&#xD;
      from each food); GL= Σ (GI of each food × grams of total carbohydrate from each food)/1000&#xD;
      kcal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets were designed according to the food habits of Mexicans living in the Tijuana area. On&#xD;
      the first day, subjects received different menus of either LGL or HGL diets, according to the&#xD;
      randomization. A research assistant was available by mail or by phone for questions during&#xD;
      the 6-month period. An e-mail, as a reminder and reinforcement to maintain the diet, was sent&#xD;
      every 2 weeks to all participants. Subjects who completed the 3-day dietary record (two&#xD;
      weekdays and one weekend day) were included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height was measured to the nearest millimeter using a portable stadiometer (model 214 Road&#xD;
      Rod, Seca Corp., Hanover, MD). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic&#xD;
      scale (Bod Pod, Life Measurement Inc., Concord, CA). Subjects were dressed in light clothing&#xD;
      and were not wearing shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
      weight (kg)/height (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the minimum circumference&#xD;
      between the iliac crest and the rib cage. Fat mass (in kg) and total body fat percentage were&#xD;
      measured by plethysmography with the Bod Pod. The subjects entered the Bod Pod wearing a&#xD;
      bodysuit and Lycra hat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood samples were taken at 8 AM from an antecubital vein after a 12-hour overnight&#xD;
      fast, again at baseline and at 3 months after beginning the study. Blood samples were&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3500 × g for 3 minutes, and plasma was removed and analyzed immediately after&#xD;
      collection. For quantitative determination of glucose in serum, the glucose oxidase procedure&#xD;
      based on a modified Trinder method was used (SERA-PAK Plus, Bayer, Sées, France). Serum&#xD;
      insulin levels were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay by the IMMULITE 2000 analyzer&#xD;
      (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was&#xD;
      used to estimate insulin resistance and was computed as follows: (fasting serum insulin&#xD;
      [μU/ml] × fasting plasma glucose [mmol/L]/22.5). Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides were measured by enzymatic methods (SERA-PAK Plus); LDL-cholesterol was&#xD;
      calculated using the Friedwald formula: LDL (mmol/L) = total cholesterol - (TG/2.2) - HDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire containing seven questions from the International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate physical activity at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean ± standard deviations were calculated using descriptive statistics in all variables.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements were evaluated, and it was determined that they did not meet the&#xD;
      normality test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk). To test differences between groups on&#xD;
      biochemical and anthropometric measurements, Mann-Whitney non-parametric test for independent&#xD;
      samples was performed. For comparison of differences before, at 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      intervention in the same treatment group, we used Friedman non-parametric test for repeated&#xD;
      measurements. To test differences between groups on diet intake at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
      the study, Mann-Whitney non-parametric test for independent samples was performed.&#xD;
