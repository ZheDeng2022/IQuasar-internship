  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of IMC-A12 in treating&#xD;
      young patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal&#xD;
      tumor or other solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as IMC-A12, can block cancer growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose of IMC-A12&#xD;
      (cixutumumab) in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors using a limited&#xD;
      dose-escalation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of this drug in children with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in children with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of this drug in children with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors within the confines of a phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain initial phase II efficacy data on the antitumor activity of this drug in&#xD;
      children with Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine change in IGF-IR and insulin receptor (IR) levels and IGF-IR and IR&#xD;
      activation in lymphocytes as biomarkers of IMC-A12 action and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of this drug on circulating levels of proteins involved in linear&#xD;
      growth and glucose homeostasis, including IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-BP3, growth hormone, insulin,&#xD;
      and C-peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To develop exploratory data concerning biomarkers of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      and other correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II,&#xD;
      IGF-BP3, growth hormone, insulin, and C-peptide; trough concentrations and PK sampling; and&#xD;
      biomarkers, including IGF-IR expression and phosphorylation and insulin receptor expression&#xD;
      and phosphorylation via immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting. Tumor tissue samples&#xD;
      from patients with Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET are banked for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.&#xD;
