  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AMES device is designed to produce functional cortical changes by:(1) assisting the&#xD;
      subject as he/she attempts to move the limb (assisted movement) and (2) enhancing movement&#xD;
      sensation by vibrating the muscles during movement (enhanced sensation). The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the combination of assisted movement and enhanced sensation from muscle&#xD;
      vibration can increase the amount of motor recovery in individuals disabled by a stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 700,000 U.S. citizens have a stroke each year with about half ending up with&#xD;
      significant motor disabilities. There are an estimated 5 million stroke survivors in the&#xD;
      U.S., making strokes the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S.. Existing&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapies have not been effective in returning all stroke survivors to full&#xD;
      motor recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AMES device was designed to be able to provide therapy for the ankle joint and the hand&#xD;
      (fingers/wrist). Subjects may qualify for one or two limbs. In this 18 treatment sessions,&#xD;
      double-blinded, control study, AMES therapy will be provided in addition to the usual&#xD;
      physician-ordered rehabilitation during the sub-acute period following a stroke. Those&#xD;
      control subject who complete the Phase 1 placebo sessions will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      cross-over to participate in a AMES treatment group for a Phase 2.&#xD;
