    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy is the most effective method of lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma that&#xD;
      is not well controlled with drop medication. The post-operative wound healing response&#xD;
      remains the major barrier in surgical success. Scar tissue formation results in occlusion of&#xD;
      the surgical drainage site created. As a consequence, the intraocular pressure rises once&#xD;
      again. The current use of anti-scarring agents such as 5 Fluorouracil (5FU), is a well&#xD;
      established method employed by ophthalmologists to clinically reduce the postoperative&#xD;
      scarring response. However, in patients with a high risk of bleb failure, repeated&#xD;
      subconjunctival injections of 5FU following bleb needling is often required resulting in&#xD;
      increased clinical load and patient inconvenience. A slow release formulation of 5FU would be&#xD;
      of benefit by releasing the 5FU into the subconjunctival space over an extended period&#xD;
      thereby providing a prolonged therapeutic effect. In addition, hyaluronic acid is known to&#xD;
      possess antifibrotic properties and from its gel-like physical state, would potentially act&#xD;
      as a physical tissue spacer that may further limit active subconjunctival scarring at the&#xD;
      site where it is injected. We hypothesise that injecting a mixture of 5FU with hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid would give better outcomes than injecting 5FU alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine whether bleb needling with subconjunctival injection of&#xD;
      Viscoelastic/5FU formulation is an effective method for prolonged drug delivery in preventing&#xD;
      the post-operative scarring response. This will be a prospective case-controlled study&#xD;
      involving patients who have already undergone trabeculectomy and who require bleb needling&#xD;
      and subconjunctival 5FU injections.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine whether needling of the conjunctival bleb after&#xD;
      trabeculectomy with subconjunctival injection of a 5 Fluorouracil (5FU)/ viscoelastic&#xD;
      formulation is an effective method for prolonged drug delivery in preventing post-operative&#xD;
      scarring in the conjunctiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Culture Experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell culture experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the hyaluronic acid, at&#xD;
      varying commercially available concentrations, on human Tenon's fibroblasts, the target cell&#xD;
      type of our proposed HA/ 5FU mixture. We also perform tests to examine the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      drug release profiles of the different 5FU/HA formulations. This allowed us to determine the&#xD;
      most effective formulation to use for patients in the clinical arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, human Tenon's fibroblasts attained from tissue explants from cadaver eyes were grown&#xD;
      until confluent in fetal calf serum containing the standard antibiotics for tissue culture,&#xD;
      gentamicin and amphotericin, and placed in an incubator at 37°C under 95% humidity with 5%&#xD;
      CO2. The cells were passaged when confluent and used for experiments between passages 3-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha smooth muscle actin expression Tenon's fibroblasts were seeded on 24 well plates and&#xD;
      incubated in fetal calf serum (FCS) containing the standard antibiotics for tissue culture,&#xD;
      gentamicin and amphotericin, and placed in an incubator at 37°C under 95% humidity with 5%&#xD;
      CO2. The culture medium was removed after 24 hours and replaced with fresh medium described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collagen I production Standard 3-D collagen I gels seeded with fibroblasts for gel&#xD;
      contraction assays were employed to quantify collagen production by fibroblasts treated with&#xD;
      different HA concentrations. Gels treated with TGF beta (a known stimulator for collagen I&#xD;
      synthesis and inducer of alpha smooth muscle actin expression ie myofibroblast phenotype)&#xD;
      acted as positive control. Type I collagen derived from rat tail were mixed with culture&#xD;
      medium and following confluency, trypsinised cells were resuspended in this mixture and cast&#xD;
      in a 24 well plate and allowed to polymerise in an incubator at 37°C. After polymerisation,&#xD;
      the gels were gently detached from the plates in which they are cast and suspended in fresh&#xD;
      medium described below&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Tenon's fibroblasts were cultured in fresh media containing HA alone, 5-FU/HA (HA&#xD;
      concentrations10, 14, 23 mg/ml) or cultured without HA or 5FU (controls). Fibrosis and&#xD;
      scarring response of the myofibroblasts was assessed through Collagen I and alpha smooth&#xD;
      muscle actin (ASMA) expression which were quantified by Real Time -Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR). WST-1 assay determined cell viability. 5-FU solution or powder was dispersed in HA&#xD;
      and mechanically stirred and then vortex mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results showed that HA markedly reduced ASMA and collagen I mRNA expression by&#xD;
      myofibroblasts compared to controls without HA. Treatment with HA following 5FU (10mg/ml)&#xD;
      pretreatment resulted in a greater reduction in ASMA and collagen I expression compared to HA&#xD;
      treatment alone, and statistical significance reached with 23mg/ml HA (p&lt;0.05). Cell&#xD;
      proliferation and viability was not affected by HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team of investigators has completed the experiments examining the release of 5FU from the&#xD;
      5FU/ HA mixture. 5FU solution or powder was mechanically stirred and vortex mixed in HA and&#xD;
      the release of 5FU was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The&#xD;
      concentration of 5FU used was 10mg/ml and the concentration of HA used was 10, 14 and 23&#xD;
      mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5FU/HA mixture delayed drug release to 48 hours, with HA of 14mg/ml and 23mg/ml showing a&#xD;
      greater delay in drug release than 10mg/ml, (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in&#xD;
      rate of drug release between powder and solution form of 5FU although the pH was notably&#xD;
      different ie 6.6 and 10 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our in-vitro studies and drug release assays demonstrate that this 5FU/HA&#xD;
      mixture has the desired therapeutic effect on Human Tenon's myofibroblasts. The optimum&#xD;
      concentration for HA is 23mg/ml and it would be combined with 5FU 10mg/ml. We expect that 5FU&#xD;
      would be released from the mixture over 48 hours; both HA and 5FU will have anti-scarring&#xD;
      effects in the subconjunctival space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited and randomized at the first postoperative visit where a 5-FU&#xD;
      injection is indicated according to clinical parameters indicating active scar formation.&#xD;
      (usually after the first post-operative month when suturelysis has been completed). All post&#xD;
      operative care apart from the 5FU/viscoelastic mixture injection in the control group will be&#xD;
      unchanged from current treatment standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 50 patients who have under gone trabeculectomy at the Singapore National Eye Centre&#xD;
      will be recruited in the study from glaucoma clinics at Singapore National Eye Centre. This&#xD;
      will consist of different types of glaucoma. 25 patients will receive subconjunctival&#xD;
      injection of 5FU after bleb needling while 25 will receive injections of a 5FU/ viscoelastic&#xD;
      formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment and examination at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients (cases and controls) will have the following examination: Snellen visual acuity,&#xD;
      slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, bleb and intraocular pressure measurement with&#xD;
      a Goldmann tonometer. Tonometry will also be performed pre injection using a pneumatonometer&#xD;
      (Reichert) according to manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colour photographs of the bleb will be captured and stored digitally for masked bleb grading.&#xD;
      The Visante OCT will be used to image the bleb morphology in dark conditions. It is a new&#xD;
      non-contact instrument that rapidly obtains high-resolution images of the angle. The image&#xD;
      capture scan takes less than 10 seconds and is akin to taking a photograph. The device allows&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative angle imaging, which is objective and reproducible. This will&#xD;
      take place prior to the needling procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleb needling &amp; subconjunctival injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having taken informed consent from the patient, the patient will be assigned into either the&#xD;
      case or control group. In brief, needling of the conjunctival bleb will be carried out at the&#xD;
      slit lamp using an aseptic technique. The doctor performing the procedure will use sterile&#xD;
      gloves and clean the patient's eyelids and peri-orbital skin with povidone iodine 10%. The&#xD;
      eye will be anaesthetised with Guttae Tetracaine 0.5% and a wire speculum inserted to&#xD;
      separate the eyelids. Povidone iodine is the inserted into the conjunctival sac. 0.1ml of&#xD;
      lignocaine 2% is injected into the subconjunctival space, temporal or nasal to the bleb&#xD;
      before needling of the bleb is performed with a 27 guage needle attached to a 1ml syringe.&#xD;
      5FU solution (10mg/ml) (control arm) or 5FU/viscoelastic formulation (10mg/ml of 5FU in&#xD;
      23mg/ml HA, (50/50) volume/volume) (experimental arm) is injected posterior to the bleb after&#xD;
      needling is complete. Injections are given within the same quadrant as the bleb. Post&#xD;
      injection the conjunctival sac is thoroughly rinsed and re-examined on the slit-lamp. The IOP&#xD;
      is checked at the end of the procedure using the Goldmann tonometer and the pneumotonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive current standard of care with respect to intraoperative antifibrosis&#xD;
      therapy and the timing and frequency of postoperative 5-FU. Further administration of&#xD;
      subconjunctival 5-FU solution or 5FU/HA formulation, (depending on the treatment arm the&#xD;
      patient was initially assigned to) at subsequent office visits will be administered when&#xD;
      required according to current clinical practice for patients in both treatment arms. This&#xD;
      will be recorded in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleb imaging with the Visante anterior segment OCT and IOP measurements will be recorded at&#xD;
      every visit ie week 1, and 12. The need for further needling or other intervention eg&#xD;
      massage/suture removal/lysis (if relevant) will be clinically decided by the ophthalmologist&#xD;
      at each visit and bleb imaging will be performed before any additional procedures perfomed if&#xD;
      it falls on a research visit ie week 1 or 12. Bleb grading from slit lamp photographs will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline pre-injection and at week 12.&#xD;
