      Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease affecting the lungs that is caused by a germ spread by&#xD;
      coughing. TB infection is currently diagnosed by a skin test that has limited accuracy. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to look at the reliability of a new blood test for diagnosing TB&#xD;
      infection in children. Study participants will include 300 HIV-infected (HIV infection is a&#xD;
      viral infection that causes disease which destroys the body's ability to protect itself from&#xD;
      infection and disease.) children and 500 HIV-uninfected children, ages 3 months to 5 years,&#xD;
      residing in the Khayelitsha and Ravensmead/Uitsig Communities of the Western Cape Province,&#xD;
      South Africa. Study procedures will include questionnaires, HIV and TB testing, which will be&#xD;
      performed by blood and skin tests. Participants may be involved in study related procedures&#xD;
      for up to 24 months.&#xD;

      Although widely used, the tuberculin skin test (TST) has limited diagnostic accuracy for&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection. TST sensitivity is particularly limited in&#xD;
      children with compromised immune status due to HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection,&#xD;
      young age and/or severe malnutrition. Very limited data exists regarding the diagnostic&#xD;
      utility of Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) to detect M. tb infection in children. The&#xD;
      proposed study will address major gaps in current knowledge regarding the diagnosis of M. tb&#xD;
      infection in HIV-infected children and may be a powerful tool to spur policy change that&#xD;
      would dramatically improve health in children in countries endemic for tuberculosis (TB) and&#xD;
      HIV. The primary objectives of the study will be to assess the agreement between the TST and&#xD;
      IGRAs in HIV-infected and uninfected children less than or equal to age 5 and to assess the&#xD;
      performance of TST and IGRAs across a standard gradient of M. tb exposure in HIV-infected and&#xD;
      uninfected children less than or equal to age 5. The secondary objectives of the study will&#xD;
      be to measure the impact of potential interaction and confounding variables on the TST and&#xD;
      IGRAs in HIV-infected and uninfected children less than or equal to age 5 and to identify&#xD;
      factors that modify children's response to the TST and IGRAs over time. This study is a&#xD;
      prospective community-based study in a setting highly endemic for HIV and TB, the agreement&#xD;
      between the TST and IGRAs will be assessed in 800 children, ages 3 months to 5 years, and the&#xD;
      influence of M. tb exposure, HIV status, cellular immunity, nutritional status and age&#xD;
      evaluated. Subjects will include HIV-infected (N=300) and uninfected (N=500) children with&#xD;
      variable degrees of M. tb exposure. The inclusion of children with no known household TB&#xD;
      contact will result in a measure of background community M. tb exposure in a setting with&#xD;
      high annual risk of M. tb infection (ARI). Active contact investigation of children exposed&#xD;
      to newly diagnosed adult TB index cases in the household allows for the creation of a&#xD;
      standardized M. tb exposure gradient to serve as a surrogate measure of M. tb infection in&#xD;
      the absence of an existing gold standard. After determination of household membership,&#xD;
      researchers will administer a standard questionnaire, assess M. tb exposure, TB disease and&#xD;
      HIV status, collect approximately 6-8 ml of blood for IGRAs, place a TST (after phlebotomy)&#xD;
      and read the TST at 48-72 hours. In sub-groups of children enrolled during the first 18&#xD;
      months, the TST, IGRAs and measures of cellular immunity will be repeated at 3, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      24-months post enrollment. This study has been designed to meet guidelines for complete and&#xD;
      accurate reporting of studies on diagnostic accuracy. There will be one study site (The&#xD;
      Desmond Tutu TB Center, Stellenbosch University, Tygerberg, Cape Town, South Africa). Study&#xD;
      enrollment will occur over 3 years. The expected duration of subject participation will range&#xD;
      from 2 days to 24 months. The primary (dependent) outcome is M. tb infection as defined by&#xD;
      TST, T. Spot Tb, and Quantiferon-Gold In-tube (QTF) completed at baseline. The secondary&#xD;
      (dependent) outcome is M. tb infection as defined by TST, T. Spot Tb, and QTF completed at 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, and 24 months. The primary independent outcome is M. tb infection as defined by M. tb&#xD;
      contact score. The secondary independent outcome is HIV status, age, nutritional status, and&#xD;
      cellular immunity (CD4 count).&#xD;
