  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether KC706 is effective in the prevention and&#xD;
      healing of blisters in patients with pemphigus vulgaris, while the patient remains on stable&#xD;
      doses of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to follow-up on pre-clinical observations that administration&#xD;
      of KC706 is associated with prevention of the development of lesions in a mouse model of PV.&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will be those with active disease in spite of ongoing&#xD;
      treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The dose chosen for this&#xD;
      clinical study is 300 mg once daily. The primary assessment of interest will be pemphigus&#xD;
      lesion status during dosing with KC706.&#xD;
