  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine microbes (e.g., bacteria, fungi, viruses) that live on human skin and&#xD;
      how microbes contribute to health and disease. It will analyze healthy human skin and how the&#xD;
      these microorganisms might change in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin condition&#xD;
      also known as eczema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers, as well as patients with moderate to severe eczema (AD), between 2 and 40&#xD;
      years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also wish to enroll children and adults aged 2-40 who have been diagnosed with inherited&#xD;
      immune disorders known as HIES (hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome), WAS (Wiskott-Aldrich&#xD;
      syndrome), or DOCK8 immunodeficiency because they frequently have skin problems similar to&#xD;
      AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical family and medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (research blood as well as serum IgE, and complete blood count)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin samples to analyze microbes. Samples are obtained by the following methods:&#xD;
           swabbing the skin with a cotton swab; scraping (scratching) the skin gently with a blade&#xD;
           to remove only the outermost skin layers; and, only in adults, biopsy (surgical removal)&#xD;
           of a small skin sample less than 1/4-inch (5 mm) in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nose swabs to analyze microbes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with eczema may have photographs of their skin taken to help monitor the skin&#xD;
           rashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted periodically for follow-up studies. Patients with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis may have additional skin samples collected to examine changes in the skin bacteria&#xD;
      over time and during all of the stages of eczema. In addition, patients who have a flare of&#xD;
      their eczema are asked to undergo a skin sample collection as soon as possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Skin microbiota (bacteria, fungi, viruses, phage, archae) play a significant role in&#xD;
           common dermatological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis/AD (eczema).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since culture-dependent methods are often biased assessments of microbial diversity,&#xD;
           genomic methods can expand our understanding of the human microbiome and skin diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic dermatitis is typical among rare primary immunodeficiencies: Wiskott-Aldrich&#xD;
           syndrome; hyper-IgE syndrome; and combined immunodeficiency associated with DOCK8&#xD;
           mutation syndrome. The skin disease in these monogenic disorders resembles AD, is&#xD;
           associated with microbial infections, and may provide additional insight into&#xD;
           microbial-host disease interactions.&#xD;
