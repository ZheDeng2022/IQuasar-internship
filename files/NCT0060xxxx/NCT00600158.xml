      Epidural local anesthetics are the gold standard for shortening duration of bowel dysfunction&#xD;
      after bowel surgery. Previous studies suggest that their effect may be in part a result of&#xD;
      actions of the local anesthetic outside the epidural space. If local anesthetics could be&#xD;
      administered intravenously instead, this might be a safer, easier and less expensive&#xD;
      approach. Therefore, this trial will compare the effect on bowel function recovery of&#xD;
      intravenous local anesthetics with those administered epidurally.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ileus seems an almost unavoidable side effect of most types of bowel surgery. This is&#xD;
      unfortunate, since postoperative ileus is not only unpleasant for the patient, but also has&#xD;
      detrimental effects on recovery from surgery. The maintenance of enteral nutrition has been&#xD;
      shown to be an important factor in ensuring rapid recovery from gastrointestinal surgery, as&#xD;
      the catabolic state decreases immune function, delays wound healing, and increases morbidity.&#xD;
      However, ileus often precludes enteral feeding. As a result, duration of postoperative ileus&#xD;
      is frequently a major determinant of duration of hospitalization. At this time, the most&#xD;
      effective manner to minimize the duration of postoperative ileus is the use of continuous&#xD;
      local anesthetic epidural analgesia 3 as confirmed by a systematic review on the topic. This&#xD;
      effect appears specifically related to the use of local anesthetic, as postoperative epidural&#xD;
      administration of opiates alone is without effect on ileus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative ileus is largely inflammatory in origin, and appears to be reduced when&#xD;
      surgical techniques (e.g. minimally invasive approaches) are used that are associated with&#xD;
      less inflammatory responses (as determined from interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels).&#xD;
      The observation that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in reducing the&#xD;
      duration of ileus supports this hypothesis (but these are often avoided because of concern&#xD;
      for bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these findings suggest that epidural analgesia with local anesthetics may&#xD;
      shorten the duration of postoperative ileus because of an anti-inflammatory action of the&#xD;
      local anesthetic. Modulating effects of local anesthetics on the inflammatory system are well&#xD;
      known, and have been described in vitro, in animal studies, and to a lesser extent in&#xD;
      clinical trials. In animals, inflammatory-mediated injury in heart is ameliorated by local&#xD;
      anesthetics, as is endotoxin- or acid-mediated lung injury. In humans, thrombosis incidence11&#xD;
      and hypercoagulation after surgery (both inflammatory-mediated processes) are decreased by&#xD;
      systemic local anesthetics (yet physiologic coagulation is not affected). Important in the&#xD;
      current context, the effectiveness of local anesthetics in the setting of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease is well established. The compounds have been shown to decrease the release of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators from neutrophils, which may play a role in this beneficial effect. As&#xD;
      another example, cognitive deficits after cardiac surgery probably result from a combination&#xD;
      of emboli and the inflammatory response that these induce in the brain. Systemic local&#xD;
      anesthetics would be expected to interfere with both of these processes, and indeed improve&#xD;
      cognitive outcome in this setting.16 The mechanism behind this action is most likely a&#xD;
      modulatory effect of local anesthetics on neutrophils. Local anesthetics have been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit neutrophil priming (a critical component of neutrophil-mediated tissue injury), but&#xD;
      not to interfere with activation (required for wound healing and host defense). Importantly,&#xD;
      and in contrast to classic inflammatory suppression, this inflammatory modulation by local&#xD;
      anesthetics is therefore not associated with detrimental effects on wound healing and&#xD;
      infection rates. We have shown that selective inhibition by local anesthetics of cellular Gq&#xD;
      proteins explains this effect. Other effects, including those on mediator release, may also&#xD;
      play a role. Since epidural anesthesia leads to significant blood levels of local anesthetics&#xD;
      (1 to 5 ÂµM), it is conceivable that the inflammatory modulatory action of systemically&#xD;
      absorbed local anesthetic explains the beneficial effects of epidural analgesia on duration&#xD;
      of postoperative ileus. An additional beneficial effect on return of bowel function will&#xD;
      result from the reduced requirement for opiate analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this is the case, then a similar beneficial effect might be obtained using systemic&#xD;
      administration of local anesthetics. Both the inflammatory modulatory effects and the&#xD;
      analgesic actions (thereby decreasing opiate requirements) are present when these drugs are&#xD;
      given intravenously. This approach would have significant advantages over epidural&#xD;
      administration. The common use of perioperative anticoagulation for the prevention of deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis has made appropriate timing of epidural placement and removal considerably&#xD;
      more difficult. Epidural placement and management costs time and adds expense. Many patients&#xD;
      may not desire the placement of an epidural catheter. In addition, the uncommon but real&#xD;
      risks of epidural placement (certainly in the thoracic region) would be avoided by systemic&#xD;
      administration of the local anesthetic. The major risks are epidural hematoma or abscess,&#xD;
      both of which can be devastating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials indicate that systemic local anesthetics have beneficial actions on&#xD;
      the return of bowel function after surgery. In patients undergoing radical prostatectomy,&#xD;
      administration of lidocaine (3 mg/min) for the duration of surgery and 1 h postoperatively&#xD;
      resulted in a 1 day earlier return of bowel function and an associated earlier discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital as compared with placebo. Significantly earlier return of propulsive motility in&#xD;
      the colon was also observed in patients undergoing cholecystectomy who received intravenous&#xD;
      lidocaine (3 mg/min intraoperatively and continued 24 h post surgery). Similarly,&#xD;
      intraoperative instillation of bupivacaine demonstrated beneficial effects on colonic&#xD;
      motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study has investigated the effect on postoperative bowel function of systemically&#xD;
      administered local anesthetic after bowel surgery. It is in this setting that restoration of&#xD;
      bowel function is most relevant. We hypothesize that intravenous, intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative administration of local anesthetic, added to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)&#xD;
      for post-operative pain relief, will result in more rapid return of bowel function as&#xD;
      compared with PCA alone. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized, blinded, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients undergoing open colectomy for tumor.&#xD;
