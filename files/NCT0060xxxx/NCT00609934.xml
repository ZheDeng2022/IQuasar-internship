  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a new anti-angiogenic drug called&#xD;
      sorafenib, in combination with radiotherapy, for renal cell cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      bone and is causing significant pain. The study will find a safe dose of sorafenib for this&#xD;
      combination study treatment, look at side effects, and test if the study treatment is&#xD;
      effective in controlling the pain experienced from this type of renal cell cancer. . There&#xD;
      will be two parts or phases to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the first phase is to find the highest dose of sorafenib that can be given&#xD;
      safely to patients, when combined with radiotherapy. We will also see what kind of effects&#xD;
      the study treatment has on you and your cancer. Participants in this phase will receive a&#xD;
      dose of sorafenib that has shown to be well-tolerated in humans. If the side effects are&#xD;
      tolerable for this dose of sorafenib when combined with radiotherapy, new patients will be&#xD;
      asked to join the study and will receive a dose of sorafenib higher than the last study&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, new study participants will receive the dose of sorafenib that was&#xD;
      determined to be safe in the first phase. Side effects will continue to be looked at and the&#xD;
      effectiveness on controlling pain symptoms from this type of cancer, will also be looked at.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eligible patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic RCC&#xD;
             that is judged to be incurable with standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have at least one radiographically-evident symptomatic (&gt; 2/10 on the&#xD;
             Brief Pain Inventory) bone metastasis that is amenable to palliative radiation.&#xD;
             Multiple symptomatic bone metastases may be irradiated at the same time. However, if&#xD;
             more than one symptomatic bone metastasis is identified, one will be chosen as the&#xD;
             index lesion for reporting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No planned change in analgesic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No planned increase in regular analgesic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No prior surgery to the index lesion, although previous surgery for other metastatic&#xD;
             disease is permissible if &gt; 4 weeks prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients may have had up to two previous lines of systemic treatment for metastatic&#xD;
             RCC, including prior treatment with sorafenib or another similar multi-targeted&#xD;
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor, if completed &gt;4 weeks prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients may not have had previous radiotherapy to the index lesion. Patients may have&#xD;
             had previous radiotherapy to other metastases if completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             registration. Patients must have recovered from the acute side effects of radiotherapy&#xD;
             prior to study registration.&#xD;

             normal values (range of 5-208 U/L) xi. Serum amylase, normal values (range 30-110 U/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
             Effective methods of birth control would include a barrier method (e.g. condoms,&#xD;
             diaphragm) combined with spermicide, or an intrauterine device (IUD). Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serious medical condition that might be aggravated by treatment, including but not&#xD;
             limited to: myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina, active cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, uncontrolled psychotic disorders, serious infections, active peptic&#xD;
             ulcer disease, active liver disease, or cerebrovascular disease with previous stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent concurrently or within 4&#xD;
             weeks of study registration. Patients receiving other molecularly-targeted treatments&#xD;
             for RCC off of study, including inhibitors of angiogenesis or mTOR, will be eligible&#xD;
             for this study after a 1 week wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
