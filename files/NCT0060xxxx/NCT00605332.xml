&#xD;
          2. Patient is considered a candidate for the IVCF under one of the following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Proven PE&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraindication to anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to achieve/maintain therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Iliocaval DVT&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Large, free-floating proximal (i.e. ileofemoral) DVT&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Massive PE treated with thrombolysis/thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic PE treated with thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Protection during thrombolysis for iliocaval DVT&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PE with limited cardiopulmonary reserve&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor compliance with anticoagulant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High risk of injury worsened by anticoagulation (e.g., ataxia, falls)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Multi-trauma patient with high risk of PE&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgical patients at high risk of PE&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medical condition with high risk of PE&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a vena cava diameter of 17-28mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient or legal guardian has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees&#xD;
             to its provisions and has provided informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is willing to be available for the appropriate follow-up for the duration&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has suitable IVC anatomy that would allow infra-renal placement of the&#xD;
             filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have ANY of the following exclusion criteria are NOT eligible for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IVC thrombosis extending to renal veins&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Duplicate IVC&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gonadal vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requires supra-renal filter placement&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has an uncontrolled infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is at risk for aseptic PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has uncontrollable coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has an existing IVCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has a condition that inhibits radiographic visualization of the IVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or&#xD;
             Nitinol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to contrast which cannot be pre-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient's access vessels preclude safe insertion of the delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient is participating in another device or drug study. Patient must have&#xD;
             completed the follow- up phase of any previous study at least 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment into this trial. The patient may only be enrolled in this study once.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient is unable and/or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures or required&#xD;
