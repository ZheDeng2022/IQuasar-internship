  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are a group of medications that are used to lower cholesterol levels. Although&#xD;
      serious side effects are rare, some people taking statins experience muscle pain or weakness.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the number of people who experience mild muscle complaints and will&#xD;
      determine the effect of statins on skeletal muscle strength, endurance, and aerobic exercise&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins are the most effective medications for reducing high cholesterol levels. They are&#xD;
      extremely well tolerated by the majority of people but can produce a variety of&#xD;
      muscle-related side effects in some people. Of these side effects, the most serious is&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis, which involves muscle fiber damage that can begin as muscle pain and progress&#xD;
      to a loss of muscle cells, kidney failure, and death. While rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare,&#xD;
      some people experience the more common muscle-related side effects of statins, such as muscle&#xD;
      pain (known as &quot;myalgia&quot;), cramps, and weakness. These more common side effects warrant&#xD;
      attention because they may limit the use of statins, affect mobility, and increase the risk&#xD;
      of injury in older individuals. Also, the term &quot;muscle weakness,&quot; often used by patients and&#xD;
      their doctors, is not well defined and can refer to a wide range of complaints from simple&#xD;
      fatigue to an actual inability to perform activities of daily living. It is important to&#xD;
      describe and quantify in more detail the muscle-related side effects associated with statins.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of statin-induced mild muscle&#xD;
      complaints and to determine the effect of statins on skeletal muscle strength, endurance, and&#xD;
      aerobic exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy people who have never received statin medications. First,&#xD;
      participants will attend three study visits over a period of 2 weeks. These study visits will&#xD;
      include blood collection, questionnaires on physical activity and pain, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, and body measurements, including height, weight, and head circumference.&#xD;
      Participants will also complete two cardiopulmonary exercise stress tests on a treadmill and&#xD;
      will undergo arm and leg strength testing. Some participants may undergo a muscle biopsy.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either 80 mg of atorvastatin or&#xD;
      placebo on a daily basis for 6 months. Blood will be collected again at Month 3. At Month 6,&#xD;
      participants will attend two study visits for repeat baseline measurements. All participants&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone every other week during the 6-month treatment period to monitor&#xD;
      adverse events and medication compliance.&#xD;
