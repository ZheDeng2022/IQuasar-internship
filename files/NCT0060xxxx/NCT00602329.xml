      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab&#xD;
      may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving&#xD;
      bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help&#xD;
      plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well MRI works in predicting response&#xD;
      to combination chemotherapy given together with bevacizumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the alteration of tumor blood flow using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
           after 2 courses of combination chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and&#xD;
           leucovorin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg or FOLFOX alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate tumor blood flow, as assessed by DCE-MRI, with time to progression in&#xD;
           patients receiving bevacizumab at 5mg/kg vs 10mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate vascular proliferation, as measured by DCE-MRI, with markers of endothelial&#xD;
           cell proliferation (i.e., CD31, 34, 105; integrin αvß3; phospho-ERK; Ki67; PCNA; and&#xD;
           smooth muscle actin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain pilot data on whether assays that measure vascular endothelial cell mitogenic&#xD;
           stimulation and mitogenic activity may predict response to therapy, time to progression,&#xD;
           and overall survival of patients receiving bevacizumab at 5mg/kg vs 10mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association of various markers of apoptosis in tumor cells (e.g.,&#xD;
           MIF, CREB, or HIF-1-alpha expression/polymorphism and others) and tumor vascularity, as&#xD;
           assessed by DCE-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate markers of apoptosis in tumor cells with response to therapy, time to&#xD;
           progression, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine serum levels of VEGF prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and then prior&#xD;
           to courses 2 and 3 of chemotherapy as potential markers of antiangiogenic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients who are eligible to receive bevacizumab are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms. Patients who are ineligible to receive bevacizumab receive FOLFOX alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and oxaliplatin IV over 2&#xD;
           hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours (FOLFOX) beginning on day&#xD;
           1. Patients also receive bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
           repeats every 14 days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive FOLFOX as in arm I and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg IV over 90&#xD;
           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLFOX alone (control): Patients receive FOLFOX as in arm I. All patients undergo&#xD;
           dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and between courses 2 and 3 (between days 17&#xD;
           and 29) to assess tumor blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue specimens are obtained from prior colonoscopic biopsy or surgical resection in&#xD;
      patients receiving bevacizumab. Tissue specimens are examined by immunohistochemistry to&#xD;
      evaluate tumor markers of angiogenesis and apoptosis (e.g., CD31, 34, 105, phospho-ERK, PCNA,&#xD;
      Ki67, SMA, and integrin αvß3). Blood specimens are obtained at baseline and prior to courses&#xD;
      2 and 3 (days 15 and 29) to evaluate plasma levels of VEGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
