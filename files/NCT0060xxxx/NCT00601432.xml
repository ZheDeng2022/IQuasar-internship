  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of food on the single-dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of an oral solution of levofloxacin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-dose study conducted at a single center, the effect of food on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin was studied in 24 healthy men and women aged 18 to 55 years&#xD;
      old. Subjects were assigned different treatments based on chance; both the researcher and the&#xD;
      study participant knew the treatment being administered. The study consisted of 3 phases: a&#xD;
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods, and a&#xD;
      post-treatment phase. Subjects who met the prestudy eligibility criteria were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequence groups. In each treatment period, subjects were&#xD;
      admitted to the study facility the evening before study drug administration and housed&#xD;
      through 48 hours after dosing with study drug. Subjects received levofloxacin as a single&#xD;
      oral dose of 500 mg under both fed (within 10 minutes after completion of a high-fat,&#xD;
      high-caloric breakfast) and fasted (10-hour overnight fast) conditions according to their&#xD;
      randomized treatment sequence. Each dosing day was separated by a washout period of at least&#xD;
      4 days. In each treatment period, pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected immediately&#xD;
      prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hours&#xD;
      after dosing for determination of plasma concentrations of levofloxacin. Safety evaluations,&#xD;
      including adverse event monitoring, standard clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology,&#xD;
      serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign monitoring, and physical examinations were&#xD;
      performed on Days 1 and 3 of each treatment period. The post-treatment phase consisted of&#xD;
      safety evaluations performed after collection of the final pharmacokinetic blood sampling in&#xD;
      the second treatment period. Adverse events were monitored from the time of the first&#xD;
      study-related procedure through completion of post-treatment study procedures, or until the&#xD;
      time of early withdrawal from the study. Levofloxacin solution administered as 2 single oral&#xD;
      doses of 500 mg each, 1 in each treatment period, administered at least 4 days apart.&#xD;
