      RATIONALE: Educating health providers on talking with cancer patients about complementary and&#xD;
      alternative medicine (CAM) may help encourage health providers to talk more often with cancer&#xD;
      patients about the use of CAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well an education intervention works&#xD;
      in encouraging health providers to talk with cancer patients about the use of CAM.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the efficacy of an education intervention designed to increase the frequency&#xD;
           with which health providers ask cancer patients about their use of complimentary and&#xD;
           alternative medicine (CAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the frequency with which health providers ask about CAM use and referral for CAM&#xD;
           use by health providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether personal CAM use among health providers is related to the frequency of&#xD;
           asking patients about CAM use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the frequency and type of CAM use among patients diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Stratification is based on the number of health&#xD;
      providers at each CCOP component site (&lt; 3 health providers per component site vs 3 to 6&#xD;
      health providers per component site vs 7 to 9 health providers per component site vs 10 or&#xD;
      more health providers per component site). The CCOP component sites are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (intervention): Health providers receive educational materials comprising a brief&#xD;
           video about communicating with and providing guidance to patients regarding&#xD;
           complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) and a list of resources they can access to&#xD;
           obtain information about herbs, CAM modalities, and drug/herb interactions.&#xD;
           Approximately 2 weeks after the educational intervention, health providers receive a&#xD;
           follow-up e-mail reminding them to ask patients about CAM use. The e-mail also includes&#xD;
           a brief update regarding current research findings on CAM modalities and drug/herb&#xD;
           interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (wait-list): Health providers are enrolled on a wait-list. After 2 months, the&#xD;
           educational materials in arm I are made available to the wait-list health providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health providers in both arms complete questionnaires at baseline and at 2 months to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the educational intervention, personal CAM use, and level of knowledge&#xD;
      about CAM and to determine if they are asking patients about CAM use. Patients of the health&#xD;
      providers also complete questionnaires at the same time points to assess personal CAM use&#xD;
      before and after cancer diagnosis as well as the level of their interaction with health&#xD;
      providers regarding CAM use.&#xD;
