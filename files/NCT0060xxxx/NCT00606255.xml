      Study Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, chronic disease without symptoms such as hypertension, the treatment compliance&#xD;
      is relative low and is difficult to increase. The low compliance is related to poor&#xD;
      prognosis. There are many factors that effect to compliance of antihypertensive drug.&#xD;
      Education is one factor that can be controlled by doctors. Therefore, in this study, the&#xD;
      compliance of the patients in 3 groups of active training group, passive training group, and&#xD;
      no training group (usual treatment group) will be compared to evaluate the effect of training&#xD;
      for controlling of hypertension.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective - The compliance of each group for the antihypertensive drug is evaluated&#xD;
      and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are allocated to three groups; active training group, passive training group, no&#xD;
      training group (usual treatment group) and training is performed as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active training group: Electronic Pill-Boxes with SMS service 1/week, training material&#xD;
           provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive training group: Electronic Pill-Boxes ,Training material provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual treatment group: Electronic Pill-Boxes, maintain current treatment method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate other factor that has effect on the compliance of antihypertensive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the blood pressure lowering effect according to the compliance of&#xD;
           antihypertensive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the percentage of missed doses, the percentage of delayed doses, the percentage&#xD;
           of multiple doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of education on the compliance of antihypertensive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timelines FPFV : Jan, 2008 LPLV: Dec. 2008&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is multi center, prospective, randomized, open, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to compare the compliance for antihypertensive drugs according to different&#xD;
      method of patient training and the observation period per patient is 6 month. There is no&#xD;
      fixed visit date and the visits are made according to patient's periodic treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To come up with representative and reliable nation wide statistical data, from hospitals&#xD;
      nation wide patient who receive drugs (ACE-I, ARB, β-Blocker, CCB, Diuretic) for blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering purpose according to the prescription patterns of investigator will be&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers &amp; patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. of centers: 20 general hospitals No. of patients: 1,062 patients&#xD;
