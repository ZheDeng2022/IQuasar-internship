  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether computer-driven protocolized weaning is&#xD;
      superior to physician-directed non-protocolized weaning in over-24-hours-ventilated surgical&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The main hypothesis was that weaning duration differs&#xD;
      between both methods. Secondary hypotheses were that reintubation rate, duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and workload for physicians&#xD;
      and nurses differ between both methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since long-term mechanical ventilation is affiliated with a bunch of complications, weaning&#xD;
      affected patients from ventilation as soon as possible is a crucial point. In this context&#xD;
      automated computerized systems have become a torchbearer. These systems are expected to&#xD;
      expedite the weaning process, reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of&#xD;
      stay of a given patient in comparison to conventional physician-directed weaning. A&#xD;
      multicenter randomized trial by Lellouche et al supported these theories, using a&#xD;
      computer-driven system to regulate Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). This system is now&#xD;
      commercially available as SmartCare/PS (Draeger Medical AG &amp; Co. KG, Luebeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study on hand was to find out whether the results reported before could be&#xD;
      repeated in a broad, surgical ICU patient group. Study design was chosen similar. In addition&#xD;
      we investigated the workload for physicians and nurses in both study arms which has not been&#xD;
      conducted before.&#xD;
