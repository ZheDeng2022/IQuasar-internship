      This study will test whether pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos (Registered Trademark)&#xD;
      Registered Trademark) is effective for treating patients with asthma who do not respond to&#xD;
      standard therapy. Experiments have shown that this drug, which is used to treat patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, may be effective for treating asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 75 years of age who have had asthma for at least a1 year and whose&#xD;
      symptoms are not well controlled with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids with or without&#xD;
      long-acting bronchodilators may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with&#xD;
      breathing tests, an allergy skin test, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ultrasound test of the heart), blood tests, and DEXA scan (an x-ray to measure bone&#xD;
      thickness) to make sure they are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants undergo tests and procedures in the following study phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are given a device to measure and record their lung function and asthma symptoms&#xD;
      at home each morning and night for 4 weeks before starting the study medication. Lung&#xD;
      function is also measured at clinic visits before and after inhaling a bronchodilator&#xD;
      medicine. Before starting the study medication, participants have a sputum induction (sputum&#xD;
      collection test). For this test, the participants inhale a salt-water mist and are asked to&#xD;
      collect sputum into a plastic cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly selected to receive either pioglitazone hydrochloride or placebo (a&#xD;
      look-alike pill with no active ingredient) once a day for 10 weeks. They return to the clinic&#xD;
      after 2 weeks to repeat the tests done in Phase 1 and to monitor any reactions to the study&#xD;
      drug or placebo. If there are no problems, the amount of medication is increased once, and&#xD;
      then they return for follow-up evaluations every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests, sputum collection and DEXA scan are repeated after 10 weeks on medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return for follow-up 1 month after stopping the medication or placebo to monitor&#xD;
      their asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New therapies are needed for patients with asthma who are suboptimally controlled by standard&#xD;
      measures. Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos [R]) is a highly selective and potent agonist for&#xD;
      the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). Studies in murine models&#xD;
      of allergic asthma have shown that PPAR gamma-agonists down-regulate allergen-mediated airway&#xD;
      inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This protocol is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group (phase II) pilot study of the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of pioglitazone for the treatment of patients with allergic asthma and reversible&#xD;
      airflow obstruction who are persistently symptomatic despite therapy with high doses of&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting Beta 2-agonists. The primary end-point&#xD;
      for this study will be the change in airflow obstruction, as measured by the&#xD;
      post-bronchodilator FEV1. Secondary end-points will include indices of airway inflammation,&#xD;
      airflow obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and asthma symptoms.&#xD;
