      Project: Assessment of the safety of dietary supplement lactobacillus fermented extract in&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea and vomiting are significant causes of nutritional depletion and result in further&#xD;
      deterioration of the physical and mental status. Support of gastrointestinal function may&#xD;
      alleviate nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy and will not only reduce the discomfort&#xD;
      experienced by the patient but will allow better tolerance of the treatment. This study will&#xD;
      assess orally administered Seigen alpha EV during chemotherapy for its safety and effects on&#xD;
      the nutritional depletion deriving from the chemotherapy. It will also look at its effect on&#xD;
      the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Randomization and Treatment: The subjects will be distributed in each of the three cancer&#xD;
      categories (breast, lung, and colon), and randomized on centralized randomization lists for&#xD;
      each of the cancer categories and assigned a unique identification number in the temporal&#xD;
      order of recruitment. Using randomization with the minimization method, subjects will be&#xD;
      allocated to treatment or placebo, 15 each for the treatment group or the placebo group, for&#xD;
      a total of 30 subjects in each of the 3 cancers. This study utilizes a double-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo: The placebo is identical in packaging and appearance to the treatment.&#xD;
      Identification of placebo vs. Seigen alpha EV is by unique packaging code. Patients and study&#xD;
      doctors are blinded to the identification interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Treatment will be for a maximum of 3 months. The dosage of the study supplement is&#xD;
      as follows: Subjects will be instructed to take 1 packet (6 grams) 3 times daily for a total&#xD;
      daily dosage of 3 packets (18 grams). Each packet is clearly marked for breakfast, lunch, or&#xD;
      supper. The contents of the packet will be dissolved in water or liquid and taken orally&#xD;
      morning, noon, and evening. Subjects will be required to return any unused packets to study&#xD;
      doctor at the end of each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual clinical tests for therapeutic monitoring of usual treatment of patient will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, quantitative and qualitative parameters will be measured at start of treatment&#xD;
      and at 1, 2, and 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toxicity assessments using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC):&#xD;
           total WBC, total lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
           diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, anorexia, urticaria, fatigue, muscle weakness&#xD;
           and headache. (Refer to Document 1 Toxicity Assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-assessment of quality of life will be performed using European Organization for&#xD;
           Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (version 3). The treating physician&#xD;
           will summarize the patient quality of life by using the Karnofsky performance scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Additional blood test for 10 colon CA subjects (5 treatment, 5 placebo ) Molecular&#xD;
           marker NFÎºB mediated signal transduction pathway genes (n=84) will be measured on 10&#xD;
           subjects with colon cancer. A sample of no less than 5 ml using PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes&#xD;
           (Qiagen, Cat. No. 762115) will be collected from each subject. Shipment overnight on at&#xD;
           least 10 lbs of ice block (blue or wet) to SuperArray Bioscience in Frederick, MD 21704.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and repeated at one, two and three months.&#xD;
