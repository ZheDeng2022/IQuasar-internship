    <textblock>
      The parathyroid gland and its hormone have a major impact on the endocrine control of bone&#xD;
      metabolism and mineralization and parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been identified in some&#xD;
      epidemiological reports to relate adversely to mortality. Previously, the applicant has&#xD;
      demonstrated in two models that dietary cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)&#xD;
      reduces PTH by over 30% in as little as 4 weeks in male rats without adversely affecting bone&#xD;
      density. Both bioactive PTH and intact PTH assays have been used and both are reduced by CLA.&#xD;
      In one rat model, rats had normal PTH and a sub-group had high PTH due to chronic renal&#xD;
      disease. In the second study, the rats were healthy young males and females. Regardless of&#xD;
      the model and health state, PTH was reduced 30 to 40% by CLA. Of interest, other isoforms of&#xD;
      CLA such as trans-10, cis-12 CLA do not alone result in reduced PTH. The selected CLA isomer&#xD;
      proven to reduce PTH, cis-9, trans 11 CLA, is common to food products such as milk fat and&#xD;
      beef and is thus more physiologically relevant to the human diet. The global objective of&#xD;
      this study is to, for the first time; assess the effects of CLA on PTH in humans,&#xD;
      specifically men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men 19-53 years of age are selected since bone mass will have reached a peak by this&#xD;
      age. Beginning with healthy relatively young men is important versus aging or ill individuals&#xD;
      since the effect of CLA on PTH has not been examined and aging and illness might confound the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited using posters and local newspaper advertisements from the general&#xD;
      population. Men (n=30/group) with healthy weights will be randomized to receive 0, 1.5 or 3 g&#xD;
      CLA/d for a period of 4 months. At baseline, body weight will be assessed along with whole&#xD;
      body bone, lean and fat mass using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Regional bone mass&#xD;
      (lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck) will also be examined using DXA. A blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken in the fasted state between 9:00 and 10:00 to examine PTH, ionized Ca, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of bone metabolism. After each 1 month on the study, the measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated until end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake will be monitored along with a survey for possible mild side-effects such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort. Data will be examined using a mixed model for random (age,&#xD;
      weight, vitamin D status) and fixed effects (diet, time) with post-hoc comparisons using&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction.&#xD;

      EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS The global objective of this study is to, for the first time; assess the&#xD;
      effects of CLA on PTH in humans, specifically men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives and Hypotheses, in healthy men 40 years of age are to determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cis-9, trans-11 CLA reduces PTH;&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. it is hypothesized that CLA will reduce PTH by 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect is transient; b. it is hypothesized that PTH will fall within 4 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment and remain stable thereafter over the 4 months of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Short-term changes in bone metabolism accompany reductions in PTH following dietary&#xD;
           intake of CLA; c. it is hypothesized that bone resorption will be reduced as indicated&#xD;
           by resorption markers and the ratio of osteoprotegerin to RANKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective and Hypothesis is to determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Dietary CLA and plasma CLA at baseline are related to bone mass and metabolism;&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. it is hypothesized that higher dietary intakes of CLA and higher plasma CLA will be&#xD;
      associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) and lower bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods Population: Healthy men 19 to 53 years of age are selected&#xD;
      since bone mass will have reached a peak by this age. Beginning with healthy relatively young&#xD;
      men parallels the observations from the animal studies in male rats that were at an age when&#xD;
      peak bone mass was already achieved (5 mo). These participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Greater Montreal area; primarily the Macdonald Campus of McGill University and also through&#xD;
      announcements made in the local newspapers (West Island Gazette). All study visits will take&#xD;
      place at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, School of Dietetics and Nutrition&#xD;
      (Directed by Dr. Weiler).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be 90 healthy men (n=30/group) based on the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      healthy body weight based on body mass index (18.5 - 25 kg/m2 as per Health Canada (50)), no&#xD;
      chronic diseases, normal bone mass for age (ie Z-score better than -1 where reference data&#xD;
      available), and vitamin D status within optimal range based on serum 25(OH)D (between 50 and&#xD;
      80 nmol/L of serum 25(OH)D with a median threshold of 75 nmol/L as set by international&#xD;
      experts (24)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D status will be an inclusion criterion since seasonal changes in vitamin D status&#xD;
      will alter PTH. Participants who meet the entry criteria upon screening must also continue to&#xD;
      meet the entry criteria 1 month later when the supplementation begins (see figure 3 for flow&#xD;
      diagram of study time-line for year 1). This is important as related to vitamin D status and&#xD;
      possible interactions with PTH. The error of the vitamin D assay is &lt;10%. Thus measurements&#xD;
      at baseline within 10% of the screening value will enable continuance in the study. To ensure&#xD;
      that the median threshold is maintained, screening will be set at 75 nmol/L of 25(OH)D and&#xD;
      values &gt;10 nmol/L will be accepted at inception. This will accommodate the range set for&#xD;
      optimal vitamin D status and is thus 65 nmol/L and up in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: In May and June of 2008 potential participants will be initially screened by&#xD;
      telephone for health status, self-reported body weight and height and age. Upon meeting these&#xD;
      criteria they will be asked to fast beginning the evening prior to the screening visit (12 h)&#xD;
      that will include measurement of body weight, height and bone mass using dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) to provide whole body and regional bone mass (lumbar spine, total hip,&#xD;
      femoral neck) and a general health assessment by the study physicians. At this visit a 5 ml&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken between 9 and 10 am to screen for 25(OH)D concentration. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that in May-June the 25(OH)D will be within the targeted range in 50-75% of&#xD;
      people screened based on the data of Looker et al for US men in northern latitudes in summer&#xD;
      where mean values were 79 nmol/L in the northern attitude group of men 40 to 49 years of age&#xD;
      (51). Those meeting criteria will be invited to participate in the trial for which men will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive 0, 1.5 or 3 g CLA/d for a period of 4 months beginning in ~June of&#xD;
      each year; half of the sample will be recruited each year to enable the monthly assessments&#xD;
      accompanied by rapid measurement of CLA. Dietary assessment using a 24-hour food recall will&#xD;
      establish typical intakes of CLA prior to baseline sampling by mailing the record a week in&#xD;
      advance, followed by supplementation. At baseline, body weight and height will be measured&#xD;
      along with DXA assessment of whole body and regional bone mass (lumbar spine, forearm, total&#xD;
      hip, femoral neck). A food frequency questionnaire will be given to assess the relationship&#xD;
      between CLA in the diet, CLA status and bone descriptively. A blood sample will be taken in&#xD;
      the fasted state between 9:00 and 10:00 to examine PTH, ionized Ca, and markers of bone&#xD;
      metabolism including osteocalcin (formation), osteoprotegerin, RANKL and N-telopeptide&#xD;
      (resorption) and CLA in plasma and red cell membranes. This sampling time will accommodate&#xD;
      the nadir in PTH as well as permit assessment of biomarkers of bone metabolism at a&#xD;
      standardized am time. The measurements (except for the DXA) will be repeated monthly until&#xD;
      end of study. Dietary intake will be monitored each month using a 24-hour food recall prior&#xD;
      to each visit to enable clarifications in person. A survey for mild side-effects such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort will be conducted at each visit along with collection of all&#xD;
      supplements not taken to estimate compliance. Since participants will be fasting for each&#xD;
      visit, a small snack will be provided as tetra pack milk and a bagel after the measurements&#xD;
      (under general supplies in budget). Participants will be asked to not exercise prior to the&#xD;
      visit since moderately intense activity can elevate PTH (52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of Methodology Dietary Supplementation Approach: All supplements and placebo will be&#xD;
      double-blinded by use of letter coding. Only the safety officer will know the treatment&#xD;
      groups. Each participant will take the required number of placebo and/or CLA capsules with&#xD;
      each lunch and dinner meal and be provided enough for one month at a time. At each visit all&#xD;
      unused capsules will be recovered for compliance assessment and a new supply provided for the&#xD;
      next month of study. Participants will be asked to maintain their current diet to prevent&#xD;
      changes in body weight and body composition and also will be asked to keep their activity as&#xD;
      constant as possible over the duration of study, also to keep body weight and composition&#xD;
      constant as well as maintain weight bearing activities on bone. Diet will not be modified in&#xD;
      this study, but rather monitored. At the screening assessment, a registered dietitian (3 RDs&#xD;
      in Dr. Weiler's training program are available to provide this assessment) will provide all&#xD;
      participants an assessment of current and usual intake against recommendations and then guide&#xD;
      them on how to keep the diet both within recommendations and usual intakes. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed on what amounts of and types of snack foods will be permitted the evening prior&#xD;
      to fasting. Of note, calcium intake in Montreal men is typically close to recommendations&#xD;
      with ~80% achieving calcium intake at the recommended level (53, 54).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplements will be Clarinol A95 (Lipid Nutrition) that is in free fatty acid form with&#xD;
      80% of the CLA in the cis-9, trans-11 form and 20% in the trans-10, cis-12 isoform; this is&#xD;
      the purest CLA available. Using supplements for this study is rationalized in order to follow&#xD;
      the approach from the basic studies rather than food products enriched with CLA; ie, use&#xD;
      diets with the supplemental CLA as used in the rodent study. Each supplement will be designed&#xD;
      to provide half of the CLA dosage per meal. In this manner the 1.5 group will have capsules&#xD;
      containing 0.75 g of CLA with the remaining weight comprised of placebo olive oil. For the 3&#xD;
      g group, the CLA capsules will contain 1.5 g CLA. The placebo capsules will be olive oil.&#xD;
      Each person will be asked to take one half-dose at lunch and one half-dose at dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and Supplement Intake: will be assessed at each visit using a 24-hour food recall.&#xD;
      The data will be used to describe the intakes of the population with respect to total energy,&#xD;
      macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate) and micronutrients (Ca, P, Zn, Mg, vitamin D)&#xD;
      that relate to bone and PTH metabolism. The food intake for the day prior to blood sampling&#xD;
      is also important to establish the possible effects of an evening meal or snack prior to&#xD;
      fasting for the am blood sampling. For example if the snack was high in calcium or if the&#xD;
      participant did not eat the usual intake etc. values for PTH could be falsely low. The&#xD;
      three-day record is selected to better assess intakes and is validated against plasma samples&#xD;
      measured for CLA (5, 56). The dietary intake will have less of an impact on the plasma CLA&#xD;
      after inception but the dietary intake of CLA is a necessary assessment to demonstrate&#xD;
      sources of dietary CLA and to quantify total dietary CLA and enhance understanding of the&#xD;
      plasma CLA values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Procurement: Blood will be collected at all visits between 9:00 and 10:00 to control&#xD;
      for diurnal variation permitting 3 to 4 participants to be seen in our Unit daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects and Safety Monitoring: At each visit, participants will be asked using a&#xD;
      check-box questionnaire if they experienced any illness or been treated for acute illnesses.&#xD;
      Frequency of headaches, dizziness, constipation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or&#xD;
      abdominal pain will be documented. Any abnormal value will initiate a second sampling. Upon&#xD;
      confirmation of abnormal values, the participant will be asked to stop taking the CLA&#xD;
      supplement and have a subsequent blood sample taken at a follow-up visit to evaluate return&#xD;
      of ionized Ca and PTH to expected values and they will fall into the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      statistical analysis arm of the study. Blood pressure will be measured using standard radial&#xD;
      cuff and sphygmomanometer and in supine position immediately following the DXA as part of the&#xD;
      general health assessment.&#xD;
