  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Conor&#xD;
      Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System in the treatment of coronary artery disease (a single&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesion) in native coronary arteries. The study will evaluate the outcomes of&#xD;
      a new drug-eluting stent compared to an approved drug-eluting stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While Cordis made a business decision to no longer pursue NEVO™ development and&#xD;
      commercialization, the patients will be followed up as per protocol. This includes performing&#xD;
      all protocol required follow-up visits and the collection and reporting of all safety&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis remains a frequent cause of late failure following successful coronary angioplasty&#xD;
      occurring in an estimated 20-40% of procedures performed. Coronary stents provide mechanical&#xD;
      scaffolding that helps reduce restenosis by limiting the extent of elastic recoil and late&#xD;
      vascular remodeling. Despite improvements over balloon angioplasty alone, restenosis&#xD;
      following coronary stenting procedures has been cited to occur in 20-40% of cases and is&#xD;
      primarily a result of neointimal hyperplasia. Thus, stents which are capable of delivering&#xD;
      drugs to limit neointimal hyperplasia, in addition to providing mechanical support at the&#xD;
      area of the lesion, have been developed to further limit the extent of restenosis following&#xD;
      coronary stenting. There are several pharmacologic agents approved for use with drug-eluting&#xD;
      stents.Two drugs have been widely studied in controlled clinical trials and real-world&#xD;
      patient populations, sirolimus and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate a new sirolimus-eluting cobalt chromium coronary stent system&#xD;
      compared to an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of single&#xD;
      de novo coronary lesions in native coronary arteries. Subjects meeting qualification will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with the Conor sirolimus-eluting coronary stent or&#xD;
      to treatment with an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. All subjects will undergo&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up at six months and complete clinical follow-up for a period of five&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The NEVO™ stent will not be commercialized. Cordis have decided to close the study after 3&#xD;
    years. This decision took the absence of safety signals into account.&#xD;
