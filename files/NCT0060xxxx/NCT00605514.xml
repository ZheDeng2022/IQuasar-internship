      This study will determine if experimental vaccines to prevent Ebola virus infection and&#xD;
      Marburg virus infection are safe and what side effects, if any, they cause. Ebola virus&#xD;
      infection may range from mild to severe, and may cause breathing problems, severe bleeding,&#xD;
      kidney problems and shock that can lead to death. Marburg virus infection causes an illness&#xD;
      similar to that caused by the Ebola virus. The vaccines used in this study contain genetic&#xD;
      material produced in the laboratory that causes the body to make a small amount of either&#xD;
      Ebola or Marburg virus proteins. No Ebola or Marburg virus is in the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assigned to receive injections of either the Marburg or the Ebola vaccine.&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the Marburg vaccine and the second group will&#xD;
      receive the Ebola vaccine. The injections are given at 4-week intervals (study weeks 0, 4 and&#xD;
      8). They are given into a muscle with a needleless system called the Biojector(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants keep a diary at home (on paper or electronically) for 5 days, in which they&#xD;
      record their temperature, symptoms and any reaction at the injection site. They call a study&#xD;
      nurse the day after vaccination to report how they feel and return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up 2 weeks after each injection (weeks 2, 6 and 10). The visits include a check of&#xD;
      vital signs, blood and urine tests, medical history and review of medications taken.&#xD;
      Additional visits at weeks 12, 24 and 32 include a check of vital signs, medical history and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      two recombinant DNA vaccines: one against Marburg virus infections and one against Ebola&#xD;
      virus infections. The hypothesis is that each vaccine will be safe for human administration&#xD;
      and elicit a humoral and T cell mediated immune response. The primary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccines in healthy adults.&#xD;
      Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of each study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-MARDNA025-00-VP (Marburg DNA) is composed of one closed-circular DNA plasmid encoding for&#xD;
      the glycoprotein (GP) from the Angola strain of Marburg. VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP (Ebola DNA WT)&#xD;
      is composed of two closed-circular DNA plasmids, one encodes for GP from the Zaire strain and&#xD;
      one encodes for GP from the Sudan-Gulu strain of Ebola. DNA vaccine vials will be supplied at&#xD;
      4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM) into&#xD;
      the deltoid muscle using the Biojector[R] 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System&#xD;
      (Biojector).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 healthy adults, ages 18-60 years, will be enrolled into two groups of 10&#xD;
      subjects each. No more than one subject per group may be in the age range of 51-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled into two groups. Group 1 subjects will receive the&#xD;
      Marburg DNA vaccine and Group 2 subjects will receive the Ebola DNA WT vaccine. The first 3&#xD;
      enrollments in each group will occur no faster than one per day. Before completing enrollment&#xD;
      into each group, there will be a study pause with review by the Protocol Safety Review Team&#xD;
      (PSRT) when there is at least 2 weeks of safety follow-up on the third subject's first&#xD;
      injection. Before the initiation of Group 2, the FDA must have assessed administration of the&#xD;
      Ebola DNA WT vaccine as safe to proceed. In addition, there will be a study pause with review&#xD;
      by the PSRT when there is at least two weeks of safety follow-up on the last subject enrolled&#xD;
      into Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC 206 Group 1 will receive Marburg DNA, accrue 10 subjects and deliver injections on Day 0&#xD;
      with a dose 4 mg, Day 28 plus or minus 7 with a dose 4 mg and Day 56 plus or minus 7 with a&#xD;
      dose 4 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC 206 Group 2 will receive Ebola DNA WT, accrue 10 subjects and deliver injections on Day 0&#xD;
      with a dose of 4 mg, Day 28 plus or minus 7 with a dose 4 mg and Day 56 plus or minus 7 with&#xD;
      a dose 4 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total accrual will be 20 subjects. The injections will be administered at least 21 days&#xD;
      between DNA injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original protocol design required 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone follow-up contacts for&#xD;
      each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Version 4.0 protocol amendment allows a 4th injection for those who consent. Consent and&#xD;
      administration of the 4th injection could occur anytime in the interval starting with Study&#xD;
      Week 32 through Study Week 52. The 4th injection follow-up schedule includes 1 telephone&#xD;
      contact and 4 follow-up visits after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The original study requires 32 weeks of clinical follow up for each&#xD;
      participant. Subjects who consent to the amended schedule with a 4th injection will have an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks of follow up.&#xD;
