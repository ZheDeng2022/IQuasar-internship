    <textblock>
      The present protocol will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed mode&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation, Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist, commonly known as NAVA.&#xD;
      During NAVA, the timing and magnitude of pressure delivered are controlled by the infants'&#xD;
      diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi), a validated measurement of neural respiratory drive.&#xD;
      Recent clinical trials in adults and term infants have shown that NAVA is more synchronous&#xD;
      than conventional pressure support ventilation, and that NAVA delivers lower mean airway&#xD;
      pressures to achieve the same ventilation and respiratory muscle unloading. NAVA has recently&#xD;
      been approved for use in infants by Health Canada and the FDA in the United States, and is&#xD;
      commercially available on the Servoi ventilator (Maquet Critical Care, Solna, Sweden). The&#xD;
      present protocol is designed as a &quot;case study&quot; where the researchers responsible would like&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of ventilating an infant on NAVA with the Servoi for&#xD;
      12 hours, and to compare it to conventional ventilation.&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of delivering NAVA in an intubated infant&#xD;
      with the Servoi ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: All ventilatory and EAdi parameters will be stored in a laptop computer&#xD;
      connected to the ventilator. SAO2 will be measured via pulse oximetry with a probe placed on&#xD;
      one of the infant's extremities. End Tidal PCO2 measurements will also be made via probe&#xD;
      placed on the Y piece of the respirator circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General protocol sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients in the PICU at HSJ screened daily for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible cases reviewed with attending team and study team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent obtained from parents or guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change to Servoi ventilator (conventional settings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasogastric tube replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor EAdi during conventional settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust PEEP to minimize tonic activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NAVA level titration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Application of NAVA for 12 hours with the titrated settings of PEEP and NAVA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return to conventional ventilator settings on servoi and monitor for 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA for 12 hours Following the titration of PEEP and the NAVA level, the infant will be&#xD;
      ventilated on NAVA with the titrated levels. The following will be monitored and recorded for&#xD;
      20 min at 1 hour intervals: Phasic EAdi, tonic EAdi, tidal volume, ventilator-delivered&#xD;
      pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end tidal PCO2, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAVA level and PEEP levels can be adjusted throughout the study period, and is based on&#xD;
      clinical judgment (as they would routinely do for a conventional mode). Following any new&#xD;
      setting, the 12 hour period will continue with those new settings. Following the end of this&#xD;
      12th hour of NAVA, the feeding tube with the sensors will remain in place for feeding the&#xD;
      patient as per ICU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol termination criteria: If the infant demonstrates a sustained change in any of the&#xD;
      following, the protocol will be terminated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained decrease in SaO2 &lt; 92% requiring increase in FIO2 &gt; 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End tidal PCO2 &gt; 60 mm Hg requiring progressive increases in the NAVA level,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained increase in heart rate&gt;180 bpm during 15 min,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained increase in respiratory rate&gt;60 bpm during 15 min,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled agitation judged by the attending physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring during conventional ventilation after discontinuation of NAVA (1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare NAVA to conventional ventilation, monitoring will be continued with&#xD;
      conventional settings on the Servoi ventilator for 1 hour. The following will be monitored&#xD;
      and recorded at 20 min intervals: Phasic EAdi, tonic EAdi, tidal volume, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      saturation, CO2, HR. Following this, the baby will be returned to the ventilator and settings&#xD;
      determined by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-ventilator synchrony (trigger delays, cycling-off delays (Beck 2007))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phasic EAdi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tonic EAdi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tidal volume, airway pressure, respiratory rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAO2, End Tidal PCO2, FIO2 Number of times back-up rate started (per hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of PEEP or NAVA level adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA level titration: A continuous analysis will be performed breath-by-breath for phasic&#xD;
      EAdi, ventilator-delivered pressure, respiratory rate and tidal volume. These values will be&#xD;
      plotted versus the NAVA level. The NAVA level at the inflection point will be compared to the&#xD;
      NAVA level initially used to match the conventional ventilation settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA for 12 hours: EAdi signals will be processed automatically by the ventilator with&#xD;
      standardized automated algorithms that have been implemented in to the Servoi. Phasic and&#xD;
      tonic EAdi, as well as the ventilatory parameters (Vt, rr, SAO2, CO2) will be quantified&#xD;
      breath-by breath and the last 20 min of each hour will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN order to compare patient-ventilator synchrony between NAVA vs Conventional ventilation,&#xD;
      trigger delays and cycling-off delays will be compared for each subject between the 2 modes.&#xD;
      Paired t-tests will be used for this comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to verify significant changes in variables over the&#xD;
      twelve hour intervention period. The impact of PEEP on tonic diaphragm activity and the&#xD;
      impact of NAVA level on tidal volume, pressures, and phasic diaphragm activity will also be&#xD;
      compared by RM ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination: This is a case study and we will include 5 infants.&#xD;
