  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that patients who undergo surgery while they under general&#xD;
      anesthesia have fewer wound infections if they receive higher concentrations of oxygen but&#xD;
      this has never been studied in women who are undergoing cesarean section. We plan to&#xD;
      randomize women who are undergoing cesarean to receive either standard of care oxygen flow&#xD;
      through a nasal cannula during their cesarean section only or a higher concentration of&#xD;
      oxygen than they would typically receive through a face mask. Women will receive this therapy&#xD;
      during their cesarean and for 2 hours afterwards. We will follow them after their surgery for&#xD;
      evidence of infection either in their wound or their uterus.&#xD;

      We designed a randomized controlled trial of supplemental oxygen for the prevention of post&#xD;
      cesarean delivery infectious morbidity at Washington University in St. Louis, MO. Patients&#xD;
      who underwent scheduled or intrapartum cesarean delivery with regional anesthesia were&#xD;
      eligible for participation. Women were recruited for study participation from the antepartum&#xD;
      service and labor and delivery. Exclusion criteria included emergency surgery in which the&#xD;
      participant was unable to provide informed consent, human immunodeficiency virus infection,&#xD;
      chronic corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy, general anesthesia, and a&#xD;
      diagnosis of extra uterine infection (i.e., pyelonephritis or pneumonia) before cesarean&#xD;
      delivery. Acute chorioamnionitis was not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written consent was obtained, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 scheme to&#xD;
      receive either supplemental oxygen or standard care. Randomization was achieved with opaque&#xD;
      envelopes that contained the assigned study group; the envelopes were opened after the&#xD;
      patients had agreed to participate in the study but before surgery. Women in the supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen group received oxygen at a flow rate of 10 L/min (corresponding to a FiO2 of&#xD;
      approximately 80%) by nonrebreather mask (CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA) during and for 2 hours&#xD;
      after cesarean delivery. Compliance with supplemental oxygen by face mask was assessed by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist intraoperatively and by the postpartum nurse at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes&#xD;
      after surgery. Women who were assigned to the standard care group received oxygen at a flow&#xD;
      rate of 2 L/min (corresponding to a FiO2 of 25-30%) by nasal cannula (Salter Labs, Arvin, CA)&#xD;
      during the cesarean delivery only. Oxygen saturation was assessed both intraoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively for both groups; women with oxygen saturations 95% were supplied supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen, as needed, to maintain appropriate oxygenation. Women in both groups received&#xD;
      standard preoperative skin preparation and prophylactic antibiotics. Subcutaneous depth was&#xD;
      measured by the primary operative team with a sterile ruler; demographic, intrapartum, and&#xD;
      operative information was abstracted from the medical records. The operative decision to&#xD;
      place subcutaneous sutures was left to the surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study was a composite outcome that consisted of endometritis and&#xD;
      wound infection. Strict diagnostic criteria were used for infectious outcomes. A patient was&#xD;
      diagnosed with endometritis if she had an oral temperature of 38°C after the first 24 hours&#xD;
      following the procedure and either (1) fundal or lower abdominal tenderness greater than&#xD;
      expected or (2) foul-smelling or purulent lochia.16 Endometritis was diagnosed only if other&#xD;
      causes for the patient's signs and symptoms were not identified. Patients had to be treated&#xD;
      with intravenous antibiotics for a diagnosis of endometritis to meet our study definition.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of wound infection required wound opening &gt;1 cm or other surgical intervention&#xD;
      (such as laparotomy or debridement of tissue) plus at least 1 of the following: (1) purulent&#xD;
      drainage from the wound, (2) erythema or induration of the surrounding tissues, (3) maternal&#xD;
      oral temperature &gt;38°C, or (4) radiographic evidence of infection. Secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      defined before the study was initiated and included the need for wound opening &gt;1 cm because&#xD;
      of wound hematoma or seroma, hospital readmission, and need for intravenous antibiotics after&#xD;
      the first 24 hours after the procedure. We also collected data on immediate neonatal outcomes&#xD;
      that included Apgar scores, special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      admission, umbilical artery pH, O2, and CO2, and antibiotic administration after birth.&#xD;
      Physicians were provided with educational materials regarding the diagnosis of endometritis&#xD;
      and wound infection before study initiation and intermittently throughout the study period.&#xD;
      All outcomes were assessed by the primary care team, and the diagnoses were abstracted from&#xD;
      the chart by study personnel (research nurse or investigator). The medical record was&#xD;
      reviewed at the time of the 2-4 week postoperative visit, and all women who did not return&#xD;
      for a postoperative visit within 4 weeks or who had planned follow-up visits at an outside&#xD;
      clinic were contacted by the research nurse by telephone to inquire about postoperative&#xD;
      complications. The data collection form was used as a prompt during the telephone interviews&#xD;
      to ensure standardization. The primary comparison for our study was supplemental oxygen vs&#xD;
      standard care with respect to the primary outcome of infectious morbidity. Data were analyzed&#xD;
      with the intent-to-treat principle, and a separate analysis was completed that analyzed only&#xD;
      those patients who were treated according to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis included unpaired t tests for normally distributed continuous variables,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test for nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and chi-squared or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact tests for categorical data. Stratified analyses with the Mantel-Haenszel test&#xD;
      and logistic regression were performed to assess for confounding and interaction. Risk ratios&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for outcomes by treatment arms. A probability&#xD;
      value of &lt; .05 was considered significant. No interim analyses were planned or conducted. The&#xD;
      study protocol included a continuous (daily) process of monitoring and reporting of maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal adverse events by the research team. Adverse events were reported to the Human&#xD;
      Research Protection Office and the institutional review board as they occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the initial sample size calculation, we estimated the rate of infectious morbidity, which&#xD;
      consisted of endometritis and wound infection, to be 15%. To detect a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      surgical site infection with 80% power and an alpha error of 0.05, 278 women per arm were&#xD;
      required. After 50% of the subjects had been enrolled, the calculated sample size of 556&#xD;
      women was increased by approximately 10% to account for the observed loss to follow-up rate,&#xD;
      which resulted in a final sample size of 606 women.&#xD;
