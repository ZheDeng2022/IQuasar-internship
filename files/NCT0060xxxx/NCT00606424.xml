    <textblock>
      [F-18]HX4 is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging. This trial&#xD;
      is looking at the safety of [F-18]HX4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor is seeking to determine if [F-18]HX4 may serve as a clinically useful hypoxia&#xD;
      marker in diagnostic imaging, allowing the rational application of hypoxia related therapies&#xD;
      to those patients most likely to benefit from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor hypoxia, a situation where tumor cells have been deprived of oxygen, caused cancer&#xD;
      cells to become more resistant to the effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive study characterizing tumor hypoxia would facilitate the development of&#xD;
      targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied consists of a total of ten (10) adult subjects, including, four&#xD;
      normal volunteers and six cancer subjects, the latter with a confirmed diagnosis of head and&#xD;
      neck cancer, as defined by the protocol eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this exploratory study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain information on bio-distribution of [F-18]HX4, and to evaluate the PET images of&#xD;
           [F-18]HX4 for resolution, signal to background ratio for both intermediate levels of&#xD;
           oxygenation, and at extreme levels hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use this eIND in order to obtain the necessary information to file an IND application&#xD;
           with the FDA. The information collected under this exploratory study will not be used&#xD;
           for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical&#xD;
           management of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Begin collection of baseline imaging data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect [F-18]HX4 metabolism data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain information to improve study design and the conduct of future trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be conducted as an exploratory, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      uncontrolled, single center, safety study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is expected to begin subject enrollment in early January 2008 and end subject&#xD;
      participation in June 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of an individual subject's participation includes a screening visit, followed by&#xD;
      participation in the actual study starting with the day of dosing with imaging sessions&#xD;
      lasting several hours, concluding with a next day safety follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual doses of [F-18]HX4 shall not exceed 20 mCi. The IP will be administered through a&#xD;
      previously placed suitably sized angiocatheter or a butterfly needle. Prior to injection,&#xD;
      qualified site personnel will assay the dose. After IP administration several PET imaging&#xD;
      series will be acquired. Also, in order to assess major organ function and electrolyte&#xD;
      levels, a metabolites analysis will be performed for this study from predose to 90 minutes&#xD;
      postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the quantity of [F-18]HX4 and labeled metabolites excreted by the&#xD;
      kidney,urine will be collected and pooled at the designated intervals after administration of&#xD;
      the investigational product. This excretion data will provide supportive information for&#xD;
      calculating human dosimetry estimates from PET imaging biodistribution data collected in&#xD;
      human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cancer subjects, a tissue biopsy will have been taken or be scheduled to be performed.&#xD;
      The biopsy sample will be examined for hypoxic biomarker(s) using immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
