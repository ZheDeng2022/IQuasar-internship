      The primary objective of this study will be to compare the glucose level at which&#xD;
      counter-regulatory hormone responses occur during hypoglycemia in young children with&#xD;
      diabetes, with the glucose level counter regulatory hormone responses that occur in older&#xD;
      children with diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study is being undertaken to compare counterregulatory hormone responses to a&#xD;
      mild and gradual reduction in plasma glucose in young children with T1DM versus responses in&#xD;
      adolescents. The studies will be performed under the close supervision of the professional&#xD;
      staff of each DirecNet center and frequent bedside monitoring of plasma glucose&#xD;
      concentrations will ensure that clinically significant hypoglycemia is prevented from&#xD;
      developing. All subjects will be admitted to the CRC and have an IV line for blood sampling&#xD;
      inserted on the evening prior to study to reduce stress on the morning of the study. The&#xD;
      study procedure will be simplified and made less invasive in comparison to a clamp or&#xD;
      standard insulin infusion study (i.e. only the one IV for blood sampling will be needed) by&#xD;
      limiting enrollment to insulin pump-treated subjects who will have their basal rates modestly&#xD;
      increased to produce the hypoglycemic stimulus. Monsod and colleagues used the same procedure&#xD;
      of increasing the basal insulin infusion dose to induce a gradual fall in plasma glucose in&#xD;
      youth with type 1 diabetes in a study that compared the ability of injections of glucagon and&#xD;
      epinephrine to treat mild hypoglycemia. It is particularly important to note that once the&#xD;
      blood glucose level falls below 60 mg/dl, a blood sample will be obtained and hypoglycemia&#xD;
      will then be immediately corrected by intravenous administration of exogenous glucose. In our&#xD;
      recent DirecNet study, ~25% of children and adolescents had plasma glucose levels below 60&#xD;
      mg/dl during a typical night and this rose to ~50% of subjects when there was antecedent&#xD;
      exercise in the late afternoon. Moreover, the frequency of mild as well as severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia is substantially higher in pre-school children than in children and adolescents.&#xD;
      This safe and rigorously designed study will provide important new information regarding the&#xD;
      role of inadequate counter-regulation on the increased risk of hypoglycemia in very young&#xD;
      children with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time continuous glucose sensing systems offer the potential to markedly lower the risk&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia in youth with T1DM. However, the DirecNet inpatient accuracy study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the first generation of these devices was inaccurate when blood glucose was&#xD;
      lowered to less than 70 mg/dl. In that study, children with T1DM between 3-17 years of age&#xD;
      were admitted to the CRC for approximately 26 hours during which they wore 1-2 Medtronic&#xD;
      MiniMed CGMS and 1-2 Cygnus GlucoWatch G2 Biographer continuous glucose monitors. In every&#xD;
      subject in that study, blood samples were obtained every 30-60 minutes from an indwelling&#xD;
      intravenous catheter for measurement of reference plasma glucose levels in the DirecNet&#xD;
      Central Laboratory. The Guardian-RT continuous glucose monitoring systems is a real-time&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor that has considerable promise for use in children with diabetes.&#xD;
      Therefore, a secondary aim of this study is to obtain very important data regarding the&#xD;
      accuracy of this system during hypoglycemia in young children, as well as adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Guardian-RT has been approved by the FDA for detecting trends and tracking patterns in&#xD;
      adults (18 and older) and are indicated for adjunctive rather than replacement of standard&#xD;
      home glucose monitoring devices. The sensor has been approved by the FDA for use for up to 72&#xD;
      hours but can function for a longer period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to compare the glucose level at which&#xD;
      counter-regulatory hormone responses occur during hypoglycemia in young children with&#xD;
      diabetes, with the glucose level counter regulatory hormone responses that occur in older&#xD;
      children with diabetes. We hypothesize that the children in the younger age group will not&#xD;
      have a counterregulatory response until a lower glucose level is reached compared with&#xD;
      children in the older age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess signs and symptoms at different glucose levels of hypoglycemia in younger&#xD;
           children and compare those with the older children. Furthermore, symptoms will be&#xD;
           compared to counter regulatory hormone levels in the two age groups. Symptoms will be&#xD;
           assessed using physiologic data and using an age-appropriate questionnaire that would be&#xD;
           completed during the test by the subject (where appropriate) and by a parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether there is a difference in counter-regulatory hormone response in each&#xD;
           age group, among those who had at least 2-3 episodes of hypoglycemia per day or night&#xD;
           prior to the study compared with those who had an occasional or no episodes of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia prior to the test. Subjects will wear a Guardian RT for 6 days (+1 day)&#xD;
           prior to the test to assess episodes of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the accuracy of the Guardian-RT during hypoglycemia in children with type 1&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a child enters the study, the following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent is obtained from eligible subjects (age 3 to &lt;7 or 12 to &lt;18 years, T1D&#xD;
           for &gt;1 year, insulin pump being used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the day of enrollment a hemoglobin A1c is obtained and instructions are given for use&#xD;
           of the Guardian RT. The study personnel will supervise the subject or parent inserting&#xD;
           the sensor in the clinic. The subject will be instructed to complete at least four&#xD;
           glucose measurements a day using the study HGM. Instructions will also be given for&#xD;
           response to Guardian RT alarms prior to the CRC admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The subject will return for an 18-hour overnight CRC admission approximately 6 days (+ 1&#xD;
           day) after the enrollment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will continue using the Guardian RT sensor inserted prior to the&#xD;
                admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects of sufficient size to accommodate additional devices, a second&#xD;
                Guardian-RT sensor will be inserted. An intravenous catheter will be inserted for&#xD;
                reference measurements (glucose, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon&#xD;
                and GH), which will be drawn during the subcutaneous insulin infusion test the&#xD;
                following morning to send to a central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects of sufficient weight (subjects &gt;14.9kg at reinfusion centers and&#xD;
                &gt;26.3kg at discard centers) to accommodate the volume of blood required, blood&#xD;
                glucose measurements will be made every 30 minutes during the admission to allow&#xD;
                for assessment of the accuracy of the Guardian-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For subjects of sufficient weight to accommodate the volume of blood required,&#xD;
                blood glucose measurements will be made every 15 minutes for two hours after&#xD;
                dinner. This will allow for assessment of the accuracy of the Guardian-RT in&#xD;
                detecting change during a period of rising blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At approximately 8:00 a.m. the subcutaneous insulin infusion test will start.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Prior to starting the test, a HypoMonÂ® may be placed around the subject's&#xD;
                     chest using an adjustable strap.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The glucose concentration as measured by the study HGM must be &gt;110 mg/dL to&#xD;
                     start the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  At the start of the test, the basal insulin rate will be increased by&#xD;
                     approximately 25-50% to provide a gradual decline in blood glucose. A small&#xD;
                     priming bolus dose of insulin equal to approximately one hour of the subject's&#xD;
                     usual basal dose may also be given at the discretion of the investigator in&#xD;
                     addition to the 25-50% increase in the basal insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The basal insulin rate may be increased an additional amount and additional&#xD;
                     bolus insulin doses may be given at the discretion of the investigator in&#xD;
                     order to get a gradual decline in the glucose concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Blood samples will be collected for the laboratory and glucose will be checked&#xD;
                     with the study HGM with venous blood every 15 minutes until the glucose level&#xD;
                     reaches 100 mg/dL. Thereafter, the study HGM will be used to check the glucose&#xD;
                     levels with venous blood every 5-10 minutes depending on the rate of fall of&#xD;
                     the glucose level until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Blood samples will be collected for laboratory determination of hormone&#xD;
                     concentrations at baseline (before increasing the insulin infusion) and when&#xD;
                     the glucose levels are &lt;90, &lt;80, &lt;70, and &lt;60 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Subjects (or parent if appropriate) will be asked questions regarding symptoms&#xD;
                     of hypoglycemia each time the glucose level is checked with the study HGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Once the endpoint is reached (the first time the glucose is &lt;60 mg/dL using&#xD;
                     the study HGM), the basal rate will be returned to normal, the subjects will&#xD;
                     be treated with intravenous glucose and breakfast will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prior to discharge, the sensors will be removed and downloaded and the subject's insulin&#xD;
           pump will be downloaded if possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 days (+1 day) following the enrollment visit, subjects will have an inpatient CRC&#xD;
      admission of approximately 18 hours. Subjects will be admitted at approximately 3:00 PM to&#xD;
      allow sufficient time to calibrate the sensors before dinner is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Areas where a Guardian RT sensor was worn during the first week will be assessed by&#xD;
           study personnel for any skin irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Guardian RT, HGM, and pump data from the previous week will be reviewed and changes&#xD;
           will be made to diabetes management as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will continue using the Guardian RT sensor last inserted at home. If the sensor&#xD;
           is not functioning properly, a new sensor will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For subjects of sufficient size, an additional Guardian-RT sensor will be inserted and&#xD;
           calibrated approximately two hours later. An intravenous catheter will be inserted in an&#xD;
           arm vein for collection of blood samples during the admission. The area where the&#xD;
           catheter will be inserted may be numbed with Elamax or EMLA cream prior to catheter&#xD;
           insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the study endpoint is reached (the first time the glucose is &lt;60 mg/dL using the study&#xD;
      HGM), the basal rate will be returned to normal and the subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      intravenous glucose. An additional blood sample will be collected for laboratory&#xD;
      determination of glucose and hormone concentrations 15 minutes following the treatment with&#xD;
      intravenous glucose. Subjects will then be given breakfast and discharged. Prior to&#xD;
      discharge, the sensor(s) will be removed and downloaded. The subject's insulin pump will be&#xD;
      downloaded if possible.&#xD;
