    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a blood disorder that is characterized by intense, painful&#xD;
      episodes known as sickle cell crises. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PAINRelieveIt, a three-part computer-based pain management tool, in treating adults with SCD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCD is an inherited blood disorder that mainly affects people of African, Mediterranean, or&#xD;
      Latin descent. Symptoms include anemia, infections, organ damage, and painful sickle cell&#xD;
      crises. Adults with SCD who experience frequent painful crises are more likely to die sooner&#xD;
      than are adults with SCD who have fewer painful crises. Experts suggest that SCD pain be&#xD;
      treated in the same way that cancer pain is treated because both types of pain are sustained&#xD;
      and severe. However, unlike the research directed towards cancer pain, research focused on&#xD;
      the characteristics of SCD pain has been limited. Although medications are available to treat&#xD;
      SCD pain, the SCD pain management process is complex and often requires more time than what&#xD;
      is available during the typical medical appointment. Recent advances in computer technologies&#xD;
      may provide an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of SCD pain management by combining&#xD;
      online patient education with decision-making support tools for doctors. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate three touch screen computerized tools that are known collectively as PAINRelieveIt.&#xD;
      The three tools include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PAINReportIt-a pain assessment data collection tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PAINUCope-a multimedia patient education program tailored to the participant's SCD pain&#xD;
           management misconceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PAINConsultN-a decision support tool for doctors that will provide algorithm-based pain&#xD;
           medication therapies tailored to each participant's pain level&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-part study will evaluate the effectiveness of PAINReportIt and PAINUCope, alone and&#xD;
      in combination with PAINConsultN, at improving participants' SCD pain by educating&#xD;
      participants about their role in pain management and by providing decision-making support to&#xD;
      doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises two parts. Part 1 of the study will enroll patients who are receiving&#xD;
      care at the University of Illinois at Chicago Sickle Cell Clinic. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive 3 months of either access to PAINReportIt and PAINUCope or usual&#xD;
      care. At baseline and Month 3, participants will complete questionnaires on misconceptions&#xD;
      about pain, medication adherence, and pain intensity. The same participants from Part 1 of&#xD;
      the study will be enrolled into Part 2 of the study, which will last 2 years. Part 2&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either care from doctors who have access to&#xD;
      PAINConsultN or usual care. All participants will have access to PAINReportIt and PAINUCope.&#xD;
      At baseline and Year 2, participants will complete questionnaires on pain episodes.&#xD;
      Information will also be collected from doctors, including pain documentation,&#xD;
      appropriateness of prescribed pain medications, and the number of emergency department visits&#xD;
      by and hospitalizations of participants experiencing painful SCD crises.&#xD;

    <description>In Part 1 of the study, participants will access PAINReportIt and computer games. PAINReportIt helps the patient describe the pain experienced. In Part 2 of the study, participants will continue to access PAINReportIt when they are seen in the clinic, emergency department (ED), acute care center (ACCA), and hospital. They will gain access to the PAINUCope computer-based programs, which provides multimedia education tailored to the patient's misconceptions about pain management. They will receive medial usual care at the outpatient clinic, ED, ACC, and hospital.</description>
