  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate galantamine's effects on cognitive performance in abstinent cocaine users.&#xD;
      Galantamine, a medication approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is an acetylcholine&#xD;
      esterase inhibitor. Galantamine also directly potentiates nicotine receptors. Both of these&#xD;
      effects may result in improved cognitive performance in a group of subjects known to have&#xD;
      impaired performance in various cognitive tasks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Galantamine, compared to placebo, will improve cognitive performance in abstinent cocaine&#xD;
      users. The cognitive performance will be measured with the Stroop test and 3 Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) tests: Paired Associate Learning (PAL),&#xD;
      Delayed Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM),and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP).&#xD;
      Performance on these tests has been shown to be impaired in abstinent cocaine users, compared&#xD;
      to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galantamine, compared to placebo, will not be associated with any significant changes in&#xD;
      mood. Monitoring of mood will be achieved with 3 mood scales: 1) Center for Epidemiologic&#xD;
      Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the&#xD;
      Profile of Mood States (POMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently this study is completed, Patients are no longer being enrolled. There were 28&#xD;
      completers. This study has been published.&#xD;

    <measure>Paired Associate Learning (PAL) - Stages Complete</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid Visual Processing test (RVIP) is a measure of sustained attention with a small working memory component that is sensitive to cholinergic enhancers. In the Paired Associate Learning (PAL) task, boxes are displayed on the screen and are opened in a random order. One or more of the boxes will contain a pattern. After the subjects have seen the patterns behind each box, the patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the subject must touch the box where the pattern was originally located. An error will cause the test to open the boxes again to remind the subject of their locations. The number of boxes with patterns increases throughout the test. The stages completed and number of errors are measures of interest.</description>

    <measure>Performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) - Number of Errors on NoGo Trials</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The SART is a Go / NoGo task measuring the ability to activate or inhibit responses. In this 4.5 minute task, 225 single digits (25 × 9 digits) were presented on a computer monitor. Each digit was presented for 250 ms, and was immediately followed by a mask for 900 ms. The mask consists of a ring with a diagonal cross in the center. Subjects were instructed to press a spacebar to every digit except the 3, and to give equal importance to speed and accuracy. Responses were allowed during the presentation of both the digit and mask. The digits were presented in a different random order for each subject. There were 18 practice trials, containing 2 no-response targets (3s). For the Go/NoGo task, response inhibition was measured as the number of errors on the no- Go trials, with low errors indicating better response inhibition.&#xD;
Complete data for 3 subjects in the Placebo group, and for 1 subject in the galantamine group were not capture do to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Cocaine-Stroop task measures attention capture (attentional bias) secondary to cocaine cues; (Stroop effect - calculated as the difference between mean RT on cocaine words and mean RT on control words). Subjects completed 2 counterbalanced blocks (150 trials per block). One block contained 15 cocaine words and neutral words in a mixed order. The other block contained 15 control words matched in length and frequency to cocaine words, and a different set of neutral words. Subjects were required to indicate the colors in which the words were written as quickly and accurately as possible. Reaction times for identification of word color was measured. In addition, the difference in RT to words following cocaine and control words were measured (carry-over effect). Complete data for 3 participants (2 placebo and 1 galantamine) were not capture due to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

        <description>Rapid Visual Processing test (RVIP) is a measure of sustained attention with a small working memory component that is sensitive to cholinergic enhancers. In the RVIP, subjects must detect either odd or even 3 digit sequences appearing in a box in a pseudo-random order at 100 digits per minute. Reaction time (RT) to correct answers was measured.</description>

In the RVIP, subjects must detect either odd or even 3 digit sequences appearing in a box in a pseudo-random order at 100 digits per minute. A' is a measure of sensitivity to target sequences and it reflects probabilities of hits and false alarms to provide a score of sensitivity to the target regardless of response tendency. The scores range from 0 (bad) to 1 (good).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5 and Day 10</time_frame>
        <population>There were a total of 28 completers, 14 for each treatment group. However, CANTAB data was not stored on the hard drive for one subject in the Galantamine group.</population>

        <description>Rapid Visual Processing test (RVIP) is a measure of sustained attention with a small working memory component that is sensitive to cholinergic enhancers. In the Paired Associate Learning (PAL) task, boxes are displayed on the screen and are opened in a random order. One or more of the boxes will contain a pattern. After the subjects have seen the patterns behind each box, the patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the subject must touch the box where the pattern was originally located. An error will cause the test to open the boxes again to remind the subject of their locations. The number of boxes with patterns increases throughout the test. The stages completed and number of errors are measures of interest.</description>

        <description>In the PRM, the subject is presented with a series of 12 visual patterns, one at a time, in the center of the screen. These patterns are designed so that they cannot easily be given verbal labels.

        <title>Performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) - Number of Errors on NoGo Trials</title>
        <description>The SART is a Go / NoGo task measuring the ability to activate or inhibit responses. In this 4.5 minute task, 225 single digits (25 × 9 digits) were presented on a computer monitor. Each digit was presented for 250 ms, and was immediately followed by a mask for 900 ms. The mask consists of a ring with a diagonal cross in the center. Subjects were instructed to press a spacebar to every digit except the 3, and to give equal importance to speed and accuracy. Responses were allowed during the presentation of both the digit and mask. The digits were presented in a different random order for each subject. There were 18 practice trials, containing 2 no-response targets (3s). For the Go/NoGo task, response inhibition was measured as the number of errors on the no- Go trials, with low errors indicating better response inhibition.&#xD;
Complete data for 3 subjects in the Placebo group, and for 1 subject in the galantamine group were not capture do to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

        <description>The SART is a Go / NoGo task measuring the ability to activate or inhibit responses. In this 4.5 minute task, 225 single digits (25 × 9 digits) were presented on a computer monitor. Each digit was presented for 250 ms, and was immediately followed by a mask for 900 ms. The mask consists of a ring with a diagonal cross in the center. Subjects were instructed to press a spacebar to every digit except the 3, and to give equal importance to speed and accuracy. Responses were allowed during the presentation of both the digit and mask. The digits were presented in a different random order for each subject. There were 18 practice trials, containing 2 no-response targets (3s).&#xD;
For the Go trial, the reaction time reflected the response activation function, faster reaction time indicating greater response activation.&#xD;
Complete data for 3 subjects in the Placebo group, and for 1 subject in the galantamine group were not capture do to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

Subjects completed 2 counterbalanced blocks (150 trials per block). One block contained 15 cocaine words and neutral words in a mixed order. The other block contained 15 control words matched in length and frequency to cocaine words, and a different set of neutral words. Subjects were required to indicate the colors in which the words were written as quickly and accurately as possible. Reaction times for identification of word color was measured. In addition, the difference in RT to words following cocaine and control words were measured (carry-over effect). Complete data for 3 participants (2 placebo and 1 galantamine) were not capture due to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

        <title>Performance on the Modified Stroop Task (Cocaine-Stroop)- Carry-over Effect</title>
        <description>The Cocaine-Stroop task measures attention capture (attentional bias) secondary to cocaine cues; (Stroop effect - calculated as the difference between mean RT on cocaine words and mean RT on control words). Subjects completed 2 counterbalanced blocks (150 trials per block). One block contained 15 cocaine words and neutral words in a mixed order. The other block contained 15 control words matched in length and frequency to cocaine words, and a different set of neutral words. Subjects were required to indicate the colors in which the words were written as quickly and accurately as possible. Reaction times for identification of word color was measured. In addition, the difference in RT to words following cocaine and control words were measured (carry-over effect). Complete data for 3 participants (2 placebo and 1 galantamine) were not capture due to experimenter and computer errors.</description>

            <groups_desc>A mixed-effect, repeated-measures model using main effect terms of treatment (placebo or galantine) and time (day of measurement). Interaction of main effects were also analyzed, with a random effect for participant. Given the hypothesis generating nature of the study, values of p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant based on two-tailed tests. Significant interactions were followed by Bonferroni post hoc pairwise comparisons.</groups_desc>
