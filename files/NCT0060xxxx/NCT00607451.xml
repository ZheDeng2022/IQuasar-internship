  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of Neu-120 in Parkinson's disease patients with&#xD;
      levodopa-induced dyskinesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by tremor,&#xD;
      bradykinesia, rigidity, gait and postural instability and a variety of nonmotor symptoms.&#xD;
      While levodopa effectively alleviates all symptoms of Parkinson's disease and restores motor&#xD;
      function, within 3 to 5 years the majority of Parkinsonian patients develop levodopa-induced&#xD;
      side effects, mainly dyskinesias (involuntary and uncontrolled movements such as twisting of&#xD;
      a hand or a limb) and wearing off (progressive shortening of therapeutic response duration).&#xD;
      Dyskinesias are the most disabling side effects of long term levodopa therapy in Parkinsonian&#xD;
      patients. There is currently no approved drug for levodopa-induced dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of three single ascending doses of orally administered Neu-120 will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a double blind placebo controlled crossover proof of concept study. Following a 1-day&#xD;
      screening visit, patients will be randomized to receive three single ascending doses of&#xD;
      Neu-120 and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to the clinic on the evening prior to each visit on five occasions,&#xD;
      each separated by 7 (-3) days. Levodopa challenges will be performed at baseline (visit 1)&#xD;
      and at each treatment visit after withdrawal of all antiparkinsonian medications for 12&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken for measurement of Neu-120 and levodopa plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary parameter is improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Secondary parameters are&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic assessments of dyskinesias and motor function,&#xD;
      Neu-120/levodopa pharmacokinetic profiles and correlation between pharmacodynamic effects and&#xD;
      Neu-120/levodopa levels.&#xD;
