  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart is weakened and is unable to pump&#xD;
      enough blood to the organs of the body to meet the demands of the body. At times there may be&#xD;
      a buildup of fluid in the lungs, legs or other parts of the body. The accumulation of this&#xD;
      fluid has been shown to affect the resistance to flow of the electrical impulses generated in&#xD;
      the heart. The purpose of this study is to correlate measurements to the passive flow of&#xD;
      electricity generated by the heart within the chest (as measured by the Optivol TFS System)&#xD;
      with measurements of the volume of blood in the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects 5 million people in the United States, with an&#xD;
      additional 550,000 cases diagnosed each year. Despite major recent strides in treatment, a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CHF still carries significant annual morbidity and mortality. The resultant&#xD;
      economic burden associated with the management of this disease has been estimated at $40&#xD;
      billion per year, with 60% - 75% resulting from inpatient management(1). Emergency room&#xD;
      visits, frequent outpatient encounters and the hemodynamic monitoring and intensive care&#xD;
      associated with inpatient management contribute significantly to this total cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current outpatient heart failure management programs focus on lifestyle changes,&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, and disease awareness, emphasizing self identification of signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of volume overload. Despite the best efforts of all involved, frequent unscheduled visits to&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic or emergency department remain common, even in those patients&#xD;
      participating in formal management programs. Accurate identification of elevated filling&#xD;
      pressures and intravascular volume prior to the significant worsening of symptoms remains an&#xD;
      elusive goal of management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although elevated jugular venous pressure and the presence of a third heart sound have been&#xD;
      shown to have prognostic value in patients with heart failure(2), physical exam findings of&#xD;
      elevated filling pressures do not reliably correlate with invasive hemodynamics(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive measurement of filling pressures and cardiac output with a pulmonary artery catheter&#xD;
      has been the gold standard for hemodynamic assessment for decades. However, this method&#xD;
      carries significant inherent risks of placement and maintenance and is not well-suited for&#xD;
      frequent assessment in the outpatient setting. Development of a method that would accurately&#xD;
      and reliably identify hypervolemia and elevated filling pressures prior to the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms may allow earlier intervention and have a significant impact on quality of life,&#xD;
      morbidity, and mortality in patients with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood volume analysis has been used for over 100 years in the assessment of plasma volume and&#xD;
      red cell mass. Earlier techniques relied on dilution of various dyes and were based on the&#xD;
      concept that the concentration of a known quantity of dye was inversely proportional to the&#xD;
      volume of blood into which it was injected. Later, using the same concept, 51Cr labeled red&#xD;
      blood cells and 125I labeled albumen, were developed to measure the red cell and plasma&#xD;
      compartments respectively. Although the dual isotope method is considered the gold standard,&#xD;
      it is cumbersome and requires at least 6 hours for completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer, highly automated method using 131I labeled albumen and serial hematocrit&#xD;
      measurements (BVA-100, Daxor Corp. New York, NY) has been shown to correlate well with the&#xD;
      dual isotope method requiring only 1 ½ hours for completion (Dworkin et al, unpublished&#xD;
      data). Additionally, this method can automatically compare measured blood, plasma and red&#xD;
      cell volumes to norms based on the sex, weight and height of the patient in the manner of&#xD;
      Feldschuh and Enson(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using this method, Androne et al(5) found that 65% of nonedematous CHF patients had&#xD;
      unrecognized hypervolemia. More recently, anemia has been shown to be a poor prognostic&#xD;
      marker in CHF. In a separate report, Androne et al(6) found that 46% of anemic CHF patients&#xD;
      had dilutional anemia vs. 54% with true anemia. The success of targeted therapy may depend on&#xD;
      determining whether anemia is dilutional or due to reduced red cell mass. Despite this&#xD;
      method's accuracy, it is not practical for the serial measurements required to proactively&#xD;
      intervene in a CHF population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic impedance cardiography (ICG) relies on changes in transthoracic electrical&#xD;
      impedance when alternating currents are applied across the thorax. Derived measures include&#xD;
      stroke volume, cardiac output and thoracic fluid content. Although earlier studies have&#xD;
      validated the use of this method in the assessment of intrathoracic volume(7), there have&#xD;
      been conflicting results in regard to the correlation of cardiac output (CO) derived from&#xD;
      transthoracic ICG and that obtained from more traditional methods such as thermodilution,&#xD;
      indicator dye-dilution and the Fick method(8). In addition, the cumbersome nature of serial&#xD;
      data acquisition and the realization that derived hemodynamic data may be affected by lead&#xD;
      placement make this method less attractive in the ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrathoracic impedance is similar to transthoracic ICG in that it relies on changes in&#xD;
      impedance as a surrogate marker of volume status. The technique measures impedance from a&#xD;
      right ventricular lead to a pacing/defibrillator case. The technique is not subject to the&#xD;
      operator dependent variability of ICG and is well suited to serial measurements in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optivol® system developed by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN) employs proprietary software&#xD;
      (TFS) that collects and averages impedance values during a specific time period each day to&#xD;
      produce the Daily Impedance Value. The TFS software then derives and stores the Daily Mean&#xD;
      Impedance, Reference Impedance, and Cumulative Difference from the Daily Impedance Value. The&#xD;
      use of predetermined thresholds for the Cumulative Difference from the Daily Impedance Value&#xD;
      can provide an early warning of increasing thoracic fluid. This data is accessible to health&#xD;
      care practitioners through periodic download in the clinic via interrogation or through&#xD;
      Medtronic's web-based CareLink system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraham et al(9) demonstrated that TFS trends are consistent with clinical fluid status in a&#xD;
      small group of patients. In addition, a recent study by Yu et al(10) found that intrathoracic&#xD;
      impedance is inversely related to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and begins to decrease&#xD;
      days before the onset of symptoms of CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While data derived from the Optivol® system appears to mirror intrathoracic fluid content,&#xD;
      and is useful for determining trends, certain shortcomings remain. First, though changes in&#xD;
      intrathoracic impedance may inversely mirror changes in thoracic fluid content, the system&#xD;
      provides no absolute reference standard to determine euvolemia in an individual patient.&#xD;
      Secondly, it is unclear whether certain concomitant conditions (anemia, COPD) can affect the&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
