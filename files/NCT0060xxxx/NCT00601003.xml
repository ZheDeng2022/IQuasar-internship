      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nifurtimox in combination with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and topotecan are effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the effect of a drug, nifurtimox, against neuroblastoma and&#xD;
      medulloblastoma in children. Nifurtimox is a drug that has been used in South America for&#xD;
      many years to treat a parasitic disease known as Chagas Disease. It is not approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration for routine use in neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma in the&#xD;
      United States, but limited early observations suggest that nifurtimox may have anti tumor&#xD;
      activity for neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the preliminary trials of nifurtimox we have determined a safely tolerated dose of&#xD;
      nifurtimox to use in neuroblastoma patients (30mg/kg/day). The dose determined in the Phase I&#xD;
      study to be safe, will be the dose used for this study. From clinical experience in South&#xD;
      America, we know that children can tolerate nifurtimox when given by mouth, and it appears to&#xD;
      have no long-term side effects when used to treat Chagas Disease. Based on our laboratory and&#xD;
      animal studies, we believe that drug levels similar to those used to treat Chagas Disease may&#xD;
      shrink/kill neuroblastoma cells, especially when combined with other chemotherapy drugs. We&#xD;
      do not know whether nifurtimox will shrink/kill tumor cells effectively in children.&#xD;
      Therefore, the major goal of the study is to learn if nifurtimox in combination with other&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs is effective in shrinking/killing neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cells.&#xD;
