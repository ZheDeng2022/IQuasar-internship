      1. The major aims are to assess: (1) the relationship of basal and alcohol-induced&#xD;
      neurosteroid and GABA levels to the degree of acute alcohol intoxication in healthy male and&#xD;
      female volunteers; and (2) the effect of acute pregnenolone administration on the degree of&#xD;
      acute alcohol intoxication in these same volunteers. Specific hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline serum levels of pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate (PS), dehydroepiandrosterone&#xD;
           (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) will be inversely correlated with the magnitude of&#xD;
           acute behavioral responses to alcohol (sedation, anxiolysis, amnesia, psychomotor&#xD;
           impairment and intoxication). That is, higher baseline levels of these neurosteroids&#xD;
           will be associated with lessened behavioral responses to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline serum levels of allopregnanolone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC),&#xD;
           androstanediol, androsterone and GABA will be directly correlated with the magnitude of&#xD;
           acute behavioral responses to alcohol. That is, higher baseline levels of these&#xD;
           substances will be associated with heightened behavioral responses to alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute alcohol ingestion, compared to placebo ingestion, will increase serum levels of&#xD;
           allopregnanolone and THDOC and plasma levels of GABA and will decrease plasma levels of&#xD;
           PS. (Effects on levels of other neurosteroids are not specifically predicted based on&#xD;
           animal data but will be examined in an exploratory manner.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute alcohol-induced increases in serum levels of allopregnanolone and THDOC and in&#xD;
           plasma levels of GABA will be directly correlated with the magnitude of acute behavioral&#xD;
           responses to alcohol. Acute alcohol-induced decreases in serum levels of PS will be&#xD;
           directly correlated with the magnitude of acute behavioral responses to alcohol.&#xD;
           Correlations between alcohol-induced changes in other neurosteroids and changes in&#xD;
           behavior are not specifically predicted but will be examined in an exploratory manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnenolone, compared to placebo, pre-treatment will antagonize the acute effects of&#xD;
           alcohol on the behavioral measures.&#xD;

      2. BACKGROUND Neurosteroid Responses to Alcohol Administration: Alcohol likely interacts with&#xD;
      the brain GABA-A receptor complex via two distinct manners: a direct effect (Grobin et al&#xD;
      1998), and an indirect effect, which is secondary to alterations in levels of endogenous&#xD;
      GABA-A receptor-active neurosteroids or in levels of GABA itself (Morrow et al 1999). Indeed,&#xD;
      alcohol's effects on neurosteroid and GABA levels may represent a novel and important&#xD;
      mechanism of alcohol's actions (Morrow et al 1999). Acute alcohol administration&#xD;
      significantly increases cerebral cortex (700%) and circulating (600%) levels of&#xD;
      allopregnanolone, a potent GABA-A receptor agonist neurosteroid, in male rats (Morrow et al&#xD;
      1999). The magnitude of the observed alcohol-induced increase in allopregnanolone levels is&#xD;
      sufficient to enhance GABA'ergic neurotransmission and to exert anxiolytic, sedative and&#xD;
      anticonvulsant effects. Indeed, alcohol-induced increases in cerebral cortex allopregnanolone&#xD;
      levels are significantly correlated with alcohol's hypnotic effects in rats (VanDoren et al&#xD;
      2000), and the time course of alcohol-induced increases in cerebral cortex allopregnanolone&#xD;
      levels correlates well with many of alcohol's behavioral effects (VanDoren et al 2000);&#xD;
      (Morrow et al 1999). Alcohol's effects on other neurosteroids have been poorly studied,&#xD;
      although preliminary data suggest that alcohol dramatically lowers brain levels of PS (a&#xD;
      GABA-A receptor antagonist neurosteroid) (Corpechot et al 1983) and increases brain levels of&#xD;
      THDOC (a GABA-A receptor agonist neurosteroid) (Barbaccia et al 1999) in rats. In the latter&#xD;
      study, THDOC and allopregnanolone levels were increased to a significantly greater extent in&#xD;
      alcohol-preferring, compared to non-preferring rats, supporting a role of these neurosteroids&#xD;
      in modulating alcohol's reinforcing effects (Barbaccia et al 1999) and in determining&#xD;
      individual susceptibility to alcoholism. Regarding levels of GABA itself, acute alcohol&#xD;
      administration raises total brain GABA levels in rats (Kulonen 1983) and raises plasma GABA&#xD;
      levels in normal humans (Bannister et al 1988) (however, see: (Moss et al 1990)), although&#xD;
      the acute behavioral correlates of these changes have not been well-characterized. Also,&#xD;
      interactions between GABA changes and changes in neurosteroid levels have been poorly&#xD;
      characterized. These data suggest that alcohol-induced changes in allopregnanolone (and&#xD;
      perhaps PS, THDOC, other neurosteroids and GABA) levels are important contributors to&#xD;
      alcohol's behavioral actions in rodents. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, no studies have yet&#xD;
      assessed the effects of acute alcohol administration on neurosteroids in humans and the&#xD;
      relationship of these biochemical effects to alcohol's behavioural effects, and few have&#xD;
      assessed alcohol's effects on GABA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological Manipulation of Neurosteroid Levels Alters the Behavioral and Biological&#xD;
      Effects of Alcohol and Other Sedative-Hypnotics: Pregnenolone and PS block the &quot;anxiolytic&quot;&#xD;
      effect of alcohol in mice (Melchior and Ritzmann 1994), and these steroids, as well as DHEA&#xD;
      and DHEA-S (which are GABA-A receptor antagonist/ inverse agonist neurosteroids), block the&#xD;
      memory-impairing effect of alcohol in mice (Melchior and Ritzmann 1996). PS pre-treatment&#xD;
      also significantly attenuates alcohol-induced sedation, hypnosis and incoordination in rats,&#xD;
      whereas these alcohol effects are potentiated by pre-treatment with allopregnanolone&#xD;
      (Czlonkowska et al 2000). In rats, PS also blocks sedation/hypnosis induced by barbiturates&#xD;
      (Majewska et al 1989) and benzodiazepine-induced long-term electrophysiological depression&#xD;
      (Akhondzadeh and Stone 1998). Pre-treatment of male rats with allopregnanolone also increases&#xD;
      the reinforcing effects of alcohol (Janak et al 1998). This is understandable, since GABA-A&#xD;
      receptor agonists typically facilitate voluntary ethanol consumption in animals, and since&#xD;
      GABA-A receptor inverse agonists typically curtail ethanol consumption (reviewed in: (Grobin&#xD;
      et al 1998)). These findings are consistent with a GABA-A receptor agonist effect of&#xD;
      allopregnanolone and with an antagonist effect of pregnenolone, PS, DHEA and DHEA-S. In&#xD;
      addition to direct antagonist effects, PS influences GABA-A receptor affinity and number in a&#xD;
      manner opposite to that seen with alcohol (Majewska 1988). No studies in humans, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, have followed up on these findings in animals by examining the effects of&#xD;
      pharmacological neurosteroid manipulation on behavioral responses to acute alcohol ingestion.&#xD;
      However, we have previously found that pregnenolone pre-treatment significantly antagonizes&#xD;
      certain acute effects of benzodiazepines (which also act directly at the GABA-A receptor&#xD;
      complex) in healthy humans (Meieran et al in review, 2002). In that study, we found that&#xD;
      pregnenolone significantly attenuated diazepam's sedative effects (Meieran et al in review,&#xD;
      2002), consistent with pregnenolone's role as a GABA-A receptor antagonist/ inverse agonist.&#xD;
