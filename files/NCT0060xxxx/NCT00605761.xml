  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subject with Cystic Fibrosis have increased clearance of many drugs. Based on pre-clinical&#xD;
      data SB656933 was found to have low clearance and high bio-availability. This study will&#xD;
      characterize the PK profile of a single dose of SB656933 in patients with Cystic Fibrosis.&#xD;
      There will be two groups of subjects. The first group of subjects will receive a single dose&#xD;
      of 50mg SB-656933. The second group of subjects will receive a single dose of up to 300 mg&#xD;
      SB-656933. Subjects will first be screened for eligibility related to cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      history. Safety evaluations will be undertaken and plasma samples for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis will be collected. Additional blood samples will be taken for the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      endpoints CD11b and GAFS. Subjects are not required to stay overnight after their 12 hour PK&#xD;
      sample collection on Day 1, although they may do so if they wish. On Day 2 and 3, they will&#xD;
      return for collection of additional safety measurements, and further plasma and blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken for 24 and 48 h pharmacokinetics and 24h CD11b/GAFS measurements, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up visit (Visit 3) will be made 4-7 days after the treatment period. Subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study for approximately 3to 7 weeks (from screening to follow-up).&#xD;
