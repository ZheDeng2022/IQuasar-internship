      The purpose of our study is primarily to evaluate the effects of 5mg finasteride on hematuria&#xD;
      and hematospermia commonly associated with prostate biopsies. We hypothesize that 5mg of&#xD;
      finasteride daily for two weeks preceding TRUS prostate biopsy and one week following will&#xD;
      reduce hematuria and hematospermia commonly seen as complications following prostate biopsy.&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that reducing complications will decrease concern among subjects and make&#xD;
      for a more tolerable overall procedure than compared with subjects treated with placebo.&#xD;

      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is primarily to evaluate the effects of 5mg finasteride on hematuria&#xD;
      and hematospermia commonly associated with prostate biopsies. We will also examine how&#xD;
      effective the dosing of finasteride administered two weeks prior to biopsy and one week&#xD;
      following. We will also use the subject questionnaire to assess subject's attitudes and&#xD;
      concerns about hematuria and hematospermia. We will examine the overall subjective&#xD;
      tolerability of the biopsy procedure, concerns about sexual function, anxiety surrounding&#xD;
      prostate cancer, and urination following the procedure. Questionnaires will use a 10 point&#xD;
      visual analog scale to gauge subject's attitudes and concerns. We will examine for any&#xD;
      statistically significant correlations between these parameters and the complications we are&#xD;
      monitoring. We will also monitor side effects of subjects, in an effort to gauge the&#xD;
      potential risks associated with short term usage of finasteride compared to any benefits&#xD;
      afforded by finasteride on reducing hematuria and hematospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous research into the molecular mechanisms of finasteride, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that 5mg of finasteride daily for two weeks preceding TRUS prostate biopsy and one week&#xD;
      following will reduce hematuria and hematospermia commonly seen as complications following&#xD;
      prostate biopsy. We also hypothesize that reducing complications will decrease concern among&#xD;
      subjects and make for a more tolerable overall procedure than compared with subjects treated&#xD;
      with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of 5mg finasteride administered two weeks prior to prostate&#xD;
      biopsy and one week following on reducing hematuria and hematospermia following biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gauge subject's concerns relating to hematuria, hematospermia, and transmitting prostate&#xD;
      cancer to partners following TRUS prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine subject's subjective sexual function and urination in relation to their treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate benefits of finasteride in relation to the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in rate and severity of hematuria and hematospermia among subjects in treatment&#xD;
      and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in complications following biopsies, such as hospitalization and requirement for&#xD;
      blood transfusion, between treatment and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between placebo group and finasteride treatment group in: overall subjective&#xD;
      experience of biopsy procedure, concern relating to hematuria and hematospermia, sexual&#xD;
      function, and urination following prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitor side effects between placebo and finasteride when administered for three weeks total&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study we plan to conduct will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to&#xD;
      determine the effects of 5mg finasteride on the rate/severity of hematuria and hematospermia&#xD;
      following TRUS prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive 5mg&#xD;
      of finasteride orally for two weeks prior to TRUS biopsy, and one week after the biopsy.&#xD;
      Another group will receive a placebo orally for two weeks prior to the procedure and one week&#xD;
      following the biopsy. Patients will be identified for participation by existing indication&#xD;
      for TRUS prostate biopsy, and subsequently enrolled. Subjects will receive the current&#xD;
      standard of care in addition to participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to investigate the effects of finasteride compared to placebo on&#xD;
      hematuria and hematospermia following prostate biopsy. Subjects will be assigned to treatment&#xD;
      groups using a randomization process to eliminate selection bias, and to ensure that any&#xD;
      differences between the two study groups are due to random chance. The study has been&#xD;
      designed as placebo controlled and double blinded to ensure that investigator and subject&#xD;
      ascertainment biases are minimized. As there is no current prophylactic or other treatment to&#xD;
      decrease the rate/severity of hematuria and hematospermia following prostate biopsies, this&#xD;
      does not raise any ethical concerns in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment will be done on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform statistical analysis on the data collected from this study. We will examine&#xD;
      whether there is a statistically significant difference in the rates of hematuria and&#xD;
      hematospermia between placebo and finasteride treatment groups. We will also examine for any&#xD;
      statistically significant relationships between study groups (placebo versus finasteride) and&#xD;
      concern regarding hematuria/hematospermia, satisfaction with/tolerability of the biopsy,&#xD;
      concern with prostate cancer transmission, sexual/urinary function, and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified as potential participants for this study in the office of Dr.&#xD;
      Pommerville. Dr. Pommerville will identify subjects from within his urology practice as&#xD;
      needing a TRUS biopsy out of medical necessity for reasons unrelated to enrollment in this&#xD;
      study. The indications for prostate biopsy are usually based on clinical suspicion using a&#xD;
      combination of digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen blood testing. Once&#xD;
      identified as potential candidates for participation in this study, Dr. Pommerville will give&#xD;
      the potential subject a detailed explanation of the study and will explain the content in the&#xD;
      informed consent form. Once the patient has read the consent form and understands what the&#xD;
      study entails, they will make a decision whether or not to enroll in this study. Once&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be assigned a unique identification number,&#xD;
      which will not be used for any other purposes. This identification code will have features&#xD;
      that allow the code to be broken in an emergency situation. At this time, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the placebo or treatments groups in a double blind fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a three week supply of 5mg of finasteride or placebo and detailed&#xD;
      instructions on how they are to take their medication/placebo. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      take their medication/placebo, one tablet (5mg) of finasteride/placebo orally each day for&#xD;
      two weeks prior to biopsy and one week following. This will be in addition to the standard of&#xD;
      care that is normally given with prostate biopsy (antibiotics, enema). They will be given an&#xD;
      appointment to undergo prostate biopsy in two weeks. Subjects will be instructed that if they&#xD;
      decide to withdraw from this study, they may do so at any time, and return the unused&#xD;
      medication to Dr. Pommerville's office at follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo TRUS prostate biopsy two weeks later as part of their standard&#xD;
      medical care at either the Royal Jubilee Hospital or Victoria General Hospital. Equipment and&#xD;
      procedures will not differ between these sites. Patients will be followed up at this point by&#xD;
      Dr. Pommerville on their participation and adherence to study protocol. If subjects have not&#xD;
      been compliant with the protocol, they will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive repeat instructions on taking their medication and released as would be expected as&#xD;
      part of the standard of care for prostate biopsies. They will be given an appointment for two&#xD;
      weeks from the TRUS biopsy to see Dr. Pommerville in his clinic. They will be reminded to&#xD;
      come to the clinic approximately 20 minutes prior to their appointment time so that Nathan&#xD;
      Hoag (Medical student) may administer a questionnaire in accordance with what was described&#xD;
      to them by the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will present for their scheduled two week follow up appointment to Dr. Pommerville's&#xD;
      office. This practice is in accordance with the normal standard of care. Nathan Hoag will&#xD;
      administer the subject questionnaire at this point. Questionnaires will be administered prior&#xD;
      to subjects seeing Dr. Pommerville for biopsy results in an effort to minimize emotional&#xD;
      influence on the results of the questionnaire. This is the last visit in the standard medical&#xD;
      care for prostate biopsy. Subjects are instructed to follow up with Dr. Pommerville or their&#xD;
      family physicians should they have additional concerns. At this time, subjects will be&#xD;
      reminded that they are to return to Dr. Pommerville's office in an additional two weeks,&#xD;
      where the medical student will administer the questionnaire for a second time to monitor any&#xD;
      ongoing changes (4 weeks since procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the patient questionnaire, previously described grading systems will be used&#xD;
      to quantify the incidence and severity of hematuria and hematospermia among subjects at two&#xD;
      and four weeks.18,19 Hematospermia grading systems quantify hematospermia as mild (less than&#xD;
      7 days), moderate (7 to 14 days), and severe (more than 14 days). Hematuria is defined as&#xD;
      grossly passing blood or blood clots in the urine. Hematuria is stratified using minor&#xD;
      episodes (lasting 24 hours or less), moderate episodes (lasting more than 24 hours, but not&#xD;
      requiring hospital admission), and severe episodes (clot retention and hospital admission).&#xD;
      Hematuria will then be graded according to the following system: grade 0 (no gross&#xD;
      hematuria), grade 1 (up to 2 minor episodes or 1 moderate episode), grade 2 (more than 2&#xD;
      minor episodes or 1 moderate episode), grade 3 (1 or more severe episodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the conclusion of the study for subjects. They will be reminded that they are&#xD;
      free to contact Nathan Hoag should they have any concerns or questions. They will also be&#xD;
      reminded that they may follow up with Dr. Pommerville or their family physicians should they&#xD;
      need to.&#xD;
