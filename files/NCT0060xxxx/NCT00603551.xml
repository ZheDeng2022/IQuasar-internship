      The hypothesis is that postmenopausal women who have received chemotherapy have a greater&#xD;
      bone loss than the same age controls. The aim of this study is to obtain baseline bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) data on women with breast and gynecological cancers who have received&#xD;
      chemotherapy. By comparing the Z scores of postmenopausal women who have received&#xD;
      chemotherapy with age matched controls this hypothesis can be evaluated. Another goal of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the T-score of a Heel Bone Density Scan to the T-score of the DXA Scan to&#xD;
      see if there is a good correlation between peripheral and DXA scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that women who develop breast cancer have an increased bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD) probably due to endogenous estrogen production. After menopause, BMD decreases&#xD;
      rather rapidly particularly during the first years after natural menopause. Bone loss&#xD;
      typically is more rapid and severe in a premature induced menopause (surgical,&#xD;
      chemotherapeutically, or hormonal). The bone loss appears to be more rapid and at an earlier&#xD;
      age which advances bone age to a greater degree than actual age. Chemotherapeutically-induced&#xD;
      menopause accelerates this process by an average of 10 years. GnRH agonist in premenopausal&#xD;
      women causes amenorrhea in &gt;95% with associated loss of both cortical and trabecular bone. In&#xD;
      women undergoing ovarian ablation therapy, losses in bone mass as high as 13% have been&#xD;
      reported in the first year of treatment. Premenopausal women who by treatment become&#xD;
      amenorrheic remain amenorrheic posttreatment in the vast majority of cases. Adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for cancer can exaggerate bone mineral density loss. Chemotherapy may have an effect on&#xD;
      estrogen levels but may also have an effect on bone loss via direct cytotoxic effect on bone&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is data concerning BMD in patients who have received chemotherapy as children&#xD;
      and in men with prostate cancer, there is very little data concerning BMD in gynecologic&#xD;
      oncology patients who have received chemotherapy. Several different chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      have been incriminated in their effects on the bone mineral density. The alkylating drugs,&#xD;
      particularly Cytoxan, have been shown to decrease bone mineral density. Methotrexate and more&#xD;
      recently the taxanes appear to have the same effect. Since most chemotherapy today is given&#xD;
      as a combination, one or more of the cytoxic agents on the bone are included and therefore&#xD;
      this study will evaluate any postmenopausal women who has received chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women participating in this study will undergo two scans: a Heel Scan which measures the bone&#xD;
      mineral density in the heel area and a DXA scan which measures bone mineral density in the&#xD;
      lumbar region of the spine and the hip. Both scans provide a T-score and a Z-score for the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;

        The study population consists of postmenopausal women with breast or gynecological cancers&#xD;
        who were treated with chemotherapy. The subjects either received their chemotherapy or&#xD;
        follow-up at the Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina.&#xD;
