    <textblock>
      This study will examine how successfully nerves are blocked or frozen for hand surgery.&#xD;
      Traditionally, the nerves are frozen at the base of the neck, just above the clavicle or&#xD;
      collarbone (the supraclavicular block). This is mostly successful by itself, and provides&#xD;
      anesthesia of the entire arm. Occasionally, an additional nerve block is required further&#xD;
      down the arm, as the supraclavicular block may have missed a segment, or it is taking too&#xD;
      long to come on. In this study the investigators will compare the traditional technique, with&#xD;
      a similar but lower volume supraclavicular block plus an immediate low volume block of one&#xD;
      nerve further down the arm (the ulnar or median nerve block, depending on which digits are&#xD;
      being operated on). The investigators will compare success rates, speed of onset, procedural&#xD;
      comfort and length of time of weakness and numbness, plus any adverse events.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia is commonly employed for surgery on the hand. It is well tolerated by&#xD;
      most patients and has a high safety record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common form of regional anesthesia for this surgery is the supraclavicular block&#xD;
      which is successful in most cases. Occasionally an additional nerve block and/or moderate&#xD;
      sedation is required. The most frequent additional nerve blocks required are for the ulnar&#xD;
      and median nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to address whether a low volume supraclavicular block plus a selective ulnar&#xD;
      or median nerve block reduces the time taken for onset of anesthesia, reduces the time of&#xD;
      post-operative complete limb immobility, improves the surgical success of the block, and&#xD;
      increases patient satisfaction, compared to a standard block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be powered to detect a 25% difference in successful surgical anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ascertain whether the addition of an ulnar or median nerve block to a lower volume&#xD;
      supraclavicular block speeds up the onset and consistency of anesthesia, and the return of&#xD;
      limb function in patients undergoing hand surgery when compared to a standard supraclavicular&#xD;
      block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low volume supraclavicular block plus selective distal nerve blocks will speed up the onset&#xD;
      of anesthesia, improve surgical anesthetic success and decrease the time to the return of&#xD;
      upper limb function when compared to a standard supraclavicular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years of age, listed for hand surgery in the ulnar or median distribution at&#xD;
      the University of Alberta Hospital. The study will commence following ethical approval and&#xD;
      will run until 160 patients are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to amide local anesthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilateral upper limb surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery involving bone graft from the iliac crest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Request for general anesthetic from surgical or research team (for example, nerve&#xD;
           stimulation studies)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained by one of the investigators. Patients not wishing to participate in&#xD;
      the study will receive either a brachial plexus block or a general anesthetic as deemed&#xD;
      appropriate by the attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients to undergo surgery on the ring or pinky fingers will be randomised to receive either&#xD;
      a standard supraclavicular block, or a low volume supraclavicular block plus ulnar nerve&#xD;
      block. Patients receiving surgery on the thumb, index, or middle fingers will be randomized&#xD;
      in a similar fashion to a separate &quot;median&quot; group. All blocks will be placed in a designated&#xD;
      block area prior to transfer to the operating room by either an experienced staff&#xD;
      anesthesiologist or a supervised fellow in regional anesthesia. The block will be assessed&#xD;
      prior to surgery for motor and sensory dysfunction, and the block may be augmented if&#xD;
      necessary. The surgeon will determine the effectiveness of the surgical anesthesia, and will&#xD;
      indicate a need for surgical local anesthetic top up, heavy sedation or general anesthesia to&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist. Sedation can also be administered as per patient request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, a patient satisfaction questionnaire will be completed. A phone call will&#xD;
      be conducted the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Successful surgical anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to successful anesthetic block&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedural time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Duration of weakness&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blocks have been performed for many years, with a low&#xD;
      complication rate. The addition of a peripheral nerve block is not uncommon, and poses&#xD;
      minimal additional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pneumothorax&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nerve damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intravascular injection causing local anesthetic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Block failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transient hemidiaphragmatic paresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transient Horner's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Haematoma at injection site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to the block area. Midazolam will be titrated to an appropriate&#xD;
      level. A time out procedure will be undertaken to ensure the correct side is being blocked.&#xD;
      The skin will be disinfected. The ultrasound probe will scan the supraclavicular fossa to&#xD;
      identify the subclavian artery. The brachial plexus is identified postero-lateral to the&#xD;
      artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard supraclavicular block&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin will be infiltrated with lidocaine. A needle attached to a nerve stimulator will be&#xD;
      introduced. The target will be an area infero-medial to the brachial plexus. In this position&#xD;
      10 - 20 ml of a 3:1 Lidocaine 2%: 0.5% Bupivacaine solution is injected. A more superficial&#xD;
      injection is then made. A further 10-20 mls of the Lidocaine:Bupivacaine solution is&#xD;
      deposited. The total volume will be recorded with a maximum of 30mls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low volume supraclavicular block with ulnar nerve block&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin infiltration and target of the needle is the same as for the standard&#xD;
      supraclavicular block. However, a maximum of 15ml of the solution will be injected. The arm&#xD;
      is then abducted and supinated. The ulnar artery is identified. The ulnar nerve is seen&#xD;
      medial to the artery. 5ml of the solution is deposited adjacent to the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low volume supraclavicular block with median nerve block&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin infiltration and target of the needle is the same as for the standard&#xD;
      supraclavicular block. However, a maximum of 15ml of the solution will be injected. The&#xD;
      patient's elbow is flexed and the nerve is visualized on ultrasound in the antecubital fossa&#xD;
      lying medial to the brachial artery. Anesthetic solution is deposited in the forearm to&#xD;
      target the median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following block assessment, the patient will be transferred to the operating theatre.&#xD;
      Additional midazolam may be given. Propofol at 50mcg/kg/minute will be commenced if required,&#xD;
      and the rate can be increased to 75mcg/kg/minute. If the patient is unable to tolerate the&#xD;
      procedure, sedation can be increased to at least 100mcg/kg/minute and the block is deemed an&#xD;
      unsuccessful surgical block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for sensory and motor blockade of each nerve at 5 minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful anesthetic block will be defined as a sensation score in the ulnar or median&#xD;
      area of 0 or 1, and an ulnar or median motor score of 2 or less. If this does not occur in&#xD;
      the standard group, an ulnar or median nerve block will be performed. If this does not occur&#xD;
      in the combined group, a general anesthetic will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve block extent may also be assessed by objective means (e.g., strength testing with a&#xD;
      dynamometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful surgical block will be defined as requiring no further LA top-up or&#xD;
      infiltration, and sedation no greater than 75mcg/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on a study sheet. Information will be kept confidential and there will&#xD;
      be no patient identifiers on the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will be age, sex, height and weight, the type of block used, the amount of&#xD;
      local anesthetic used, the length of time taken to perform all blocks, the block assessment&#xD;
      data. Intraoperative data will note whether additional local anaesthetic, heavy sedation or&#xD;
      general anesthesia was required and the reason. Post-operative data will be a patient&#xD;
      questionnaire asking about block-related and surgery-related pain score. A follow up phone&#xD;
      call the day after surgery will determine the timing of return of power and sensation of the&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
