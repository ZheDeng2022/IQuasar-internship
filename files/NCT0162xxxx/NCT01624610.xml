  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if the diets often recommended for patients with&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) provide adequate relief. The study will&#xD;
      compare two diets that are used to treat IBS-D symptoms to see which one is more effective.&#xD;
      The study will also measure the effect of these diets on the bowel flora, which are the good&#xD;
      bacteria that inhabit the bowels in healthy people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are often refractory to conventional therapies,&#xD;
      there has been increasing interest in the role of diet in IBS. Certain foods may exacerbate&#xD;
      symptoms of IBS. Thus, restricted diets have recently gained attention for the treatment IBS.&#xD;
      The mechanism by which symptoms are improved is unclear, but these diets may improve symptoms&#xD;
      by exerting changes on the GI microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Compare the proportion of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) reporting adequate&#xD;
      relief on Diet 1 vs Diet 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effects of these diets in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS on the&#xD;
           gastrointestinal microbiota and blood based biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the efficacy of Diet 1 vs Diet 2 in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS on&#xD;
           pre-specified clinical and quality of life endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized control trial of adults meeting the Rome III criteria for&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). After a 2 week screening period and&#xD;
      randomization, during which the severity of symptoms will be assessed and eligibility&#xD;
      determined, patients will be randomized to Diet 1 vs Diet 2 for a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be a comparison of the proportion of patients in each group&#xD;
      reporting adequate relief of their IBS symptoms. For the secondary clinical outcomes, a&#xD;
      responder definition incorporating abdominal pain and stool consistency as proposed by the&#xD;
      FDA will be utilized. Key IBS-D symptoms will be assessed daily and adequate relief of IBS-D&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed weekly during the randomization period. We will also determine if a&#xD;
      difference can be detected with high probability in the relative abundance and variety of&#xD;
      specific bacterial taxa between the two groups before and after the 4 week dietary&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, blood samples will be collected before and after randomization to&#xD;
      measure relevant biomarkers of immune activation.&#xD;

    <description>Composite endpoint: A responder will report a ≥30% reduction in mean daily abdominal pain score and a decrease in mean daily BSFS value of ≥1 compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the 2 groups will be compared.</description>

    <description>An abdominal pain responder will report a ≥30% reduction in mean daily abdominal pain score compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the two groups will be compared. Between group differences in the proportion of patients with a ≥30% reduction in mean daily abdominal pain score compared to baseline at the end of each treatment week will also be assessed.</description>

    <description>For stool consistency, a responder will be defined as one who reports a decrease in mean daily BSFS value of 1 or more compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the 2 groups will be compared. Between group differences in the proportion of patients with a decrease in BSFS value of ≥1 compared to baseline at the end of each treatment week will also be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of these 2 diets on the gut microbiome (number and species) in the context of IBS is not known. A change in the microbiota may be a mechanism through which symptom response is mediated.&#xD;
We will be measuring the shift in the relative abundance (richness) and variety (diversity) of gut microbial taxa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in response to dietary intervention. Stool microbiome would be collected and analyzed using the PhyloChip™ Assay (Second Genome Inc., San Bruno, CA).</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Recent attempts have been made to identify a serological biomarker profile (Prometheus Therapeutics &amp; Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) which accurately identifies patients with IBS. We intend to perform a biomarker test panel at enrollment in all study subjects to assess whether specific combinations of biomarkers can positively or negatively predict response to either diet.</description>
