      The purpose of this study is to combine treatment options for tattoo removal in an attempt to&#xD;
      completely remove a tattoo in one visit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficient tattoo removal is of special concern to dermatology, where tattoo removal is a&#xD;
      common request. Current tattoo removal techniques using once monthly treatment with&#xD;
      quality-switched (QS) lasers are relatively effective, but not efficient. Numerous treatments&#xD;
      are required and complete removal of ink is usually rare, making the process time-consuming,&#xD;
      expensive and, sometimes, disappointing. The broad objective of this study is to combine&#xD;
      effective methods for tattoo removal based on current knowledge to establish a protocol which&#xD;
      significantly improves laser tattoo removal, aiming to selectively remove most tattoos in one&#xD;
      office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective, side-by-side comparison of four tattoo treatment&#xD;
      protocols using a combination of ablative fractional and q-switched (QS) laser techniques. 32&#xD;
      subjects with tattoos recruited from the community will receive all four treatments, one on&#xD;
      each randomly-assigned, equal quadrant of the same tattoo. The different treatment protocols&#xD;
      are as follows: 1. one round of QS laser treatment, which is the current treatment standard&#xD;
      2. four repeat treatments with the QS laser with a 20 minute delay in between 3. four repeat&#xD;
      treatments at 20 minute intervals with the QS laser combined with an ablative fractional&#xD;
      laser treatment 4. four repeat treatments at 20 minute intervals with the QS laser plus&#xD;
      treatment with the ablative fractional laser, in combination with topical urea application.&#xD;
      Following this initial round of treatments, the subject will have the option to choose his or&#xD;
      her preferred treatment protocol which will then be used to treat the entire tattoo again one&#xD;
      month later. Previous studies indicate that the majority of tattoos will be completely or&#xD;
      nearly completely removed in this study, providing a potential benefit to those who enroll in&#xD;
      the study. The primary measures of efficacy are (a) blinded evaluation of improvement from&#xD;
      standard digital photographs taken before and after the treatments, including number of&#xD;
      tattoos that are completely gone, and (b) digital analysis of tattoo removal from those&#xD;
      photos. Other study endpoints include patient's preferred removal technique, evaluation of&#xD;
      tattoo ink on dressings, inflammatory and pigmentary alterations and changes in skin texture.&#xD;
