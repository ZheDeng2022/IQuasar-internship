      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers at the National Institutes of Health give many tests of hearing and balance.&#xD;
      These tests can help detect problems that affect hearing or balance. It is important to know&#xD;
      exactly how healthy people perform on each of these tests. This information will indicate&#xD;
      when a test result is normal and when a test result shows a problem. Researchers also want to&#xD;
      determine the best methods for each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test different types of hearing and balance tests, and collect information on normal&#xD;
      values for each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 5 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will require a single visit to the National Institutes of Health Clinical&#xD;
           Center. It will include both screening tests and study tests of hearing and balance.&#xD;
           Sometimes, a second visit may be required if a test is designed to measure the same&#xD;
           thing on 2 different days. Each visit will last between 2 and 5 hours, depending on the&#xD;
           number of tests scheduled per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will also have basic&#xD;
           tests to check for normal hearing and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have different hearing tests, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Auditory Evoked Potentials to study how the ears and brain handle sound information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Auditory Processing Tests to study how a person processes complex sounds like speech in&#xD;
           background noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of middle ear and inner ear function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have different balance and inner ear tests, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balance test on a tilting platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different tests to measure how well the eyes, ears, and brain work together to help&#xD;
           maintain balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be needed as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a normative data collection protocol. The primary objective is to establish the&#xD;
      normative range of data for the NIH research population on tests of auditory and vestibular&#xD;
      function that employ parameters and/or methodologies that are either new or unique to the&#xD;
      NIH, have been upgraded (software and/or hardware), or have not been well standardized in the&#xD;
      literature. Use of the normative data will be two-fold: 1) it will serve as a reference&#xD;
      interval of normal performance by which test results can be interpreted as normal or abnormal&#xD;
      and, in some cases 2) it will be used as control data for the purpose of comparison to data&#xD;
      obtained in various patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives, when applicable, are to evaluate: 1) the effect of a change in&#xD;
      methodology, stimulus characteristics, test equipment, or test paradigm on normative data for&#xD;
      existing measures, 2) the influence of subject age and gender on normative data, and 3)&#xD;
      intra-subject variability on repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol provides the construct for small, targeted normative studies and, subsequently,&#xD;
      there are no specific a priori hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ranging in age from 5-80 years will be studied under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to collect normative data on tests of audiometric and vestibular&#xD;
      function. Small sub-studies will be conducted on healthy volunteers in order to determine the&#xD;
      normal distribution of performance on defined subsets of hearing and/or balance tests. These&#xD;
      sub-studies will fall into one of the following five general categories: serial monitoring of&#xD;
      auditory function, auditory evoked potentials, auditory processing, middle ear function, and&#xD;
      vestibular function. All participants will have a basic hearing test and tympanometry to&#xD;
      confirm eligibility for the protocol. The subsequent measures of auditory or vestibular&#xD;
      function will depend on the defined subset of tests for which normative data is being sought.&#xD;
      Possible tests for normal data collection would include: middle ear function tests (MEF),&#xD;
      otoacoustic emissions (OAE), auditory evoked potentials (AEP), tests of auditory processing&#xD;
      (AP), computerized dynamic platform posturography (CDPP), vestibular evoked myogenic&#xD;
      potentials (VEMP), videonystagmography (VNG) and/or rotational vestibular testing (RVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of tests for each sub-study will be determined either by the need to establish&#xD;
      control data for a patient population currently being evaluated under a collaborative&#xD;
      protocol, or to establish normative data on a test that will further expand our ability to&#xD;
      investigate specific pathology/function for which no equivalent published normative data are&#xD;
      available (e.g., otolith disease, auditory processing disorders). The specific tests that&#xD;
      each participant will perform will be clearly indicated and described in the consent/assent&#xD;
      documents and will be explained during the consent/assent process. Testing will be conducted&#xD;
      during a single outpatient clinic visit with the exception of measures for which test-retest&#xD;
      reliability is being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a normative data collection protocol designed to describe normal behavioral and&#xD;
      physiologic auditory and vestibular function for the NIH research population. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will vary from test to test and include one or more of the following: 1) response&#xD;
      threshold, amplitude, latency, velocity, frequency response, and/or accuracy, 2) number&#xD;
      and/or percent correct, 3) response repeatability, and 4) interaural response differences.&#xD;
