      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common form of liver disease in the United&#xD;
      States. It includes many conditions. Researchers want to study fatty liver disease by looking&#xD;
      at people who have liver cirrhosis. They also want to look at people who are or were listed&#xD;
      for liver transplants. Genetic studies may provide more information on the causes of these&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study possible genetic causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals of any age who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for genetic testing. Liver tissue from a&#xD;
           transplant or biopsy may also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also be asked to have an imaging study of the liver. This imaging study&#xD;
           may be an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this research study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the&#xD;
      United States. It includes a wide spectrum of conditions from benign hepatic steatosis to&#xD;
      cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term that describes&#xD;
      specific histological characteristics of liver inflammation and seems to be a determinant&#xD;
      step in the progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and liver failure. The overall purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to increase our understanding of the genetic background and pathophysiology of NAFLD&#xD;
      through detailed review of physical, radiologic and pathology characteristics, when&#xD;
      available. We will perform genetic analysis of known and candidate genes and will assess&#xD;
      inheritance through evaluation of unaffected relatives. Most patients will be seen by&#xD;
      hepatologists in transplant centers and hepatology clinics across the country. A subset of&#xD;
      patients and their families may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

        Although a liver biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis of NASH, patients with&#xD;
        radiologic evidence of fatty liver and/or cirrhosis in which other causes have been ruled&#xD;
        out are eligible to participate. Patients who have already undergone liver transplantation&#xD;
        for a confirmed diagnosis of NAFLD orcryptogenic cirrhosis are also eligible to&#xD;
        participate.Direct blood relatives (typically parents and siblings) of affected individuals&#xD;
        with NAFLD and associated conditions are also eligible to participate.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Although a liver biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis of NASH, patients with&#xD;
                  radiologic evidence of fatty liver and/or cirrhosis in which other causes have&#xD;
                  been ruled out are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients who have already undergone liver transplantation for a confirmed&#xD;
                  diagnosis of NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis are also eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Depending on their willingness to participate, subjects may enroll in DNA&#xD;
                  laboratory-only or clinical-only. However, to conserve resources and meet study&#xD;
                  objectives, subjects with known pathogenic mutations will be given priority in&#xD;
                  selection for extensive clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Direct blood relatives (typically parents and siblings) of affected individuals&#xD;
                  with NAFLD and associated conditions are also eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant women. Although fatty liver and cirrhosis are sometimes diagnosed during&#xD;
             pregnancy, it is unclear if they were present before and just not diagnosed or if they&#xD;
             develop as a complication of pregnancy. Additionally energy metabolism changes during&#xD;
             pregnancy and lactation which may confound our analysis. If the condition persists&#xD;
             after pregnancy and the diagnosis of NAFLD is&#xD;
&#xD;
             clearly established, patients can be referred to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. We will review a clinical description from the referring physician about a potential&#xD;
             research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into the study.&#xD;
             We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not NAFLD or related to our&#xD;
             direct research interests (e.g. fatty liver induced by chronic alcohol use, infectious&#xD;
             causes, drug-related, or toxin-related). This almost never happens. However, as some&#xD;
             of these environmental factors may contribute to a multifactorial etiology of hepatic&#xD;
             changes, we may not exclude all such cases.&#xD;
