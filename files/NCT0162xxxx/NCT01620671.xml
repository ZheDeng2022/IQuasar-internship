  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of &quot;enhanced recovery after surgery&quot; has become increasingly popular in elective&#xD;
      abdominal surgeries. Yet, the role of this concept has not been described in emergency&#xD;
      procedures. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of fast-track surgery&#xD;
      in patients with perforated peptic ulcer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, controlled clinical study. The patients with a&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer will be recruited for the study. Among&#xD;
      those, the patients with a definitive diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer confirmed by&#xD;
      surgical exploration will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized according to their protocol number given automatically by the&#xD;
      registration system of the hospital during admission. The patients who have an odd protocol&#xD;
      number will have conventional surgical protocol, and those who have an even protocol number&#xD;
      will have fast-track surgery protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional surgical protocol for perforated peptic ulcers is composed of regular&#xD;
      general anesthesia, postoperative pain control by intravenous analgesics, removal of&#xD;
      nasogastric tube by the end of 48th postoperative hour, initiation of oral intake after&#xD;
      clinical signs of active bowel movement is observed. Fast-track surgery protocol, however, is&#xD;
      composed of general anesthesia with short-acting agents and the use of regional anesthesia if&#xD;
      possible, removal of nasogastric tube during recovery from anesthesia, aggressive pain&#xD;
      control, initiation of oral intake by the end of 48th postoperative hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be scheduled for control gastroscopy in the end of six weeks after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point is the morbidity and mortality rate. Secondary end-points are length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, readmission rate, endoscopic findings in control gastroscopy.&#xD;
