    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and the best dose of dinaciclib when&#xD;
      given together with epirubicin hydrochloride (epirubicin) in patients with metastatic (cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other parts of the body) triple-negative breast cancer. Dinaciclib is&#xD;
      designed to stop cancer cells from dividing into new cancer cells. Epirubicin is designed to&#xD;
      block the way cancer cells grow and divide and may slow or stop cancer cells from spreading&#xD;
      throughout the body. Researchers want to find out what is the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      experimental drug dinaciclib that can be given in combination with epirubicin in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dinaciclib given in combination with&#xD;
      epirubicin in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the predictive value of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein (MCL-1), low&#xD;
      molecular weight cyclin E (LMW-E), and tumor grade as predictors of biologic response (i.e.&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis) in tumors treated with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy. III. To determine the effects of therapy&#xD;
      on proliferation as measured by proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) and apoptosis as&#xD;
      measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay&#xD;
      (TUNEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dinaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dinaciclib intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and epirubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A logistic regression model will be used to assess whether the expression level of LMW-E can predict clinical benefit, adjusted for dose level and other potential prognostic factors: visceral organ involvement (present vs. absent), number of prior therapies for metastatic breast cancer (0-2 or &gt; 2), age (&lt; 60 vs. &gt; 60) and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs. 2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]), assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall clinical benefit rate for patients treated at the MTD will be estimated with a 90% credible interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in proliferation as measured by Ki67 and apoptosis as measured by TUNEL</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the patients with pre- and post- treatment biopsies, summary statistics used to describe change in apoptotic index pre- to post-treatment, and boxplots to illustrate distribution pre- and post-treatment, as well as distribution of change. Mean change estimated with 95% confidence interval. MCL-1, LMW-E, and Ki67 similarly analyzed. Analyses also performed stratified by tumor grade. Correlation between changes in MCL-1 and LMW-E pre- to post-treatment estimated with 95% confidence interval. Number of tumors in 4 categories (negative, low, medium, high) tabulated by % of TUNEL+ tumor cells.</description>
