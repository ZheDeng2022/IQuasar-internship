      Pain following laparoscopic surgery continues to be a clinically important problem with 80%&#xD;
      or more patients requiring opioid analgesia post-operatively to control their pain. By&#xD;
      reducing this surgical complication patients can experience less discomfort and be discharged&#xD;
      from the recovery room more rapidly leading to reduced resource utilization and expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Post-operative pain after laparoscopic procedures could be treated by topical&#xD;
      anesthetics sprayed directly into the abdomen (inside the abdominal cavity, on the nerve&#xD;
      endings of the visceral peritoneal lining and diaphragm surface) via the surgical incision&#xD;
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trial on use of topical anesthetic (namely 0.25% ropivacaine)&#xD;
      delivered directly onto the target sites both at the beginning and the end of surgery in&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic procedure for uterine or adnexal benign&#xD;
      pathology. The drug will be delivered using a CE approved delivery system that will direct a&#xD;
      fine mist of drug directly to the areas of the peritoneal cavity that are theoretically the&#xD;
      cause of post-op pain (diaphragms, peritoneal abdominal surface, surgical dissection site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOAL: to assess the efficacy of intraperitoneal topical anesthesia in reducing postoperative&#xD;
      pain, opioid requirements in patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic procedure for&#xD;
      uterine or adnexal benign pathology&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic surgery has replaced open surgical techniques for a large number of abdominal&#xD;
      general surgical and gynecologic interventions. However pain following laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      continues to be a clinically important problem with 80% or more patients requiring opioid&#xD;
      analgesia post-operatively to control their pain. Post-operative pain and to a lesser extent&#xD;
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the main factors leading to delayed discharge&#xD;
      from the surgical recovery room and from the hospital following most surgical cases. Hence,&#xD;
      post-operative pain and PONV lead to increased costs of care. By reducing these surgical&#xD;
      complications patients can be discharged from the recovery room more rapidly leading to&#xD;
      reduced resource utilization and expense. This is especially true for routine surgical cases&#xD;
      (laparoscopic cholecystectomy -gallbladder removal, gynecologic procedures, gastric surgery)&#xD;
      that have the potential for same day surgery and discharge to home if their pain can be&#xD;
      adequately treated. It also applies to inpatient cases where superior pain control and less&#xD;
      PONV require less nursing care and potentially earlier discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin of pain after laparoscopic surgery is multifactorial with pain arising from the&#xD;
      incision site, direct trauma in the area of surgical dissection, peritoneal micro-tears and&#xD;
      inflammation due stretching during insufflation and peritoneal and diaphragm irritation of&#xD;
      from the residual CO2 remaining after the pneumoperitoneum is deflated. Because this pain is&#xD;
      multifactorial - a multifactorial approach is needed. Although the somatic pain associated&#xD;
      with the abdominal wall incision responds well to nerve blocks or opiate medications,&#xD;
      visceral pain due to pneumoperitoneum induced stretching, compression, oxygen deprivation and&#xD;
      inflammation during the surgery is less responsive to these interventions. However, visceral&#xD;
      pain can be treated by topical anesthetics sprayed directly onto the nerve endings of the&#xD;
      visceral peritoneal lining and diaphragm surface. This knowledge has resulted in extensive&#xD;
      research studying the effects of applying topical anesthetics to the peritoneal surface&#xD;
      during laparoscopic surgery in an effort to reduce post-operative pain and its attendant&#xD;
      complications. Fairly clear conclusions can be drawn from review of the research&#xD;
      investigating topical anesthetic application to the peritoneum, diaphragms and surgical site:&#xD;
      they effectively reduce postoperative pain and opioid use. They do not have any of the&#xD;
      adverse effects of systemically administered opioids such as sedation, respiratory&#xD;
      depression, nausea, or GI dysmotility. They are safe and relatively inexpensive. Their use&#xD;
      results in earlier progression to ambulation, less shoulder tip pain, less post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, earlier discharge from the recovery room and in some studies earlier&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this research and international recommendations to use this therapy topical&#xD;
      anesthetic application during laparoscopic surgery is not routinely used by most general or&#xD;
      obstetrical surgeons. There are probably two inter-related reasons for this lack of adoption&#xD;
      of this simple concept. First, no simple method exists for delivering topical anesthetics to&#xD;
      the peritoneal surface. Most studies diluted the drug with large volumes of saline (making it&#xD;
      less potent and less likely to work), then injected it into a trocar where gravity took the&#xD;
      solution straight into the gravity dependent gutters. This type of delivery system would not&#xD;
      be expected to optimize results of any topically active medication since the majority of the&#xD;
      peritoneal surface is never exposed to the anesthetic. Secondly, the pain reductions reported&#xD;
      in most topical anesthetic studies were positive but not impressive enough for surgeons to&#xD;
      change practice. This marginal reduction in post-operative pain is probably due to these poor&#xD;
      delivery systems with non-directed application of the drug and the great variations in drug&#xD;
      concentrations, site of delivery, and timing of application. Studies that used more directed&#xD;
      spray seem to show better results. A 2010 metaanalysis concludes that future studies should&#xD;
      not be designed to determine if topical intraperitoneal local anesthesia is effective (this&#xD;
      is already proven), rather this research should focus on optimization of the method of&#xD;
      delivery (aerosolized), location of application, timing of drug delivery, and drug dose and&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to address these issues. The investigators will use topical anesthetic&#xD;
      (namely 0.25% ropivacaine) delivered directly onto the target sites both at the beginning and&#xD;
      the end of surgery. The drug will be delivered using an inexpensive delivery system that will&#xD;
      direct a fine mist of drug directly to the areas of the peritoneal cavity that are&#xD;
      theoretically the cause of post-op pain (diaphragms, peritoneal abdominal surface, surgical&#xD;
      dissection site). Our primary goal is to assess the efficacy of intraperitoneal topical&#xD;
      anesthesia in reducing postoperative pain, opioid requirements in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic gynecologic laparoscopic procedure for uterus or adnexal benign pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to ropivicaine 0.25% 40 ml (100 mg) or placebo (NaCl 0.9%)&#xD;
      according to a randomization list stratified by pathology delivered in the following fashion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the derma at the portal sites will each be injected with 2 ml of medication at the onset&#xD;
           of the surgery (total volume 6 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  following insufflation of the abdomen, half of the remaining ropivacaine will be&#xD;
           atomized onto each subdiaphragmatic area (3.5ml + 3.5ml), onto the surgical dissection&#xD;
           site (3 ml) and diffusely across the peritoneal surface (dome of the abdomen and surface&#xD;
           of the visible bowel) (7ml). At the end of the case the remaining medication with be&#xD;
           atomized again onto the same areas, using the same volumes.&#xD;

      surgical evaluation (the night prior or morning of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. A standard anesthetic procedure will be conducted for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-medication with midazolam 0.03mg/kg I.V.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction with propofol 2 mg/kg. Maintenance with propofol 6mg/kg/h I.V.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle relaxation with cisatracurium, reversal with neostigmine and atropine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative analgesia will be standardized and administered by the anesthesiologist&#xD;
           to all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fentanyl 2mcg/kg I.V. at induction, then 2mcg/kg 5 min before surgical incision and&#xD;
                2mcg/kg 30 minutes prior to the end of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Remifentanil 0.1-0.3 mcg/kg/min I.V.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acetaminophen 1g I.V. and Ketoprofen 100 mg I.V. will be administered 30 minutes&#xD;
                prior to the end of surgery 4. A standard intra-operative antiemetic (Ondansetron 4&#xD;
                mg I.V.) will be administered by anesthesia 15 minutes prior to end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                5. All laparoscopies will be performed in a standardized fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Pneumoperitoneum by open technique (insufflation pressure 20 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Insertion of 3 trocars&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Intraabdominal pressure maintained at 12 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Uterine or ovarian surgical procedure in a standardized fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
                     6. All study drug delivery will be performed in a standardized fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
                a. All port sites will be injected with 2 ml/each study drug prior to trocar&#xD;
                insertion b. Immediately following insufflation the Optispray surgical spray device&#xD;
                will be inserted into the abdomen and directed towards the diaphragms, dome of&#xD;
                inflated abdomen, bowel peritoneum and surgical dissection site and the study drug&#xD;
                will be delivered as an atomized spray in the following volumes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each subdiaphragmatic area 3.5 ml + 3.5ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgical dissection site 3 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diffusely across the peritoneal surface (dome of the abdomen and surface of the visible&#xD;
           bowel) 7 ml. At the end of the case the remaining medication with be atomized again onto&#xD;
           the same areas, using the same volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. At the end of the case - this process will be repeated with the remaining drug (no&#xD;
           repeat port site injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Postoperative analgesics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will receive Acetaminophen 1g I.V. 6h after surgery, then acetaminophen 1g per&#xD;
           os every 8h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rescue analgesic will be Tramadol 100mg in 50 ml of 0.9% saline I.V., preceded by I.V.&#xD;
           0.01mg/kg droperidol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. Rescue post-operative antiemetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ondansetron 4mg I.V. (Maximal for 3 times/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection procedure Data will be collected by investigator and stored in the&#xD;
      Dipartimento di Scienze Ginecologiche e della Riproduzione Umana. Electronic datasets will be&#xD;
      prepared including only anonymous data. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS&#xD;
      v.18 computer program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only risk to the patient from this study is the risk of local anesthetic toxicity. The&#xD;
      toxicity of local anesthetics includes seizures and ventricular arrhythmias. At the currently&#xD;
      selected doses this is very low probability for the following reasons: the doses selected are&#xD;
      below the toxic doses described by the package insert for injected ropivacaine, and yet this&#xD;
      dose in not being injected rather it is being sprayed onto the peritoneal surface. While&#xD;
      there is no question some of the drug will be absorbed, this will occur over time and the&#xD;
      peak levels will not achieve that expected when a drug is injected I.V.. Finally, prior&#xD;
      literature studies have used similar doses and do not describe any toxicity in their patients&#xD;
      nor toxic serum concentrations when applied to the peritoneal surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to patient This procedure is already proven to reduce postoperative pain in numerous&#xD;
      studies but is not routinely used. Therefore, the patient has a 50% probability of being&#xD;
      delivered the active anesthetic drug and can reasonably expect to have less pain if they are&#xD;
      in that arm of the study. Furthermore, if they have reduced pain and use fewer opiates they&#xD;
      may have less nausea and they may be discharged from recovery room and possible from the&#xD;
      hospital more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The investigators will examine separately uterine surgical procedures&#xD;
      and adnexal surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain reduction: The study intention is to show a CLINICALLY significant reduction in pain&#xD;
      (not just statistically significant). This can be hard to define if they have relatively low&#xD;
      baseline pain, but most patients with anything but very minor laparoscopic surgeries who have&#xD;
      been studied in the past wake up with pain scores in the 4-6 range - 6 being more typical. A&#xD;
      pain score reduction of 1.5 would be 25% or more pain reduction (and the investigators know&#xD;
      from prior studies that 1.3 or 23% reduction is the lower limit of clinically significant&#xD;
      pain reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 45 in each group (treatment vs control) will have 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference in means of 1.500 (the difference between a Group 1 mean of 6.000 and a Group 2&#xD;
      mean of 4.500) assuming that the common standard deviation is 2.500 using a two group t-test&#xD;
      with a 0.050 two-sided significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to potential drop-outs, the investigators will include 50 patients in each group, for a&#xD;
      total of 200 patients (100 undergoing uterine procedures and 100 undergoing adnexal&#xD;
      procedures). Statistical analysis will be performed as appropriate.&#xD;
