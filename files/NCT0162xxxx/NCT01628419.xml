      The purpose of the current investigation is to examine the effects of health intervention&#xD;
      program at the workplace on health risks for cardiovascular disease, well-being and&#xD;
      absenteeism at the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 1500 male and female employees from 10 different companies across Israel will&#xD;
      take part in the study. Age: older than 18 yrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The intervention program will have positive effects on the health risks for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. For example: Will be reflected in a decrease in LDL and increase in&#xD;
      HDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The intervention program will have positive effects on the absenteeism at the&#xD;
      workplace (e.g. decrease in days of sick leave per employee).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: The incidence of cardiovascular disease and related illnesses has been on the&#xD;
      rise throughout the past decades. This increase is highly linked to a diet that is both high&#xD;
      in calories and saturated fats as well as low levels of physical activity that may cause to&#xD;
      an increase of body weight, percent of body fat and in some cases to obesity. It has been&#xD;
      known that low levels of physical activity or sedentary behavior is a dominant risk factor&#xD;
      for developing cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the work place, employees' work capacity and efficiency can highly be affected by a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle and overweight conditions. A lack of physical activity was found to be&#xD;
      associated with low levels of production at the workplace. Furthermore, a positive&#xD;
      correlation was found between employees' lifestyle and number of days on a sick leave.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that obesity and a lack of physical activity are significant risk factors&#xD;
      for absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years, several studies have examined the effect of intervention programs on&#xD;
      lifestyle behavior changes and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases(CAD). The&#xD;
      results of those studies are quite equivocal. Some have demonstrated a positive effect of the&#xD;
      intervention programs on decreasing CAD risk factors and obesity rates, while others have&#xD;
      found no clear effect. The conflicting results could be due to methodological issues and&#xD;
      different studies' designs. For example, some studies did not report the amount and the&#xD;
      intensity of the physical activity program used in the intervention program. Furthermore,&#xD;
      some intervention programs did not include a nutritional manipulation. In a recent review&#xD;
      papers, it was found that the most efficient programs were those that combined group&#xD;
      workshops, guided physical activity programs and individualized counseling sessions for&#xD;
      employers that were at a higher risk for developing CAD. Intervention program that included&#xD;
      mainly guided physical activity were found to be less effective. It should be noted that the&#xD;
      optimal program format that should be implemented at the workplace is not completely clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose: To examine the effect of health promotion intervention program at the&#xD;
      workplace on risk factors to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, well-being, life-style&#xD;
      behavior and absenteeism at the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: The study will be approved by the local ethics committee. All participants will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent form. Study's participants will include adult male and female (older&#xD;
      than 18yrs). The 1500 participants will be recruited from 10 different worksites across&#xD;
      Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: The length of the intervention program at each workplace will be 6 months.&#xD;
      Parameters will be taken on two occasions: 1. Prior to the intervention program initiation 2.&#xD;
      After 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each employee at each workplace will be asked to fill a questionnaire regarding their medical&#xD;
      history, life-style behavior, medications, physical activity habits, and nutrition and&#xD;
      sleeping behavior. The employees will undergo anthropometric measurements and will be asked&#xD;
      to perform blood test at Health maintenance organization (HMO). The same tests will perform&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention program (after 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures: subjects will be asked to wear light clothes. Height and weight will&#xD;
      be measured with no shoes. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using the common formula&#xD;
      (kg/m2). Circumference will be measured at two sites while the subject standing still with&#xD;
      both feet close together. Waist circumference will be measured at the height of the&#xD;
      bell-button; hip circumference will be measured at the widest point of the pelvis. Waist-hip&#xD;
      ratio will calculate and compared to common and updated norms. Blood pressure and resting&#xD;
      pulse will be measure twice while the subject is in a sitting position. The average value&#xD;
      will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: Each participant in the study will be asked to perform the following tests prior&#xD;
      to the beginning of the intervention program. The parameters will include: blood glucose,&#xD;
      hemoglobin, LDL, HDL, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver function (GGT, ALT), Hemoglobin A1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absenteeism from work (due to illnesses): With the assistance of the human resources&#xD;
      department, at the end of the 6 months intervention program the number of days of sick leave&#xD;
      will be recorded for each participant in the study. If applicable, data will be compared with&#xD;
      last year absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention program characteristics: Structured and guided physical activity program with a&#xD;
      certified trainer, General Guidelines for performing physical activity outside of working&#xD;
      hours, Counseling and guidelines for the kitchen staff (in organization that has food&#xD;
      services), Supplying general guidelines for healthy diet and nutrition, Modifying the working&#xD;
      environment to a health promoting one (using posters, electronic communication, daily and&#xD;
      weekly tips etcâ€¦), Lectures on general topics - physical activity, nutrition, ergonomics,&#xD;
      behavior changes, sleeping behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured physical activity program: The training program will include, a structured aerobic&#xD;
      and resistance training session performed once a week with a certified trainer. The aerobic&#xD;
      session will include running/walking for 20min in a moderate-vigorous intensity based on rate&#xD;
      of perceived exertion scale from 1 (very light exercise) until 10 (very hard and strenuous&#xD;
      exercise). During the first two weeks the intensity will remain relatively moderate (rate of&#xD;
      perceived exertion 3-4), during the third week of the program the intensity will increase to&#xD;
      5-6 and from the fifth week on, the intensity will increase from 6 to 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resistance training will include exercise for the major muscle groups for about 15-20&#xD;
      min. The resistance exercises will be performed with dumbbells, resistance bands and body&#xD;
      weight. Additionally, the participants in the program will be asked to perform an additional&#xD;
      aerobic workouts for 20-30min (rate of perceived exertion 5-6) during the week, at least two&#xD;
      more workouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General guidelines for physical activity: All the participants in the study will receive&#xD;
      pedometers for their personal use. All employees will receive the recommended amount of&#xD;
      physical activity they should perform throughout the week. The information will be&#xD;
      distributed through information sheets, posters and e-mails. The recommendations will include&#xD;
      the different types of exercises that can be performed in order to improve aerobic fitness&#xD;
      and the recommended doses such as: amounts of daily steps, amount of weekly steps.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recommendations on strength, flexibility and core exercises will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition: In organizations that have food services and catering, certified dietitians from&#xD;
      the Wingate Institute will advise the kitchen staff about healthy nutritional choices.&#xD;
      Consultation will be given on the types of food to be served during meetings and events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The professional staff will make sure that the organization provided equipment and means for&#xD;
      employees to bring food from home, such as: refrigerators, microwaves or oven to warm up&#xD;
      food, dining hall and cold water fountains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personal meeting will be available to the study's participants. In those meetings they will&#xD;
      be able to discuss personal issues and received a personal diet plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General nutrition guidelines: General nutritional guidelines at the workplace and during free&#xD;
      time will be provided to all employees. The information will be distributed through booklets,&#xD;
      poster, information sheet and e-mails. The guidelines will include recommendation regarding&#xD;
      healthy food choices, nutritional values of variety of food products, recommended recipes&#xD;
      etcâ€¦&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promoting health at the workplace (modifying the working environment): A representative from&#xD;
      the study group and the organization's management will map the working environment and will&#xD;
      recommend possible modifications that can be performed to the working environment in order to&#xD;
      make it a health promoting one. For example: improving the accessibility to spaces within the&#xD;
      working environment where employees can exercise, informative signage and posters regarding&#xD;
      healthy life-style choices, informative e-mails with weekly and monthly tips will send to the&#xD;
      employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lectures: As part of the intervention program the employees will receive 6 lectures dealing&#xD;
      with different aspects of practicing a healthy life-style. The lectures will given by the&#xD;
      professional staff from the Wingate Institute on difference topics, such as: healthy&#xD;
      nutritional choices, ergonomics at the workplace, importance of performing physical activity,&#xD;
      sleeping habits and working capacity, behavioral tools to make a life-style changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Paired t-test will be used to examine the intervention program effect&#xD;
      on anthropometric measures, blood tests parameters and absenteeism. The effect of the&#xD;
      intervention program will also be examined using multiple regressions analyses. Significant&#xD;
      level will set at P&lt;0.05. SPSS software will be used for all statistical analysis.&#xD;
