  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typically, the CTIS Pregnancy Health Information Line in the Department of Pediatrics, School&#xD;
      of Medicine at the University of California educates pregnant women who call the Information&#xD;
      Line after an exposure to a medication that might be harmful to the developing baby has&#xD;
      already taken place, and therefore the opportunity for prevention of that exposure no longer&#xD;
      exists. Frequently these pregnancies are unintended and occur due to the lack of effective&#xD;
      contraceptive use. This study facilitates patient access at UCSD to specialized and&#xD;
      individualized contraceptive counseling for women of reproductive age who are currently&#xD;
      taking a medication that might be risky in a future pregnancy. This study also measures the&#xD;
      impact of individualized contraceptive counseling in changing contraceptive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: EPIC (EMR)/physician-facilitated referral of female patients of&#xD;
      reproductive age to an existing specialized counseling service at UCSD will improve the&#xD;
      utilization of more effective contraception among women of reproductive age who are&#xD;
      prescribed medications that might be harmful to the developing fetus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate a) the effectiveness of the referral system&#xD;
      from Family Medicine to the CTIS Pregnancy Health Information Line, and b) the impact of&#xD;
      specialized counseling on contraceptive behavior change among the subset of women who accept&#xD;
      the counseling and enroll in the follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a woman of reproductive age is seen by a Family Medicine clinician and she is currently&#xD;
      taking or is newly prescribed one of the target medications, an EMR electronic alert will be&#xD;
      generated for the clinician. The alert will say &quot;This patient may benefit from a referral to&#xD;
      the CTIS Pregnancy Health Information Line for counseling,&quot; click &quot;Accept&quot; or &quot;Decline&quot;. If&#xD;
      the Family Medicine clinician clicks &quot;Decline&quot; then a reason must be given for declining. If&#xD;
      the clinician decides a referral is appropriate, he/she clicks &quot;Accept&quot; and informs the&#xD;
      patient that she will be contacted by CTIS. The referral is also included in the patient&#xD;
      instructions. Within one week, a CTIS counselor will receive the referral through EPIC/EMR,&#xD;
      and contact the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is contacted by the CTIS Pregnancy Health Information specialist, a brief&#xD;
      patient interview will be conducted with a risk assessment and counseling regarding the&#xD;
      medication and potential effects if the patient were to become pregnant, using the standard&#xD;
      of care practices that are currently used for all callers to the CTIS Pregnancy Health&#xD;
      Information Line. The patient will also be given information about contraception, efficacy of&#xD;
      rates of each contraceptive method and the safety of each method based on the USMEC guidance&#xD;
      for the patient's medical condition. She will be instructed that she can return to her Family&#xD;
      Medicine clinician for contraceptive service delivery. She will also be offered a referral to&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine at UCSD for further counseling if desired/necessary. The referring&#xD;
      Family Medicine clinician will be informed of the outcome of the referral via an EMR report.&#xD;
      This report will include the USMEC contraceptive guidance for the patient's medical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the counseling is completed, the patient will be asked if she is interested in&#xD;
      participating in the research study. If the patient does not consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study, she will still receive the counseling and an EMR report will still be sent to her&#xD;
      referring provider but she will not be contacted at a later time regarding her contraceptive&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the woman decides that she is interested in participating in the research study, she will&#xD;
      be orally consented by CTIS Pregnancy Health Information Line Research Assistant in the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatrics at UCSD. If the patient consents to participation, she will be&#xD;
      contacted one week, one month and three months after the initial telephone interaction and&#xD;
      asked several questions regarding her current contraceptive utilization and any changes from&#xD;
      the time of the last interview. Upon completion of the three-month follow-up, participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete a satisfaction survey.&#xD;
