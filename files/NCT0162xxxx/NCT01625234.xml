  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first human study to use X-396 (ensartinib), a drug being developed for treatment&#xD;
      of advanced cancers. The initial purpose of the study is to determine the largest amount of&#xD;
      X-396 that can be safely given to humans (the maximum tolerated dose). Once the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose has been determined, an expansion phase will assess the preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of X-396 in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The study will also provide&#xD;
      early information on how the body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and on the efficacy of&#xD;
      X-396.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of X-396 (ensartinib) in humans and the investigational drug will be&#xD;
      given as a once or twice daily oral dose in 28 day cycles until there is disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable safety issues. X-396 will be given to small groups of patients (1 - 6) at&#xD;
      each dose level and the patients will be observed to see if there are any adverse safety&#xD;
      effects. As long as there are no unacceptable safety issues after 28 days, the dose of X-396&#xD;
      will be increased for the next group of patients. This process will continue until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of X-396 is reached. Once the MTD is reached, up to 170&#xD;
      additional patients will also be given X-396 to further determine the activity of X-396 in&#xD;
      patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. These additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the following expansion cohorts: ALK TKI-naïve patients, patients that progressed&#xD;
      on crizotinib, patients that progressed on one or more 2nd generation ALK TKIs (patients may&#xD;
      or may not have also received prior crizotinib), including patients with asymptomatic CNS&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
