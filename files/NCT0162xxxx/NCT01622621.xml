  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is for medically inoperable early stage non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) patients. It is designed to compare the number of patients who are disease&#xD;
      free and alive at 2 years between Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) and surgical&#xD;
      intervention arms. SBRT is less invasive and felt to be equally effective to surgery for&#xD;
      early stage NSCLC. Surgery is currently the standard of care for these patients. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that SBRT is at least as good as surgery for disease free&#xD;
      survival at 2 years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for Stage I Non-Small Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is sublobar surgical&#xD;
      resection. Recent trials have suggested that early stage NSCLC might be successfully treated&#xD;
      with SBRT amongst those who are medically inoperable. SBRT is the precise delivery of a high&#xD;
      dose of radiation to control tumors while limiting damage to surrounding normal tissues.&#xD;
      Patients on the SBRT arm will receive 54 Grays (Gy) in 3 fractions. One gray is the&#xD;
      absorption of one joule of energy, in the form of ionizing radiation, per kilogram of matter.&#xD;
      Recent advances with three-dimensional conformal and Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT)&#xD;
      techniques can now compensate for lung motion and allow delivery of high-dose, single&#xD;
      fractions to the primary lung tumor for patients with clinical state I NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local control and survival results appear promising. SBRT for early stage lung cancer may&#xD;
      offer a potentially equivalent, non-invasive treatment alternative to surgical resection.&#xD;
      Additionally, SBRT may be associated with fewer complications and better quality of life.&#xD;
      SBRT may be an acceptable or even preferred treatment option in higher-risk patients not able&#xD;
      to tolerate a surgical lobectomy. This clinical dilemma is increasingly faced in our lung&#xD;
      cancer practice at Mayo Clinic, with no comparative effectiveness data to guide treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated by both Thoracic Surgery and Radiation Oncology. Randomization can&#xD;
      occur through either group but a patient must see both in consultation prior to&#xD;
      randomization. For patients meeting enrollment criteria but unwilling to participate in&#xD;
      randomization, observational arms for each of SBRT and sublobar resection will enroll up to&#xD;
      24 patients as part of the 96 patient total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive the following tests as part of their clinical care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed Tomography (CT)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) will be used for mediastinal&#xD;
           imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endobronchial/endoscopic ultrasound (EBUS/EUS)-Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) or&#xD;
           mediastinoscopy will be used for pathologic assessment of level 2 lymph nodes (N2)&#xD;
           greater than 1 cm in the short axis on CT scan and/or SUV greater than 1.5 fold&#xD;
           background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up CT scans at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months for the Surgery and&#xD;
           SBRT groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Pulmonary Function Tests at 1 year&#xD;
