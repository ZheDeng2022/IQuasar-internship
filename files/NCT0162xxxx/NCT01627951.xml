  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An effective vaccine against malaria is urgently needed to combat the scourge of this&#xD;
      disease. Before candidate vaccines can be tested in endemic countries, they are first tested&#xD;
      in human volunteers in so-called Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI's). Ideally, a&#xD;
      candidate vaccine should be tested against multiple strains of malaria, representative of the&#xD;
      disease's global distribution. To date, however, only one such strain (NF54) has been broadly&#xD;
      used in CHMI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the course of infections with 2 novel malaria strains&#xD;
      to those with NF54 in human volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria remains responsible for an intolerable burden of morbidity&#xD;
      worldwide and an effective vaccine is sorely needed to aid control efforts. Before candidate&#xD;
      malaria vaccines can enter full-scale (phase IIb) field trials in endemic areas, they must&#xD;
      first be tested under controlled circumstances in (phase IIa) clinical human malaria&#xD;
      infection studies. Since Pf isolates display a wide genetic diversity across the globe, phase&#xD;
      IIa challenge infections should be conducted with both homologous and heterologous strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1998 a highly successful Controlled Human Malaria Infection model at the UMC St&#xD;
      Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, has been employed both to test candidate vaccines and to&#xD;
      answer fundamental questions about pathophysiological and immunological mechanisms during&#xD;
      early Pf infection in human volunteers. To date largely the NF54 strain of P. falciparum has&#xD;
      been used in this Nijmegen model, with which extensive experience has meanwhile been&#xD;
      acquired. In order to increase the portfolio of Pf strains available for future phase IIa&#xD;
      studies, it is first necessary to document in detail the parasitological, clinical and&#xD;
      immunological characteristics of new candidate strains during a controlled human malaria&#xD;
      infection. In this study, the strains NF135 and NF166 will be compared in this regard with&#xD;
      the well-characterised NF54 strain.&#xD;
