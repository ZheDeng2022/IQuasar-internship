  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase I, open label, dose-escalation, study of NUC-1031 as a single agent&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumours who have failed to respond to or who have relapsed&#xD;
      after treatment with standard therapy. NUC-1031 is a ProTide of gemcitabine, a drug that has&#xD;
      been used widely and effectively against cancers for many years. Both NUC-1031 and&#xD;
      gemcitabine work by preventing cancer cells from dividing by attacking their DNA&#xD;
      (deoxyribonucleic acid). Non clinical studies have shown that NUC-1031 is more effective than&#xD;
      gemcitabine because it is able to reach cancer cells by passive diffusion, is less easily&#xD;
      degraded by the cancer cell, and delivers the monophosphate form of the active agent. The&#xD;
      first part of the study is to determine recommended phase 2 dose by dose escalation and the&#xD;
      second part is to explore preliminary anti-tumour activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase I, open label study of NUC-1031 as a single agent, administered IV&#xD;
      weekly on days 1, 8, &amp; 15 (Schedule A) or twice weekly on days 1 &amp; 5, 8 &amp; 12, 15 &amp;19&#xD;
      (Schedule B) of a 28 day- cycle regimen. An initial dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be&#xD;
      followed by an expansion cohort phase (Part II) using the preferred regimen from Part I. In&#xD;
      Part I, sequential patients will be assigned to increasing doses of NUC-1031 in a standard '3&#xD;
      + 3' design to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). There will be a review of all&#xD;
      available data (in particular the safety profile and preliminary PK data through to at least&#xD;
      the last scheduled day of Cycle 1) following enrolment of the second cohort of both schedule&#xD;
      A and B to select the preferred administration schedule to take forward for ongoing&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part II (dose expansion) additional patients will be enrolled to receive NUC-1031 at the&#xD;
      RP2D and dosing frequency determined from Part I of the study. During Part II, further&#xD;
      information will be obtained regarding safety, PK, PD and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of&#xD;
      NUC-1031 at RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, patients may continue to receive NUC-1031 for up to 6 cycles,&#xD;
      until disease progression, for as long as the participant receives clinical benefit in the&#xD;
      opinion of the CI, the occurrence of unmanageable drug related toxicity despite dose&#xD;
      modification or if the study participant declines further treatment.&#xD;
