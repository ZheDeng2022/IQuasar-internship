      The aim of this study is to measure the effects of bupivacaine administered via epidural&#xD;
      catheters on indices of motor blockade ascertained during the second stage of labor. This is&#xD;
      a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to address the primary research&#xD;
      question: Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor? The secondary research&#xD;
      question is: Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the&#xD;
      second stage of labor?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous&#xD;
      women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine&#xD;
      will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more (a 33%&#xD;
      increase) thus implicating motor blockade. Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores&#xD;
      during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these&#xD;
      indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at Parkland Hospital, 82% of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at&#xD;
      term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second&#xD;
      stages of labor. Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at&#xD;
      Parkland. After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be&#xD;
      provided. Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized. Group I&#xD;
      will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage (i.e. 10&#xD;
      cm dilation) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter (see&#xD;
      study procedure below). Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the&#xD;
      patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm. To detect a 33%&#xD;
      increase (from 28 minutes to 37 minutes) in the primary outcome the investigators need a&#xD;
      total of 310 women enrolled in the study (or 155 per arm). Assuming a 30% consent rate and&#xD;
      given that approximately 1000 women meet the inclusion criteria each year at Parkland, the&#xD;
      investigators project that this study could be completed in 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nulliparous women scheduled for labor inductions on Monday through Friday and who have&#xD;
      consented to this study will be randomized to one of two arms: bupivacaine plus fentanyl&#xD;
      epidural analgesia throughout labor and delivery (including the second stage) or epidural&#xD;
      bupivacaine plus fentanyl until 8 cm cervical dilation and only fentanyl thereafter. From&#xD;
      activation of epidural analgesia to 8 cm cervical dilation the prevailing standard epidural&#xD;
      technique in use at Parkland Hospital will be used. Briefly, 19-ga multi-orifice epidural&#xD;
      catheter is placed using 17-ga 3 ½cm Tuohy needle into the L3-L4 lumbar interspace. Lactated&#xD;
      Ringers solution, 500-1000mL will be infused during placement of the epidural catheter to&#xD;
      mitigate hypotension. A test dose using 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, 3mL, will&#xD;
      be given via the epidural catheter. If the test dose is negative, then an initial bolus of&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine, 4-8mL, with fentanyl 100mcg is given via the catheter. After securing the&#xD;
      epidural catheter the patient will be placed in the supine position and the anesthetic&#xD;
      sensory level measured with the desired level of T6-T8. Once a T6-T8 sensory block is secured&#xD;
      the epidural infusion using 0.125% bupivacaine with 2mcg/mL fentanyl at 10mL/hr will be&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time during epidural infusion the epidural catheter may be replaced at the discretion&#xD;
      of the anesthesia provider for inadequate analgesia. Ephedrine or phenylephrine will be given&#xD;
      intravenously for maternal hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or a&#xD;
      decrease of 20% systolic blood pressure from patient's baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur when the woman reaches 8 cm cervical dilation. Envelopes containing&#xD;
      cassettes will be sequentially randomized by Dr. McIntire and given to the attending&#xD;
      obstetrical anesthesiologist containing one of two medications. Group I will receive a 100mL&#xD;
      epidural cassette of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2mcg/mL to be infused at 10mL/hr. Group&#xD;
      II will receive a 100mL cassette of fentanyl 10mcg/mL (to be infused at 10mL/hr. Both groups&#xD;
      will have the same rate of epidural infusion such that the patient, nurse, obstetrician, and&#xD;
      anesthesia providers will be blinded to the randomized treatment group. The Parkland&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service (IDS) will provide the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may request a 5mL bolus from the epidural infusion every 30 minutes if pain&#xD;
      relief is inadequate. The obstetrician can also give patients in either study group 25mg of&#xD;
      intravenous meperidine every hour for up to two doses if pain relief is unsatisfactory. The&#xD;
      study regimen will continue until spontaneous delivery of the infant or until which time&#xD;
      operative vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery is planned. At this point the study will be&#xD;
      over and routine anesthesia care resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for management of labor induction at Parkland requires continuous&#xD;
      electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) as well as uterine contraction monitoring. The&#xD;
      standard is to apply EFM internal transducers when the membranes are ruptured. Standard fetal&#xD;
      monitors equipped with laptop computers will be used to electronically store the fetal heart&#xD;
      rate and uterine contraction data during this study. This will permit qualification of&#xD;
      uterine contractility during the second stage of labor. The Bromage and Breen scores for&#xD;
      motor blockade will be assessed at complete cervical dilation and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes&#xD;
      thereafter. The scoring system is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unable to move feet or knees (complete block)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Able to move feet only&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Just able to move knees&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No weakness of hip flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Able to perform partial knee bend&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analog pain (VAS) scores for the adequacy of epidural analgesia from 1-10 will also be&#xD;
      assessed at each time point used for the Bromage and Breen scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include maternal demographic characteristics as well as antepartum and&#xD;
      intrapartum obstetrical features. Condition of the infant at birth based on Apgar scores and&#xD;
      umbilical artery blood pH, as well as neonatal outcomes will be ascertained.&#xD;
