      Postoperative pain and time taken to return to normal activities after laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      are significantly shorter. Wound infections still occur and contribute to prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stays and morbidity. Typically, port incision sites are covered with a standard dressing&#xD;
      (approximating strips and a gauze). Although the umbilical wound infection rate in&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery is considered to be low, a recent study by Muensterer and Keijzer showed&#xD;
      that the umbilical wound infection rate after single incision laparoscopic appendectomy in&#xD;
      children is approximately 7%. In the same retrospective study, the investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      that a simple low cost vacuum dressing can significantly reduce the infection rate. The aim&#xD;
      of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to determine if the simple vacuum dressing&#xD;
      is superior to a standard dressing in reducing laparoscopic postoperative umbilical wound&#xD;
      infections. All patients under 17 years of age undergoing a laparoscopic operation in the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital will be randomized to a standard postoperative dressing or a standard&#xD;
      postoperative dressing with vacuum applied to it. The vacuum will be applied with a 22g&#xD;
      needle on a 10ml syringe passed percutaneously from outside the dressing into the gauze and&#xD;
      the air around the gauze is evacuated. The umbilical wounds will be evaluated 8-10 days&#xD;
      postoperatively in the clinical research unit of the Manitoba Institute of Child Heath&#xD;
      according to a standardized and validated wound evaluation tool from the Canadian Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control. Primary outcome measure in this study is postoperative wound infection. A&#xD;
      sample size calculation using the retrospective data demonstrated that the investigators need&#xD;
      275 patients in each group for the Chi-squared test to have an 80% chance of detecting a&#xD;
      difference in wound infection rate of 6% at the 5% level of significance. Based on the annual&#xD;
      number of laparoscopic operations in the Children's Hospital (around 400) the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate completing the inclusion of patients within a two-year period.&#xD;

      The AVATAR Trial: Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying VAcuum To Accomplish Reduced wound infections in laparoscopic pediatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are the most common complication of surgery worldwide and one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Literature has shown&#xD;
      that patients who develop an SSI are five times more likely to require readmission to&#xD;
      hospital within 30 days, 60% more likely to require ICU admission, and twice as likely to&#xD;
      die. SSIs also carry a significant financial burden to the healthcare system. Annually in the&#xD;
      US, SSIs account for over 900 million dollars spent in-hospital and $1.6 billion overall in&#xD;
      health care. The average risk of developing an SSI from any surgical procedure is 1-4%. A&#xD;
      landmark study by Horan, et al. in 1992 defined SSIs as any infection occurring within 30&#xD;
      days of an operation or up to 1 year if an implanted device was used. Infections were further&#xD;
      classified as: superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space, with diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria on physical exam to support each category. This criterion for SSI diagnosis has&#xD;
      since become the standard definition at the American Center for Disease Control (CDC) and&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: CDC Definition of an SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial Incisional SSI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection occurring within 30 days of an operative procedure AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue of the incision AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has at least 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purulent drainage from the superficial incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the&#xD;
           superficial incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one of the following signs or symptoms: pain or tenderness; localized swelling,&#xD;
           redness, or heat; superficial incision is opened by a surgeon and is culture-positive or&#xD;
           not cultured. A culture negative finding does not meet this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by a surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep Incisional SSI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection occurring within 30 days of an operative procedure if no implant OR within 1&#xD;
           year if an implant is used AND the infection appears to be related to the operative&#xD;
           procedure AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involves deep soft tissues (eg. fascial and muscle layers) of the incision AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients has at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the&#xD;
           surgical site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon and is&#xD;
           culture positive or not cultured when the patient has at least one of the following&#xD;
           signs or symptoms: fever &gt; 38 degrees Celsius or localized pain or tenderness. A culture&#xD;
           negative does not meet this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct&#xD;
           examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of a deep incisional SSI by a surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ/Space SSI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection occurs within 30 days of an operative procedure if no implant was used OR&#xD;
           within 1 year if an implant was used AND the infection appears to be related to the&#xD;
           operative procedure AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection involves any part of the body (excluding the skin incision, fascia, or muscle&#xD;
           layers) that is opened or manipulated during the operative procedure AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has at least 1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed through a stab wound into the organ/space&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ&#xD;
           / space&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ / space that is found on&#xD;
           direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of an organ/space infection by a surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant research has been undertaken to determine risk factors, prevention, and treatment&#xD;
      of SSIs. Risk factors can generally be divided into procedure- and patient-specific risks.&#xD;
      Horan, et al. grouped procedures into 4 wound classifications: clean, clean-contaminated,&#xD;
      contaminated, and dirty. They found that clean operations carried an average risk of 1% while&#xD;
      dirty surgeries carried a risk &gt; 27%. Other procedure-specific risk factors that have been&#xD;
      identified include: length of the procedure, degree of hemostasis, tissue trauma, and use of&#xD;
      drains. Patient-specific risk factors include: age, smoking, obesity, diabetes, poor&#xD;
      nutrition, and compromise of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a large body of research addressing SSIs in adults, very few papers have&#xD;
      addressed the development of SSIs in the pediatric population. Bucher, et al. found that SSI&#xD;
      prediction models used in adults are not generalizable to pediatrics. Extremes of age, immune&#xD;
      naivety, general physiology, and indications and types of procedures undertaken on children&#xD;
      are significantly different than those faced by adults. Research has found that&#xD;
      procedure-specific risks are much more heavily weighted in pediatric populations than&#xD;
      patient-specific risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of interventions have aimed at reducing procedure-specific risk factors, including:&#xD;
      clipping rather than shaving hair, chlorhexidine vs iodine skin preparation, steri-strips vs&#xD;
      sutures vs tissue glue for closure, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics. However, very&#xD;
      few studies have looked at post-operative dressings as a role player in reducing SSIs. A&#xD;
      recent Cochrane Review on this subject revealed that there is currently no evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that any dressing significantly reduces the risk of SSI in wounds healing from&#xD;
      primary intention. However, the Cochrane review also revealed that the 16 randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies included in the review were generally of poor quality, small sample size,&#xD;
      and/or high bias. Cochrane listed the following aspects as attributes of an ideal dressing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ability to absorb and contain exudate without leakage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lack of particulate contaminants left in wound by dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  thermal insulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impermeability to water and bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ability to use with different types of skin closure (ie. stapes, sutures)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  avoidance of wound trauma on removal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  minimal frequency of dressing changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provision of pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cosmesis and comfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  effect on formation of scar tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the investigators published a pilot study that showed that a simple, cost-effective&#xD;
      vacuum dressing could reduce wound infection rates in pediatric laparoscopic appendectomies&#xD;
      by 6%. This dressing is fashioned by placing a sterile 2 by 2 inch gauze over the umbilical&#xD;
      port site and covering it with a bioocclusive dressing, such as an op-site. A 22-gauge needle&#xD;
      is then inserted subcutaneously to remove air from the dressing, thereby creating a vacuum&#xD;
      atmosphere. This dressing fulfills all the criteria from the Cochrane review of preferred&#xD;
      attributes, is easy to apply, and inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of negative-pressure wound treatments (NPWT) is not a novel concept - however,&#xD;
      specialized VAC dressings are costly (at approx $107/day) and generally reserved for complex,&#xD;
      debilitating wounds. NPWT are thought to promote wound healing by removing local edema,&#xD;
      improving vascular and lymphatic flow, decreasing bacterial density, and promoting&#xD;
      angiogenesis and formation of granulation tissue. Minimal literature is available on the&#xD;
      utility of these dressings in children. Six studies that have shown NPWT to be effective in&#xD;
      healing complex wound dehiscence in the pediatric population; however, to the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, no study has yet been undertaken to look at the role of NPWT in SSI prevention and&#xD;
      healing of non-complex wounds in either pediatrics or adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to address this very issue by undertaking a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with sufficient statistical power to prove (or disprove) that a simple, vacuum dressing&#xD;
      can be effective at reducing the SSI rate in children undergoing any laparoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure in this study is the rate of postoperative wound infection at the&#xD;
      umbilical port site. A sample size calculation using the pilot study data demonstrated that&#xD;
      the investigators need 275 patients in each group for the Chi-squared test to have an 80%&#xD;
      chance of detecting a difference in wound infection rate of 6% with a 5% level of&#xD;
      significance. Approximately 600 patients will need to be recruited from the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital to ensure sufficient statistical power. Based on the annual number of laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures in the Children's Hospital (approximately 400) the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      completing the inclusion of patients within a two-year period. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility upon booking operative time for a laparoscopic surgery. These surgeries may&#xD;
      be either elective or emergent in nature. Patients will be recruited by the pediatric surgery&#xD;
      service that will meet with the patients and their parents/guardians prior to the operation&#xD;
      to discuss the purpose of the trial and their role, should they choose to participate.&#xD;
      Written information will be supplied and consent will be obtained from the patient directly&#xD;
      or their parent/guardian by the nurse in clinic or the operating room. Once enrolled,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of two arms: one group will receive a simple vacuum&#xD;
      dressing to their umbilical port (experimental) while the other group will receive the&#xD;
      standard dressing without vacuum (control). Randomization will take place after the operation&#xD;
      has been completed and will be done via a computer-generated list of numbers in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      using the online tool Research Randomizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prepped with chlorhexidine and draped using sterile paper drapes. The&#xD;
      umbilical incisions will be made in a horizontal manner and the trochar will be introduced&#xD;
      using the Hasson technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo fascial closure of the umbilical wound with a figure-of-8, 0 vicryl&#xD;
      stitch and subsequent umbilical port closure with 5-0 biosyn simple interrupted subcutaneous&#xD;
      sutures. A 2x2 sterile gauze will be applied with a simple bio-occlusive dressing (ie.&#xD;
      op-site). In the vacuum dressing group, a 22-gauge needle will be introduced subcutaneously&#xD;
      into the dressing and air will be suctioned out using a 10 cc syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, the dressings in both groups will be removed after 48 hrs, either by the&#xD;
      patients (or their parents) if the patient is discharged home or the house staff on the ward&#xD;
      if they are an inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent nurse from the clinical research unit at the Manitoba Institute of Child&#xD;
      Health (MICH) who is blinded to the treatment groups will examine the patients at 8-10 days&#xD;
      post-operatively and diagnose any surgical site infections using the criteria provided by the&#xD;
      CDC. Funding for the MICH nurse has already been approved (see budget). The timeframe for&#xD;
      follow up was chosen because it will minimize the likelihood of patients being lost to follow&#xD;
      up while maximizing the opportunity for detection of infection, since the majority of SSIs&#xD;
      are apparent by postoperative day 3-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pilot study, it is unlikely that the simple vacuum dressing will increase the&#xD;
      rates of SSI however as the data is accrued the investigators will assess the results in real&#xD;
      time for a disparity in SSIs greater than 10% between the study and experimental groups.&#xD;
      Should this disparity exist, in either direction, recruitment will temporarily be held while&#xD;
      the results are analyzed for their statistical significance at that point. If the results are&#xD;
      significant, the investigators will consider terminating the trial before all 600 patients&#xD;
      are recruited and changing practice accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from the trial will be stored on a computer kept in a secure location on the&#xD;
      Health Sciences campus. The file will be kept for a period of 25 years (or when the youngest&#xD;
      child in the study turns 25). Only members of the research group will have access to the&#xD;
      password-protected server where the data is kept. As patients are recruited, they will be&#xD;
      assigned a unique identification number that is separate from their PHIN or hospital ID. This&#xD;
      number will be used to organize the data instead of the patient's name or health information.&#xD;
      Only the patient's date of birth, weight, sex, diagnosis, procedure type and duration,&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, length of stay, and presence or absence of SSI will be recorded. Since&#xD;
      identifying information about the patients will not be recorded, the investigators will not&#xD;
      directly contact the patients with the results of the trial. Instead, patients will be&#xD;
      provided with an email address (avatar.clinical.trial@gmail.com that they can contact, from&#xD;
      which the investigators will periodically send out updates about the trial.&#xD;
