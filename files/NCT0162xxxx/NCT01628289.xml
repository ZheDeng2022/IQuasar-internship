      Introduction: There is no debate that people with diabetes should be screened for the&#xD;
      development of retinopathy which can threaten their sight. However, there is no routine&#xD;
      screening for retinopathy in Hong Kong at present. Many overseas countries find that they&#xD;
      miss a large proportion of their target population and, with reliance on co-payments for&#xD;
      screening, as is the case with the limited opportunistic screening at present, the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of any routine service in Hong Kong could be reduced as is predicted by&#xD;
      Hart's inverse care law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study will determine the potential cost-effectiveness of screening for retinopathy&#xD;
      in Hong Kong under a free system and one in which a co-payment is charged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Primary care patients attending General Outpatient Clinics on Hong Kong Island for&#xD;
      their routine diabetic care will randomly be offered screening either at no charge or with&#xD;
      the normal co-payment of $65. Those who are willing and unwilling to be screened will be&#xD;
      compared for their clinical, lifestyle and socioeconomic characteristics and those unwilling&#xD;
      will be asked their reasons. The uptake of screening at no fee and with a payment will be&#xD;
      compared as will the prevalence of retinopathy in the two fee groups. Subsequent screening at&#xD;
      one year will be offered at the same fee and uptake again compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal analyses will (a) identify the characteristics of those willing to be screened&#xD;
      and reasons for not being screened (b) the uptake of screening when a co-payment is charged&#xD;
      compared to when it is free (c) whether there is a difference in the prevalence of&#xD;
      retinopathy between the group willing to pay and those who accept free screening and (d) the&#xD;
      uptake of re-screening in year 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting cost-effectiveness model will use these data, the cost data collected during&#xD;
      the study and overseas data on benefits of treatment to model the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      screening for retinopathy in Hong Kong if it were to be offered free or with a co-payment.&#xD;
      This information will be important to determine the most cost-effective means of implementing&#xD;
      this preventative strategy to preserve sight and quality of life.&#xD;
