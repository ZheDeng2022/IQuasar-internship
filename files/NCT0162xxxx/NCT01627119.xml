    <textblock>
      For the past 50 years, gastric cancer has been one of the ten most frequent cancers and the&#xD;
      second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. In Taiwan, it is the fifth most&#xD;
      common cause of cancer-related deaths, accounting for 6.3% of all cancer deaths. The poor&#xD;
      prognosis of gastric cancer is mostly caused by the extensive metastasis to the lymph nodes,&#xD;
      liver, and peritoneal dissemination even if curative resection was performed. The main cause&#xD;
      of recurrence after curative or noncurative resection of advanced tumors is peritoneal&#xD;
      metastasis because of possible direct spillage and dissemination of tumor cells as a result&#xD;
      of surgical manipulation, and it is associated with a poor prognosis. As yet, no effective&#xD;
      treatment has been developed for this condition. The development of peritoneal metastasis is&#xD;
      a multistep process, beginning with attachment to peritoneal mesothelial cells, retraction of&#xD;
      the mesothelial cells and exposure of the basement membrane, attachment to the basement&#xD;
      membrane, degradation in the extracellular matrix, proliferation by the cancer cells, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and it is clear that many types of agents are involved at the various stages of&#xD;
      this process. Developing a new therapeutic method for this mode of metastasis is very&#xD;
      important for improvement of gastric cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTGF is a secretory protein belonging to the CCN family (one among the three originally&#xD;
      discovered members: cysteine-rich61, CTGF, and nephroblastoma-overexpressed gene). It is a&#xD;
      multifunctional growth factor involved in wound healing, inflammation, cell adhesion,&#xD;
      chemotaxis, apoptosis, tumor growth, and fibrosis. Recent studies showed that overexpression&#xD;
      of CTGF in human oral squamous cell carcinoma reduces cell growth and tumorigenecity. Similar&#xD;
      tumor growth inhibitory effects were observed in lung cancer cells in which CTGF&#xD;
      overexpression was less angiogenic and metastatic due to blocking of the VEGF A signaling&#xD;
      pathway. CTGF was also reported to be a key regulator of colorectal cancer invasion and&#xD;
      metastasis, and it appears to be a better prognostic factor. These studies suggest that CTGF&#xD;
      may involve the processes of peritoneal metastasis which includes cancer cell adhesion in&#xD;
      peritoneum, proliferation and angiogenesis. Peritoneal mesothelium is the first surface&#xD;
      encountered by disseminated tumor cells and successful adhesion is, therefore, of paramount&#xD;
      importance in metastasis formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CTGF is a potential&#xD;
      molecule target, which may be related to cell adhesion to peritoneum, the first step of&#xD;
      peritoneal metastasis, and its exact mechanism may includes proliferation and angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these important questions, first, we have performed the preliminary&#xD;
      studies to prove CTGF did express in different gastric cancer cell lines including AGS, N87,&#xD;
      TSGH, and MKN-45 by using RT-PCR and Western blotting, and gastric cancer tissues by using&#xD;
      immunohistochemical method. Second, we demonstrated different levels of CTGF expression in&#xD;
      different cell lines pose different adhesion ability in in-vitro adhesion assay. Third, we&#xD;
      conducted a transient CTGF-overexpressed MKN45 gastric cancer cell line, and&#xD;
      CTGF-overexpressed cell line had lower adhesive ability compared to the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next step in this project, we will be studying the roles of CTGF plays in cellular and&#xD;
      molecular biology in vitro and in vivo and clinical significance associated with therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of peritoneal metastasis from gastric cancer. We will generate stable clones of&#xD;
      MKN45 cells harboring CTGF and its control cell line to elucidate the roles of CTGF in cancer&#xD;
      cell adhesion, proliferation and angiogenesis in peritoneum.&#xD;
