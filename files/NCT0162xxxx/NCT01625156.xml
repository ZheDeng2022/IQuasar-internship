    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivantinib when given in&#xD;
      combination with temsirolimus in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Tivantinib and temsirolimus may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      ARQ197 (tivantinib) in combination with temsirolimus in adult subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors who are extensive cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19)&#xD;
      metabolizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the tolerability and/or MTD of ARQ 197 and in combination with&#xD;
      temsirolimus in adult subjects who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers (CYP2C19*2/*2, *2/*3 or&#xD;
      *3/*3 polymorphisms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify the pharmacokinetic parameters of ARQ 197 after a single dose and at steady&#xD;
      state in extensive and poor CYP2C19 metabolizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the steady state pharmacokinetics of ARQ 197 alone and in combination with&#xD;
      temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine impact of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4/cytochrome&#xD;
      P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A4/5) polymorphisms on ARQ 197&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and its active metabolite sirolimus in&#xD;
      combination with ARQ 197 and compare to historical pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine impact of CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms on temsirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and determine the safety profile of the&#xD;
      combination of ARQ 197 and temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of ARQ197 and temsirolimus in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To correlate archived tumor tissue expression of c-Met with objective response to ARQ 197&#xD;
      and temsirolimus therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and temsirolimus intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 8, 15, 22, and 29 of course 1). Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days (35 days in course 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
