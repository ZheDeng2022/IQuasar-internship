      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several types of blood cancer are associated with poor outcomes including high-risk&#xD;
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute&#xD;
           myelogenous leukemia (AML). Many people with MDS, CMML, and AML are not candidates for&#xD;
           standard treatments. New types of treatment are needed for these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clofarabine and lenalidomide are anticancer drugs. The first damages cancer cells in the&#xD;
           body. The second can alter blood supply to abnormal cells or affect how the immune&#xD;
           system attacks these cells. These drugs have been previously tested as treatments for&#xD;
           MDS and leukemia. However, they have not been tried as a combination for MDS, CMML, and&#xD;
           AML. Researchers want to see if these drugs are safe and effective for these types of&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of clofarabine and lenalidomide for people with&#xD;
      high-risk MDS, CMML, and AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have high-risk MDS, CMML, and AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must not be candidates for standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and bone&#xD;
           marrow samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 5 days of treatment with clofarabine. It will be given through a&#xD;
           vein during an inpatient hospital stay. If there are no serious side effects after the&#xD;
           infusion, participants will continue treatment as outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 28 days, participants will have a bone marrow biopsy to check their response to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the biopsy, participants will start lenalidomide treatment. Half of the&#xD;
           participants will take the drug for 28 days (one treatment cycle). The other half will&#xD;
           take it for 56 days (two cycles). More blood tests and biopsies will be used to monitor&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are no serious side effects and the disease does not become worse, participants&#xD;
           may keep taking lenalidomide at lower doses for up to 12 more cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (AML) are hetereogeneous myeloid malignancies that are associated with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis. Due to advanced age and medical comorbidities, the majority of MDS, CMML, and&#xD;
      AML patients are not candidates for potentially curative standard treatments such as&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or intensive chemotherapy (ICT). New therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches that improve response rates, have lesser toxicity, and extend survival are clearly&#xD;
      needed for high risk MDS and AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is a myelosuppressive, second generation purine nucleoside analogue which has&#xD;
      shown meaningful efficacy at variable dosing levels for high risk MDS and AML patients with a&#xD;
      favorable toxicity profile compared to intensive chemotherapy. Lenalidomide is an oral&#xD;
      structural analogue of thalidomide with a complex mechanism of action including&#xD;
      immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, and direct cytotoxic effects which is a well-established&#xD;
      treatment for MDS and has shown agent single efficacy at higher doses for AML. Lenalidomide s&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit in AML has been the greatest in patients with low presenting total&#xD;
      leukocyte and circulating blast counts. We hypothesize that the initial cytoreductive effects&#xD;
      of clofarabine may augment the effectiveness of subsequent lenalidomide therapy and create a&#xD;
      favorable immunologic milieu for patients eligible for lenalidomide maintenance therapy. This&#xD;
      open-label, single institution phase I trial will evaluate a sequential combination of IV&#xD;
      clofarabine with oral lenalidomide for the treatment of high risk MDS, CMML, and AML.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single course of IV clofarabine (5 milligrams per metered square per&#xD;
      day times 5) for cytoreduction. This will be followed by oral lenalidomide consolidation with&#xD;
      dose escalation from 25 mg daily for 21/28 days for 1 cycle in the first cohort up to 50 mg&#xD;
      daily for 28/28 days for 2 cycles in the fourth cohort. In the absence of dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity or disease progression, Subjects will receive lenalidomide maintenance, starting at&#xD;
      a dose of 10 mg daily in 28 day cycles, with dose adjustments, for up to 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to determine the safety of sequential therapy with clofarabine and&#xD;
      lenalidomide in subjects with high risk MDS, CMML, and AML. The primary study endpoint will&#xD;
      be the toxicity profile of this novel treatment combination in each cohort. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include characterization of response and duration, overall survival, and the&#xD;
      feasibility of maintenance lenalidomide therapy for responding subjects.&#xD;
