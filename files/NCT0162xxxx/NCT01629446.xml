  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how lofexidine (investigational study formulation drug)&#xD;
      is absorbed, broken down, and removed from the body. To do this, a special form of the study&#xD;
      drug will be used that has a radioactive carbon atom attached. Blood, urine, and feces&#xD;
      samples will be collected at different times to measure the amount of the study drug and&#xD;
      radioactivity they contain. The amount of radioactivity you will be exposed to is less than&#xD;
      the amount of radiation from a regular X-ray.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the mass balance of a single oral dose of 14C&#xD;
      labeled lofexidine. Study US WorldMeds Reference Number USWM-LX1-1003, conducted in July and&#xD;
      August of 2011, was a single-center, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, randomized&#xD;
      sequence study to determine the mass balance and absolute bioavailability of a single oral&#xD;
      dose of 14C-labeled lofexidine compared to a single intravenous dose of lofexidine. During&#xD;
      the conduct of the study, deficiencies occurred in the collection and processing of urine&#xD;
      samples from subjects administered the oral dose of 14C-labeled lofexidine. In study&#xD;
      USWM-LX1-1003-1, six male subjects will be dosed with 14C labeled lofexidine oral solution in&#xD;
      order to provide accurate data for the mass balance portion of the study. Male subjects who&#xD;
      successfully participated in and completed study USWM-LX1-1003 will be enrolled first.&#xD;
      Additional male subjects will be enrolled as needed to provide a cohort of 6 subjects.&#xD;
      Additional provisions to ensure adequate urine collections have now been implemented at the&#xD;
      site and will be utilized in USWM-LX1-1003-1. All blood draws for pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
      and radioanalysis, and all urine and fecal collection intervals, will occur at the same time&#xD;
      points in USWM-LX1-1003-1 as they did in USWM-LX1-1003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME), trace amounts of&#xD;
      14C compounds are quantified using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). As a form of an&#xD;
      isotope ratio atom counter that achieves the lowest detection limits of any type of mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, AMS provides quantitative sensitivity towards 14C labeled compounds to low&#xD;
      attomole (10-18) levels. This high degree of sensitivity enables the detection of compounds&#xD;
      in very small specimens and/or tissues after administration of doses that can be both&#xD;
      chemically and radiochemically small (microdose levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the radioactive dose to be given (approximately 280 nCi; 10.36 kBq) the total radiation&#xD;
      exposure to the participant is within the level of background radiation exposure that occurs&#xD;
      naturally and orders of magnitude (1000 fold reduction on average) below the levels typical&#xD;
      for human metabolism studies using 14C tracers.&#xD;
