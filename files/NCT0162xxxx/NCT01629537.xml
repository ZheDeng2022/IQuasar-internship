  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a devastating condition which causes distress or&#xD;
      impairment in social, occupational or other important aspects of functioning. The occurrence&#xD;
      of PTSD in the military is on the rise. This has significantly impacted military members,&#xD;
      their families, and society as a whole. According to an expert panel convened by the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine in 2007, the effectiveness of most currently employed PTSD therapies is&#xD;
      low. Safe and effective treatments are urgently needed. The specific aim of this&#xD;
      investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel approach to relieve PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      utilizing a procedure commonly used in pain management, a Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) with&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Male soldiers experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of PTSD will be&#xD;
      recruited for evaluation of Stellate Ganglion Block with local anesthesia as an intervention&#xD;
      for PTSD treatment. Participants will be randomized to receive either the SGB with local&#xD;
      anesthesia to C6 tubercle or a sham procedure involving a subcutaneous saline injection to&#xD;
      the neck. The PTSD symptoms before and after the procedure will be measured using a&#xD;
      comprehensive clinician-administered scale, self-report measures, objective measures of&#xD;
      cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures. Subjects will undergo assessment&#xD;
      prior to the procedure, one week following the procedure, one month and 3 months following&#xD;
      the procedure. Patients receiving sham injections will be allowed to cross over to the&#xD;
      treatment group. Based on published case reports of Lipov et al in Chicago and Mulvaney et al&#xD;
      from Walter Reed Medical Center, who utilized this technique to successfully treat soldiers&#xD;
      with combat-related PTSD, we predict that the use of Stellate Ganglion Block will result in&#xD;
      reduction of PTSD symptoms as measured by clinician-administered scales, self-report&#xD;
      measures, objective measures of cognitive ability, and physiologic reactivity measures,&#xD;
      leading to a significant and lasting reduction of PTSD symptoms.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL is a 17-item self-report measure of the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. It is used to screen and diagnose individuals for PTSD, as well as monitoring symptom change during and after treatment. To be compared to the 1 week pre baseline measures at enrollment</description>

    <intervention_name>Stellate Ganglion Block injection with ropivicane</intervention_name>
    <description>For participants receiving the stellate ganglion injection with ropivicaine, a 22 g needle will be directed percutaneously to the anterolateral C6 vertebral body Using ultrasound guidance to avoid the nearby vascular structures and identify the appropriate vertebral level and tissue plane. After negative aspiration for blood and CSF, and digital subtraction, 2cc of Iohexol,(Omnipaque 180) will be injected through the needle under live fluoroscopy to visualize dye spread over the pre-vertebral plane At this point, 7 cc 0.5% ropivicaine will be injected and the needle will be removed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Placebo Procedure</intervention_name>
    <description>In participants randomized to the placebo injection, the same positioning, monitoring, sterile preparation and technique and local anesthesia protocol will be used. The 22 g needle will instead be placed in the subcutaneous, superficial tissues overlying the C6 tubercle, but superficial enough that the prevertebral fascial plane of the stellate ganglion will not be breached. Using fluoroscopic guidance, this needle will be injected with 2 cc of contrast dye to confirm superficial spread. The needle will then be injected with 5 cc of preservative free normal saline and the needle will be removed.</description>
