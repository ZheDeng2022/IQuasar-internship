  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While obese and extremely obese youth are at increased risk of health complications,&#xD;
      especially the extremely obese group rarely seek medical care. One of the underlying reasons&#xD;
      might be the lack of adequate treatment options. This study is a subproject of the &quot;Medical&#xD;
      and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance and effects of&#xD;
      structured care study&quot;, short: &quot;Youth with Extreme obesity Study (YES)&quot;, which aims at&#xD;
      improving the medical care and social support structures for youth with obesity and extreme&#xD;
      obesity in Germany. In this subproject, information on the causes and consequences of extreme&#xD;
      obesity will be gathered via questionnaires and medical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese youth and young adults (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2) between the ages of 14 and 24.9 years (initially&#xD;
      up to 21 years) are eligible to participate. Participants will be asked to complete a series&#xD;
      of questionnaires on their general health, psychosocial situation and wellbeing in 2-3&#xD;
      sessions. They will be offered a thorough medical examination comprising a general check-up,&#xD;
      a fasting blood draw and oral glucose tolerance test, a focused orthopaedic examination, a&#xD;
      sleep apnea screening, and an ultrasound of the liver. The aim of the study is to elicit the&#xD;
      acceptance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and to assess the frequency of&#xD;
      co-morbidities in obese and extremely obese youth. This knowledge will optimize medical&#xD;
      treatment and support options. Interested participants will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      further steps of YES, which entail medical care and psycho-social support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter study, we aim to recruit adolescents from various medical and non-medical&#xD;
      settings and examine their acceptance of diagnostic and subsequent treatment procedures. We&#xD;
      will compare the prevalence rates and severity of co-morbidities between adolescents with&#xD;
      extreme obesity (BMI ≥35kg/m2)and those with less severe obesity (BMI 30-34.9kg/m2). This&#xD;
      project is part of the &quot;Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity -&#xD;
      acceptance and effects of structured care study&quot;, short: &quot;Youth with extreme obesity Study&#xD;
      (YES)&quot;, which also comprises a randomized controlled trial to investigate a novel&#xD;
      intervention targeted at improving quality of life and social functioning of extremely obese&#xD;
      adolescents, a structured prospective evaluation of adolescent bariatric surgery, and&#xD;
      economic assessments of the financial burden of extreme adolescent obesity on the healthcare&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current state of knowledge, we have formulated the following hypotheses in&#xD;
      regards to baseline characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The prevalence of somatic, psychiatric and psycho-social co-morbidities is higher, and&#xD;
           health related quality of life is lower in extremely obese youth compared to the control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The prevalence of somatic co-morbidities is equal in treatment-seeking and non&#xD;
           treatment-seeking youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities is higher and health related quality of&#xD;
           life is lower in treatment-seeking compared to non treatment-seeking youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The acceptance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is lower in extremely obese&#xD;
           youth compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The acceptance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is lower in non&#xD;
           treatment-seeking- compared to treatment-seeking youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Socio-economic status, intelligence and educational status are predictors of treatment&#xD;
           seeking behaviour and of the acceptance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five participating university centers are distributed across 4 geographic regions in the&#xD;
      North (Berlin), in the West (Essen/Datteln), in the East (Leipzig) and in the South (Ulm) of&#xD;
      Germany, and will therefore render data that are representative of Germany as a whole. We&#xD;
      will recruit a total of 600 adolescents age 14 to 24.9 years (initial age 21 years, changed&#xD;
      in an amendment in February 2013) with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) and 600 adolescents&#xD;
      with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) over a 24 months period. Baseline assessments include an&#xD;
      array of standardized questionnaires and validated instruments to assess health,&#xD;
      psycho-social situation, psychiatric co-morbidities and health related quality of life (in&#xD;
      the amendment in February 2013, the scope of psychosocial questions was reduced), as well as&#xD;
      a physical examination, laboratory tests, liver ultrasound, and screenings for orthopedic&#xD;
      co-morbidities and sleep apnea. Subjects who participate in the baseline examination will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the subsequent components of YES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will reveal comorbidity rates and psycho-social situation, and demonstrate the&#xD;
      acceptance and outcomes of a structured healthcare program for adolescents with extreme&#xD;
      obesity. The planned subsequent longitudinal study will provide unique information on the&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial development of adolescents with extreme obesity in Germany.&#xD;
