  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a common complaint of childhood, associated with&#xD;
      considerable health care costs, disruption of normal activity, emotional distress, and&#xD;
      long-term health effects. The study will test a treatment approach which, if successful,&#xD;
      would substantially change the treatment for FAP and potentially for a wide range of&#xD;
      childhood medical problems where parental responses to symptoms contribute to these adverse&#xD;
      effects. The study would also provide a model which would be much more accessible than&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face therapies to a broader range of families in need than are currently&#xD;
      served.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Abdominal Pain (FAP) affects 10 to 15% of children and has significant social,&#xD;
      emotional, and financial costs, but no known organic cause and no accepted medical or&#xD;
      behavioral treatment. The researchers have conducted studies that provide support for a&#xD;
      theoretical model in which cognitive-behavioral and social learning processes (modeling&#xD;
      and/or potentially reinforcing responses by parents) may contribute to the maintenance of&#xD;
      illness behaviors and functional disability in children with FAP. The researchers&#xD;
      subsequently tested a social learning and cognitive-behavioral intervention for parent-child&#xD;
      dyads which focused on changing these parent behaviors as well as teaching coping skills to&#xD;
      children. Results support the effectiveness of the intervention and the explanatory value of&#xD;
      the theory, demonstrating that parental change is a key element in reducing children's&#xD;
      symptoms. The proposed study will build on these findings by evaluating a parent-only&#xD;
      intervention. Furthermore, our experience and that of other investigators indicates that&#xD;
      alternative intervention models are needed for wider accessibility to the intervention for&#xD;
      families in need. While a parent-only format is expected to increase accessibility, we will&#xD;
      also evaluate the use of a remote telephone intervention.&#xD;
