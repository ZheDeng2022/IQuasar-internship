    <textblock>
      Ilio-inguinal nerve blocks have a long history of efficacy in treatment of post-operative&#xD;
      pain following inguinal surgery. Several anatomic studies have shown that the nerves&#xD;
      supplying the inguinal area have a certain degree of variability with respect to their&#xD;
      location between the internal and external oblique layers of the anterior abdominal wall.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the standard single-shot approach to ilio-inguinal nerve blocks has a&#xD;
      significant incidence of unintended femoral nerve block, which can impair patients' ability&#xD;
      to walk after surgery. The investigators are proposing a new approach to the ilio-inguinal&#xD;
      nerve block, which divides the total dose of local anesthetic into 3 equal parts, injecting&#xD;
      each 1/3 into different layers of the anterior abdominal wall and sub-cutaneously. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to show that this new technique, the Tsui approach, provides equal&#xD;
      analgesia to the standard single-shot ultrasound-guided ilio-inguinal nerve block, while&#xD;
      being faster to perform and having a lower incidence of unintended femoral nerve blockade.&#xD;
      Patients under age 10 who are scheduled for elective inguinal surgery (hydrocele repair,&#xD;
      orchidopexy, and inguinal hernia repair), who have already consented to an ilio-inguinal&#xD;
      nerve block that is commonly placed for this type of procedure, will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in this study. No increased risk is anticipated for these patients, as both&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided and blind techniques are equally well-accepted in the literature for this&#xD;
      type of block, and in addition there are few vascular or neural structures in this anatomical&#xD;
      area (just medial and inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine) that may be damaged.&#xD;
      Follow-up will be limited to an assessment of pain scores in the PACU post-operatively and&#xD;
      any unintended femoral nerve blockade in post-PACU. This will not delay their hospital&#xD;
      discharge as these are same-day surgery patients.&#xD;

      Project Summary Rationale - The conventional technique for performing an ilio-inguinal nerve&#xD;
      block involves a single shot of local anesthetic (usually 0.3 mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine) in&#xD;
      the transversus abdominis plane of the anterior abdominal wall. Using a blind technique (also&#xD;
      known as &quot;fascial click&quot;), a blunted needle (20 gauge) is placed 1 cm medial and 1 cm&#xD;
      inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and directed downward perpendicular to&#xD;
      the skin surface until two distinct &quot;pops&quot; are felt, corresponding to the external and&#xD;
      internal oblique fascial layers. The entire volume of local anesthetic is then deposited in&#xD;
      this plane. Success with this technique ranges from 35-75% in the literature (1-3). Studies&#xD;
      have shown that volumes as low as 0.075 mL/kg of 0.25% levobupivacaine have provided equal&#xD;
      analgesia to 0.2 mL/kg for up to 4 hours post-operatively when ultrasound guidance is used to&#xD;
      ensure placement of local anesthetic near the ilio-inguinal and/or ilio-hypogastric nerves&#xD;
      (4), resulting in a 100% success rate for this block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing a technique that will deliver 1/3 of the total dose of local anesthetic (0.3&#xD;
      mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine) for each layer of the lower anterior abdominal wall. Due to the&#xD;
      anatomic variability of the course of the ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric nerves, we&#xD;
      believe that the placement of 0.1 mL/kg in each of the external oblique, internal oblique,&#xD;
      and transversus abdominis layers will improve the success of the &quot;fascial click&quot; approach&#xD;
      without the need for ultrasound guidance. In addition, the ilio-inguinal nerve block has a&#xD;
      known complication of unintended femoral nerve block. The incidence of femoral nerve block&#xD;
      varies from 4.5% to 9% (5); in fact, one randomized controlled trial of ilio-inguinal nerve&#xD;
      block for inguinal hernia repair in adults had to be stopped prior to completion due to&#xD;
      patient harm (falls, etc) from femoral nerve blockade (6). We propose that a 3-layer&#xD;
      technique will have a lower incidence of unintended femoral nerve block as compared to the&#xD;
      conventional single-shot technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inguinal surgery (orchidopexy, inguinal hernia repair, or hydrocele repair), both the&#xD;
      ilio-inguinal and ilio-hypogastric nerves need to be blocked. The ilio-inguinal nerve arises&#xD;
      from L1 and follows the inguinal canal to innervate the medial aspect of the thigh, anterior&#xD;
      scrotum or labia. The ilio-hypogastric nerve has an anterior cutaneous branch the runs at the&#xD;
      level of the ASIS, providing innervation to the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the inguinal&#xD;
      region. For orchidopexy surgery, additional local anesthetic may be needed if the scrotal&#xD;
      incision is towards the apex of the scrotum (posterior - perineal nerve vs anterolateral -&#xD;
      genito-femoral nerve) rather than on the anterior aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goals and Objectives Primary Objective - To introduce a new technique of IHN/IIN blocks&#xD;
      that is equianalgesic to the single-shot technique without requiring ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective - To introduce a technique that has a lower incidence of unintended&#xD;
      femoral nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Randomized controlled trial comparing two groups: single-shot group (0.3 mL/kg&#xD;
      of 0.25% bupivacaine placed 1 cm medial to the ASIS following two &quot;pops&quot; via the fascial&#xD;
      click method), and the three-shot (TS) group, where 1/3 of the total dose above is deposited&#xD;
      in each of the 3 layers (external and internal oblique, transversus abdominis). In the TS&#xD;
      group, 0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected per layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods After IRB approval, ASA I-II children presenting for inguinal surgery (orchidopexy,&#xD;
      inguinal hernia, or hydrocele repair) whose parents have already given consent for an&#xD;
      ilio-inguinal nerve block, will be approached to participate in this study. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from parents, while verbal assent will be obtained from children&#xD;
      where appropriate. Exclusion criteria include patient or parental refusal, local anesthetic&#xD;
      allergy, or contraindication to ilio-inguinal nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ilio-inguinal nerve blocks will be performed by the attending anesthesiologist who is&#xD;
      responsible for the child's anesthetic. Each child will be premedicated with 20 mg/kg of oral&#xD;
      acetaminophen. Induction of anesthesia will be intravenous (propofol and remifentanil) or via&#xD;
      facemask (oxygen and sevoflurane) according to the discretion of the attending anesthetist.&#xD;
      Following placement of intravenous access and laryngeal mask airway, anesthesia will be&#xD;
      maintained with 1 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) of sevoflurane in air/O2 with&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation. Intraoperative monitoring will include heart rate,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, oxygen concentration, and anesthetic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SonoSite ultrasound unit (SonoSite M-Turbo, Bothell, WA, USA) and a SLAx 13-6 MHz linear&#xD;
      hockey stick probe will be used to document the placement of the local anesthetic and the&#xD;
      relevant anatomical structures. The study investigators will turn the screen away from the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist performing the block and will save 'before' and 'after' images of&#xD;
      the block onto a USB stick via the ultrasound machine. The attending anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      sterilize the area with chlorhexidine solution and locate the ASIS. Using a blunted 20 gauge&#xD;
      needle, they will place the needle approximately one finger's-breadth medial to the ASIS and&#xD;
      insert perpendicular to the skin until 2 pops are felt. If the patient has been randomized to&#xD;
      the single-shot group, following negative aspiration, all of the local anesthetic (0.3 mL/kg&#xD;
      of 0.25% bupivacaine) will be injected here. A screen shot of local anesthetic spread will&#xD;
      then be saved through the ultrasound machine onto a USB stick. If the patient has been&#xD;
      randomized to the three-shot (TS) group, following negative aspiration, one third of the&#xD;
      local anesthetic (0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine) will be injected here, then pulled back one&#xD;
      &quot;pop&quot; to the next layer where another third of the local anesthetic will be injected. The&#xD;
      final third of the local anesthetic dose will be injected subcutaneously in a skin wheal&#xD;
      medial to the ASIS. Again, a screen shot of local anesthetic spread will be saved via the&#xD;
      ultrasound machine to a USB stick. The USB stick will be password-protected using only&#xD;
      consecutive numbers to identify the patients. The investigator who will later review the&#xD;
      screen shots from the ultrasound will thus be blinded from patient allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following block placement, the surgeon may prep and drape the patient in preparation for the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Baseline heart rate and arterial blood pressure will be noted following&#xD;
      skin incision. An increase in heart rate or arterial blood pressure greater than 20% from&#xD;
      baseline will be treated with rescue analgesia (fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV). For orchidopexy,&#xD;
      additional local anesthetic (0.1 mL/kg 0.25% bupivacaine) will be used for local infiltration&#xD;
      of the scrotal incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, analgesia will be recorded by trained pediatric nurses in the&#xD;
      post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) using the FLACC pain scale for young children or non-verbal&#xD;
      patients, and using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Score for older children. Both are rated on a&#xD;
      scale of 0-10. Any score greater than 6 will be treated with morphine 0.05 mg/kg IV, up to 2&#xD;
      doses, 15 minutes apart. PACU nurses will also note any quadriceps weakness, indicating an&#xD;
      unintended femoral nerve block. Following discharge from PACU, the patients will continue to&#xD;
      be monitored for pain scores in day surgery area for up to 4 hours post-operatively. No&#xD;
      follow-up is planned beyond discharge from day surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that a blind, single shot technique for ilio-inguinal nerve blocks has a&#xD;
      success rate of 35-75% (1-3). For the purposes of our study, we will use a value of 60%&#xD;
      efficacy for the single-shot technique. We hypothesize that a 3-shot technique will have an&#xD;
      efficacy of 90%, based on studies showing 100% efficacy for single-shot ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      technique (4), and 94% efficacy in a similar study (7). For a power of 0.8, alpha 0.05, we&#xD;
      calculate a sample size of 32 patients per group.&#xD;
