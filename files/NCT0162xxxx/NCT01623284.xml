  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine whether there are clinical features that can be used as&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict whether underlying Alzheimer's pathology is the cause of a speech and&#xD;
      language based dementia. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of patients who test&#xD;
      positive for beta-amyloid deposition will vary across different speech and language based&#xD;
      dementias.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Speech and language based dementias (SLDs) (often referred to as primary progressive aphasias&#xD;
      or PPA) are neurodegenerative diseases in which speech or language impairments are the most&#xD;
      salient features of the disease and explain deficits in activities of daily living. Patients&#xD;
      with SLDs may have poor grammar, prominent anomia, comprehension deficits, speech production&#xD;
      and articulation problems, difficulty with repetition of words or sentences, word finding&#xD;
      pauses, or a combination of all these features. The SLDs can be further divided into&#xD;
      different subtypes. Up to 50% of patients with SLDs that go on to autopsy have shown&#xD;
      Alzheimer type pathology where beta-amyloid deposition is observed; the rest have pathology&#xD;
      consistent with frontotemporal lobar degeneration where beta-amyloid deposition is absent.&#xD;
      Future disease modifying treatments that target beta-amyloid will most likely differ from&#xD;
      treatments that do not target beta-amyloid. As a consequence, biomarkers are needed to&#xD;
      differentiate patients with SLDs with and without beta-amyloid deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research has been done to identify biomarkers that could differentiate patients with&#xD;
      SLDs with and without beta-amyloid, mainly because the gold standard to identify the presence&#xD;
      of beta-amyloid has been pathological examination, which does not always occur, and may not&#xD;
      occur until more than 10 years after onset. The recent development of&#xD;
      [N-methyl-11C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole also known as 11C Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Compound B or PiB is a solution to this problem since PiB allows the in vivo detection of&#xD;
      beta-amyloid. Unfortunately, PiB is very expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of our research is to develop a cost effective algorithmic approach to the&#xD;
      evaluation and diagnosis of patients presenting with SLDs. The objective of the studies&#xD;
      outlined in this proposal is to identify clinical, neuropsychological, or imaging biomarkers&#xD;
      that are readily available, relatively inexpensive, and non-invasive that will allow the&#xD;
      differentiation of patients with SLDs with and without beta-amyloid deposition. We will use&#xD;
      PiB as an indicator of beta-amyloid pathology. Our proposal is predicated upon our strong&#xD;
      preliminary data showing that clinical, neuropsychological and radiological features differ&#xD;
      between patients with SLDs with and without beta-amyloid deposition. Our central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that temporo-parietal lobe findings such as memory loss, visuospatial/perceptual&#xD;
      impairment, parietal lobe atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and parietal lobe&#xD;
      hypometabolism on [18-F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), will be&#xD;
      associated with beta-amyloid deposition (PiB positive status). On-the-other hand, frontal&#xD;
      lobe features, such as apraxia of speech and behavioral and executive dysfunction, as well as&#xD;
      extrapyramidal features such as Parkinsonism, will be associated with absence of beta-amyloid&#xD;
      deposition (PiB negative status). The rationale for examining these clinical-imaging&#xD;
      relationships is that successful predictions will provide a solid scientific foundation for&#xD;
      the ultimate development of a cost effective algorithm to guide the diagnosis of SLDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients found to be eligible and willing to enroll in this study will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
      Neurologic Examination, a Speech Pathology Consultation, Neuropsychometric testing, an MRI&#xD;
      scan, an FDG PET scan and a PiB PET scan of the brain. This will be done over a period of two&#xD;
      days at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.&#xD;
