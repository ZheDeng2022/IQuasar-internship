  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the major health problems for chinese women. Besides surgery and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proved to be an effective program by many&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, not all patients respond well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Knowing the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before receiving it can not only reduce the economic&#xD;
      burden, but also more importantly save time to take more suitable treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is undertaken to build a model combine both clinical and genetic factors to&#xD;
      predict the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Cervical cancer has been one of the most commom malignant diseases among femails, and do a&#xD;
      lot of harm to both young and older women, especially to the people in the undeveloped areas.&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been investigated for treatment of cervical cancer patients&#xD;
      since 1980s around the world（Sardi J, Di Paola G, Giaroli A, Sananes C, Burlando S and Rueda&#xD;
      NG，1988；Mancuso S, Benedetti Panici P, Greggi S and Scambia G，1989.）. Clinicians found that&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy can help to diminish the tumor size,eliminate the distant&#xD;
      metastasis; thus, patients can get the opportunity of surgery (Benedetti Panici P, Scambia G,&#xD;
      Greggi S, Di Roberto P, Baiocchi G and Mancuso S，1988). As a result, women may have the&#xD;
      chance to have their ovarian function preserved; and by plus surgery and post-surgery&#xD;
      therapy, the women may also be able to be cured in the areas where sophisticated radiotherapy&#xD;
      utilities are not availble.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the development of science and techonology in chemotherapy for cervical cancer, the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy was also brought into China. And since 1990s, the investigation of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in China has been carried out in the teaching hospitals of China's&#xD;
      leading famous universities in the developed aress. Strengthened by the prosperous economy of&#xD;
      the countries, neoadjuvant chemotherapy began familar to China's Gyneclogists before the&#xD;
      ending of the 20th century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the beginning of the 21th century, that's in the early 2000s, neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      has been introduced as a new therapeutic therapy method. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also&#xD;
      showed its own advantages (Chang TC, Lai CH, Hong JH, Hsueh S, Huang KG, Chou HH, Tseng CJ,&#xD;
      Tsai CS, Chang JT, Lin CT, Chang HH, Chao PJ, Ng KK, Tang SG and Soong YK, 2000) and carried&#xD;
      out in our hospitals, with the approvements of the institutions. Response both short-term and&#xD;
      long-term response were evaluated. Clinical response, which is also known as early reponse,&#xD;
      is also one of the short-term response, and has also been evaluated according to the response&#xD;
      criterion. Patients' toxicity and long-term survival have also been recorded and evaluated.&#xD;
      The treatment, as well as the study, was carried out in accordance with the approved&#xD;
      guidelines. All eligible patients gave written informed consent before therapy. All protocols&#xD;
      were approved by the ethical committees in the universities or the institutions, and updated&#xD;
      with the renovated Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the middle stage or the late stage of 2000s, more clinicians have studied neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the top universities hospitals as well as our hospitals, and taken the&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens to the hospitals and institutions of theirs for the treatment of&#xD;
      cervical cancer patients. Some of them have also taken part in the study with us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And since the begining of the 2010s, more hospitals have taken part in the neoadjuvant study&#xD;
      with us, and the number of the institutions have been updated with updation of protocols and&#xD;
      ethical approvements. Patients who have fulfilled the inclusion criterion have been included&#xD;
      with exclusion of disabled patients, such as Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 70，hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy has been treated as an standard treatment of cervical&#xD;
      cancer (ref 4-6), neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also showed its own advantages (Chang TC, Lai&#xD;
      CH, Hong JH, Hsueh S, Huang KG, Chou HH, Tseng CJ, Tsai CS, Chang JT, Lin CT, Chang HH, Chao&#xD;
      PJ, Ng KK, Tang SG and Soong YK, 2000): it can facilitate premenopause women to have their&#xD;
      ovarian function preserved in addition to the facility of radical surgery, some people have&#xD;
      so good response that the tumor disappear completely after neosdjuvant chemotherapy. This may&#xD;
      open an new window to young women who want to have their fertility (including uterus and&#xD;
      ovaries) preserved. And the mechanism of chemotherapy-response and chemo-resistence in still&#xD;
      need to be widely and deeply explored, which is also important for clinicians to understand&#xD;
      the pathway of chemo-drugs' metablism and to avoid the toxic effect of the chemo-drugs.&#xD;
