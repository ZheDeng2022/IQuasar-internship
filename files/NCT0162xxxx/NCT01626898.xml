  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wake Forest University is partnering with Chatham Social Health Council (a community-based&#xD;
      organization) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Hombres&#xD;
      Ofreciendo Liderazgo y Apoyo (HOLA) en Grupos (Men Giving Leadership and Support in Groups),&#xD;
      a Spanish-language HIV risk behavior intervention for Latino men who have sex with men (MSM)&#xD;
      in rural North Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the HOLA intervention, when compared to those in the comparison intervention,&#xD;
      will report: increased consistent use of condoms during sexual intercourse; increased use of&#xD;
      HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services;&#xD;
      greater knowledge concerning the impact of HIV on communities (including Latino and MSM)and&#xD;
      HIV risk behaviors and prevention strategies; more positive attitudes towards abstinence and&#xD;
      condom use; increased self-efficacy to use and assert the use of condoms with sex partners;&#xD;
      increased condom-use mastery scores; decreased barriers to risk reduction (e.g.&#xD;
      health-compromising aspects of machismo); and enhanced partner and provider communication and&#xD;
      sexual negotiation skills.&#xD;

      Wake Forest University is partnering with Chatham Social Health Council to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Hombres Ofreciendo Liderazgo y Apoyo&#xD;
      (HOLA) en Grupos (Men Giving Leadership and Support in Groups) HIV risk behavior intervention&#xD;
      for Latino men who have sex with men (MSM), ages 18 and over, in rural North Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spanish language HOLA en Grupos was developed by the Chatham Social Health Council in&#xD;
      close collaboration and partnership with the local Latino community, including Latino MSM,&#xD;
      and representatives from a local community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership&#xD;
      that has been in existence for nearly ten years, and has been delivered by the Council to&#xD;
      Latino MSM in an area the includes 6 largely rural counties for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOLA en Grupos consists of four 4-hour group sessions that combine presentations by&#xD;
      facilitators who are trained Latino MSM community members, activities, and scenes from a DVD,&#xD;
      and is delivered over a period of two weeks to groups of about 10 participants. HOLA en&#xD;
      Grupos was designed to increase HIV prevention knowledge, condom use and mastery, decrease&#xD;
      barriers to risk reduction (e.g., health-compromising aspects of machismo), enhance sexual&#xD;
      negotiation skills, and increase use of HIV testing, counseling, and treatment services among&#xD;
      intervention participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spanish language comparison condition consists of four 4-hour group sessions designed to&#xD;
      increase participants' knowledge about cancer, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and is delivered over a period of two weeks to groups of about 10 participants. The&#xD;
      content focus of the comparison condition reflects the desire of community partners to&#xD;
      provide this type of information to community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 Latino MSM (150 per condition) will be screened and if eligible, recruited in&#xD;
      waves of 20 men (10 per condition). Eligible individuals must self-identify as Latino or&#xD;
      Hispanic, be ≥ 18 years of age, report MSM behavior since age ≥ 18, and provide informed&#xD;
      consent. Individuals who have participated in the HOLA en Grupos, or interventions for Latino&#xD;
      heterosexual men (HoMBReS or HoMBReS-2), will be excluded from the study. Study assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
