      This study aims to investigate the relative effectiveness of two different pain management&#xD;
      plans for injuries sustained while active duty in the military. One arm of the study has&#xD;
      subjects undergo standard comprehensive medical management, while the other adds the&#xD;
      placement of a spinal cord stimulator, a common procedure for the alleviation of pain.&#xD;

    <description>Pain rating using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) over time. The NPRS is assessing the patients pain on a 11-point rating scale from 0 - 10 with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst imaginable pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is a veteran or active duty service member injured while on active military&#xD;
             duty receiving care for pain related to the injury(ies) in the Department of Defense&#xD;
             health care system or through the Department of Veteran's Affairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The elapsed time since the active-duty injury leading to chronic pain is not less than&#xD;
             3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject reports constant or daily episodes of injury-related pain of at least moderate&#xD;
             severity, graded 4 or higher on an 11-point NPRS (point estimate by subject and&#xD;
             Investigator at time of enrolment based on overall pain or pain at a specific site).&#xD;
             Pain may be nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed. Phantom pain associated with&#xD;
             amputation of an extremity or extremities is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Attempts to control pain with commercially available systemic analgesics have not&#xD;
             provided adequate relief, in the judgment of the managing physician and subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is able to localize site(s) of pain. At least one site of daily pain&#xD;
             contributing to moderate severity (Inclusion Criterion 4) and intractability&#xD;
             (Inclusion Criterion 5) must be in an extremity, or phantom pain at the site of an&#xD;
             amputated extremity. If the extremity site of pain is not an amputated limb, then the&#xD;
             pain must have a neuropathic component. This site is identified as the site of Target&#xD;
             Pain (TP) for efficacy evaluations during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is an acceptable candidate for surgical placement of an indwelling spinal cord&#xD;
             stimulation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is judged an appropriate candidate for treatment using the available&#xD;
             techniques and interventions encompassed within the protocol's definition of&#xD;
             comprehensive medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For the duration of the trial, subject is willing to limit interventions for control&#xD;
             of chronic pain to those approved by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject is judged psychologically appropriate for either treatment intervention,&#xD;
             based on the impression of an interviewing psychologist or psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject provides informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject experiences phantom pain associated with amputation of both an upper and lower&#xD;
             extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has headache or visceral truncal pain or other non-musculoskeletal pain as the&#xD;
             only pain that results in constant or daily scores of â‰¥4 on the 11-point NPRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has spinal disease that would, in the judgment of the investigator, preclude&#xD;
             placement of a spinal cord stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has ongoing chronic infection or a medical condition associated with an&#xD;
             unacceptably increased risk of infection related to device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a current diagnosis or history of psychosis, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
             hallucinations, or unexplained loss of consciousness, whether or not related to a&#xD;
             combat injury that, in the opinion of the investigator, would exclude the patient from&#xD;
             participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a cardiac pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has any significant medical or psychiatric condition that would interfere with&#xD;
             the conduct of the study or with the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is pregnant or is breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has participated in any drug or device trial in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has any planned elective or semi-elective surgery during the 6 months of the&#xD;
             Primary Treatment Phase, including stump revisions or grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has a psychological condition of great enough severity that it would&#xD;
             unacceptably increase the medical risks associated with implantation and care of the&#xD;
             devices required for the treatment on the CMM + SCS arm, or would likely interfere&#xD;
             with the subject's ability to sustain participation in a research study of long&#xD;
             duration. Investigators are encouraged to include the medical monitor and the&#xD;
             coordinating investigator in discussions about individual candidate subjects who have&#xD;
             psychological diagnoses as part of the polytrauma syndrome before enrollment or&#xD;
             treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
