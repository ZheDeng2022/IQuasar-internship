    <textblock>
      Use of positron emission tomography (PET) in determination of functional tumour volume can&#xD;
      provide usable information for radiotherapy to define the irradiated volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the best tumour volume measure method, the investigators have chosen as model&#xD;
      the breast cancer which allows us to study a stationary or moving organ by the patient&#xD;
      position and belonging to a primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used methodology is based on lesion volume measure in preoperative time, obtained with&#xD;
      PET, and on the measure of specimen volume by the anatomic laboratory after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's main objective is to compare this two measure of tumour size and secondarily to&#xD;
      compare TEP with or without respiratory gating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET-scan is achieved with FDG, under his French permission marketing, and acquire in 3&#xD;
      times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A whole body acquisition in supine position, follow by a centered tumour acquisition with&#xD;
      respiratory gating, then an acquisition in prone position to immobilise the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is monocentric and descriptive. It provides to include 30 patients in 1 year.&#xD;

      The use of positron emission tomography (PET) in determination of functional tumour volume&#xD;
      may pose two major problems especially for the exact delineation of tumour contours:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory movements, when the tumour is thoracic, may induce an overestimation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PET's low spatial resolution, linked to the emission of photons&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual method to define tumour contours result of three types of delineation usually used:&#xD;
      the visual contouring, the segmentation based on an activity threshold fixed, and the&#xD;
      segmentation with adaptive thresholding.&#xD;
