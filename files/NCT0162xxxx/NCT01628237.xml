  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) constitutes a frequent pathology, generates a severe&#xD;
      handicap for patients and represents a considerable expense for healthcare system.&#xD;
      Neurostimulation has currently not been validated in the treatment of back pain because of&#xD;
      technological limitations in implantable spinal cord stimulation (SCS). The lack of a&#xD;
      validated technique for back pain relief has prompted the development of newer devices,&#xD;
      including leads with increased number of contacts (up to 16) and various geometric&#xD;
      arrangements, the objective of which is to cover a larger area while attempting to extend,&#xD;
      steer, or focus the electric field of the stimulation within the spinal cord regions. This&#xD;
      led companies to design a new generation of multicolumn surgical leads that allow the&#xD;
      activation of longitudinal and transverse electric fields (multicolumn spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation, MSCS) in order to provide bilateral paresthesia coverage of back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of MSCS (using longitudinal&#xD;
      and transverse electric stimulation) versus mono-column spinal cord stimulation (CSCS, using&#xD;
      axial stimulation, actually represented by quadripolar or octopolar lead) on the treatment of&#xD;
      lumbar pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 115 patients will be randomized to either CSCS or MSCS. Patients, between 18 and&#xD;
      80 years old suffering from refractory neuropathic pain of radicular origin with associated&#xD;
      back pain will be included. Patients will be divided into two groups. One group with MSCS&#xD;
      during the 12 months after the new generation electrode implantation and one group with CSCS&#xD;
      during 6 months and MSCS between 6 and 12 months after the new generation electrode&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be evaluated during this study: overall pain VAS, leg pain VAS,&#xD;
      back pain VAS, Oswestry disability index, Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating scale,&#xD;
      Brief Anxiety Scale and the Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension Health questionnaire and costing&#xD;
      in relation to surgery and patient management.&#xD;
