      Understanding bone growth and achieving bone deformity corrections re-mains one of the oldest&#xD;
      challenges in paediatric orthopaedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical and biomechanical effects of&#xD;
      implants for growth modulation in pediatric patients undergoing correction of leg length or&#xD;
      deformities of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to assess outcome after growth modulation using the Eight&#xD;
      plate (Orthofix) at the time of implant removal with regard to any Adverse Events (AE)&#xD;
      related to the growth plates or implants under investigation. The secondary aims are to&#xD;
      assess if the planned correction was achieved and if the achieved correction was maintained&#xD;
      after implant removal. Furthermore, secondary aims include investigation of the number and&#xD;
      type of revision surgeries, the proportions of any other local AE as well as any influencing&#xD;
      factors for growth modulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the oldest mysteries in paediatric orthopaedics is the knowledge about bone growth and&#xD;
      the ability to correct acquired bone deformities. Guiding the growth of a bone for deformity&#xD;
      cor-rection by harnessing the ability of a growing bone to undergo plastic deformity is a&#xD;
      well-known pediatric orthopaedic principle. Nevertheless, there are still many open questions&#xD;
      concerning growth and guided growth. Several surgical options already exist for correction of&#xD;
      angular de-formity and leg length discrepancies. The gold standard remains the corrective&#xD;
      osteo¬tomy before or after growth arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction during growth poses the risk of recurrence of the deformity during growth. By any&#xD;
      means, growth modulation involves major surgery and requires internal or external fixation.&#xD;
      Epiphysiodesis or hemiepiphysiodesis, either permanent or temporarily, can be done in an open&#xD;
      or percutaneous way. Permanent epiphysiodesis is mainly performed using screws, while for a&#xD;
      temporary epiphysiodesis staples or plate/screw systems are used. The treatment seems to be&#xD;
      clinically effective, but the precise calculation of the remaining growth and the optimal&#xD;
      surgical timing are crucial. Furthermore, the underlying biomechanical properties are not yet&#xD;
      fully known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical effects of the Eight Plate system&#xD;
      for growth modulation treatments in pediatric patients undergoing leg length corrections or&#xD;
      deformity corrections of the knee. The primary aim of the study is to assess outcome of&#xD;
      growth modulation at removal of the implants with regards to AEs related to the growth plates&#xD;
      or implants under investigation. The secondary aims are to assess if the planned correction&#xD;
      was achieved and if the achieved correction was maintained after Eight Plate removal.&#xD;
      Furthermore, secondary aims include the investigation of the number and type of revision&#xD;
      surgeries, any functional deficits after implant removal, any additional local AE, the&#xD;
      assessment of the primary implant positioning, and any additional radiological parameters&#xD;
      related to the implants and leg alignment.&#xD;
