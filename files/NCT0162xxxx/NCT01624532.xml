      1. Step 1&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigate the optimum volume of GC1109 to compare the subject ratio after&#xD;
                seroconversion in each Anti-PA Ab by TNA at 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3&#xD;
                times with the immunogenicity of each treatment (GC1109 and placebo cohort) in&#xD;
                healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In healthy adults, three times the clinical dose of about four weeks, compare&#xD;
                immunogenicity of each treatment group (GC1109 group and the placebo group) with&#xD;
                subsects ratio who have been Seroconversion for Anti-PA Ab by TNA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percentage of subjects after seroconversion in each anti-PA IgG level (by ELISA) at&#xD;
                4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Check the Seroprotection antibody titer (survival rate : 50%) with passive immune&#xD;
                (nonclinical tests) at 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Establish the Seroconversion rate from the percentage of subjects after&#xD;
                seroconversion at 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times and seroprotection&#xD;
                antibody titer in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the immunogenicity of each treatment with the GMT's assessment of Anti-PA&#xD;
                Ab by TNA for 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare the immunogenicity of each treatment with the GMT's assessment of Anti-PA&#xD;
                IgG by ELISA for 4 weeks following infuse the drug 3 times&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the safety of the each treatment cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Step 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluate whether the Toxin Neutralization Antibody by TNA assay satisfy the NF50 standard&#xD;
      or not at 4 weeks following infuse the optimal dose of GC1109 4 times in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety of the GC1109 in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the GMT of Toxin Neutralization Antibody by TNA assay after infusing the drug&#xD;
           4 times until 24 weeks in healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the GMT of Anti-PA IgG by ELISA after infusing the drug 4 times until 24 weeks&#xD;
           in healthy adults&#xD;
