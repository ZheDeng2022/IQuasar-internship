  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa may be responsible for a catch- down or even an interruption of growth,&#xD;
      delayed puberty and osteopenia with failure of acquisition of bone mass. The recovery of&#xD;
      normal nutrition usually leads to a resumption of growth and pubertal development. However,&#xD;
      despite a therapeutic nutritional and psychotherapeutic satisfactory approach, some patients&#xD;
      have a significant short stature with reduced adult final height and a deficit of bone mass.&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of growth hormone (hGH) treatment on the growth&#xD;
      velocity in prepubertal children or children in early puberty with anorexia nervosa and&#xD;
      significant reduction of height velocity. This is a single-center, controlled, randomized and&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of hGH treatment for 1 year against a&#xD;
      placebo, on the growth velocity of prepubertal or children in early puberty with Anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa and major catch-down.This period is followed by the evaluation of the hGH treatment&#xD;
      in children receiving placebo and continued hGH treatment in the treatment arm for 1 year, in&#xD;
      total 2 years of study for each child. This second period corresponds to an ethical&#xD;
      consideration giving secondarily access to treatment for patients in the placebo group.&#xD;

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months after the&#xD;
      start of the trial. This evaluation will include a clinical evaluation and a biological&#xD;
      (IGF-I, IGFBP-3, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, mineral metabolism, thyroid function, 24 hours&#xD;
      urinary cortisol, as well as conventional electrolyte tolerance parameters), psychological&#xD;
      and nutritional study body composition by absorptiometry at 0, 12 and 24 months. Evaluations&#xD;
      will be conducted at the Center for Clinical Investigation at Hospital Robert Debre. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the linear growth rate 1 year after the start of the trial expressed&#xD;
      in cm/1 year in the group with hGH compared to the placebo group. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be the height velocity expressed in SDS (standard deviation score), the data of body&#xD;
      composition and psychological changes that will be assessed between the 2 arms at the end of&#xD;
      the two years of the clinical trial. The data of body composition obtained by dual photon&#xD;
      absorptiometry and biological data of mineral metabolism and growth factors are expressed in&#xD;
      Z score compared to normal references that we have established in France, in healthy subjects&#xD;
      according to age, gender and pubertal stage.&#xD;
