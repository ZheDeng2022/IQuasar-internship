    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about tobacco dependence and nicotine metabolism in&#xD;
      African-Americans and whites, by studying to see if how fast a person metabolizes nicotine&#xD;
      (how the body breaks down nicotine into inactive compounds) affects how dependent they are on&#xD;
      smoking cigarettes. The investigators believe that people with a faster rate of metabolism&#xD;
      may have more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms and also may have a harder time trying to&#xD;
      quit smoking.&#xD;

      Our studies will use the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) (the ratio between the nicotine&#xD;
      metabolites 3'hydroxycotinine and cotinine)as a simple and clinically feasible biomarker for&#xD;
      the rate of nicotine metabolism. The investigators hypothesize that a faster rate of&#xD;
      metabolism leads to faster elimination of nicotine from the body and a more rapid dissipation&#xD;
      of brain tolerance to nicotine in the interval between cigarettes, leading in turn to (1)&#xD;
      more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms and (2) greater subjective reward from the cigarette&#xD;
      smoked following deprivation. These effects would help to explain why smokers with faster&#xD;
      rates of nicotine metabolism have a poorer response to smoking cessation therapy when&#xD;
      compared to those with slower rates of metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will explore the relationship of the NMR to the endophenotypes of&#xD;
      withdrawal, craving and reward, with the assumption that these factors are likely&#xD;
      intermediaries for the mechanism linking nicotine metabolism to tobacco dependence and&#xD;
      smoking cessation rates with pharmacotherapy. Our study design uses a brief (6 hour) interval&#xD;
      of smoking abstinence followed by a &quot;reward&quot; cigarette to elicit the subjective responses&#xD;
      relating to withdrawal and reward. Because smoking behavior and severity of nicotine&#xD;
      dependence vary by race and sex the investigators will also compare the relationship between&#xD;
      NMR and withdrawal and reward in African American vs white smokers and in men vs women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will examine whether nicotine half-life mediates the observed effects of&#xD;
      NMR on primary response measures.&#xD;
