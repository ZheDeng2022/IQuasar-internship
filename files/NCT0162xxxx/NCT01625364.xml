      The purpose was to evaluate effectiveness and impact of an academic and counseling asthma&#xD;
      health education program (SHARP) for fourth- and fifth-grade students diagnosed with asthma.&#xD;
      Students attending schools randomized to the low-dose control condition received Open Airways&#xD;
      for Schools (OAS). The first aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of SHARP, compared to the&#xD;
      low-dose group, for students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma&#xD;
      management at 1, 12, and 24 months post-intervention. We hypothesized that compared to&#xD;
      students enrolled in elementary schools who received the low-dose program, students in&#xD;
      elementary schools that received SHARP would increase asthma knowledge (cognition) and&#xD;
      logical reasoning abilities for managing acute episodes (cognition), acceptance of asthma as&#xD;
      a chronic condition (psychosocial), and use of effective asthma health behaviors (behavior).&#xD;
      The second aim was to evaluate the long-term impact of SHARP, compared to the low-dose group,&#xD;
      for students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at&#xD;
      12 and 24 months post intervention. We hypothesized that compared to students enrolled in&#xD;
      elementary schools who received the low-dose program; students in elementary schools who&#xD;
      received SHARP would decrease asthma severity, use of healthcare services, and school&#xD;
      absenteeism due to asthma, and increase participation in life activities (quality of life).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over 7 million US children younger than age 18 years are currently diagnosed with asthma, and&#xD;
      approximately 4 million children experience exacerbation of asthma symptoms annually. The NIH&#xD;
      National Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma specify that part of a&#xD;
      successful management program includes educating students with asthma and their caregivers&#xD;
      about the condition. The guidelines recommend expanding education of students and families to&#xD;
      schools and community settings. An academic and counseling program was developed for older&#xD;
      school-age students with asthma and their family caregivers titled Staying Healthy-Asthma&#xD;
      Responsible &amp; Preparedâ„¢ (SHARP). A two-group prospective randomized single-blinded design was&#xD;
      used. The sample consisted of two cohorts of students diagnosed aged 9-12 years with asthma&#xD;
      and their caregivers from varying socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Cohort dyads&#xD;
      were drawn from 23 elementary schools that were located in a diverse, moderately sized,&#xD;
      medically underserved, inner-city community. The schools were matched based on projected&#xD;
      enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and&#xD;
      racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. Recently retired certified elementary&#xD;
      schoolteachers, identified by the district, were trained to serve as interveners to deliver&#xD;
      both programs in the schools during instructional time.&#xD;
