      This is a Phase 1,2 randomized, double-blind, multi-center, clinical trial, in participants&#xD;
      aged 65 years and older, evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of a water-in-oil emulsion&#xD;
      adjuvant (MAS-1 adjuvant, Mercia Pharma, Inc, Scarsdale, NY) combined with each of the three&#xD;
      reduced HA antigen dose levels of trivalent influenza virus vaccine compared with licensed,&#xD;
      unadjuvanted, standard dose trivalent virus (TIV). Immunogenicity for each of the three viral&#xD;
      strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus) in the concurrent influenza seasonal vaccine will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many VA patients are at-risk for complications from influenza because of advanced age and&#xD;
      underlying chronic diseases. A more effective influenza virus vaccine is needed in older&#xD;
      patient populations and high antibody levels are correlated with protection. Vaccine&#xD;
      dose-sparing to maximize the number of doses available is a public health goal. The&#xD;
      combination of influenza vaccine antigens with an adjuvant could help improve the vaccine.&#xD;
      This study will be a phase 1, 2 randomized, observer-blind, multi-center, clinical trial, in&#xD;
      patients aged 65 years and older, evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of a water-in-oil&#xD;
      emulsion adjuvant (MAS-1) combined with each of three reduced influenza hemagglutinin (HA)&#xD;
      antigen dose levels of trivalent influenza virus vaccine compared to unadjuvanted, standard&#xD;
      dose trivalent influenza virus vaccine (TIV). Immunogenicity for each of the three viral&#xD;
      strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus) in the concurrent seasonal influenza vaccine will be&#xD;
      assessed. The hypothesis is that adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine (using reduced doses of&#xD;
      influenza HA antigen containing 1 g, 3 g and 5 g of HA) has superior immunogenicity compared&#xD;
      to unadjuvanted, standard dose trivalent influenza virus vaccine (containing 15 g HA antigen)&#xD;
      for each of three viral strains, and the adjuvanted vaccine has an acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to demonstrate 1) acceptable safety for influenza virus vaccine,&#xD;
      adjuvanted with MAS-1 compared to unadjuvanted, standard dose TIV, and 2) improved&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine compared to unadjuvanted, standard&#xD;
      dose TIV for each of the three viral strains. Immunogenicity will be measured by&#xD;
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers. The primary measure of immunogenicity is&#xD;
      the seroconversion rate at 1 month post-vaccination for each viral strain. Secondary and&#xD;
      exploratory immunogenicity objectives include the seroprotection rate (defined as the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination HAI antibody titer &gt; 1:40 for a viral strain)&#xD;
      at 1, 3 and 6 months post-vaccination for each viral strain; the geometric mean titers (GMTs)&#xD;
      of HAI antibody and ratio of GMTs pre-vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months post-vaccination&#xD;
      between the four vaccine groups for each viral strain; and the geometric mean fold increase&#xD;
      (GMFI) at 1, 3 and 6 months post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (i.e., GMT of the&#xD;
      post-vaccination values divided by the GMT of the pre-vaccination value) for each virus&#xD;
      strain within each of the four vaccine groups. The study population of 160 subjects (40 per&#xD;
      vaccine group) who provide informed consent and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled at&#xD;
      four clinical sites. Subjects who meet the entry criteria for the study will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive one of the three adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine dose levels or&#xD;
      unadjuvanted, standard dose TIV. Randomization will be stratified by clinical site (4 sites)&#xD;
      and age (65-74 years old or 75 years old). Vaccine preparation will be performed at&#xD;
      point-of-use by the site pharmacists according to a standardized procedure. Administration of&#xD;
      vaccine will be performed by an unblinded vaccine administrator. Study assessments will be&#xD;
      performed by blinded study personnel. Subjects will also be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
      Study subjects will each participate for a total of 12 months post-vaccination. The whole&#xD;
      study duration of 32 - 32.5 months is expected to include 6 months of startup, 8 - 10 weeks&#xD;
      of enrollment, 12 months of follow-up post-vaccination and 12 months of study closure and&#xD;
      data analysis. If the objectives of this study are achieved and the hypothesis is correct,&#xD;
      the adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine at one or more of the reduced HA antigen doses will&#xD;
      induce an improved HAI antibody response compared to unadjuvanted, standard dose TIV with an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile. Results of this trial will inform the design of future clinical&#xD;
      trials studying adjuvanted influenza virus vaccines utilizing this novel water-in-oil&#xD;
      adjuvant emulsion that could include dose-finding studies for the optimal amount of adjuvant&#xD;
      combined with one HA antigen dose, and larger phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.&#xD;
