    <textblock>
      This study will explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess ventilatory&#xD;
      defects that occur due to asthma, determine the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in&#xD;
      response to drug treatment, and whether MRI can serve as a biomarker of treatment effects due&#xD;
      to asthma therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (ALL Patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a male or female 18 to 65 years of age with clinical diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
             for at least 1 year at the prestudy (screening) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients of reproductive potential, a blood pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             performed, and it must be negative before the patient can continue in this study. If&#xD;
             sexually active, the patient must agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures for&#xD;
             the duration of the study and for 2 weeks after Visit 5. Medically acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills,&#xD;
             patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm)&#xD;
             used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures&#xD;
             such as Plan B™, sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods for routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient understands the study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by&#xD;
             giving written informed consent (Consent must be given before any study procedures are&#xD;

             visit/protocol schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is judged to be in good health (except for asthma) based on medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, vital sign measurements, and laboratory safety tests performed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 39 kg/m2 at the prestudy screening (Visit 1).&#xD;
             BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight in kg and dividing by the patient's&#xD;
             height in meters, squared. Patient's body must fit within the scanner sufficiently&#xD;
             well to allow satisfactory imaging in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;

             for at least 6 months and has a smoking history of no more than 5 pack-years (i.e., 1&#xD;
             pack per day for 5 years). Patients who have discontinued smoking or the use of&#xD;
             nicotine / nicotine containing products for at least approximately 3 months may be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been defined by the study site team as having allergic asthma.&#xD;

             value or more than 100 mL, whichever is greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has no clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) performed&#xD;
             at the prestudy (screening) visit and/or prior to administration of the initial dose&#xD;
