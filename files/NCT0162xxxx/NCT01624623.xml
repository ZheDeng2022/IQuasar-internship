  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the daily use of a unique daily organ tracking system on target&#xD;
      localization in patients treated with radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved coverage of the target volume with radiotherapy could result in improved cancer&#xD;
      control rates and decreased coverage of surrounding structures potentially decreasing&#xD;
      treatment toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study evaluates the clinical utility of a novel real-time localization&#xD;
      system of the prostate bed during adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy. This study will also determine positioning errors using daily cone-beam&#xD;
      computed tomography in patients set up with the Calypso 4D Localization System. Subjects will&#xD;
      have BeaconÂ® Transponders implanted into the prostate bed. The Calypso 4D Localization System&#xD;
      will localize the position of the prostate bed. Cone beam CT will be used daily to measure&#xD;
      inter-transponder distance. The Calypso system will also track the prostate bed position in&#xD;
      real time during the entire radiation treatment. The treatments will be adjusted as required&#xD;
      to ensure accurate treatment of the clinical target volume. The time of, the number, and&#xD;
      extent of adjustments will be recorded for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily cone-beam computed tomography images will also be retrospectively analyzed to assess&#xD;
      for adequate target coverage. The analysis will be performed retrospectively through manual&#xD;
      3-D registration of the cone-beam CT dataset with the treatment planning CT scan. This&#xD;
      information will determine the margins necessary for the PTV using the Calypso 4D&#xD;
      Localization System and potentially may allow a reduction in the PTV volumes on future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

        This study will include high risk patients referred for adjuvant or salvage radiation&#xD;
        therapy after radical prostatectomy based upon the presence of unfavorable characteristics&#xD;
        after prostatectomy, which include positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension of&#xD;
        disease, or immediately detectable PSA.&#xD;
