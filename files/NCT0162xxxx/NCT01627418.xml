      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether fuel subsidies reduce exacerbations of COPD&#xD;
      among people aged over 55, and therefore whether providing such subsidies is a&#xD;
      cost-beneficial policy initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Warm Homes for Elder New Zealanders Study enrolled community-dwelling people aged over 55&#xD;
      with moderate or worse COPD. Prior to the study commencing the houses were insulated (if&#xD;
      feasible, &amp; the house-owner agreed). Data were collected on the health and energy use of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The households randomly assigned to the &quot;early&quot; intervention group had a subsidy to their&#xD;
      power account their first winter in the study. The subsidy was the intervention and was&#xD;
      designed to enable the participants, if they chose to do so, to keep their house warmer&#xD;
      during the winter.&#xD;

      Warm Homes for Elder New Zealanders (WHEZ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Although there has been considerable recent work on the prevention, management and&#xD;
      causes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the contribution of housing has not&#xD;
      been well researched. This is despite the socio-economic patterning of COPD (Maori women have&#xD;
      the highest rate of COPD that has been recorded for any group of women), and the relationship&#xD;
      between socio-economic deprivation and housing conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that improved heating would reduce exacerbations of COPD as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COPD patients with the most advanced disease tend to be older people who often live on a&#xD;
           fixed income and may be unable to afford adequate heating&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a high excess of winter hospitalisations in COPD patients indicating COPD&#xD;
           exacerbations may be triggered by cold conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About one third of exacerbations of COPD are triggered by respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Housing, Insulation and Health Study demonstrated a reduction in self-reported&#xD;
           respiratory disease after houses were insulated. Therefore improving the heating in&#xD;
           households with a COPD patient may reduce respiratory infections and this in turn would&#xD;
           reduce the number and severity of exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of people over 65 in New Zealand will increase from 12% to 22% over the next&#xD;
      25 years. Therefore it will become increasingly important to find cost-effective ways of&#xD;
      reducing the morbidity of the older age group. As COPD is a significant cause of morbidity&#xD;
      amongst older people, this study investigates a potentially cost effective intervention to&#xD;
      reduce both the likelihood of expensive hospital stays and improve the quality of life for&#xD;
      older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To evaluate whether fuel subsidies reduce exacerbations of COPD among people aged over&#xD;
      55, and therefore whether providing such subsidies is a cost-beneficial policy initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits The potential benefits of the study include reducing the burden of&#xD;
      disease. The patients and their caregivers may experience improved quality of life. Hospitals&#xD;
      may experience fewer patients requiring treatment during the winter. A cost-benefit analysis&#xD;
      will quantify the benefits.&#xD;
