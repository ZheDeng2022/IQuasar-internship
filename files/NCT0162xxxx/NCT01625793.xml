  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study has been designed to identify behavioral and physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      through which positive social connectivity (PCS) and negative social processes (NSP) interact&#xD;
      with psychosocial stress to promote resilience in the context of illness. The investigators&#xD;
      model inflammation (a central element of all disease states) through the use of treatment&#xD;
      with interferon (IFN)-alpha, which provides a standardized regimen of chronic cytokine&#xD;
      exposure known to produce profound behavioral disturbances, including depression, fatigue and&#xD;
      sickness, in a high percentage of individuals. To objectively assess social processes, the&#xD;
      current project will employ the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), which periodically&#xD;
      and unobtrusively records snippets of ambient sounds in people's momentary environments. To&#xD;
      objectively assess behavioral and physiological responses to psychosocial stress the current&#xD;
      project will employ the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized laboratory stressor&#xD;
      known to reliably activate behavioral, neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. These novel&#xD;
      methodologies and model systems will be employed to test the hypotheses that (a) pre-existing&#xD;
      affiliative and prosocial behavior will promote resilience in the context of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and that (b) -conversely-chronic inflammation will reduce affiliative and&#xD;
      prosocial behavior via effects on stress reactivity, neuroendocrine function and sleep.&#xD;
      Finally, it will explore (c) the potential mediating role of stress physiology. To test these&#xD;
      hypotheses, 110 subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus infection will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive treatment with pegylated IFN-alpha plus ribavirin or to postpone treatment for 6&#xD;
      weeks: 55 subjects at University of Arizona and 55 subjects at Emory University. Prior to&#xD;
      randomization and 6 weeks later all subjects will be evaluated with the EAR and sleep&#xD;
      actigraphy in their home environments and will undergo TSST and 14 hour diurnal&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and immune measurement.&#xD;

    <description>Hepatitis C patients who are eligible to receive IFN-alpha treatment and enrolled in this study will be treated with pegylated IFN-alfa-2b or pegylated IFN-alfa-2a plus ribavirin at a dose of 800-1,400 mg/d as determined by the treating gastroenterologist. All medication administration is for purely clinical indications as dictated by treating physicians. Any and all diagnostic or treatment issues related to potential treatment with IFN-alpha will be conducted by treating clinicians. Subjects will be randomized to start their clinical (non-research) treatment following completion of baseline assessments or to delay the start of their clinical (non-research) treatment by 7 weeks.</description>
