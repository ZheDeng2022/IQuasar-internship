  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. PCI, as&#xD;
      a well-proved and booming measure in CHD management, is invasive and of high cost, however&#xD;
      the knowledge about the real-life PCI use in China is limited. Within a nation-wide and&#xD;
      regional representative probability sample of hospitals in China, 14,000 CAG/PCI inpatient&#xD;
      cases will be sampled randomly from 2001 to 2011. The sampled medical records will be&#xD;
      reviewed and abstracted in the national coordinating centre, in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      treatment pattern, outcomes, and cost for PCI, during the past decade. Basic data and&#xD;
      innovative evidence will accelerate evidence-based clinical practice and policy making, and&#xD;
      improve patients outcomes in future finally.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major concern in public health globally, as well as in&#xD;
      China, and remarkable variations of resources available and health system performance have&#xD;
      been noted. Relatively limited information is available about how evidence-based therapies&#xD;
      are incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice. In addition, little&#xD;
      information is available about the magnitude and quality of PCI, which has developed rapidly&#xD;
      during the past several decades. Practical and applied knowledge from large unselected&#xD;
      population is needed to guide practice and policy for quality improvement and cost reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the treatment pattern and outcomes of PCI during the past decade in China,&#xD;
      using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design, from 70 sampled hospitals, 7,000&#xD;
      CAG/PCI cases will be selected in 2011, and 3,500 in 2001 and 2006 separately. Photocopies of&#xD;
      the 14,000 medical records of CAG/PCI cases will be sent to the national coordinating centre.&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests,&#xD;
      medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted by well&#xD;
      trained professional abstractors. By characterizing differences in patients' features,&#xD;
      comparing the use of medications and procedures, and examining the in-hospital outcomes,&#xD;
      we'll define the gaps between clinical practice and guidelines, as well as the disparities&#xD;
      across different regions and hospitals, to evaluated the treatment pattern and outcomes in&#xD;
      the last decade in China. New knowledge will be generated about PCI management all over&#xD;
      China, to provide evidence for policy-making and clinical guidelines, and to improve patients&#xD;
      prognosis in future finally.&#xD;
