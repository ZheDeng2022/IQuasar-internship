  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, open label, randomized, comparative study. Comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of adalimumab with immunomodulator therapy (i.e. 6-mercaptopurine, 6-MP), in&#xD;
      maintaining remission of post-operative CD patients, with a high risk of disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment for efficacy will be conducted through interval endoscopic surveillance at&#xD;
      24 and 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the adalimumab arm, showing endoscopic remission at 52 weeks of therapy, will be&#xD;
      re-randomized to either maintain adalimumab therapy for an additional 52 weeks or conclude&#xD;
      therapy. A third endoscopic assessment for these patients will be conducted at 104 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a substantial increase in both endoscopic, as well as clinical&#xD;
      remission rate in patients on adalimumab therapy.&#xD;
