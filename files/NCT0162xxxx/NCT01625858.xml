  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supraglottic airway device LMA Supreme has recently been introduced for pediatric&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will prospectively evaluate success rate and airway leak pressure&#xD;
      in everyday's clinical pediatric anesthesia practice. Primary hypothesis is that the LMA&#xD;
      Supreme has a leak pressure with a 95% confidence interval of 18-22cmH2O. Leak pressures will&#xD;
      be compared to results from other pediatric supraglottic airway devices previously studied by&#xD;
      the investigators group. Secondary Hypothesis: The primary success rate of the LMA-S is&#xD;
      higher than 90%; therefore, performance is similar to the performance of the Ambu Aura Once™&#xD;
      and of the i-gel™. Study design: Prospective controlled observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step, we will include more pediatric supraglottic airway devices. Each new arm&#xD;
      will be handled exactly the same, assuming the same hypothesis being justified.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The induction of anesthesia will follow the standard operating procedures of the pediatric&#xD;
      anesthesia division at the children's hospital for the use of supraglottic airway devices.&#xD;
      After loss of eyelash reflex and proper bag-mask ventilation provided, the SGA will be&#xD;
      introduced into the mouth under standardized anesthesia to guarantee the same depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia. This includes either propofol 2.5 mg/kg for older children, or sevoflurane&#xD;
      inhalation in younger children at an end-tidal sevoflurane concentration of 6%. The time&#xD;
      necessary to insert the airway device and the success rate will be recorded. We will also&#xD;
      check at what airway pressure the SGA starts leaking. A fiberscope will be inserted through&#xD;
      the airway port and through the gastric tube to obtain a view of the vocal cords and evaluate&#xD;
      the position of the SGA. The gastric catheter will then be placed after insertion; the size&#xD;
      will be according manufacturers' recommendations. After surgery, the SGA will be checked for&#xD;
      evidence of mucosa lesions (blood stains on device). One day after surgery, the patient&#xD;
      (and/or the parents) will be interviewed about sore throat, hoarseness, dysphagia,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), rescue medication, pain, time of hospital discharge&#xD;
      and any unscheduled re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and during the operation, the following data will be recorded: Sex, age, weight,&#xD;
      surgical procedure and duration, medications needed, cardiovascular parameter, depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Secondary outcome data include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The insertion time necessary to airway device placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Success rate of SGA device to ventilate patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fiberscope view through the airway port on the glottis opening (1 full vision on the&#xD;
           vocal cords - 4 no structure distinguishable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fiberscope view through the airway gastric tube channel on the upper esophageal&#xD;
           sphincter (rating 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement of the gastric catheter (yes, no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative: Device will be checked for evidence of mucosa lesions (blood stains on&#xD;
           device).&#xD;
