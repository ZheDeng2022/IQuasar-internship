  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to enroll male subjects affected by Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia&#xD;
      (XLHED). The sweat duct images will be acquired with a CE marked skin-imaging device and the&#xD;
      sweat rate will be measured using a CE marked pilocarpine iontophoresis and collection&#xD;
      system. The technologies for both imaging of sweat ducts and the measurement of maximal sweat&#xD;
      rate have been used safely and without adverse events in our prior studies involving&#xD;
      HED/XLHED subjects. Furthermore, this study will assess the feasibility of developing a&#xD;
      non-invasive screening tool that will enable detection of clinical signs of XLHED based on an&#xD;
      analysis of a two dimensional frontal photograph.&#xD;

      The study proposes to enroll male subjects affected by XLHED (determined by genetic testing&#xD;
      and restricted to age &gt; 1 yr). The sweat duct images will be acquired with a CE marked&#xD;
      skin-imaging device and the sweat rate will be measured using a CE marked pilocarpine&#xD;
      iontophoresis and collection system. The technologies for both imaging of sweat ducts and the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Attending the 2012 Spanish Association for those Affected by Ectodermal Dysplasia&#xD;
             Annual Reunion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One year of age or greater;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conform to one of the following requirements for providing informed consent/assent:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If more than 18 years of age, subjects must provide signed informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If less than 18 years of age and it is determined that the subject is capable of&#xD;
                  providing assent, both the assent of the subject and consent of the parent(s) or&#xD;
                  guardian of that subject must be granted. Under this condition, both parents of&#xD;
                  the subject should give their permission, unless 1 parent is deceased, unknown,&#xD;
                  incompetent, or not available;&#xD;
