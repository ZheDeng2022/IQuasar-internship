  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project allows for the systematic collection and analysis of long-term follow-up&#xD;
      clinical parameters in children who have received a stem cell transplant. The data collected&#xD;
      will assist in determining appropriate intervention and treatment plans for patients enrolled&#xD;
      on this study. In addition, future patients may benefit by having the ability to anticipate&#xD;
      problems and develop methods of prevention or early intervention.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Implement long-term follow-up guidelines for children, adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults who are survivors of HSCT while establishing a database which captures the&#xD;
      survivor's lifetime care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect evidence-based data through a structured framework of periodic physical&#xD;
           examination, laboratory and medical tests to monitor late effects in our HSCT survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish standards of care for late effects of therapy post HSCT for malignant and&#xD;
           non-malignant diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide early identification and intervention towards recognized problems, as well as&#xD;
           consistent education to foster a healthy lifestyle to all survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and tissue samples to study immune reconstitution of all immune cell types&#xD;
           and learn more about immune reconstitution and its affect on post-HSCT complications and&#xD;
           disease free survival.&#xD;
