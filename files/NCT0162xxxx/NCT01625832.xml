      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      industrialized countries despite advances in medical, interventional, and surgical&#xD;
      revascularization therapies. In both, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic stable&#xD;
      disease, standard therapeutic approaches may fail to restore tissue perfusion. Indeed, a&#xD;
      substantial number of chronic CAD patients may not be amenable to standard revascularization&#xD;
      therapies or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may fail to restore coronary artery&#xD;
      patency following an acute vessel occlusion (no-reflow phenomenon, microvascular&#xD;
      obstruction). As a consequence, the long pursued strategy of augmenting myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      by diverting blood from the coronary venous system to an ischemic region (venous&#xD;
      retroperfusion) has again gained attention during recent years. Occlusion of the coronary&#xD;
      sinus (CSO) was introduced to provide retroperfusion by transient augmentation of coronary&#xD;
      venous pressure. Different devices using CSO have been invented and evaluated in animal&#xD;
      models and small clinical trials, e.g. intermittent CSO (ICSO) and pressure-controlled&#xD;
      intermittent CSO (PICSO) which seem to be effective for myocardial salvage. However, they are&#xD;
      not yet employed in clinical routine, and importantly, the exact underlying mechanisms by&#xD;
      which retroperfusion due to CSO may reduce myocardial ischemia are not yet understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As &quot;natural bypasses&quot;, coronary collaterals are anastomoses without an intervening capillary&#xD;
      bed between portions of the same coronary artery or between different coronary arteries that&#xD;
      represent an alternative source of blood supply to a myocardial area jeopardized by ischemia.&#xD;
      Collaterals of the heart can be assessed quantitatively by coronary pressure measurements,&#xD;
      which have become the gold standard (collateral flow index, CFI=[Poccl-CVP]/[Pao-CVP]).&#xD;
      Theoretically, augmentation of coronary sinus pressure by CSO with an increase of venous&#xD;
      backflow reaches the upstream collateral circulation, which in turn could lead to improved&#xD;
      collateral flow from non-ischemic area(s) to an occluded, ischemic myocardial region by&#xD;
      upstream flow diversion. On the other hand, when considering the formula to calculate&#xD;
      pressure-derived CFI, it seems that augmentation of coronary back pressure would rather&#xD;
      impair collateral flow (since central venous pressure is coronary sinus pressure). However,&#xD;
      the regional effect of a global increase in coronary sinus pressure is unlikely to be as&#xD;
      uniform as the above formula implies, i.e., the response is more pronounced in some than in&#xD;
      other vascular territories. In experimental studies using dogs (with abundant collaterals),&#xD;
      elevation of coronary sinus pressure caused an augmentation of regional myocardial blood flow&#xD;
      in the collateralized area. In contrast, when ICSO was performed in pigs (which possess no&#xD;
      preformed collaterals), it increased the pressure distal of an occluded LAD but did not&#xD;
      improve blood flow or left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, experimental studies and pathophysiologic considerations suggest a necessary&#xD;
      role of the collateral circulation for the beneficial effects of coronary sinus occlusion&#xD;
      (CSO) observed in animals and humans; however, no clinical data are available so far on the&#xD;
      effect of CSO on myocardial ischemia in the presence of varying collateral flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CSO decreases intra-coronary ECG ST-segment elevation during a 2-minute coronary&#xD;
           occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The decrease in occlusive intra-coronary ECG ST elevation during CSO is directly&#xD;
           proportional to CFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coronary sinus oxygen saturation during coronary occlusion with CSO is directly&#xD;
           proportional to CFI.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of venous retroperfusion in coronary artery disease Coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries despite advances&#xD;
      in medical, interventional, and surgical revascularization therapies. The different&#xD;
      strategies aiming at restoration of coronary blood flow and subsequent improvement of&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion have led to increased survival rates of CAD patients with both acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic stable disease. However, in both situations standard&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches may fail to restore tissue perfusion: First, up to 20% of patients&#xD;
      with chronic CAD may not be amenable to standard revascularization therapies and may suffer&#xD;
      from refractory angina pectoris and/or chronic heart failure. Second, despite the high&#xD;
      success rates of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in restoration of coronary artery&#xD;
      patency following an acute vessel occlusion (AMI), blood flow of the infarct related artery&#xD;
      is often still markedly impaired (TIMIâ‰¤2; no-reflow phenomenon, microvascular obstruction).&#xD;
      As a consequence, the long pursued strategy of augmenting myocardial perfusion by diverting&#xD;
      blood from the coronary venous system to an ischemic region (venous retroperfusion) has again&#xD;
      gained attention during recent years. Already in 1898, the experimental work of Pratt&#xD;
      suggested that venous retroperfusion may provide nutritional delivery to the myocardium. In&#xD;
      the mid 20ieth century, the concept was followed by cardiac surgeons who introduced the&#xD;
      coronary venous bypass graft for myocardial revascularization (CVBG; which was soon replaced&#xD;
      by its arterial counterpart, CABG) and also used this protection technique during valve&#xD;
      surgery. More than 25 years ago, occlusion of the coronary sinus (CSO) was introduced to&#xD;
      provide retroperfusion by transient augmentation of coronary venous pressure. Since then,&#xD;
      different devices using CSO have been invented and evaluated in animal models and small&#xD;
      clinical trials, e.g. intermittent CSO (ICSO) and pressure-controlled intermittent CSO&#xD;
      (PICSO; Miracor Medical Systems, Austria) as well as a coronary sinus reducer stent (Neovasc&#xD;
      Medical, Israel). At least the systems using (P)ICSO seem to be effective for myocardial&#xD;
      salvage; however, they are not yet employed in clinical routine, possibly due to their&#xD;
      difficult usage and potential risks (sinus damage, thrombosis, stenosis, chronic myocardial&#xD;
      edema). Importantly, the exact underlying mechanisms by which retroperfusion due to CSO may&#xD;
      reduce myocardial ischemia are not yet understood. It has been proposed that aside from&#xD;
      augmented delivery of blood to the ischemic region, the following mechanisms may play a role:&#xD;
      a functional venous microcirculation, less blockade of the microcirculation, &quot;washout&quot; of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), diminished granulocyte trapping, and improvement of&#xD;
      cellular/interstitial edema. Importantly, it is very likely that the extent of coronary&#xD;
      collaterals play a crucial role for the efficacy of (P)ICSO. However, only a limited number&#xD;
      of experimental studies have addressed this issue so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary collateral circulation As &quot;natural bypasses&quot;, coronary collaterals are anastomoses&#xD;
      without an intervening capillary bed between portions of the same coronary artery or between&#xD;
      different coronary arteries that represent an alternative source of blood supply to a&#xD;
      myocardial area jeopardized by ischemia. In patients with CAD, a well-developed coronary&#xD;
      collateral circulation contributes to reduction of infarct size, LV-dysfunction, and&#xD;
      mortality. Collaterals of the heart can be assessed quantitatively by coronary flow velocity&#xD;
      or pressure measurements, which have become the gold standard. The theoretical basis of this&#xD;
      method relates to the fact that perfusion pressure (minus the central venous &quot;back&quot; pressure)&#xD;
      or flow velocity signals obtained distal to an occluded stenosis originate from collaterals.&#xD;
      The measurement of aortic and coronary pressure or flow velocity provides the basis for the&#xD;
      calculation of a pressure- or velocity-derived collateral flow index (CFI), both of which&#xD;
      express the amount of flow via collaterals to the vascular region of interest as a fraction&#xD;
      of the flow via the normally patent vessel CFI measurements have been documented to be&#xD;
      accurate with regard to ECG derived dichotomous collateral assessment, with regard to each&#xD;
      other, but also to quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging by contrast echocardiography&#xD;
      during balloon occlusion. Pressure- and Doppler-derived coronary collateral measurements are&#xD;
      regarded as the reference method for quantitative clinical assessment of coronary collateral&#xD;
      flow. Pressure- and Doppler-derived coronary collateral measurements are regarded as the&#xD;
      reference method for quantitative clinical assessment of coronary collateral flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, it can be imagined that at the origin of preformed collateral channels in&#xD;
      the non-ischemic area, blood is diverged away from the downstream microcirculation due to&#xD;
      regionally augmented back pressure. At the orifice of the preformed collaterals, perfusion&#xD;
      pressure as well as back pressure are low resulting in a low driving pressure, i.e., the&#xD;
      necessary condition to receive blood from the collateral-supplying region (limited by&#xD;
      increased wall stress, respectively by an extravascular tissue pressure above approximately&#xD;
      27 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These theoretical considerations have been investigated only experimentally so far. Sato et&#xD;
      al. performed regional myocardial blood flow measurements in dogs after ligation of the left&#xD;
      anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with or without coronary sinus pressure elevation&#xD;
      to 30 mmHg. In this study, regional myocardial blood flow in the collateralized area was&#xD;
      augmented by an elevation of coronary sinus pressure, however this effect was present only in&#xD;
      the periphery of the ischemic region. Using a very similar model (namely LAD occlusion in&#xD;
      dogs and sinus pressure augmentation above 30 mmHg by CSO), Ido et al. showed that CSO&#xD;
      augments subendocardial but not subepicardial myocardial blood flow in the ischemic region&#xD;
      (i.e. collateral flow). Interestingly, CSO also normalized the subepicardial blood flow in&#xD;
      the non-ischemic region, which was increased by the LAD occlusion. Moreover, after maximal&#xD;
      vasodilation with adenosine these effects were abolished and blood flow with CSO was&#xD;
      decreased in the ischemic region, indicating collateral steal.17 In addition to these&#xD;
      studies, Toggart et al. demonstrated years earlier in a pig model that ICSO (augmentation&#xD;
      above 60 mmHg) increased the pressure distal of an occluded LAD, but did not improve blood&#xD;
      flow or left ventricular function. Since pigs do not have preformed collaterals, this study&#xD;
      importantly indicates a crucial role of collateral flow for the therapeutic efficacy of ICSO.&#xD;
      Of note, the results of this study also argue against the proposed &quot;washout&quot; hypothesis. In&#xD;
      conclusion, experimental studies and pathophysiologic considerations suggest a necessary role&#xD;
      of the collateral circulation for the beneficial effects of coronary sinus occlusion observed&#xD;
      in animals and humans; however, no clinical data are available so far on the effect of CSO on&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia in the presence of varying collateral flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study in patients with chronic stable CAD undergoing elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography is to determine the effect of CSO on the level of myocardial ischemia during a&#xD;
