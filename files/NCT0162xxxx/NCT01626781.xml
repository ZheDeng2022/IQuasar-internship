  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the examination of Mapisal® versus urea hand-foot cream as&#xD;
      prophylaxis for capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors or breast cancer, to assess the efficacy of Mapisal®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mapisal® is a medical device that is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of HFS.&#xD;
      Initial clinical data and case studies on the treatment and prophylaxis of Caelyx-induced HFS&#xD;
      have been impressive. Because the pathomechanism of HFS caused by capecitabine is the same as&#xD;
      for Caelyx-induced HFS, it is expected reason that administering Mapisal® should result in a&#xD;
      significant reduction of HFS caused by capecitabine. The urea hand-foot cream was selected&#xD;
      for the standard arm, because it is used commonly, is accepted by patients, and seems to have&#xD;
      a positive influence on the severity of the HFS in the experience of many oncologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a frequently occurring, often dose limiting, dermatologic&#xD;
      reaction associated with cytotoxic agents, such as capecitabine, liposomal doxorubicin, and&#xD;
      doxetacel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events affecting the integument have posed significant challenges to oncologists in&#xD;
      recent years in terms of selecting appropriate supportive therapies. Not only medications&#xD;
      that inhibit EGFR receptors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, panitumumab or cetuximab, but also&#xD;
      multiple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib and other&#xD;
      &quot;older&quot; medications such as capecitabine can often lead to skin-related adverse events that&#xD;
      can be difficult to manage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These adverse events compromise skin-related quality of life and can lead to dose compromises&#xD;
      or even the termination of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no side effects reported for the use of either Mapisal® or urea hand-foot&#xD;
      cream, making both treatments safe. Given the potential benefits of the treatments in&#xD;
      preventing HFS by reducing discomfort and impairment of quality of life, the conduct of the&#xD;
      trial is regarded as justifiable and there is no indication that patients are exposed to an&#xD;
      increased risk associated with study participation.&#xD;
