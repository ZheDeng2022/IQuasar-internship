  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to determine the feasibility of carrying out a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to investigate whether screening parents of children admitted to pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit (PICU) so as to target follow-up at those most at risk of developing&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is effective at reducing adverse psychological&#xD;
      sequelae.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the feasibility of offering a follow up clinic to parents identified to&#xD;
      be vulnerable for future psychological difficulties after their child's admission to the&#xD;
      Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Bristol Children's Hospital. Both mothers and&#xD;
      fathers of children admitted to PICY for a duration of at least 12 hours will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Screening measures will be used to identify vulnerability to&#xD;
      future post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Where one or both of the parents&#xD;
      has been scored as high risk they will be randomised to receive the intervention or the&#xD;
      control arm of the study (ratio 1:1). The intervention involves a follow-up clinic two months&#xD;
      pots admission, staffed by the unit Clinical Psychologist, a PICU doctor and PICU nurse. In&#xD;
      the control arm no follow-up clinic will be offered (i.e. current standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To investigate the recruitment rates, clinic attendance and follow-up rates in order to&#xD;
      perform an accurate sample size calculation for a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) To carry out initial statistical analysis to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of developing PTSD, anxiety and depression after being offered the follow-up&#xD;
      intervention as opposed to not being offered it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) To assess the acceptability of providing targeted follow-up both to those who receive it&#xD;
      and those who are excluded due to low risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is of importance to the public because not only does PTSD negatively affect quality&#xD;
      of life, it is also associated with increased use of health care services and resources.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All parents of children admitted to paediatric intensive care for over 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents deemed unsuitable for the study by the responsible consultant. This will&#xD;
             include families where a child's condition is suspected to result from non-accidental&#xD;
             injury or where withdrawal of care is being discussed due to a child's critical&#xD;
             condition. Families will be excluded if their child died during or after admission, as&#xD;
             these families are already followed up routinely.&#xD;
