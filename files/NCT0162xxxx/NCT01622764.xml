      The research the investigators propose is a molecular imaging study of RO5323441, an antibody&#xD;
      against placental growth factor (PlGF) in patients with recurrent GBM treated with&#xD;
      bevacizumab, a drug against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Both VEGF and PlGF are&#xD;
      molecules involved in tumor growth since they enable the development of tumor vasculature,&#xD;
      thus delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. The treatment will consist of bevacizumab&#xD;
      (i.v.) given every 2 weeks, until the patient has clinical benefit (no disease progression)&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Meanwhile, patients will receive and injection of low protein-dose&#xD;
      radiolabeled RO5323441 (89Zr-RO5323441) on day -3 and 11 of the first bevacizumab treatment&#xD;
      cycle. Brain-only 89Zr-RO5323441 positron emission tomography (PET) will be performed at 2&#xD;
      hours after each injection of 89Zr-RO5323441 on day -3 and 11. Whole body 89Zr-RO5323441 PET&#xD;
      will be performed on day 1 and 15, before and after the first treatment with bevacizumab. The&#xD;
      main purpose of this trial is to determine how much of RO5323441 actually gets into the&#xD;
      recurrent GBM lesions, since for a drug to be active, it has to be able to reach cancer&#xD;
      cells. As second aims, RO5323441 accumulation in normal, non-tumor organs, will be assessed,&#xD;
      as well as how bevacizumab influences RO5323441 penetration into tumor lesions (to answer the&#xD;
      question of combined bevacizumab + RO5323441 treatment in GBM) or RO5323441 biodistribution&#xD;
      in non-tumor organs.&#xD;

      Rationale: Glioblastomas (GBM) account for 70% of all gliomas (80% of all malignant brain and&#xD;
      CNS tumors) and remain the most aggressive sub-type of glioma, with a particularly poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Surgery aimed to complete resection is the first therapeutic modality, however,&#xD;
      the infiltrative nature of the disease makes a complete resection nearly impossible. In a&#xD;
      randomized, phase III EORTC-NCIC trial, overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      patients treated with concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of&#xD;
      temozolomide was 27.2% (95% CI 22.2-32.5) at 2 years, 16.0% (12.0-20.6) at 3 years, 12.1%&#xD;
      (8.5-16.4) at 4 years, and 9.8% (6.4-14.0) at 5 years, treatment which is now standard of&#xD;
      care. Almost all GBM patients experience relapse and there is no one generally agreed&#xD;
      standard of care in recurrent GBM. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a central&#xD;
      regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis, is considered to play a major&#xD;
      angiogenic role in GBM. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, showed a&#xD;
      28%RR,a 43% 6-month PFS and provided a consistent clinical benefit in terms of both delayed&#xD;
      progression and increased median overall survival over historical controls. This benefit is&#xD;
      limited however, with the tumor eventually evading treatment by for example compensatory&#xD;
      upregulation of angiogenic factors like placental growth factor (PlGF). Therefore, targeting&#xD;
      PlGF could be a new strategy of tumor angiogenesis inhibition, complementary to VEGF(R)&#xD;
      inhibition. In preclinical setting, inhibiting PlGF has shown to inhibit growth and&#xD;
      metastasis of various tumors. Humanized monoclonal PlGF antibody RO5323441 was evaluated in&#xD;
      phase I trials in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients; no Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      was found, thus no Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined. Stable disease was observed in 6/23&#xD;
      patients on different dose levels. A phase I/II study of bevacizumab in combination with&#xD;
      RO5323441 is currently ongoing in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT01308684). However, the&#xD;
      amount of RO5323441 to reach the recurrent GBM, and how this is affected by bevacizumab&#xD;
      treatment, are yet unknown. This can be determined by repetitive measurement of RO5323441&#xD;
      tumor uptake with 89Zr-RO5323441 PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the penetration of RO532441 into&#xD;
      recurrent GBM by 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and to quantify its uptake, to visualize and&#xD;
      quantify 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organ distribution, and to measure the effect of&#xD;
      bevacizumab treatment on 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a single center, investigator driven, 89Zr-RO5323441 PET imaging and&#xD;
      bio-distribution study in patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab&#xD;
      at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight i.v. in 90 min on day 1 is given every 2 weeks in cycles of&#xD;
      6 weeks. The treatment with bevacizumab will continue until documented disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or patient's best interest. 89Zr-RO5323441 will be&#xD;
      administered i.v. at a tracer dose of 5 mg (37 MBq) on day -3 and on day 11 of cycle 1 of&#xD;
      bevacizumab treatment. Four PET scans will be performed (2 brain only PET scans and 2 whole&#xD;
      body PET scans). Brain only PET scans will be performed 2 hours after each 89Zr-RO5323441&#xD;
      administration on day -3 and day 11, and will take 10 minutes/ scan. Whole body PET scans&#xD;
      will be performed 4 days after each 89Zr-RO5323441 administration (before dosing with&#xD;
      bevacizumab on day 1 and day 15), and will take 50 minutes/ scan. 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake&#xD;
      values in recurrent GBM lesions at baseline and day 15 will be compared to assess bevacizumab&#xD;
      effect on tracer tumor uptake. The purpose of the two early brain-only PET scans after each&#xD;
      89Zr-RO5323441 injection is to identify whether changes in 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent&#xD;
      GBM lesions following treatment with bevacizumab can be solely attributed to an effect on&#xD;
      blood volume/ vascular permeability, or rather indicate a possible modulation of placental&#xD;
      growth factor (PlGF) level in the tumor tissue. The rationale for the whole body&#xD;
      89Zr-RO5323441 PET scans is to assess 89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs distribution at&#xD;
      baseline, as well as to evaluate the influence bevacizumab treatment could exert on&#xD;
      89Zr-RO5323441 non-tumor organs uptake. For 89Zr-RO5323441 pharmacokinetics, blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken 1 hour after 89Zr-RO5323441 tracer injection on d-3 and d11, respectively&#xD;
      together with the blood samples for hematology on d1 and d15 during the 1st cycle of&#xD;
      bevacizumab treatment. The rationale for this is that performing both the 89Zr-RO5323441 PET&#xD;
      scan data quantification and the assessment of the tracer's blood pharmacokinetics would&#xD;
      enable us to better understand the specificity of 89Zr-RO5323441 uptake in recurrent GBM&#xD;
      lesions. Patients will be assessed for bevacizumab treatment response by brain MRI every 6&#xD;
      weeks (i.e. every cycle) in the first 6 month and every 12 weeks thereafter, until documented&#xD;
      progression using the updated RANO criteria. Treatment and tracer injection related side&#xD;
      effects will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 4.0) for toxicity and adverse event reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/ endpoints: 89Zr-RO5323441 tumor uptake and organ distribution will be&#xD;
      scored visually and quantitatively. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and relative uptake value&#xD;
      (RUV) will be determined and compared in the recurrent GBM lesions and in relevant tissues at&#xD;
      baseline and day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risk associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Bevacizumab is registered in The Netherlands for use in metastasized colon and&#xD;
      breast cancer, in lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma and has already been&#xD;
      tested in GBM clinical trials. Bevacizumab is expected to have clinical benefit for patients&#xD;
      enrolled in this study and similar safety profile compared to the other indications.&#xD;
      RO5323441 monotherapy was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignant diseases. In&#xD;
      this study, one patient will receive a low total protein dose of 10 mg RO5323441 (2X5mg) in&#xD;
      the tracer and it is expected that RO5323441 will not enhance bevacizumab related side&#xD;
      effects. The total radiation dose of 89Zr-RO5323441 for a patient participating in this study&#xD;
      would be 36 mSv for women and 30 mSv for men. According to the investigators this radiation&#xD;
      burden is justifiable in this patient group by the information that can be obtained in this&#xD;
      study. Risk: exposure to 89Zr-RO5323441 PET scan-related radiation, possibility of allergic&#xD;
      reaction to the protein in the tracer, possible side-effects of bevacizumab.&#xD;
