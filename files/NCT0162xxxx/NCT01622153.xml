      The health of teeth, their supporting tissues and maintaining their integrity is the primary&#xD;
      goal of pulp therapy. Conservative pulp therapy for primary teeth aims to maintain pulp&#xD;
      vitality, reduce the need for a pulpectomy, and promote the integrity and retention of such&#xD;
      teeth until appropriate exfoliation.(51) A pulpotomy is usually performed for carious&#xD;
      exposures of primary teeth with normal pulp or reversible coronal pulpitis, or primary teeth&#xD;
      pulpally exposed by trauma (AAPD 2009). A pulpotomy requires healthy radicular pulp capable&#xD;
      of healing after amputation of inflamed or infected coronal pulp [Fuks and Eidelman, 1991].&#xD;
      After the coronal pulp is amputated, the remaining vital radicular pulp tissue surface is&#xD;
      treated with a long-term clinically successful medicament such as Buckley's Solution of&#xD;
      formocresol. (46-52) Electrosurgery has also demonstrated success. (53) The coronal pulp&#xD;
      chamber is filled with zinc/oxide, eugenol, or other suitable base, and the tooth is restored&#xD;
      with a restoration that seals the tooth from microleakage. The most effective long-term&#xD;
      restoration has been shown to be a stainless steel crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the coronal tissue is amputated, the remaining radicular tissue is judged to be vital&#xD;
      without suppuration, purulence, necrosis, or excessive hemorrhage that cannot be controlled&#xD;
      with a damp cotton pellet after several minutes. In addition to this, if there are no&#xD;
      radiographic signs of infection or pathologic resorption then a pulpotomy procedure is&#xD;
      indicated. (Camp JH, Fuks AB) Despite concerns of toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity&#xD;
      [Swenberg et al., 1980; Goldmacher and Thilly, 1983; Ranly and Horn, 1987], formocresol (FC)&#xD;
      remains a commonly used primary tooth pulpotomy medicament [Hingston et al., 2007]. Various&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic success rates (59-100%) have been reported [Mejare, 1979; Naik and&#xD;
      Hegde, 2005], attributed to intra-patient variations, clinician and assessor factors, FC&#xD;
      concentrations and application times, coronal seal, and study durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As technology continues to improve, it allows dentists to treat patients with greater&#xD;
      precision, meaning less pain and quicker healing. The diode laser is used in many different&#xD;
      dental procedures. It is most commonly used to perform soft-tissue surgery in the mouth. The&#xD;
      diode laser's high-energy beam kills bacteria, thus it is often used to sterilize areas of&#xD;
      the mouth before or during root canal procedures. (Laser-dentistry/diode-laser) The diode&#xD;
      laser represents a whole new way of thinking about dental care. Laser treatment is less&#xD;
      painful, more convenient, and more effective than many traditional dental treatments. A study&#xD;
      by Bahrololoomi Z, Moeintaghavi A, comparing FC and electrosurgery pulpotomy after nine&#xD;
      months of follow up found that clinical and radiographical success rates were 96% and 84%&#xD;
      respectively in the electrosurgical group and 100% and 96.8% respectively in the formocresol&#xD;
      group. There was no statistical significance and the results showed that the failure rates&#xD;
      for electrosurgery pulpotomy were equal to those of formocresol pulpotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental care has recently been identified as the most prevalent unmet health need amongst US&#xD;
      children (AAPD 2009). This research study investigates another treatment method to help&#xD;
      provide dental care to these children by evaluating the success rate of a laser (electrical)&#xD;
      pulpotomy compared to formocresol pulpotomy in primary molars with carious pulp exposure.&#xD;
      There is a need to study and assess the laser pulpotomy method in order to help create a more&#xD;
      efficient and painless treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a prospective study and clinical evaluation of patients ranging from ages 3-8&#xD;
      years old treated under general anesthesia from June, 2010 to June, 2014. The review and&#xD;
      analysis will be completed over a four year time period. The patients participating in this&#xD;
      study will include those presenting themselves as patients to the Tapper Pediatric Dentistry&#xD;
      clinic at Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital. These patients will only be scheduled to be&#xD;
      treated in the operating room when it is indicated as the best treatment option. Treatment&#xD;
      under General Anesthesia is indicated when: 1. Patient is uncooperative due to a lack of&#xD;
      psychological or emotional maturity and/or mental, physical, or medical disability. 2.&#xD;
      Patients for whom local anesthesia is ineffective because of acute infection, anatomic&#xD;
      variations, or allergy. 3. Extremely uncooperative, fearful, anxious, or uncommunicative&#xD;
      child or adolescent. 4. Patients requiring significant surgical procedures. 5. Patients for&#xD;
      whom the use of GA may protect the developing psyche and/or reduce medical risk. 6. Patients&#xD;
      requiring immediate, comprehensive oral/dental care (AAPD 2009). The patients will then be&#xD;
      consented and informed on the same day of the OR appointment. They will be given specific&#xD;
      post-op instructions both verbally and in written form. They will be scheduled for a two-week&#xD;
      follow-up appointment in the clinic following dental treatment. Informed consent must be&#xD;
      obtained by the parent/guardian of the patients that will participate in the study and&#xD;
      receive pulpotomy treatment with the laser technique. Other patients, regardless of the&#xD;
      study, will have pulpotomy treatment using the traditional formocresol technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive general endotracheal anesthesia while receiving comprehensive&#xD;
      dental treatment. General anesthesia will be provided using a combination of inhaled&#xD;
      anesthetics and propofol intravenously. General anesthesia will be supplemented with&#xD;
      intravenous opioid analgesics, ketorolac unless contraindicated, and anti-mimetics. The&#xD;
      anesthetic approach will not be influenced by participation or non-participation of patients&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's name, date of birth, and medical history will be obtained from each patient&#xD;
      chart. This PHI will be utilized to keep track of patient demographics for the study.&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for the operating room will be seen for a post-op two week follow up&#xD;
      appointment and regular dental visits regardless of whether or not they are participating in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the eligible subjects a randomized clinical trial will be performed on 90 primary molars&#xD;
      in children aged 3-8 years. Two preoperative bite wing radiographs will be taken. The teeth&#xD;
      will be treated for pulp therapy using either a conventional formocresol (30 controls and 30&#xD;
      study teeth) or GENTLEray 980 Soft Tissue diode laser (30 study teeth) technique. 30&#xD;
      Controls: The procedure for these 30 subjects is conducted using a #8 round diamond bur to&#xD;
      remove occlusal tooth structure for pulp chamber access and removal of coronal pulp. Cotton&#xD;
      pellets are saturated with conventional 1:5 dilution of Buckley's formocresol into the canal&#xD;
      orifice for 5 minutes for complete hemostasis. After this, a Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12%&#xD;
      rinse will be applied to decrease the bacterial level. Then, placement of 35% Phosphoric Acid&#xD;
      Etch for 15-30 seconds is rinsed off and dried until the tooth has a white, chalky&#xD;
      appearance. One layer of Optibond Solo is placed into the pulp chamber and light cured for 10&#xD;
      seconds with a 3M ESPE Elipar S10 light curing device. IRM (Zinc Oxide Eugenol) cement will&#xD;
      then be placed to seal the pulp chamber. A stainless steel crown will be cemented with Ketac&#xD;
      Cement that was triturated for 10 seconds to complete the pulpotomy procedure and final&#xD;
      restoration. 30 Conventional Formocresol: The procedure for these 30 subjects is conducted&#xD;
      using a #8 round diamond bur to remove occlusal tooth structure for pulp chamber access and&#xD;
      removal of coronal pulp. Cotton pellets are saturated with conventional 1:5 dilution of&#xD;
      Buckley's formocresol into the canal orifice for 5 minutes for complete hemostasis. After&#xD;
      this, a Chlorhexidine Gluconate 0.12% rinse will be applied to decrease the bacterial level.&#xD;
      Then, placement of 35% Phosphoric Acid Etch for 15-30 seconds is rinsed off and dried until&#xD;
      the tooth has a white, chalky appearance. One layer of Optibond Solo is placed into the pulp&#xD;
      chamber and light cured for 10 seconds with a 3M ESPE Elipar S10 light curing device. Dyract&#xD;
      compomer will then be placed to seal the pulp chamber. A stainless steel crown is cemented&#xD;
      with Ketac Cement that was triturated for 10 seconds to complete the pulpotomy procedure and&#xD;
      final restoration. 30 Laser Diode: The procedure for these 30 subjects is conducted using a&#xD;
      #8 round diamond bur to remove occlusal tooth structure for pulp chamber access and removal&#xD;
      of coronal pulp. Then a GENTLEray 980 Soft Tissue diode laser (Power: 3.0W, Mode: PW, Fiber:&#xD;
      300µm, Ton: 100ms, Toff: 100ms, Timer: cont) will be used to vaporize the residual pulp&#xD;
      tissue and complete hemostasis. After completion of hemostasis, a Chlorhexidine Gluconate&#xD;
      0.12% rinse will be applied to decrease the bacterial presence. Subjects will then receive&#xD;
      placement of 35% Phosphoric Acid Etch for 15-30 seconds followed by 10 second light cured&#xD;
      optibond solo. IRM (Zinc Oxide Eugenol) cement is then placed to seal the pulp chamber. A&#xD;
      stainless steel crown cemented with Ketac Cement for the full coverage final restoration&#xD;
      completes the pulpotomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the pulpotomy procedures, the teeth will be evaluated for clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      success at 6 months post-op and 12 months post-op appointments at the Tapper Pediatric Dental&#xD;
      Clinic at Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital. The study teeth treated will be evaluated&#xD;
      clinically based on the presence of the following: (1) pain (2) abscess (3) mobility.&#xD;
      Radiographic success will be determined by evaluating a bite wing x-ray taken at the two&#xD;
      post-op appointments for the presence of the following: (1) internal resorption (2) external&#xD;
      resorption and (3) furcation radiolucency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only physical risk in laser therapy is the risk of eye damage. While eye damage has not&#xD;
      been reported to date, we must still consider it as a possible risk. Because these study&#xD;
      subjects will be under General Anesthesia their eyes will already be closed and covered.&#xD;
      Suitable protective goggles should be worn by the investigator and assistants. Other possible&#xD;
      risks associated with this study include risks from anesthesia- (Nausea, vomiting, epistaxis,&#xD;
      fever, discomfort/pain). There are minimal to no risks involved in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulpotomy treatment maintains the vitality of the tooth as well as the supporting tissues.&#xD;
      The longevity and prognosis of having a laser pulpotomy versus a formocresol pulpotomy&#xD;
      treatment has been considered to be just as beneficial. Through this research study, we can&#xD;
      further prove this new finding. Maintaining your primary dentition is extremely important and&#xD;
      this study will provide insight on how advances in dental technology can help better treat&#xD;
      carious teeth in more efficient and painless ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of this research the only alternative is to not participate in this study.&#xD;
