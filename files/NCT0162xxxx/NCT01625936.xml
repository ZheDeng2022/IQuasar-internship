  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, dose escalation study of the investigational agent, CRLX101, given in&#xD;
      combination with Bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the initial safety and effectiveness of this agent in combination&#xD;
      with Bevacizumab. The investigators are also trying to determine the best dose level of&#xD;
      CRLX101 to give in combination with bevacizumab. About 22 subjects will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study at the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1b, dose-escalation study of the investigational agent, CRLX101, given in&#xD;
      combination with Bevacizumab in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the initial safety and effectiveness of this agent in combination&#xD;
      with Bevacizumab. The investigators are also trying to determine the best dose level of&#xD;
      CRLX101 to give in combination with Bevacizumab. About 22 subjects will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study at the University of Pennsylvania. This study also involved two sub-studies that will&#xD;
      be conducted in a select set of study subjects. This includes investigational cG250 PET/CT&#xD;
      scans and paired bone marrow biopsy/aspirate assessments. The IND being requested from the&#xD;
      FDA for this study will cover both the use of CRLX 101 as well as the use cG250 in the study&#xD;
      sub-study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced renal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma that is unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have disease that is evaluable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors guidelines (RECIST), v1.1. Disease sites must be assessed within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been treated with at least one prior conventional molecularly&#xD;
             targeted therapy in a non-adjuvant setting. Conventional molecularly targeted therapy&#xD;
             will be defined as including pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, axitinib,&#xD;
             or everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A two week wash out is required between the last dose of molecularly targeted therapy&#xD;
             and baseline correlative studies (124I-cG250 PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy). If no&#xD;
             baseline correlative studies will be performed, a wash out of 1 week will be required&#xD;
             prior to the commencement of study therapy. Toxicities from prior therapy must be&#xD;
             resolved to grade 1 or less prior to the start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have been treated with surgery or not (i.e., cytoreductive nephrectomy&#xD;
             not required), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, cytokine therapy including interferon&#xD;
             alpha and interleukin-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain or spinal-associated metastases are eligible but must have&#xD;
             concluded dexamethasone therapy and be considered neurologically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than 1 (Karnofsky greater than 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of CRLX101 and bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal, barrier method, abstinence) prior to study entry, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of administration of&#xD;
             this combination therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform the&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 4 months after completion of administration of this combination&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to entering the study or those who have not yet recovered to grade 1 or less prior&#xD;
             treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgery within the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with bevacizumab or topoisomerase I therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational therapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to any of the experimental compounds examined&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other active malignancy (inactive / without progression for at least 6 months and&#xD;
             no progression anticipated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-healing wounds or ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing patients as stated above. Agents examined in this clinical trial&#xD;
             carry the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bevacizumab has been associated with the development of treatment-related hypertension&#xD;
             that can become urgent or emergent. Evidence of uncontrolled hypertension in patients&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment will preclude enrollment onto this study until blood&#xD;
             pressure is controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as the presence of&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure greater or equal to 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
             greater or equal to 100 mmHg measured on two separate occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV or with solid organ transplant (because of potential&#xD;
             additional risk for cytopenias).&#xD;
