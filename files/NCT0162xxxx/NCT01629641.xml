      The purpose of this study is to determine the test-retest and inter-rater reliability and&#xD;
      concurrent validity of two iPhone goniometric applications in the measurement of active&#xD;
      shoulder external rotation as compared to a standard manual goniometer. The scientific&#xD;
      hypotheses for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be significant Pearson correlations (&gt;.8) to demonstrate test-retest&#xD;
           reliability for each of the tools between the 1st and 2nd round of testing as assessed&#xD;
           by novice testers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be significant intra-class correlation coefficients (&gt;.8) to demonstrate&#xD;
           inter-rater reliability between the novice tester and the experienced tester for each of&#xD;
           the three tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be significant Pearson correlations (&gt;.8) to demonstrate concurrent validity&#xD;
           between the standard goniometer and the photo capture application, the standard&#xD;
           goniometer and the accelerometer-based application and the photo capture application&#xD;
           with the accelerometer-based app. as assessed by novice testers.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the test-retest and inter-rater reliability and&#xD;
      concurrent validity of two iPhone goniometric applications in the measurement of active&#xD;
      shoulder external rotation as compared to a standard manual goniometer. This research is&#xD;
      being done to determine if there are other more reliable, valid or innovative technological&#xD;
      ways to measure active range of motion. Four testers (three entry-level doctoral students in&#xD;
      physical therapy and one of two experienced physical therapists) will be measuring currently&#xD;
      enrolled physical therapy doctoral students. The two experienced physical therapists are the&#xD;
      principle investigator and the listed investigator who is a Physical Therapist. Two separate&#xD;
      iPhone applications (DrGoniometer, which is based on photo capture and GetMyROM, which is&#xD;
      based on the iPhone's internal accelerometer) and a standard manual goniometer will be used&#xD;
      to measure the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will receive a cover letter describing the study via email. If the&#xD;
      student is interested in participating they will report to the testing room (wearing a tank&#xD;
      top (male or female) or asked to remove their top (male)) at one of the scheduled testing&#xD;
      times. All testing will occur in a laboratory room on the TWU-Houston campus. The participant&#xD;
      will be asked to review and sign an informed consent form. Any questions related to the study&#xD;
      will be specifically asked at this time but may be asked at any time during the duration of&#xD;
      the study. The primary investigator or any co-investigator will assign a confidential&#xD;
      participant number to the participant at this time. Next the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a demographic form. If the participant answers &quot;yes&quot; to question 4, 5, 6 or 7,&#xD;
      he/she will be eliminated from the study and asked not to participate. At this time, the&#xD;
      participant will be randomly assigned to testing table 1, 2 or 3 (all three tables will&#xD;
      follow the same basic procedure but the participant will be assessed by the table's assigned&#xD;
      instrument first). Also, the side of testing (left or right) will be randomly selected. For&#xD;
      example, a participant may be randomly assigned to table 1 (right shoulder). The participant&#xD;
      will report to table 1, which is the iPhone DrGoniometer station...therefore they will be&#xD;
      measured with this tool first. All of the testers (novice and expert) will be blinded to the&#xD;
      outcomes of the other measures. Tester 1 (novice) will evaluate active right shoulder&#xD;
      external rotation range of motion (ROM) with the iPhone DrGoniometer with a piece of tape&#xD;
      covering the measurement reading. Tester 1 will then hand the iPhone to the blinded recorder,&#xD;
      who will remove the tape, record the measurement, replace the tape and hand the iPhone back&#xD;
      to Tester 1. Then the participant will be measured with GetMyROM (by novice 2) and then the&#xD;
      standard goniometer (by novice 3) in random order. Tape will also be placed over the&#xD;
      measurements on the iPhone for GetMyROM and the standard goniometer in the same manner that&#xD;
      will be used with DrGoniometer. Next, the skilled tester will measure the participant with&#xD;
      the instrument used at the assigned table. The participant will stay with this assigned table&#xD;
      for the duration of the testing. Now the participant will be asked to stand up and move&#xD;
      around before returning to the table for the 2nd round of testing. At least fifteen minutes&#xD;
      from initial testing, the three initial novice testers will repeat their measurements in the&#xD;
      previous order. All measurements and time of testing for the first measurement will be&#xD;
      recorded by blinded investigators (recorders) and entered into a password protected computer&#xD;
      and password protected Excel file which will only be known to the primary investigator. The&#xD;
      file and computer will be locked in the primary investigator's office when data collection is&#xD;
      not actively taking place. The data linking the participant number with the participant's&#xD;
      name will only be known by the primary investigator and the recording investigators. The&#xD;
      iPhones will not be linked to the internet during the testing and all images will be deleted&#xD;
      after the data is recorded. The data will be recorded on to an Excel data printout. After&#xD;
      each data collection session, the data will be entered into the file electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Shoulder External Rotation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow a standard measurement testing procedure for assessing shoulder&#xD;
      external rotation. The participant will be asked to wear either a tank-top (females or males)&#xD;
      or no shirt (males). The participant will lie on their back on a padded plinth (table). The&#xD;
      participant will asked to place their test shoulder in approximately 90 degrees of abduction&#xD;
      (away from the body) and the elbow flexed (bent) to 90 degrees. The forearm is placed in&#xD;
      neutral or midway between pronation/supination (long axis rotation) with approximately 2/3rds&#xD;
      of the proximal the entire humerus is supported by the table. A towel will be placed under&#xD;
      the humerus so the elbow is approximately at the level of the shoulder. In order to achieve&#xD;
      this position, participants will be instructed via the following script:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lie on your back on the plinth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Move to the edge of the plinth towards me.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Let me position your arm and put a towel under it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bring your arm back towards the table, into external rotation, until you feel like you&#xD;
           can't go any farther&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hold this position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the standard goniometer measurement, the axis of the goniometer will be placed on the&#xD;
      center of the olecranon and the stationary arm of the goniometer will be perpendicular with&#xD;
      the floor and the moving arm will bisect the ulna towards the ulnar styloid process. For&#xD;
      DrGoniometer, a photo will be taken of the participant at the end of normal active ROM and&#xD;
      the amount of range of motion will be calculated using the app. For GetMyROM, the iPhone will&#xD;
      be placed perpendicular to the ground, as determined by the tester, and then the edge of the&#xD;
      iPhone will be placed on the caudal border of the ulna. Expected normal range of motion is&#xD;
      approximately 90 degrees of external rotation. The testers will be watching for movement&#xD;
      substitutions: elbow extension (straightening), scapular elevation, tilting or protraction.&#xD;
      If the tester notices any compensatory movement patterns, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      return to neutral and repeat the movement without compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Three different iPhones will be used. These iPhones belong to the investigators. They will&#xD;
      all be iPhone 4 version. All iPhone wireless and 3G connections will be disabled prior to&#xD;
      data collection in order to reduce potential loss of confidentiality. All iPhones will use&#xD;
      the same version of the applications and will not perform any updates to these applications.&#xD;
      All iPhones will have the same version of software and will not update the software on the&#xD;
      iPhone during the study. All iPhones will be password protected in order to reduce potential&#xD;
      loss of confidentiality. At the end of each testing session, one of the PT investigators will&#xD;
      assure that the photos have been deleted prior to reestablishing connectivity with the&#xD;
      internet. In addition, all investigators signed a confidentiality statement.&#xD;
