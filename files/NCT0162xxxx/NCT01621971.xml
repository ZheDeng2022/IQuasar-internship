  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main hypothesis is that inhalation of milrinone can reduce the elevated pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure due to severe mitral valve regurgitation without compromising systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Therefore, the effects of a brief inhaled milrinone (IH) on pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure are determined and compared to those of intravenous milrinone (IV) in severe mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative pulmonary hypertension (PHT), an independent risk factor for cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      1,2 is frequently associated with chronic mitral valve regurgitation and tends to produce&#xD;
      right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Worsening PHT, which is sensitive to any increase in the&#xD;
      RV afterload, reduces the right coronary perfusion pressure, exacerbates RV dysfunction, and&#xD;
      compromise the left ventricular (LV) preload and systemic perfusion pressure. 3,4 Although&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) milrinone is preferred for treating PHT due to its beneficial effects in&#xD;
      enhancing myocardial contractability without increasing the heart rate-related myocardial&#xD;
      oxygen consumption, 5-7 its frequent association with systemic vasodilation requires&#xD;
      additional vasoconstrictor therapy for maintaining the optimal perfusion pressure.8-10&#xD;
      Selective pulmonary vasodilation, which reduces the RV afterload without systemic arterial&#xD;
      vasodilation, is important for managing PHT and the accompanying RV dysfunction.11 A study&#xD;
      reported that nebulized and inhaled (IH) milrinone ( 1 mg/ml) produced dose-dependent&#xD;
      selective pulmonary vasodilatation in postoperative PHT in the intensive care unit.12 If IH&#xD;
      milrinone during the pre-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) period produces selective pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilation in patients with PHT undergoing mitral valve surgery, it would be a beneficial&#xD;
      option for managing intraoperative PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that a brief inhaled milrinone could reduce the pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure without the systemic side effects better than intravenous milrinone in elevated&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      hemodynamic before and after administering IH and to compare them to those of IV milrinone in&#xD;
      patients with elevated pulmonary artery pressure due to severe mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      undergoing mitral valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Experimental Groups Adult patients with PHT (systolic PAP &gt; 50 mmHg&#xD;
      estimated by the velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation in preoperative transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography) undergoing mitral valve surgery for chronic mitral regurgitation are&#xD;
      enrolled in this study after obtaining approval from the institutional research board and&#xD;
      providing written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative exclusion criteria include preoperative supraventricular tachycardia (SVT),&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, multiple ventricular ectopic contractions, continuous&#xD;
      inotropic support, LV ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 30%, emergent surgery, obstructive&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, bleeding diatheses, bronchial asthma and had biochemical evidence of hepatic&#xD;
      disease or renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist implements the randomization process for grouping the patients by giving the&#xD;
      enrolled patients, a patient identification number (PIN). Then, the patients are stratified&#xD;
      by their PIN in a 1:1 ratio to receive IH (Primacor, Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., Markham,&#xD;
      ON, Canada) (Group IH) or IV (Group IV) milrinone. The investigators are blinded to the&#xD;
      allocation of the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and Patient Monitoring When the patient arrived in the operating room, continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of a five-lead ECG (lead II and V5), the bispectral index (BIS), pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      and invasive arterial pressure via the radial artery are started. Patients are given&#xD;
      midazolam 1.5-2 mg intravenously in the patient holding area. Anesthesia is induced with&#xD;
      propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 10-15 μg/kg, and rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg. Target controlled&#xD;
      infusion (TCI) and a TCI infusor (Diprifusor™ TCI system; Fresenius, Waltham, MA, USA) are&#xD;
      used to administer propofol for anesthetic induction and maintenance, and the infusion dose&#xD;
      is titrated to achieve a propofol effect-site concentration of 2-2.5 μg/ml. Additional&#xD;
      fentanyl at 10-30 μg/kg/h and rocuronium at 20-30 mg/h are administered to maintain&#xD;
      anesthesia, and the propofol concentration is adjusted to maintain a BIS score of 40-60.&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, volume-controlled ventilation of oxygen with air (FiO2 0.6, flow&#xD;
      rate 100 ml/kg/min) is started with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg, respiration rate of&#xD;
      12-14/min, inspiration:expiration ratio of 1:2, and peak airway pressure lower than 25 cmH2O.&#xD;
      Then, the respiration rate is adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO2 of 35-40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An introducer and a pulmonary artery catheter (Oximetrix™ Opticath catheter; Abbot&#xD;
      Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA) are placed in the right internal jugular vein. A&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe is placed, and intraoperative TEE is used to&#xD;
      monitor ventricular and valvular function throughout the operation. The LV EF is measured&#xD;
      using a modification of Simpson's method from the midesophageal 4 or 2 chamber view of&#xD;
      two-dimensional TEE images as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after anesthesia induction and obtaining vascular access for hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring, synthetic hydroxyethylstarch (Voluven™; Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homberg, Germany) is&#xD;
      administered as needed to maintain stable hemodynamics, and bolus phenylephrine 50-100 μg is&#xD;
      administered intravenously to treat any refractory hypotension (MAP &lt; 60 mmHg) persisting for&#xD;
      more than 1 min with intravascular volume administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivering the study drugs and collecting data, CPB with moderate hypothermia (rectal&#xD;
      temperature 28-30ºC) via crystalloid cardioplegia is used during the surgical procedure. The&#xD;
      MAP was maintained at 50-80 mmHg by adjusting the pump flow and administering 50 μg boluses&#xD;
      of phenylephrine during the CPB period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IV milrinone infusion (0.5 μg/kg/min) is started at the release of the aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
      and a continuous infusion of norepinephrine is started at a rectal temperature of 35ºC as&#xD;
      needed; its dosage is titrated to wean the patient from CPB and to maintain the optimal&#xD;
      hemodynamics during the post-CPB period in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the Study Drug After performing the sternotomy and achieving stable hemodynamics,&#xD;
      but before the initiation of CPB, the study drugs are administered; IH milirinone and IV&#xD;
      placebo (0.9% normal saline 0.05 ml/kg) or IH placebo (distilled water) and an IV bolus of&#xD;
      milrinone (50 μg/kg) are administered in Group IH and IV, respectively. Milrinone is used at&#xD;
      its commercial concentration (1.0 mg/ml) for both inhalation and IV administration. The&#xD;
      reservoir of a nebulizer (MiniHeart™; Westmed, Tucson, AZ, USA) in the inspiratory limb of&#xD;
      the ventilator circuit (90 cm proximal to the Y-piece) is filled with milrinone or placebo.&#xD;
      The milrinone or placebo in the reservoir is nebulized with a fixed operating flow at 2 L/min&#xD;
      of O2 (as per the manufacturer's recommendation) and delivered over 10 min at a ventilator&#xD;
      flow rate of 100 ml/kg/min to avoid rebreathing the expiratory flow, which may produce&#xD;
      contamination or interaction between the nebulized milrinone and CO2 absorbent (Fig. 1). The&#xD;
      aerosol size and delivery rate of the nebulized drug are assumed to be 1.0-2.5 μm and 45-65&#xD;
      μL per gas flow, respectively, according to the manufacturer's manual for the nebulizer.&#xD;
      Excess inspiratory gas flow from the nebulizer was compensated for by adjustment of minute&#xD;
      ventilation settings on the ventilator, keeping minute ventilation constant. Inspiratory&#xD;
      oxygen fraction (FiO2) is kept constant throughout the procedure. If MAP decreases below 60&#xD;
      mmHg, inhalation of the study drug is stopped and the patient excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic Data The following data are obtained before and 10 min after completely&#xD;
      administering the study drug: mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MPAP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP), the&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure gradient (TPG= mean PAP-PAOP), thermodilution cardiac output (CO),&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), arterial O2 tension&#xD;
      (PaO2), mixed venous O2 saturation (SvO2), and TEE measured EF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Intergroup comparisons of the changes in SVR, PVR, the PVR/SVR ratio,&#xD;
      and TPG are used to identify selective pulmonary vasodilation. The data before and after&#xD;
      administration are compared using paired t-test. If the data do not pass a normality test,&#xD;
      the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. Intergroup data are compared using the t-test. The&#xD;
      need for bolus phenylephrine due to hypotension in the pre-CPB period or during CPB is&#xD;
      compared using Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance is assumed at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
