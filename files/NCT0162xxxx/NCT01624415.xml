  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans attain binocular vision from the two retinal images of both eyes through a series of&#xD;
      sensory and motor processes that culminate in the perception of stereoscopic depth. Looking&#xD;
      at a scene creates two slightly different images on the retinas which is due to the eyes'&#xD;
      different positions on the head. This so called binocular disparity provides information to&#xD;
      calculate depth and therefore enables stereopsis. Physiologically the two retinal images are&#xD;
      superimposed and merge into one stereoscopic image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one image is presented to one eye in an experimental setting, and a completely different&#xD;
      image is presented to the other eye, the investigators visual system, analogous to diplopic&#xD;
      vision, is not able to fuse these image stimuli. Instead, a phenomenon called binocular&#xD;
      rivalry occurs. Here, both images are seen alternating and the brain can switch back and&#xD;
      forth between these images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of objective changes to image&#xD;
      quality on the investigators subjective stereoscopic perception. This psychophysiological&#xD;
      testing is done by looking at different images and thereafter by subjective grading of the&#xD;
      image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that overlapping image modifications occurring in both eyes are&#xD;
      detected immediately, but changes, that are rotated by 90 degrees against each other, should&#xD;
      be suppressed and result in one stereoscopic image, reduced in image quality. Whether this&#xD;
      also accounts for more detailed images, such as reading cards, is questionable.&#xD;
