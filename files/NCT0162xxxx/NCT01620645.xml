    <textblock>
      The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) together with the Association of British Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Industries (ABPI) have recently funded a program designed to foster collaboration between&#xD;
      academic COPD researchers and the pharmaceutical industry in the UK, with the aim of&#xD;
      developing and furthering our research capacity and expertise for the benefit of patients&#xD;
      living with this prevalent and disabling condition. This builds on the strong international&#xD;
      track record of COPD research in the UK. The program is divided into four work packages&#xD;
      (WP1-4), each with specific aims. WP1 will collate and establish data from patient cohorts&#xD;
      and share this information through the development of knowledge management platforms. WP2&#xD;
      will specifically assess how airway micro-organisms impact on COPD and how the effects of&#xD;
      bacteria and viruses may be modified. WP3 is concerned with tissue injury and repair which&#xD;
      are fundamental processes in the development of COPD. WP4 will examine in detail the&#xD;
      potential for improving patient outcomes by targeting the skeletal muscle dysfunction that&#xD;
      can profoundly affect exercise capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre UK based observational study of a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) funded by the MRC, as part of the MRC/ABPI&#xD;
      Inflammation and Immunology Initiative in COPD. This consortium brings together key&#xD;
      researchers in the COPD research community with long-standing expertise in understanding&#xD;
      bacterial infection, inflammation and immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the role of bacterial and viral infections, which are often the trigger for&#xD;
      exacerbations, and the mechanism of tissue re-modelling and repair following exacerbations is&#xD;
      extremely important. Exacerbations and the progression of the disease impose a considerable&#xD;
      disability on patients and a financial burden on the health service. In additional, pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation in COPD may result in systemic inflammation. This is associated skeletal muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction, as well as worsening other common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now have a much better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie COPD and cause the chronic inflammatory process, both locally within the lung and&#xD;
      systemically. However, current therapy for COPD is inadequate and relies on long-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators, which do not ameliorate the underlying chronic inflammatory process.&#xD;
      Currently available anti-inflammatory therapies are incompletely effective. An improved&#xD;
      understanding of the complex mechanisms in COPD is required in order to develop future&#xD;
      effective treatments, for which there is a pressing need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from existing cohorts of COPD patients, and indirectly through&#xD;
      their general practitioner and outpatient clinics. Patients must have COPD, and all patients&#xD;
      will be assessed to ensure the correct diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be phenotyped by lung morphology and function, biomarkers in blood,&#xD;
      sputum and urine, bacterial and viral load in sputum, cardiovascular behaviour,&#xD;
      co-morbidities and skeletal muscle function. The patients will be followed up over initially&#xD;
      18 months, with a planned extension to 5 years, to accurately determine the relationship&#xD;
      between bacterial and viral infections, tissue re-modelling and skeletal muscle dysfunction&#xD;
      with exacerbation frequency and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be phenotyped by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chest CT-Scan for quantitative measures of lung morphology at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECG and blood pressure to assess cardiovascular risk conferred by systemic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      4)Biomarkers of infection, inflammation and cardiovascular disease in blood, sputum (both&#xD;
      spontaneously produced and induced) and urine 5)Quality of life, respiratory symptoms,&#xD;
      fatigue, depression, history of cigarette smoking, housing, contact with children and pets&#xD;
      and daily activity will be assessed by questionnaire 6)A 6 minute walk test and 4 meter gait&#xD;
      speed to determine exercise tolerance and disability 7)Lung function using a spirometer and&#xD;
      whole body plethymograph 8)Arterialised blood gases using ear-lobe blood gas analysis&#xD;
      9)Bioimpedance for assessing blood flow and body composition 10)Isometric Muscle strength&#xD;
      using quadriceps strain gauge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary card on which they will record an increase&#xD;
      in two respiratory symptoms, from which we will identify exacerbations, based on our&#xD;
      validated criteria of two consecutive days with increase in two symptoms that must include&#xD;
      either dyspnoea, sputum purulence or sputum volume. Patients unable to complete the diary&#xD;
      cards will be judged incapable of taking part in the research. All patients will provide&#xD;
      informed, written consent. Patients will be seen at enrollment, every 6 months thereafter for&#xD;
      baseline measurements, at exacerbation and at week 2 and 6 post exacerbation to monitor their&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a baseline CT scan, at full suspended inspiration with the smallest&#xD;
      field of view that includes both lungs. The maximum dose of radiation that each patient with&#xD;
      receive from the CT scan is estimated at 2 milli-Sieverts. This is equivalent to about 100&#xD;
      front chest X rays. This compares to an average exposure of 2 milli-Sieverts per year from&#xD;
      naturally occurring radioactive material (background radiation). Patients may benefit from&#xD;
      detection of previously unknown lung carcinoma and lung abnormalities. At exacerbation&#xD;
      visits, some patients may require a chest X-ray as part of standard clinical emergency care&#xD;
      e.g. to exclude a pneumothorax or detect pneumonia. The estimated dose of radiation per plain&#xD;
      chest X-ray is 0.02 milli-Sieverts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will only be taken by trained personnel. The blood will be analysed for routine&#xD;
      haematological parameters, and other body chemicals that might be linked to COPD, ischaemic&#xD;
      heart disease and other co-morbridities. The volume of blood taken should not cause any&#xD;
      anaemia and routine blood counts will be made to monitor haemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both spontaneous and induced sputum specimens will be taken. The induced sputum may cause&#xD;
      coughing and some shortness of breath. Patients will be closely monitored and their lung&#xD;
      function checked to ensure their safety. We have previously shown that induced sputum&#xD;
      sampling is a safe procedure in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to walk for 6 minutes and the distance recorded. Patients heart rate&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation will be monitored before and after the walk. Patients may experience&#xD;
      shortness of breath during this test. Supplementary oxygen will be available if the patient&#xD;
      desaturates during the test. Additional assessment of muscle strength and disability will be&#xD;
      carried out using a quadriceps strain gauge, the four meter gait speed test and the short&#xD;
      physical performance battery. The patient should not experience any more dyspnoea than they&#xD;
      would normally encounter in everyday life and the quadriceps strain gauge will only be&#xD;
      performed if there are no underlying musculoskeletal or neurological contra-indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigations described above are specific to certain centres collaborating in this&#xD;
      study and not all tests will be performed on all patients. The tests which will be requested&#xD;
      for each individual patient will be fully explained during their initial visit at the&#xD;
      appropriate study site.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive a single high resolution CT scan of the chest. This will be performed using a low tube current, helical technique. Participants may also receive a plain chest X-ray if clinically indicated.&#xD;
The total research protocol dose is 2 mSv. The dose from the chest X-ray is insignificant compared with the dose from the CT scan of the chest, therefore all this dose can be considered to be additional to standard of care. A dose of 2 mSv represents a risk of radiation induced detriment of approximately 1 in 10,000 and is equivalent to about 11 months of average natural background radiation in the UK.</description>
