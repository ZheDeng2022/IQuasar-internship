  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent anxiety disorder that is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and hypertension. One&#xD;
      potential mechanism is overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), both at rest&#xD;
      and particularly during stress. This study will evaluate whether 8 weeks of daily DGB therapy&#xD;
      or transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) therapy improves SNS activity at rest and&#xD;
      during stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is highly prevalent in both the military and general population. Because of the&#xD;
      tremendous deleterious mental health and socioeconomic impact of PTSD, research to understand&#xD;
      and treat all aspects of PTSD is vitally important. One less recognized but highly&#xD;
      significant consequence of PTSD is an increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CV) disease, and its risk factors. Despite the epidemiologic data demonstrating increased CV&#xD;
      risk in PTSD, very little is known about underlying mechanisms. This project will help fill&#xD;
      this gap by examining the mechanistic role of sympathetic overactivation in PTSD. Sympathetic&#xD;
      hyperactivity has a major role in causing and sustaining hypertension, and contributes to the&#xD;
      development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and atherogenesis. Moreover, exaggerated SNS&#xD;
      responses during mental stress are associated with an increased risk of hypertension and CV&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow breathing is an integral part of many ancient meditative practices that are purported to&#xD;
      have beneficial physiologic and psychological effects. Clinical applicability of slow&#xD;
      breathing requires a method for delivering slow breathing exercises to outpatients on a&#xD;
      consistent basis. This can be achieved through device-guided slow breathing (DGB) in which&#xD;
      breathing rate is slowed to &lt; 10 breaths/min via an interactive biofeedback device. The&#xD;
      RESPeRATE (Intercure, Inc.) device is currently FDA approved for adjunctive treatment of high&#xD;
      blood pressure and reduction of stress. This device includes a belt-type respiratory sensor,&#xD;
      earbuds to provide audio feedback, and microprocessor that measures adherence and success at&#xD;
      achieving slow breathing rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal nerve stimulation has been shown in both animal and human studies to safely and&#xD;
      effectively reduce sympathetic activity and inflammation. tVNS is a noninvasive method that&#xD;
      involves placing a device over the skin overlying the vagus nerve on the neck. The device&#xD;
      delivers mild electrical stimulation, using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS) unit. Prior studies have shown that transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation safely and&#xD;
      effectively reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans and improved heart&#xD;
      rate variability, indicating a decrease in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and a&#xD;
      shift in cardiac autonomic function toward parasympathetic (PNS) predominance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if device-guided slow breathing or tVNS improves&#xD;
      sympathetic activity and vascular function in persons with PTSD. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to 15 minutes daily of DGB vs sham-DGB, or tVNS vs. sham-tVNS for 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The RESPeRATE device will be used for 15 minutes of device-guided breathing daily for 8 weeks. The participant places the elastic belt with a respiration sensor around the upper abdomen, and wears earbuds for audio feedback. The device monitors the breathing rate, calculates inspiration and expiration times, and generates a personalized melody of two distinct ascending and descending tones for inhalation versus exhalation. Users effortlessly entrain their breathing pattern with the tones, and the device gradually guides the user to a prolonged expiration time and slower respiratory rate (to &lt; 10 breaths/minute). The device automatically stores usage data, allowing for quantification of adherence and performance.</description>

    <description>tVNS is a noninvasive method that involves placing a device over the skin overlying the vagus nerve on the neck. The device delivers mild electrical stimulation, using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit. The stimulation is increased until there is a vibration and slight muscle contraction in the lower face or neck. Then the stimulation is delivered for 2 minutes on the left side of the neck, and on the right side of the neck, for a total of 4 minutes. The tVNS device is used twice daily for 8 weeks.</description>
