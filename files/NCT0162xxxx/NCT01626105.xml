    <textblock>
      This study is designed to accurately identify the pharmacogenetic determinants of risk of&#xD;
      Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor development by focusing on only a select group of Hemophilia A&#xD;
      (HA) patients who have: (i) received a recombinant FVIII therapeutic product containing the&#xD;
      same primary amino acid sequence since their original diagnosis; (ii) verifiable FVIII&#xD;
      infusion histories; and (iii) been tested regularly for FVIII inhibitor development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are developing a novel, personalized strategy for assessing immunogenicity of protein&#xD;
      therapeutics using, as our model, the infusion of Factor VIII (FVIII) into hemophilia A (HA)&#xD;
      patients. About 20% of all treated HA patients develop neutralizing FVIII alloantibodies&#xD;
      (&quot;inhibitors&quot;) that make disease management difficult and expensive. Nowadays, HA is usually&#xD;
      treated with highly purified human recombinant (r)-proteins, an advance in safety from&#xD;
      pathogens not accompanied by a decrease in inhibitor incidence. Current strategies for&#xD;
      upcoming FVIII formulations focus largely on engineering the most immunogenic epitopes in the&#xD;
      hope of forming a universally less immunogenic protein. In contrast, we are pioneering a&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic approach to immunogenicity that takes into account the underlying variability&#xD;
      of the patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project focuses on defining the role of individual genetic differences on FVIII&#xD;
      immunogenicity. The principles, however, have broader application for protein therapeutics in&#xD;
      general. We have studied non-HA-causing variants in the FVIII gene (F8) and have shown that&#xD;
      (i) nonsynonymous (ns)-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encode several structurally&#xD;
      distinct wild-type FVIII proteins in the human population and (ii) a sequence mismatch&#xD;
      between patients' endogenous FVIII and infused FVIII due to ns-SNPs is a risk factor for&#xD;
      inhibitor development that may explain the high inhibitor incidence in HA patients with black&#xD;
      African ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most well established risk factor for inhibitor development is the type of HA-causing F8&#xD;
      gene mutation. As a rule, large alterations in F8 and absence of antigenically cross-reactive&#xD;
      material (CRM) in plasma are associated with inhibitor development. The most common F8&#xD;
      mutation causing severe HA, an intron-22-inversion (I22I), fits that description but is not&#xD;
      associated with a high inhibitor risk. Similarly, while most HA patients with missense&#xD;
      mutations do not develop inhibitors, this alloimmune complication occurs frequently in&#xD;
      patients with one of a few highly recurrent missense mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While not definitively established, population heterogeneity in the repertoires of&#xD;
      HLA-class-II (HLA-II) molecules expressed on the surfaces of the antigen-presenting cells in&#xD;
      individual patients is likely another genetic contributor to inhibitor risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a comprehensive assessment of the pharmacogenetics of the immune response to&#xD;
      FVIII leveraging a unique resource comprised of a group of 55 subjects with severe or&#xD;
      moderately-severe HA who were (i) enrolled as previously-untreated patients (PUPs) in the&#xD;
      recently concluded clinical trial known as the Advate PUP study and (ii) have received the&#xD;
      same r-FVIII protein (i.e., Advate) since birth. Prior PUP-study data as well as new blood&#xD;
      samples and data will be obtained from these subjects upon their enrollment into the current&#xD;
      study. In addition to having been treated with only a single FVIII product, this exceptional&#xD;
      patient cohort was (and continues to be) closely monitored for both FVIII infusion history&#xD;
      and inhibitor development, the latter of which by undergoing frequent Bethesda testing. (HA&#xD;
      patients who have been treated with several FVIII products are not ideal for testing the&#xD;
      hypotheses we have proposed.)&#xD;
