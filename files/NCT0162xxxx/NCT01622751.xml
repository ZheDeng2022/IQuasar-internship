    <textblock>
      Context: Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone with an insulin sensitizing effect,&#xD;
      and has been related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. In addition, children with&#xD;
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and the abnormality of&#xD;
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if the sleep stages are related to the plasma levels of adiponectin,&#xD;
      resistin, and RBP4 (retinol binding protein-4), and whether these relationships are&#xD;
      influenced by age, obesity and insulin resistance.&#xD;

      This comparative study was carried out in 28 PWS children and 18 controls. The enrolled PWS&#xD;
      children were volunteers out of a pool of approximately 100 PWS children followed at Samsung&#xD;
      Medical Center [median age 8.0 years, interquartile range (7.0-10.5 years), BMI: median 24.2&#xD;
      kg/m2 (23.0-27.5 kg/m2)] and 18 obese healthy children [median age 9.0 years interquartile&#xD;
      range (7.0-11.0 years), BMI: median 24.2 kg/m2 interquartile range (23.1-27.6 kg/m2)].&#xD;

        The study population comprised 28 children with PWS and 18 controls. The enrolled children&#xD;
        with PWS were volunteers from a pool of approximately 100 children with PWS followed up at&#xD;
        the Samsung Medical Center. The controls were healthy children from several elementary and&#xD;
        middle schools located in the southern areas of Seoul.&#xD;
