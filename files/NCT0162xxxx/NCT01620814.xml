      Comparison of intravaginal misoprostol and dinoprostol for the purpose of cervical ripening&#xD;
      before diagnostic hysteroscopy in the women at the reproductive age:RANDOMİSED,CONTROLLED&#xD;
      PROSPECTİVE TRİAL Objective. Comparison with one another and with control group of vaginal&#xD;
      dinoprostol and misoprostol with for the purpose of cervical ripening before diagnostic&#xD;
      hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: It was planned for performing to 95 women who appealed to gynecology polyclinic&#xD;
      and will be performed diagnostic hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eighty-six women who will be performed diagnostic hysteroscopy assigned as randomize&#xD;
      to three groups. It was planned that none procedure will be applied to group 1 for cervical&#xD;
      ripening, vaginal misoprostol and vaginal dinoprostone will be practiced to Groups 2 and 3,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While diagnostic hysteroscopy allows panoramic view of the uterus cavity, operational&#xD;
      hysteroscopy allows to minimal invasive approach in the intrauterine lesions. Most frequently&#xD;
      complications of hysteroscopy are cervical rupture, hemorrhage, failure of passage formation&#xD;
      and uterus perforation. These generally are related to cervix dilatation's difficulty. These&#xD;
      complications can be minimized preoperatively by the cervical ripening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present clinic study will be performed on the patients who appealed to gynecology polyclinic&#xD;
      of the Konya TRH by the reason of infertility and infertility polyclinic of Zekai Tahir Burak&#xD;
      Women Health Education and Research Hospital were planned diagnostic hysteroscopy by&#xD;
      intrauterine pathology prediagnosis.Women will be given information about study and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained Inclusion criteria: On the HSG,USG or SIS, women at the age&#xD;
      of primary or secondary infertile reproductive suspected for intrauterine pathology, no&#xD;
      contraindication for hysteroscopy and reproductive age Exclusion criteria: Women are with&#xD;
      allergy against to prostaglandins, with diseases in which prostaglandin usage is&#xD;
      contraindicated, pregnant, don't given approval, with cervical surgery history and cervical&#xD;
      insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post randomization. For the purpose of cervical ripening none procedure will be performed to&#xD;
      Group 1, while vaginal misoprostole of 200 mg and vaginal dinoprostone will be applied to&#xD;
      Group 2 and 3, respectively. While misoprostol will be implanted 3 hours before procedure,&#xD;
      but dinoprostone will be implanted 6 hours before procedure. Before drug implantation for&#xD;
      determination of the cervical insufficiency and measure of the cervical canal's opening,&#xD;
      bougies will be applied toward to back from 8 no- hegar bougie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After drugs administration, cervical canal will be again evaluated with above mentioned way&#xD;
      by bougie before hysteroscopy, patients whose cervixes were easily passed via 5.5 no-hegar&#xD;
      bougie, haven't cervical dislocation requirement and then directly hysteroscopy will be&#xD;
      applied to them. Other patients will be applied cervical dislocation up to 6 no- hegar bougie&#xD;
      before hysteroscopy. These processes also will be applied to patients of the Group 1.&#xD;
