      This scientific study aims at studying human adaptations to high altitude and the studies&#xD;
      will be conducted at the University of Zürich and during a 4 week high altitude &quot;expedition&quot;&#xD;
      to the Jungfraujoch research station at 3450 m altitude. The proposal is made up of several&#xD;
      independent biological research projects to be conducted in the same healthy volunteers&#xD;
      participating in the study. Thus, the subjects will be studied at sea level, and then during&#xD;
      4 weeks of acclimatization to high altitude, and for some experimental purposes all subjects&#xD;
      will also be studied one and two weeks after return to sea level.&#xD;

      Study aim A: Red cell mass and hypoxia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various forms of altitude training have been used to increase in particular endurance&#xD;
      performance of elite athletes. The most commonly used approaches is either to live and train&#xD;
      at altitude (Live high - train high; LHTH) or to live at high altitude while training at sea&#xD;
      level (Live high - train low; LHTL). While it is generally accepted that the potential&#xD;
      performance enhancing effects of LHTH and LHTL are mediated through a hypoxia dependent&#xD;
      increase in red cell mass (1), this has never been demonstrated experimentally. In 2010 the&#xD;
      investigators conducted the first placebo controlled double blinded LHTL study (supported&#xD;
      with BASPO funding) with the clear aim to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the&#xD;
      performance enchantment following LHTL. In brief, for this reason 16 elite athletes (average&#xD;
      VO2max ≈ 70 ml.kg.min) resided for 16 hours/day in either normoxia or at the stimulated&#xD;
      altitude of 3000 m for four weeks. This protocol was chosen based on recent reviews by&#xD;
      experts within the field (2). Despite this supposedly optimal setting the investigators did&#xD;
      not find a single positive change induced by LHTL. To our big surprise and despite having&#xD;
      measured VO2max, time trial performance, red cell mass, markers of erythropoiesis at a much&#xD;
      higher frequency than in any other previous LHTL study they all remained unaffected by LHTL.&#xD;
      Based on our experience within altitude physiology and studies including erythropoietin&#xD;
      injections in humans, the investigators have begun to speculate if even 3 weeks of continuous&#xD;
      altitude exposure is sufficient stimulus to increases red cell mass which is the cornerstone&#xD;
      assumption for LHTL (1, 3). If this is not the case, then the scientific rationale to perform&#xD;
      LHTL vanishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial determination of red cell mass at altitude dates 100 years back when Douglas (4)&#xD;
      reported that 6 weeks of exposure to 2300 m altitude on the Gran Canaries did not increase&#xD;
      red cell mass whereas htc did increase. Some 50 years later Lawrence (5) concluded that a&#xD;
      true increase in red cell mass required several weeks (8) of altitude exposure (3800 m),&#xD;
      whereas the decrease in plasma volume begins upon arrival. It should here be noted that they&#xD;
      used a superb method to determine red cell mass: autologous red cells tagged with radioactive&#xD;
      phosphorous, something that is not possible today. In 1964 Hannon (6) conducted his now&#xD;
      classic study when he exposed 8 female and 8 males to 4300 m altitude for 9 full weeks.&#xD;
      During the first month there was no increase in red cell mass, and over the next 5 weeks red&#xD;
      cell mass only increased by 5% despite of continued iron supplementation. The method used in&#xD;
      this particular study was autologous chromium-51-labbeled red cells, i.e. gold standard. Even&#xD;
      at the severely high altitude of 5450 m (with no relevance for elite sport), Reynafarje (7)&#xD;
      reported that 6 weeks are required for an increase in red cell volume. To follow up on all&#xD;
      previous altitude studies is impossible here, but in a recent review Grover and Bärtsch (8)&#xD;
      summarized these by stating that &quot;True polycythemia develops when residence at high altitude&#xD;
      (3800-4500m) extends over months to years&quot;. Thus, as compared to the altitude research done&#xD;
      in the past in regards to red cell mass, mostly conducted with the use of techniques by far&#xD;
      superior to those used today and at higher latitudes than applied in LHTL protocols, the&#xD;
      proposal that LHTL should increase red cell mass seems at odds. It should be kept in mind&#xD;
      however, that in most altitude studies it is difficult to isolate the effects to hypoxia, and&#xD;
      also changes in temperature, nutritional intake and physical activity level are often a&#xD;
      confounding factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levine and Stray-Gundersen (3) were the first to report an increase in red cell mass&#xD;
      following LHTL. After 3 weeks of LHTL at 2500 m they calculated RCV to be increased by 8%&#xD;
      based on changes in plasma volume as derived by Evens Blue. Evens blue is a poor measure for&#xD;
      changes in RCV since it rapidly leaks from the circulation, and the data should be taken with&#xD;
      some caution. It is also interesting that an increase in RCV was only observed in 50% of the&#xD;
      LHTL subjects. This does not exclude that the observed changes were simply not just the&#xD;
      result of biological variation (9). In the 10 years following the first positive LHTL results&#xD;
      the data could not be replicated. Especially the Australian research group lead by Chris Gore&#xD;
      made huge efforts in this period but could not confirm that 3 weeks of LHTH or normobaric&#xD;
      LHTL caused RCV to increase (10-16). From 2006 and onwards positive effects of LHTL have been&#xD;
      reported on RCV, but the data are far from convincing. The research group of J.P. Richalet&#xD;
      conducted a series of experiments in Premanon, and found red cell mass to increase in one&#xD;
      study (17), but unchanged in another two studies (18, 19). J Wehrlin from the Bundesamt für&#xD;
      Sport found three weeks of LHTL to increase RCV (20), but the study design is not clean as&#xD;
      subjects from different disciplines served as control and treatment subjects. This is a&#xD;
      problem since they were at different stages in their training season and it cannot be&#xD;
      excluded that this does not affect RCV. Since the subjects were elite athletes competing at&#xD;
      the international level it is also a pity that no anti-doping samples were collected in this&#xD;
      subject's population. Chris Gore has for the last few years applied an unusual statistical&#xD;
      approach and thereby reported what they call &quot;marginal&quot; increases in RCV following LHTL (21).&#xD;
      This conclusion however cannot be drawn if using a standard accepted statistical approach.&#xD;
      Thus, although it is generally accepted that LHTL may increase RCV, the picture is not as&#xD;
      clear as expected, and the investigators argue that it is rather unlikely when comparing with&#xD;
      the above mentioned chronic altitude exposure studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim with this present study is to determine in a large study population (n=16) if&#xD;
      continuous exposure to 3450 m altitude for four weeks increases red cell mass or not. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen this altitude because 1) In populations living permanently at this&#xD;
      altitude, an elevated red cell volume has been reported as compared to their countrymen&#xD;
      living near sea level, 2) If the investigators choose a lower altitude, and the investigators&#xD;
      observe no increase in red cell mass the investigators would not be able to determine whether&#xD;
      this was the consequence of a too low altitude or a too short exposure duration, 3) Exposure&#xD;
      to much higher elevations may not be suitable for athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol for Study aim A: Red cell mass and hypoxia One month before altitude exposure&#xD;
      subjects will on a weekly basis have their RCV (by CO rebreathing) and other hematological&#xD;
      parameters quantified on two separate days not separated by more than one day (i.e. Monday&#xD;
      and Tuesday, or Tuesday and Wednesday etc). This allows for a very good estimation of their&#xD;
      basal hematological values. Light iron supplementation (40 mg/day will be started on day 1&#xD;
      and kept throughout the study). Furthermore, all subjects will perform light bike exercise at&#xD;
      1.0 W/kg body weight for 30 minutes every second day during this month. Such light activity&#xD;
      is known not to influence red cell mass (22). The activity will be continued during the&#xD;
      altitude exposure period at the Jungfraujoch (see below), in order to limit any potential&#xD;
      effect altitude/confinement induced physical inactivity which may induce a decrease in plasma&#xD;
      volume, which however is reported to be eliminated by even very light (23). On two&#xD;
      occasions/week while at Jungfraujoch all subjects will be escorted to the Mönchhütte (same&#xD;
      altitude) and back (total 60 min of walking) in order to also keep some physical activity.&#xD;
      While at altitude all subjects will perform the same test as at sea level, i.e. double&#xD;
      determination of hematological parameters on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim B: Cardiovascular adjustments to high altitude:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classic studies by Grollman on Pikes Peak ( 4300m) in the US demonstrated that there is an&#xD;
      approximately 40% increase in resting cardiac output (heart rate × stroke volume) within the&#xD;
      first days of ascent to high altitude (Grollman 1930). Similar observations have been made&#xD;
      under more rigorously controlled conditions in the laboratory, with equivalent degrees of&#xD;
      hypoxia (24, 25). Changes in stroke volume play a minor role in the altitude induced increase&#xD;
      in cardiac output, and most of the response (90-95%) seems to be the result of an increase&#xD;
      heart rate (24, 25). Following a few days of altitude exposure however, cardiac output&#xD;
      returns to sea level values or to even lower values despite hypoxemia is still persisting&#xD;
      (26). The decrease in cardiac output is surprising and occurs despite an continuous increased&#xD;
      heart rate and is a consequence of a reduction in stroke volume (26, 27). Similar data are&#xD;
      reported with exercise, i.e. a decrease in stroke volume with submaximal and maximal exercise&#xD;
      (28). The physiological mechanism leading to a reduction in stroke volume at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise with continuous exposure to high altitude remains unknown, and the main aim with&#xD;
      Study B is to resolve this issue. Since cardiac output to a large degree depends on blood&#xD;
      volume (Frank-Starling mechanism) and left ventricular filling, it is tempting to speculate&#xD;
      that the altitude dependent decrease in plasma volume and hence also total blood volume&#xD;
      causes right ventricle filling and subsequently also stroke volume to be reduced. To test&#xD;
      this hypothesis to interventions will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To facilitate venous return, and hence right ventricle filling, subjects will on a&#xD;
           weekly basis be tested on the commonly used tilt-table. The tilt table allows&#xD;
           investigation of subjects in the supine position at various head-down tilts. The&#xD;
           investigators wish to study our volunteers during 5 minutes of head down tilt at (at&#xD;
           each tilt) -15, -30 and -45°, which is normal procedure. The head down tilt facilitates&#xD;
           venous return and hence stroke volume. The largest effects are usually seen at around&#xD;
           -70°. During the last minute of each tilt cardiac output will be assess by an inert&#xD;
           re-breathing technique (the investigators have had this procedure approved by the ETH&#xD;
           ethical board in previous applications) and by ultra sound doppler. Heart rate and blood&#xD;
           pressure will continuously be monitored non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the last study day at the Jungfraujoch plasma volume will be restored to sea level&#xD;
           values by infusion of Dextran. The exact volume of dextran to be infused is calculated&#xD;
           by multiplying the red cell volumes (assessed in project A) with the hematocrit. Cardiac&#xD;
           output will be assessed as above in the supine and seated position before and&#xD;
           immediately after the infusion of Dextran.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stroke volume and heart rate will be determined during submaximal and maximal exercise&#xD;
           by inert-gas re-breathing on a weekly basis during acclimatization. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that the expected changes in stroke volume correlate well with altitude&#xD;
           induced changes in plasma and blood volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study C: Autonomic nervous control at high altitude:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to hypoxia causes sympathoexcitation in humans. This has been determined indirectly&#xD;
      by measurements of the hypoxia-induced increases in noradrenaline (Cunningham et al., 1965)&#xD;
      and directly by increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (Saito et al., 1988). The&#xD;
      primary underlying mechanism is activation of chemoreceptors in the carotid body (Marshall,&#xD;
      1994) and the brainstem (Solomon, 2000). Thus, during acute exposure to hypoxia, heart rate&#xD;
      and sympathetic nerve activity change significantly when blood oxygen saturation decrease to&#xD;
      about 85% (Smith et al., 1996). In humans, this level of saturation results from breathing&#xD;
      hypoxic gas mixtures with an FIO2 of 0.11-0.13 with some individual variation (Lundby et al.,&#xD;
      2004). Recently it was demonstrated that sea level residents acclimatizing for 4 weeks to an&#xD;
      altitude of 5260m above sea level exhibited a surprisingly high level of muscle sympathetic&#xD;
      nerve activity (Hansen &amp; Sander, 2003). The average muscle sympathetic burst frequency&#xD;
      increased to 300% above sea level values, which is considerably more than the 50-100%&#xD;
      expected during acute exposure to a corresponding hypoxic gas mixture (FIO2 0.105). One&#xD;
      limitation to this first study was the inclusion of only one time-point during the altitude&#xD;
      acclimatization. Thus, it is unknown whether high altitude sympathoexcitation as measured by&#xD;
      microneurography subsides during further acclimatization in sea level residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific mechanisms underlying this apparent high altitude sympathoexcitation are&#xD;
      unclear. Concurrent breathing of pure oxygen and intravenous infusion of saline at high&#xD;
      altitude to restore blood homeostasis only caused a minor decrease in muscle sympathetic&#xD;
      nerve activity (Hansen &amp; Sander, 2003), suggesting that traditional activation of the&#xD;
      peripheral chemoreflex or the cardiopulmonary baroreflex do not account for the&#xD;
      sympathoexcitation. In stead, chronic exposure to hypoxia may cause resetting of the central&#xD;
      nervous pathways involved in sympathoexcitatory reflexes. There is a growing body of evidence&#xD;
      supporting that pharmacologically-induced inhibition of brainstem nitric oxide signalling&#xD;
      causes amplification or resetting of sympathoexcitatory reflexes, and it has been suggested&#xD;
      that accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide could be similarly involved in&#xD;
      human sympathoexcitatory states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism of high altitude sympathoexcitation (point 1-5 below)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown how chronic hypoxia causes sympathoexcitation, but some of the potential&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arterial baroreflex-activation. In previous high altitude MSNA-studies the sea level&#xD;
           residents had minor but significant increases in arterial blood pressure of about&#xD;
           8-12mmHg (29, 30), which rules out arterial baroreflex unloading. Resetting of the&#xD;
           arterial baroreflex has not been ruled out as a contributing factor, but it is unlikely&#xD;
           as a major mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiopulmonary baroreflex-activation. In a chronic high altitude study (29), an&#xD;
           intravenous infusion of saline (800-1000ml over 15 min) caused only a small decrease in&#xD;
           sympathetic traffic, providing evidence that unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors&#xD;
           is not a primary contributor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chemoreflex-sensitization. The ventilatory and sympathoexcitatory responses to high&#xD;
           altitude acclimatization share several characteristics. Both responses develop gradually&#xD;
           over days, and once established normalization is slow over days after re-exposure to&#xD;
           normoxia (29, 31, 32). Ventilatory and sympathetic chemoreflexes share the afferent&#xD;
           input from peripheral chemoreceptors, and the central neuronal circuitries responsible&#xD;
           for efferent activation of phrenic nerves and sympathetic outflow are parallel. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that hyperventilatory and sympathoexcitatory responses to&#xD;
           chronic hypoxic exposure share underlying mechanisms. Ventilatory acclimatization to&#xD;
           high altitude is thought to primarilly depend on chemoreflex-sensitization, i.e. despite&#xD;
           stable or even slightly improving arterial oxygen tension during the first 2 weeks of&#xD;
           acclimatization, the hypoxic chemoreflex ventilatory response (HVR) slowly is augmented.&#xD;
           The basis for this unique reflex-sensitization has been studied quite extensively over&#xD;
           the last several decades. In humans, it is likely that both peripheral and central&#xD;
           mechanisms are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Peripherally, the signaling events in the chemoreceptors within carotid and aortic&#xD;
           bodies are complex involving several excitatory and inhibitory transmitters. The&#xD;
           excitatory signals include adenosine, ATP, acetylcholine and endothelin. The primary&#xD;
           inhibitory signaling molecules are dopamine (acting on D2-receptors, D2R) (33),&#xD;
           noradrenaline, and NO. In humans, intravenous low-dose dopamine and the D2R-antagonist&#xD;
           domperidone (now only administered orally) are able to decrease and augment sea level&#xD;
           HVR, respectively (34, 35), but not maximal hypoxic ventilation (36). Neither low-dose&#xD;
           dopamine or domperidone cross the blood-brain barrier. Although, dopamine production and&#xD;
           effects within the carotid body may decrease during the first days of hypoxic exposure&#xD;
           (37, 38), enzymes involved in dopamine production, dopamine receptors, and&#xD;
           dopamine-concentration (and noradrenaline) are upregulated during chronic hypoxia (38).&#xD;
           The functional consequence for ventilatory responses in humans have been studied&#xD;
           sparingly, but one study suggests that the effects of both dopamine and dompridone on&#xD;
           HVR are unaltered or slightly larger in subjects exposed to hypoxia for 8h (35). The&#xD;
           role of NO in peripheral chemoreception has not been studied in humans, but recent&#xD;
           animals studies suggest the peripheral inhibitory action of NO is confounded by&#xD;
           NO-mediated disinhibition of dopamine-effects. Thus, sodium nitroprusside actually&#xD;
           increase peripheral chemoreceptor firing in cats perhaps by blocking endogenous&#xD;
           dopamine-inhibition (39).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Centrally, chemoreceptor-afferent activation causes release of L-glutamate and dopamine&#xD;
           within the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). These events lead to excitation of&#xD;
           NTS-neurons that in turn via L-glutamate excite brainstem neurons within the rostral&#xD;
           ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The collected input to RVLM-neurons control the central&#xD;
           sympathetic outflow from the brainstem. Animal studies have suggested that modulation of&#xD;
           the chemoreflex pathway within NTS by dopamine (excitatory) (40) nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
           (excitatory) (41) becomes more significant during hypoxic exposure. Thus microinjection&#xD;
           of sodium nitroprusside and the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA into NTS in awake rats&#xD;
           cause an increase and a decrease in ventilation during hypoxic exposure (41). The role&#xD;
           of central D2R in hypoxia have been studied in rats by comparing HVR after domperidone&#xD;
           (peripheral D2R blockade) with HVR after domperidone + haloperidol (a peripheral and&#xD;
           centrally acting D2R blocker) (42). The overall effects of haloperidol alone on the&#xD;
           ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxia in humans was a reduction in HVR (43).&#xD;
&#xD;
           While a number of neuronal pathways and transmitters both peripherally and centrally may&#xD;
           play physiological roles in chemoreflex-sensitization linked to&#xD;
           altitude-acclimatization, recent studies in D2R-knock-out mice have provided compelling&#xD;
           evidence that D2R are a prerequisite (44). For this reason the present study will test&#xD;
           whether sensitization of the chemoreceptors is an underlying cause for high altitude&#xD;
           sympathoexcitation, and if so whether dopamine- or NO-related mechanisms are involved.&#xD;
           In this regard, it should be noted that, acute hyperoxia or even three days of normoxic&#xD;
           breathing failed to normalize sympathetic traffic in healthy subjects acclimatized to&#xD;
           high altitude for 4 weeks (29). However, similar findings have been reported for&#xD;
           ventilation. Thus, chronic hypoxia may cause such a substantial sensitization of the&#xD;
           chemoreflex, that even hyperoxia may fail to silence the primary peripheral&#xD;
           chemoafferents from the carotid and aortic bodies, and it has been speculated that&#xD;
           hyperoxia may actually cause central excitation of ventilatory and sympathetic output&#xD;
           after acclimatization to altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Decreased NO-production in brainstem-vasomotor centers. Soon after it was discovered&#xD;
           that NO was an important endothelium-derived vasodilator, NO also emerged as a&#xD;
           neuromodulator augmenting glutamatergic neurotransmission (45). It has since been well&#xD;
           established in animal models that the overall functional significance of NO deficiency&#xD;
           within brain stem centers is sympathoexcitation and augmentation of sympathoexcitatory&#xD;
           reflexes (46). This form of sympathoexcitation has been identified in humans (47). Thus,&#xD;
           while some studies indicate an increased NO-production within NTS, the overall&#xD;
           NO-production could be decreased during hypoxic exposure. Indeed, a recent human study&#xD;
           have suggested that there is at least a relative NO-deficiency with lower blood&#xD;
           cGMP-levels during hypoxic exposure (48). In a high altitude study, intravenous infusion&#xD;
           of the NO substrate, L-arginine, had no effect on sympathetic traffic (Lundby et al.,&#xD;
           2002abstract). This finding does not exclude NO-deficiency during chronic hypoxia, but&#xD;
           merely indicates that such putative deficiency is not related to a relative lack of the&#xD;
           substrate for NO synthesis. The present study adresses this unresolved issue in two&#xD;
           independent ways. First, whole-body NO-production will be determined by a novel&#xD;
           stable-isotope technique. Second, L-NAME will be is used to produce NO synthase&#xD;
           inhibition. Under ambient air conditions this will reveal whether the functional&#xD;
           significance of endogenous NO-production is decreased in chronic hypoxia. During&#xD;
           HVR-testing L-NAME may have complex effects on the chemoreflex due to both disinhibition&#xD;
           at the level of the peripheral chemoreceptors and indirect inhibitory action within NTS&#xD;

        5. Neurophysiological characteristics of high altitude sympathoexcitation The high altitude&#xD;
           sympathoexcitation has not yet been characterised using single-unit recordings. The&#xD;
           single-unit characteristics such as firing probability and probabilities of dual and&#xD;
           multiple single-unit firing within one heart cycle will allow cross-sectional comparison&#xD;
           of sympathetic traffic between lowlanders and high altitude natives. Furthermore,&#xD;
           sympathetic single-unit characteristics have recently been published for the&#xD;
           sympathoexcitatory states of heart failure, sleep apnoea, and hypertension (49). Thus,&#xD;
           important comparisons can be made to other sympathoexcitatory states. The firing&#xD;
           characteristics may have important implications for noradrenaline release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral uncoupling of sympathetic activity and vasomotor tone Despite a dramatic increase&#xD;
      in sympathetic nerve activity, and noradrenaline release, there is a limited (albeit&#xD;
      statistically significant) increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure at high&#xD;
      altitude. This is logically related to hypoxia-induced peripheral offsetting of sympathetic&#xD;
      vasoconstriction. The uncoupling could be caused at least partially by alpha-receptor&#xD;
      downregulation, although there was no significant decrease in cardiac alpha-1-receptors in&#xD;
      rats living in hypobaric hypoxia for 21 days (50). In addition, acute severe hypoxic exposure&#xD;
      also causes an uncoupling of sympathetic activity and vasomotor tone. Thus, in humans using&#xD;
      FiO2 of 0.08, sympathetic traffic is very high, but vascular resistance and blood pressure&#xD;
      are decreased (51). This acute hypoxia effect is unlikely to be explained by receptor&#xD;
      downregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for high altitude sympathoexcitation tested with the proposed application:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The high altitude sympathoexcitation will be characterised by an increased probability&#xD;
           of sympathetic single-unit firing, resembling characteristics of sympathoexcitation in&#xD;
           heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chronic hypoxic exposure causes substantial sensitisation of the chemoreflex, which at&#xD;
           least partially explains the sympathoexcitation of high altitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a) Central nervous D2R-mediated dopamine effects are importantly involved in chemoreflex&#xD;
      sensitisation in high altitude sympathoexcitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3b) Altered NO-signaling is importantly involved in chemoreflex sensitisation in high&#xD;
      altitude sympathoexcitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for peripheral uncoupling of sympathetic responses 4) Chronic hypoxic exposure&#xD;
      causes decreased local and whole body nitric oxide production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be each studied 4 times (2 control studies in Zürich, with and without&#xD;
      L-NAME, and 2 studies at Jungfraujoch in week 3), with and without L-NAME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study day will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meaurements: BP, HR, Plethysmographic limb blood flow, Ventilation (incl oxygen uptake),&#xD;
      Pulseoximetry, and MSNA single-units, and MSNA multi-units for the full chemoreflex-study.&#xD;
      Blood samples: Including: Catecholamines, RBC-channels, cGMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemoreflex (6 different oxygen levels in arterial blood) (protocol suggested by Mou et&#xD;
           al. 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB-1: CO2 will be kept at ambient breathing levels (i.e. the resting value measured in each&#xD;
      individual), by adding small amounts of CO2 during the chemoreflex tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB-2: On one study day, intravenous dopamine-infusion (3 µg kg -1 min-1) (Dahan et al. 1996),&#xD;
      domperidone-tablets (0,75 mg kg-1) (Pedersen et al. 1999, Lundby et al. 2001), and&#xD;
      intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) (Takeuchi et al. 1993) will be used in this sequence at&#xD;
      sea level and at Jungfraujoch to inhibit and disinhibit peripheral chemoafferent firing, and&#xD;
      subsequently inhibit central D2R-related chemoreflex excitation. Dopamine effects disappear&#xD;
      within a few minutes after stopping infusion (Dahan et al. 1996, Jarnberg et al. 1981).&#xD;
      Domperidone effects will reach maximum about 30 minutes after tablet ingestion, and remain&#xD;
      fairly stable for another 30 minutes. At these doses, dopamine and domperidone do not cross&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier and consequently the contribution of central sensors of hypoxia is&#xD;
      unaltered. Metoclopramide has been reported to cause an increase in sympathetic activity at&#xD;
      sea level. If the investigators confirm this after domperidone-treatment at sea level, any&#xD;
      decrease in sympathetic traffic in high altitude will strongly suggest hypoxia-related&#xD;
      changes in central D2R-related chemoreflex excitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim D: Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue metabolic adjustments to high altitude:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia-dependent control of mitochondrial function has long been of interest however&#xD;
      surprisingly little is known regarding this topic in either humans or animals. Previous&#xD;
      observations of mitochondrial modifications following acclimatization to altitude (especially&#xD;
      high and extreme altitudes) have been inconsistent. Initial reports (52-55) demonstrated&#xD;
      greater expression of indirect markers suggestive of enhanced oxidative potential in both&#xD;
      animals and humans native to high altitude, leading investigators to postulate that&#xD;
      acclimatization may improve respiratory capacity and mitochondrial function in response to an&#xD;
      increasingly hypoxic environment (55). This initial paradigm was challenged when further&#xD;
      studies of lowlanders sojourning to high/extreme altitudes reported either a dramatic loss of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mitochondria (56, 57) or negligible changes in mitochondrial profile&#xD;
      following acclimatization to high/extreme altitude (58-62), even despite significant&#xD;
      reductions in skeletal muscle mass (60, 61). One consistency across the literature, however,&#xD;
      has been the assumption that mitochondrial function (i.e. respiratory capacity, substrate&#xD;
      control of respiration, and efficiency or coupling control) is represented via static&#xD;
      measurements alone such as mitochondrial specific protein concentrations/activity or&#xD;
      morphometric analysis representing mitochondrial content or volume, respectively. While such&#xD;
      static measurements are not to be discounted, as they are vital to the study and our&#xD;
      understanding of mitochondrial physiology, relying on these measurements for the&#xD;
      characterization of mitochondrial function and oxidative potential is incomplete. Examination&#xD;
      of mitochondrial function requires direct specific manipulations of mitochondrial respiration&#xD;
      so potential changes in oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport can be identified.&#xD;
      Alterations in whole body protein turnover (63) and hypoxia facilitated changes in protein&#xD;
      concentration, including several mitochondrial proteins (64) from this study have already&#xD;
      been reported. To elucidate hypoxia induced changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function&#xD;
      following acclimatization to high altitude, the investigators wish to assess mitochondrial&#xD;
      function of permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers and adipose tissue at sea level and after&#xD;
      approximately 20-24 days of exposure to high altitude.&#xD;
