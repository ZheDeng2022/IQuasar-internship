    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if modulation of NRF2 with a Sulforaphane enriched supplement modifies&#xD;
      responses to O3. Participants: Recruitment of up to 70 healthy volunteers, ages 18-50, for&#xD;
      completion of 36 volunteers. Procedures: This is a randomized, placebo controlled 2x2&#xD;
      crossover study of treatment with an NRF2 modifier versus placebo in healthy volunteers which&#xD;
      will examine airway inflammation before and 4 hours after a 2 hour 0.4 ppm O3 exposure.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to received either the NRF2 modifier, SFN oral supplement&#xD;
      (i.e. broccoli sprout shake), or placebo (alfalfa shake) for 3 days followed by a 0.4 ppm O3&#xD;
      exposure for 2 hours. At least 2 weeks later subjects will return for a 2nd supplementation&#xD;
      treatment (using the alternative supplement to that provided initially) followed by an ozone&#xD;
      exposure identical to the initial one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be seen for a baseline screening visit at which time informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained, a 12 lead ECG will be performed and spirometry with subsequent sputum&#xD;
      induction will be performed. Only subjects meeting the lung function criteria as well as&#xD;
      criteria for adequate sputum production will continue in the study. If the sample is&#xD;
      considered &quot;borderline&quot; by the study team, the subject maybe invited back to repeat&#xD;
      collection of another sputum sample. Subjects will be required to abstain from caffeine for&#xD;
      12 hours prior to all study visits and must not use/ingest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      medications, anti-oxidant vitamins, juices/drinks fortified with extra vitamin supplement and&#xD;
      cruciferous vegetables 7 days prior to all visits. Subjects will be provided with a list of&#xD;
      cruciferous vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified volunteers will next be seen for a training visit at which time they will undergo&#xD;
      physical exam by a study physician. After baseline spirometry is evaluated, the subject will&#xD;
      exercise on a treadmill, and measurements of minute ventilation will be collected. Treadmill&#xD;
      speed and/or elevation will be adjusted until the subject's minute ventilation is at the&#xD;
      target level of 30-40 L/min. The resulting speed and elevation will be used during the ozone&#xD;
      exposure sessions. At the training visit, participants will also undergo nasal epithelial&#xD;
      biopsy from one nare, and a buccal swab will be collected for genotyping. Baseline blood&#xD;
      samples will also be collected at this time for analyses of markers of inflammation, cytokine&#xD;
      assessments, SFN levels and complete blood cell count with differential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the training session, the subject will return for 4 sequential days.&#xD;
      During the first 3 days, subjects will ingest (observed ingestion) either broccoli sprout&#xD;
      homogenate or alfalfa sprout homogenate based on earlier randomization. One hour after the&#xD;
      supplement dose on the 3rd day, the volunteer will undergo exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone for a 2&#xD;
      hour period. During exposure, subjects will perform 15 minutes of moderate exercise on a&#xD;
      treadmill (minute ventilation = 30-40 L/min), each separated by 15 minutes of seated rest.&#xD;
      Heart rate and rhythm will be continuously monitored throughout the exposure. Spirometry and&#xD;
      symptom scoring will be performed both prior to and after exposure. One hour after the end of&#xD;
      exposure, a nasal epithelial biopsy will be collected from the nare that is contralateral to&#xD;
      that used at the prior visit. Four hours after completion of the exposure, blood will be&#xD;
      drawn for study endpoints and a sputum induction will be performed. The following day the&#xD;
      subject will return for a follow-up visit to include vital signs, symptom scoring,&#xD;
      spirometry, sputum induction and venipuncture for blood endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to abstain from a list of vegetables for 1 week prior to each study&#xD;
      session until the completion of that session. Subjects will also be asked to maintain a food&#xD;
      diary for the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2 to 6 weeks washout period, participants will again return for a repeated sequence&#xD;
      of 4 days with 3 days of supplement ingestion followed by ozone exposure using the alternate&#xD;
      supplement and a 24 hour post exposure follow-up visit. Samples for analyses will be&#xD;
      collected at the same time points as those used in the initial sequence.&#xD;
