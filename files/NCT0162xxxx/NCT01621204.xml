    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate if eltrombopag can be used instead of Intravenous Immune&#xD;
      Globulin (IVIG) in patients with ITP, to adequately raise their platelet count when they&#xD;
      undergo minor or major surgery. Eltrombopag is a daily, oral pill approved for treatment of&#xD;
      ITP. IVIG is a blood product frequently used to treat ITP. Patients with ITP who need surgery&#xD;
      have to get treatment to increase their platelet count. IVIG is commonly used for this&#xD;
      purpose but eltrombopag may be more effective and convenient for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by the&#xD;
      presence of platelet autoantibodies, low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding.&#xD;
      TPO receptor agonists which stimulate platelet production have been shown to be remarkably&#xD;
      effective in ITP. Their use as a short-term means of elevating platelet counts in preparation&#xD;
      for surgical procedures has not yet been adequately evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with moderate to severe ITP (platelet count less than 50 x 10exp9/L) have&#xD;
      stable platelet counts and do not bleed; however, when surgeries or invasive procedures&#xD;
      become necessary, additional treatment is often required to increase the platelet count to&#xD;
      achieve adequate hemostasis. Although specific guidelines for surgical platelet count&#xD;
      thresholds in ITP are lacking, platelet transfusion guidelines recommend a platelet count of&#xD;
      50 - 100 x10exp9/L for the vast majority of surgical procedure; 50x10exp9/L is a typical&#xD;
      threshold for minor surgeries like tooth extractions and endoscopies; and 100x10exp9/L is&#xD;
      used for major surgery like cardiac surgery or neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to rapidly increase platelet counts in&#xD;
      ITP patients before an invasive procedure. IVIG is associated with a transient platelet count&#xD;
      response in approximately 80% of patients, which occurs within 2 - 4 days. In most patients,&#xD;
      platelet counts remain elevated for approximately 4 weeks, allowing enough time to complete&#xD;
      the procedure and for adequate post-operative hemostasis. However, IVIG is a&#xD;
      resource-intensive and expensive blood product associated with frequent side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is a small molecule, non-peptide thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist indicated&#xD;
      for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP who have had an&#xD;
      insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. TPO receptor&#xD;
      agonists are an effective new class of medications that are non-immunogenic agonists of the&#xD;
      TPO receptor (c-Mpl) and work by increasing platelet production in ITP patients. In&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, eltrombopag maintenance therapy has been shown to raise the&#xD;
      platelet count in 60 - 80% of ITP patients and platelet counts generally remain elevated as&#xD;
      long as the drug is continued. Time to response is 1 - 2 weeks with minimal need for dose&#xD;
      titration. Side effects of eltrombopag observed in clinical studies included elevation of&#xD;
      liver enzymes (approximately 10% of patients). The risk of thrombosis and bone marrow&#xD;
      reticulin formation remain uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 74 patients (across&#xD;
      approximately 8 centers) in Canada. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      eltrombopag bridging therapy compared with IVIG bridging therapy in adult patients with ITP&#xD;
      who require surgery. This study will also evaluate bleeding, adverse events and&#xD;
      patient-reported treatment satisfaction using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for&#xD;
      Medication (TSQM). Patients will be stratified according to centre and surgery type (major&#xD;
      vs. minor).&#xD;
