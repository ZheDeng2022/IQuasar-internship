      This is a prospective, observational, open-label, 2-arm, parallel, multi-center study.&#xD;
      Patients with HBV-associated severe acute exacerbation for whom the treatment with NRTI (such&#xD;
      as lamivudine and entecavir) is medically recommended will be screened for eligibility. To&#xD;
      target 74 evaluable subjects, approximately 82 patients should be recruited into this trial.&#xD;
      After enrollment, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the antiviral&#xD;
      treatments below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Lamivudine 100 mg p.o. q.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Entecavir 0.5 mg p.o. q.d. This process will be stratified by prolonged PT, &lt;&#xD;
           4 sec / 4-6 sec / &gt; 6 sec. Both lamivudine and entecavir will be taken once daily and&#xD;
           the first dose of observational drug should be administered on Day 1. The observational&#xD;
           period of individual subject will be 12 weeks; however, both treatments could be&#xD;
           continued after the end of study based on physician's clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety data will be collected at baseline, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 85, and 180&#xD;
      days after initiation of antiviral treatment. All assessments should be conducted based on&#xD;
      routine practice of each hospital. Only the analysis of HBV DNA and anti-HDV will be&#xD;
      performed in the central lab. For patients who are willing to provide the residual samples of&#xD;
      HBV DNA assessment, the blood samples will be preserved appropriately. All AE(s) and SAE will&#xD;
      be followed until resolution or the event is considered stable.&#xD;

      The study is to compare treatment response of lamivudine and entecavir in patients with&#xD;
      spontaneous severe acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the overall survival (OS) rate during observational period between lamivudine&#xD;
      and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the change from baseline in HBV DNA level at each visit between lamivudine&#xD;
           and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the proportion of subjects who have a ≥ 2 log10 decline from baseline in HBV&#xD;
           DNA level at each visit between lamivudine and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the change from baseline in ALT and AST level at each visit between&#xD;
           lamivudine and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the proportion of subjects with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) at each visit&#xD;
           between lamivudine and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the change from baseline in bilirubin level at each visit between lamivudine&#xD;
           and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare the transplantation-free survival rate during observational period between&#xD;
           lamivudine and entecavir therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess the safety of lamivudine and entecavir treatments in patients with&#xD;
           HBV-associated severe acute exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical method(s) for safety/efficacy evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The major analysis will be performed according to the principal of intent-to-treat&#xD;
           population; the safety evaluation will be performed according to the safety population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For primary endpoint, the time to event will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and&#xD;
           summarized as the number of observations, number of censored, median time point estimate&#xD;
           and the 95% CI for median.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Change from baseline in HBV DNA level at each visit 2. Proportion of subjects with HBV DNA&#xD;
      response* at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defined as a ≥ 2 log10 decline from baseline HBV DNA level. 3. Change from baseline in&#xD;
           ALT level at each visit 4. Change from baseline in AST level at each visit 5. Proportion&#xD;
           of subjects with prolonged PT* at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PT at each visit will also be assessed. 6. Change from baseline in bilirubin level at&#xD;
           each visit 7. Transplantation-free survival rate during observational period Continuous&#xD;
           variables will be analyzed using two-sample t-test/ Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and&#xD;
           categorical variables will be analyzed Chi-squared/ Fishers' exact test. Descriptive&#xD;
           statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval will be also presented. Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and&#xD;
           percentage in frequency table. In addition, the time to event will be analyzed by&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (4) The summary results of laboratory at the baseline and the end of study visit, the&#xD;
           change from baseline to end of study visit will be summarized by descriptive statistics&#xD;
           and paired t-test will be used under significant level 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (5) Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA and a summary frequency table of adverse&#xD;
           events will be provided. The severity and relationship to study medication of adverse&#xD;
           events will be summarized as well. Furthermore, if any serious adverse event had&#xD;
           occurred, the brief summary about serious adverse event will be described and listed in&#xD;
           tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (6) All statistical tests will be two-side and evaluated at the 0.05 level of&#xD;
           significance.&#xD;
