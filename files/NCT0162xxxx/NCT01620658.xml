      The primary objective of the present trial is to compare the radiation attenuation provided&#xD;
      by XPF caps (0.5mm lead-equivalent and 0.3mm lead-equivalent) to the standard protection&#xD;
      (fabric cap, basically no protection) as measured in % radiation attenuation) during 150 days&#xD;
      of fluoroscopy guided cardiology interventions. The second objective is to compare the&#xD;
      operator comfort (rated on a visual analog scale) of wearing the XPF protection caps compared&#xD;
      to the standard fabric caps.&#xD;

    <description>The null hypothesis is that the XPF 0.5mm lead-equivalent caps attenuation is equal to the XPF 0.3mm lead-equivalent and standard cap attenuations. The alternative hypothesis is that the XPF 0.5mm lead-equivalent cap attenuation is superior or inferior to the XPF 0.3mm lead-equivalent and standard cap attenuations. The groups will be compared separately and a pooled analysis, comparing XPF 0.5mm and 0.3mm combined vs. standard is also planned.The radiation protection (radiation dose reduction) expressed as a percentage was calculated by subtracting radiation measured underneath the cap from radiation measured outside the cap and then dividing this difference by the product of radiation measured outside the cap multiplied by 100.</description>
