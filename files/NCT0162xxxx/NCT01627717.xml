  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection by both HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)is frequent due to similar transmission&#xD;
      modes. Near 20% of people living with HIV are also infected by HCV. People living with HIV&#xD;
      are treated by anti-HIV medications that may interact with numerous other medications,&#xD;
      including new medications against HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boceprevir is one of these new HCV medications and it is now considered as part of the&#xD;
      standard of care for people infected with HCV. Previous research has shown boceprevir may&#xD;
      influence the capacity of the liver to breakdown (metabolize) certain medications and when&#xD;
      these medications are used in combination with boceprevir, their blood concentrations may be&#xD;
      increased or decreased which could increase the risk of side effects or decrease efficacy.&#xD;
      Among the drugs having a potential for an interaction with boceprevir is maraviroc, an&#xD;
      anti-HIV medication. If concentrations of maraviroc increase, people may experience more side&#xD;
      effects. However, if concentrations of maraviroc decrease, people living with HIV may have a&#xD;
      lower suppression of the virus. This could increase the risk for the HIV virus to develop&#xD;
      resistance, that is that the treatment will no longer be effective. No studies have been&#xD;
      conducted to investigate the effects of boceprevir on blood concentrations of maraviroc. This&#xD;
      research project addresses this research question. This project, however, cannot be done with&#xD;
      people living with HIV since resistance may develop in these people if the concentrations of&#xD;
      maraviroc decrease. It is for this reason that the investigators wish to recruit healthy&#xD;
      people not infected with HIV nor HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eleven healthy volunteers will be included. They will receive maraviroc 150 mg (1 tablet)&#xD;
      every 12 hours from days 1 to 19 inclusively. On day 5, a total of ten blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn during the following 12 hours (at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 hours after&#xD;
      maraviroc morning dose intake) to measure the blood concentrations of maraviroc. Boceprevir&#xD;
      800 mg (4 capsules) every 8 hours with food will be started on day 6 and continued until day&#xD;
      19 inclusively. On day 19, after the morning maraviroc and boceprevir dose, another ten blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn over a 12 hour period. A phone follow-up will be done on day 26. Thus,&#xD;
      the total study duration for subjects is 26 days. The investigators will compare the blood&#xD;
      concentrations of maraviroc when given alone to the blood concentrations of maraviroc when&#xD;
      given with boceprevir.&#xD;

      Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is frequent&#xD;
      because of shared modes of viral transmission. Near 20% of HIV-infected patients are also&#xD;
      infected with HCV, the prevalence of HCV in the HIV population varying according to the route&#xD;
      of transmission. Despite the decrease in mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      since the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HCV-related&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease (ESLD) now represents a leading cause of death in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV treatment outcomes in terms of sustained virologic response (SVR) are usually worse in&#xD;
      co-infected patients, pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG IFN-alpha) / ribavirin treatment&#xD;
      leading to success in only 40 to 50% of mono-infected patients and 30 % of co-infected&#xD;
      patients. In patients co-infected with HIV, present guidelines recommend a fixed course of&#xD;
      PEG IFN-alpha / ribavirin for 48 weeks to optimize HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent introduction of boceprevir and telaprevir, two direct acting antiviral agents&#xD;
      (DAAs) against HCV, changed the standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection&#xD;
      with genotype 1, whereby now the AASLD practice guidelines recommend the use of boceprevir or&#xD;
      telaprevir in combination with PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin in both HCV mono-infected treatment&#xD;
      naïve and experienced patients. No studies have yet been published in HCV-HIV co-infected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boceprevir is a novel HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitor (PI). In clinical studies of&#xD;
      treatment-naïve and experienced patients, this agent, in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      (PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin), achieved much greater SVR rates, reaching rates higher than 70 %&#xD;
      in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boceprevir has to be taken 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules) three times a day (every 7-9 hours)&#xD;
      with food. Boceprevir is usually well tolerated according to single and multiple dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics studies in healthy volunteers with adverse effects similar to placebo. The&#xD;
      serious adverse effects related to boceprevir are seen when boceprevir is coadministered with&#xD;
      PEG-IFN alpha/ribavirin. These include anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of the use of&#xD;
      boceprevir/PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin in HCV treatment naïve HCV/HIV co-infected patients showed&#xD;
      that 70.5 % of patients on boceprevir/PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin had an undetectable HCV RNA at&#xD;
      24 weeks as compared to 34.4% of patients on PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boceprevir metabolism is mediated mainly by aldo-keto reductases and by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.&#xD;
      Boceprevir is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Boceprevir is by itself known to be&#xD;
      a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/3A5 and drugs metabolized by this pathway may have increased&#xD;
      exposure when administered with this product. In vitro data has shown that boceprevir does&#xD;
      not induce CYP3A4/5. Surprisingly, however, a recent warning by the FDA (FDA Medwatch,&#xD;
      February 9th 2012) and a Dear Health Care Professional Letter from Merck &amp; Co, Inc. (USA)&#xD;
      have revealed that boceprevir decreases the exposure of HIV ritonavir-boosted protease&#xD;
      inhibitors that are CYP3A4 substrates. This unpublished data suggests that boceprevir in vivo&#xD;
      may be acting as a CYP3A4 inducer. Contradictory in vitro and in vivo drug interaction study&#xD;
      results are not uncommon. The clinical impact of these interactions is at the moment unclear.&#xD;
      This has implications for possible drug-drug interactions if boceprevir is used in&#xD;
      combination with cART in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the antiretroviral drugs that seem promising to be used in HIV/HCV co-infected patients&#xD;
      is maraviroc. A recent conference abstract suggests that adding maraviroc to an&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimen in HIV/HCV-co-infected patients naïve to anti-HCV therapy decreases&#xD;
      liver fibrosis. Maraviroc is usually given as 300 mg twice daily with or without food but the&#xD;
      dose may change depending on the patient's concomitant medications. Maraviroc does not&#xD;
      inhibit any of the major CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and&#xD;
      CYP3A4) and does not show any effects on plasma concentrations of other molecules.&#xD;
      Maraviroc's major metabolic routes are oxidation and N-dealkylation and in vitro studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that maraviroc is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of maraviroc&#xD;
      with known CYP3A4 inhibitors requires maraviroc dosage to be reduced to 150 mg twice a day&#xD;
      while its use with CYP3A4 inducers necessitates maraviroc to be used 600 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maraviroc was well tolerated in the various clinical trials with a drop-out rate of 4 to 6 %&#xD;
      similar to placebo. The most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infections (22,8&#xD;
      %), cough (13,8%), fever (12,9 %), rash (10,8 %), muscle-related symptoms (9,9 %), dizziness&#xD;
      and postural dizziness (8,7 %), abdominal pain (8.2 %), insomnia (7,7 %) and constipation&#xD;
      (5,9%) (19). Maraviroc should be used with caution in patients with an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events as cases of myocardial infarction, postural hypotension and syncope&#xD;
      have been reported. Postural hypotension is dose-related and unlikely to occur at labeled&#xD;
      doses. However, postural hypotension may be of concern if drug-drug interactions occur&#xD;
      without proper dose adjustments of maraviroc. The use of maraviroc 150 mg BID in steady-state&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers in the presence of potent CYP3A4&#xD;
      inhibitors has been well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study regarding the use of maraviroc with boceprevir has been conducted. Given the similar&#xD;
      metabolic routes taken by these molecules, that is CYP3A4, it is likely that these molecules&#xD;
      will interact. It is unknown if boceprevir will increase or decrease maraviroc systemic&#xD;
      exposure. To limit potential toxicity and study discontinuations, however, we have chosen to&#xD;
      do the study with maraviroc 150 mg twice daily. The study will evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      boceprevir on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers. As maraviroc does not&#xD;
      inhibit nor induce CYP 450 isoenzymes, maraviroc is not expected to influence boceprevir&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. For this reason, we have chosen not to measure boceprevir concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1, single center, open-label, crossover single-sequence drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      study in healthy Caucasian males. The study population is limited to Caucasian males to limit&#xD;
      interpatient pharmacokinetic variability. Eleven healthy volunteers will be included. They&#xD;
      will receive maraviroc 150 mg every 12 hours from days 1 to 19 inclusively. On day 5, 12 hour&#xD;
      intensive pharmacokinetic sampling will be done to measure maraviroc in the absence of&#xD;
      boceprevir. Boceprevir 800 mg every 8 hours with food will be started on day 6 and continued&#xD;
      until day 19 inclusively. On day 19, 12 hour intensive pharmacokinetic sampling will be&#xD;
      repeated to measure maraviroc concentrations in the presence of boceprevir. The maraviroc&#xD;
      concentration will be at steady-state by day 5. Furthermore, 14 days of boceprevir will be&#xD;
      sufficient to study inhibition and induction. A phone follow-up will be done on day 26. Thus,&#xD;
      the total study duration for subjects is 26 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of boceprevir on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective is to determine&#xD;
      the appropriate maraviroc dose to be taken when given concomitantly with boceprevir.&#xD;
