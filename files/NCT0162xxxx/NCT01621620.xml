      objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the sympatho-vagal balance effect on different limbs of pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether it is the hypertension by itself or the baroreflex activation due&#xD;
           to blood pressure rise that is responsible for the analgesic effect of acute&#xD;
           hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      study questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study questions are derived from the study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence pain perception?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence diffuse noxious inhibitory control systems?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence temporal summation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the hypoalgesic effect to acute increase in blood pressure a result of baroreflex&#xD;
           activation?&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the activation of the sympathetic system, which leads to increased&#xD;
      hypertension, rather than the cholinergic response to increased BP, is responsible for&#xD;
      antinociceptive effect of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. To study the sympatho-vagal balance effect on different limbs of pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether it is the hypertension by itself or the baroreflex activation due&#xD;
           to blood pressure rise that is responsible for the analgesic effect of acute&#xD;
           hypertension.&#xD;

      2.c study questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study questions are derived from the study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence pain perception?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence diffuse noxious inhibitory control systems?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does sympatho-vagal balance influence temporal summation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the hypoalgesic effect to acute increase in blood pressure a result of baroreflex&#xD;
           activation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Subjects and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.a subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every subject will be invited to 2 separate sessions. At least 24 hours will apart the two&#xD;
      sessions. The test in each session is described in details in the Hebrew protocol attached to&#xD;
      the current protocol in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be signed by each subject prior to a thorough interview. The&#xD;
      interview, composed of several question regarding prior health problems, current or past use&#xD;
      of medications as well as demographic details (as detailed in the Hebrew protocol) will take&#xD;
      place in the test room prior to the beginning of the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will include detailed interview, blood pressure, heart rate and ECG strip at&#xD;
      the beginning of the first(but not the second) session. The first measurement will be taken&#xD;
      following 15 minutes complete rest. The second and the third after 5 and 10 minutes,&#xD;
      respectively. Blood examinations are not required in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects: 20 age matched subjects (20-50).&#xD;
