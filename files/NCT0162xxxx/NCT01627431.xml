  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common atherosclerotic disease manifestation and&#xD;
      its prevalence increase with age and with the simultaneous presence of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD patients are usually treated, as a first line treatment, with the exercise therapy,&#xD;
      combined with the pharmacological antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of first line therapy failure, PAD patients usually undergoing to invasive&#xD;
      revascularization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a peripheral stent has been located, the major follow-up problem is the restenosis&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published studies describe how, in a large amount of patients, can be recognised an high&#xD;
      residual platelet activity. These data about PAD patients at the moment are lacking .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors would evaluate the incidence of PAD patients with an high residual platelet&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common atherosclerotic disease manifestation and&#xD;
      its prevalence increases with age and with the co-presence of cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      PAD affects a large proportion of the adult population, with an age-adjusted prevalence of&#xD;
      4-15% which increases to 29% in case of comorbidity such as the presence of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      in the same individual. Less than 20% of patients with peripheral arterial laments the&#xD;
      typical symptom of &quot;claudication intermittens&quot;. Studies on the symptomatic PAD natural&#xD;
      history indicate that the risk of limb loss in non-diabetic patients is low (2% or less), but&#xD;
      the cardiovascular disease represent the leading cause of death; the annual rate of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death) is between 5&#xD;
      and 7%. Medical treatment and / or surgery in this type of patient should be directed not&#xD;
      only to improve the walking autonomy but also to reduce cardiovascular risk. Claudicant&#xD;
      patients first-line therapy is based on structured physical exercise program and, in some&#xD;
      specific cases, on the antiplatelet pharmacological therapy. The lack of response to exercise&#xD;
      and / or drug therapy should lead to the next level of decision making, which is to consider&#xD;
      limb revascularization procedures. However, in patients with suspected proximal lesion&#xD;
      (gluteal claudication or absent femoral pulse), revascularization procedures could be&#xD;
      considered as a first line therapy. When the revascularization procedures are considered, the&#xD;
      first choice intervention should be the endovascular strategy, considering the lowest number&#xD;
      of periprocedural complications. Recommendations for optimal drug therapy after&#xD;
      revascularisation procedures in the lower limbs are hampered by lack of agreement on the&#xD;
      optimal role of these procedures, and lack of data from randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
      Transluminal angioplasty (PTA), primary or associated with stenting, is recommended for focal&#xD;
      stenotic lesions of the iliac (common and external first section) and femoral-popliteal axis,&#xD;
      particularly when the claudication intermittents is considered as severe, rather than&#xD;
      critical ischemia. Also, this approach is recommended in non-diabetic patients with a&#xD;
      relatively preserved tibial vessels flow. Exists a minor agreement about endovascular&#xD;
      procedures use in extended occlusive lesions. In recent years, has become more common the use&#xD;
      of open or covered stents during endovascular treatments in order to make it more secure and&#xD;
      durable over time, especially in obstructive and extended lesions. This has certainly led to&#xD;
      improved primary patency outcomes, but has entailed and still entails additional problems of&#xD;
      drug therapy agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the main problem concerning lower limbs revascularization is the post-procedure&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic pharmacological treatment and the different antiplatelet drugs effectiveness&#xD;
      This issue was addressed in two meta-analyses, where have been shown how the data are not&#xD;
      conclusive. Moreover, a recent study by Marcucci et al (Circulation. 2009; 119: 237-42) has&#xD;
      clearly shown that impaired platelet activation inhibition is a crucial point for the&#xD;
      prevention of vascular outcomes, because residual platelet reactivity has been associated&#xD;
      with adverse vascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these data identify two key issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platelet hyperactivation, usually observed after revascularization procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The platelet inhibition percentage appears crucial to reduce postoperative thrombotic&#xD;
           complications and restenosis early onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a unique aspect of this study is to analyze whether after peripheral&#xD;
      revascularization procedures a platelet hyperactivation is observed and evaluate the possible&#xD;
      involved mechanisms. In fact, the knowledge of the underlying mechanism could lead to more&#xD;
      appropriate pharmacological approach to prevent platelet activation. In this context, the&#xD;
      authors would explore the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inducing platelet&#xD;
      activation in patients with PAD undergoing revascularization devices.&#xD;
