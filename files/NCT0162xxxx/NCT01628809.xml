      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a three-day mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      retreat (vs. a three-day relaxation retreat) in stressed, unemployed, community adults on&#xD;
      brain function, brain structure, and overall health and immunity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stress has been shown to be a significant risk factor for increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Eight-week Mindfulness-Based Meditation programs (MBSR) have been shown to improve&#xD;
      participants' health and well-being, including reducing inflammation and slowing the&#xD;
      progression of chronic diseases such as HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential benefits of a three-day mindfulness-based meditation retreat program (vs. an active&#xD;
      rest and relaxation retreat control condition) on a highly stressed, unemployed, community&#xD;
      adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited from the Pittsburgh area and are randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      mindfulness-based retreat program or the rest and relaxation retreat program. All&#xD;
      participants complete a psychosocial survey, blood work, and a baseline fMRI before&#xD;
      completing the intervention. Participants complete a second fMRI immediately following the&#xD;
      intervention and then additional blood work and psychosocial surveys at a four month&#xD;
      follow-up timepoint. At each fMRI appointment, participants will complete neuroimaging tasks&#xD;
      (where they will be presented with words, picture, and sounds) that will assess&#xD;
      neuroreactivity, regulation responses, and brain volume before and after mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation training.&#xD;
