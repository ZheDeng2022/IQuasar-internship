  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to determine if the addition of a standard of care drug,&#xD;
      interferon-alfa 2b (IFN), with an investigation vaccine will have any affect on the immune&#xD;
      system and/or your cancer. The investigational vaccine will be made with genes that are&#xD;
      specific to melanoma and will be given intradermally (i.d.) every two weeks for a total of 3&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the vaccines, subjects will be randomized to either receive a boost of high dose IFN or&#xD;
      no boost. IFN will be administered intravenously (into a vein) for 5 consecutive days (Monday&#xD;
      through Friday) every week for 4 weeks. Administration will begin approximately 30 days (± 7&#xD;
      days) after the 3rd vaccine. The first dose of IFNα2b may begin within 10 business days of&#xD;
      randomization. All subsequent procedure dates for Group A will be based on the date of the&#xD;
      first dose of IFNα2b.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single site study to evaluate the immunological effects of autologous DC&#xD;
      transduced with the MART-1, tyrosinase and MAGE-A6 (melanoma associated antigens, MAA) genes&#xD;
      in 30 subjects with recurrent, unresectable stage III, IV metastatic melanoma (M1a, M1b,&#xD;
      M1c). AdVTMM2-transduced DC, 10e7, will be given intradermally (i.d.) every two weeks for a&#xD;
      total of 3 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the DC vaccines, subjects will be randomized to either receive a boost of high dose&#xD;
      IFNa2b or no boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to receive the IFNa2b boost will receive Interferon-a2b, 20 MU/m2/d&#xD;
      (rounded to the nearest 1 million units) administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days&#xD;
      (Monday through Friday) every week for 4 weeks (induction). Administration will begin&#xD;
      approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the 3rd vaccine. The first dose of IFNα2b may begin&#xD;
      within 10 business days of randomization. All subsequent procedure dates for Group A will be&#xD;
      based on the date of the first dose of IFNα2b..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-points of this study are local and systemic toxicity, immunological response,&#xD;
      generation of determinant spreading and anti-tumor immunity, and clinical response.&#xD;
