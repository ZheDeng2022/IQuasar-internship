      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimes, which&#xD;
      control the HIV infection and results in increases in CD4 cell counts and an undetectable&#xD;
      viral load, many patients suffer from increased morbidity. There is evidence that presence of&#xD;
      antibodies against the C5 region of gp120 strongly correlates with slower disease&#xD;
      progression, and that loss of antibody responses to this region are associated with&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vacc-C5 is a single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine corresponding to the&#xD;
      C5 region on gp120 and the external domain of gp41. The vaccine is intended to create a&#xD;
      non-neutralizing antibody against C5 region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate safety of the vaccination regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune responses (antibodies), T cell responses, T cell&#xD;
           activation markers and other immune markers.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimes, which&#xD;
      control the HIV infection and results in increases in CD4 cell counts and an undetectable&#xD;
      viral load, many patients suffer from increased morbidity. There is evidence that presence of&#xD;
      antibodies against the C5 region of gp120 strongly correlates with slower disease&#xD;
      progression, and that loss of antibody responses to this region are associated with&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vacc-C5 is a single heterodimeric peptide-based HIV therapeutic vaccine corresponding to the&#xD;
      C5 region on gp120 and the external domain of gp41. The rationale behind the Vacc-C5 is the&#xD;
      finding that long-term non-progressors (LTNP) subjects have more antibodies towards the C5&#xD;
      part of gp120 than HIV infected subjects with a more rapid disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Vacc-C5 immunotherapy is to induce a humoral immune response. The&#xD;
      vaccine is intended to create a non-neutralizing antibody against the C5 region and to&#xD;
      thereby mimic a natural process in HIV-infected long-term non-progressors (LTNP) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of adjuvant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptide vaccines are poorly immunogenic by themselves. To induce measurable levels of T&#xD;
      helper cell type 1 (Th1) or type 2 (Th2) immune responses against these peptides, an adjuvant&#xD;
      is often required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different adjuvants are to be used in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. GM-CSF which facilitates dendritic cell maturation and migration to the lymph nodes for&#xD;
           antigen presentation. The regimen when using this adjuvant is intradermal&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aluminum-containing adjuvants is well known. They have been administered to human beings&#xD;
           and animals in millions of doses of vaccines. This type of vaccine is usually&#xD;
           administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. In this study intramuscular&#xD;
           administration will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to evaluate the safety of Vacc-C5 at three different dose levels given intradermally&#xD;
      with GM-CSF as adjuvant or given intramuscularly with Alhydrogel as adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate C5-specific humoral immune responses (antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the C5-specific T cell responses by ELISPOT and T cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate T cell activation markers (e.g. CD38, HLA-DR) and other immune markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open, dose-escalating, single centre study in HIV-positive subjects on&#xD;
      treatment (ART). Two different vaccine regimens will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm A: Vacc-C5 with GM-CSF as adjuvant administered intradermally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm B: Vacc-C5 with Alhydrogel as adjuvant administered intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose levels of Vacc-C5 (100, 300 and 900 microgram will be tested for each of the two&#xD;
      vaccination regimen. A dose escalation design (3+3) will be used, and if no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) is detected 18 subjects will be included in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have been HIV-positive and stable on ART for the last 6 months with CD4 cell&#xD;
      counts ≥400x 10 6 /L and who meet the other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible&#xD;
      for the study. The duration of the study is 26 weeks plus a screening period of up to 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Period, all subjects will remain on their ART and receive three&#xD;
      immunizations; at Weeks 1, 2 and 4, with Vacc C5 including either GM-CSF or Alhydrogel as&#xD;
      adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is sequential, meaning that the first three subjects in each arm receive the lowest&#xD;
      dose (three subjects) 100 µg Vacc-C5. If no dose limiting toxicity has been detected after&#xD;
      week 4 vaccination, three more subjects will be added and the next dose level will be&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
