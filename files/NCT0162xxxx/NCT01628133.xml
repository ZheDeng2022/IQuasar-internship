      The purpose of the study is to determine whether packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion&#xD;
      affects intestinal blood flow of premature infants during feedings and if so, whether return&#xD;
      of normal intestinal blood flow pattern occurs within 48 hours of blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal intestinal responses to the feedings (insufficient postprandial blood flow increase&#xD;
      in order to digest given feeding volume or overall decrease of intestinal blood flow) may&#xD;
      predispose infants to feeding intolerance and to serious intestinal disease called&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a relatively common heart condition found in young preterm&#xD;
      infants that can lead to decreased blood flow in different organs, including intestines.&#xD;
      Thus, the determination of the presence or absence of PDA is an important part of the study,&#xD;
      since it can be a relevant confounding variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assess intestinal blood flow by using sonogram to&#xD;
      measure velocity through the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the artery supplying most of&#xD;
      the intestine, both pre- and 45 minutes post feeding. The investigators will also use&#xD;
      echocardiogram to determine the presence or absence of PDA. Each set of measurements will be&#xD;
      done immediately before and after the transfusion, and again 24 and 48 hours after the&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that infants will have attenuated&#xD;
      postprandial blood flow velocities in immediate posttransfusion state when compared to the&#xD;
      pretransfusion values. The investigators further hypothesize that normal, pretransfusion&#xD;
      postprandial blood flow velocities will be achieved 48 hrs after the blood transfusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the death of intestinal tissue. It most often affects&#xD;
      premature or sick babies. NEC occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and the&#xD;
      tissue falls off. NEC is a known complication of prematurity with high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. About 7 to 13% of all very low birth weight infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
      Care Units (NICU) develop NEC, with mortality ranging from 10 to 44% (1,2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEC is considered a multifactorial disorder converging on a common final clinical&#xD;
      presentation associated with several etiologic mechanisms, including ischemia (eg&#xD;
      reperfusion), infection (eg, gut colonization), mechanical injury (eg, viscosity, embolic),&#xD;
      iatrogenic factors (eg catheters, excessive enteral feeding), and immunological barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction (1,13,4,5) To date, there is no single, unifying consensus on causation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly, the association between NEC and Packed Red Blood Cell (PRBC)transfusion has been a&#xD;
      subject of recent debate. Several retrospective studies report increased incidence of NEC 22&#xD;
      hrs (7) or 48-72 hrs after PRBC transfusion (8) and increased odds of NEC development within&#xD;
      48 hrs posttransfusion (9). Singh, measuring the strength of association between the NEC and&#xD;
      PRBC transfusion describes the association as strong &lt; 24hrs, less strong &lt; 48 hrs and absent&#xD;
      at 96 hrs (10). Importantly, the majority of the infants in these studies were stable&#xD;
      premature neonates on full enteral feeds, who decompensated and developed NEC after being&#xD;
      transfused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on poor or no evidence, many NICUs are implementing policy not to feed premature&#xD;
      infants during the blood transfusion (11). A small recent prospective trial (8) reported&#xD;
      decreased incidence of NEC (from 5.3 to 1.3%) when feeds are withheld during the transfusion.&#xD;
      Similarly, the limited investigation of the superior mesenteric artery (blood vessel that&#xD;
      supplies the greatest volume of blood to the intestinal tract) blood flow velocities (SMA&#xD;
      BFV) revealed that the expected post-prandial increase in SMA BFV disappeared following the&#xD;
      PRBC, placing the fed neonates receiving blood transfusion at higher risk for NEC (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial study had several major limitations, such as enrolling larger and more mature&#xD;
      preterm neonates at lesser risk for PRBC transfusion related NEC, excluding infants with&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), common clinical condition in preterm neonates, losing 11 out&#xD;
      of 22 patients for follow up studies (hence &quot;normalization&quot; of post-prandial blood flow&#xD;
      velocities and finding potentially safe time point for feeds reintroduction could not be&#xD;
      suggested by the study results) and using relatively less commonly transfused PRBC volumes&#xD;
      over longer period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators intend to further their understanding of the hemodynamic&#xD;
      consequences of PRBC transfusion in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates by evaluating&#xD;
      pre-and post-prandial SMA BFV in neonates who are not fed during the transfusion at different&#xD;
      time points and correlate those with relevant clinical outcome measures. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that the results from this study will be used by clinicians to help guide them in&#xD;
      making decisions regarding the safety of administering PRBC transfusion in VLBW neonates.&#xD;

        ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) neonates will be studied since morbidities such as transfusion&#xD;

        intolerance most frequently occur in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the need to ensure parental comprehension prior to consent documentation, parents&#xD;
