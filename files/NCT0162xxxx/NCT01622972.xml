  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of Nottingham have been developing new, non-invasive magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) techniques to image the bowel. Building on those studies the investigators want&#xD;
      to study, in healthy volunteers, the effects of purging on the colon. The investigators plan&#xD;
      two studies using their novel MRI techniques in healthy volunteers to demonstrate how doses&#xD;
      of a preparation designed to clean the bowel alters small and large bowel water content and&#xD;
      transit. The investigators will also define the changes induced in colonic microbiota and how&#xD;
      these are linked to changes in transit and the structure of colonic contents. This&#xD;
      experimental model is comparable to an episode of acute diarrhea, therefore this study will&#xD;
      also improve their understanding of the effects of diarrhea on bowel physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following from the above study, the investigators would like to extend this study on patients&#xD;
      who have functional constipation and previously have not responded to conventional laxatives.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine examinations of the colon including colonoscopy and barium enema widely carried out&#xD;
      in clinical practice require evacuation of colonic contents. This is most conveniently&#xD;
      carried out using osmotic laxatives the most widely used preparation being based on&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol such as Moviprep. When fully made up as 1 litre of Moviprep , it provides&#xD;
      100 grams of polyethlene glycol '3350' with a measured osmolarity of around 530 mosmol/l.&#xD;
      Being nonnutrient, this would be expected to rapidly leave the stomach and generate a&#xD;
      substantial inflow of fluid in the upper small intestine as water flows down the osmotic&#xD;
      gradient markedly increasing the small intestinal water content compared with fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous MRI studies using a Mannitol solution of 300 mosmols/l resulted in a small bowel&#xD;
      secretion of fluid increasing total small bowel water to nearly 400 mls after a 300 ml meal.&#xD;
      The investigators would anticipate a much larger increase after the hypertonic Moviprep. The&#xD;
      flush of small bowel fluid induced by mannitol produces a radical change in the heterogeneous&#xD;
      structure of the ascending colon as shown in our recent MRI images of the colon before and&#xD;
      after mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to expectation colonic contents are far from homogenous with a spatially organised&#xD;
      bacterial flora which others have described at a microscopic level which the investigators&#xD;
      are just beginning to demonstrate using their novel MRI techniques. The colon should be&#xD;
      regarded as a complex bioreactor which is spatially highly organised with a mucous layer&#xD;
      overlying the enterocytes, the outer layer of mucus containing a germinal layer with bacteria&#xD;
      which reseed the bioreactor when it is purged. The rate of recovery after purgation with&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol is said to be normally rapid as the intact germinal layer rapidly&#xD;
      recolonises but slower in certain patient groups though data is very limited as yet. The&#xD;
      anecdotal yet persuasive patient accounts of improvement in bowel function after colonic&#xD;
      lavage suggest that the reconstituted microbiota may be different, though this has yet to be&#xD;
      studied using modern techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently the investigators have had no way of noninvasive imaging this complex&#xD;
      structure but recent developments of high resolution MRI in Nottingham show that this is now&#xD;
      feasible. Pilot data demonstrates that purging removes the heterogeneous three dimensional&#xD;
      structure leaving homogeneous fluid contents with an intense proton signal. Just how this&#xD;
      impacts on the colonic microbiota is as yet unknown as there have been no studies to date&#xD;
      combining these novel approaches with new techniques now available for assessing the&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early culture-based assessments identify only a minority of all the faecal organisms present&#xD;
      and it is only in the last decade that methods based on assessment of microbial DNA have&#xD;
      evolved to make it possible to describe the full complexity of the faecal microbiota. PCR of&#xD;
      the highly conserved 16s ribosomal RNA gene shows the microbiota of individuals to be highly&#xD;
      complex and individualised. Similarity indices show similarities of around two thirds over a&#xD;
      7 week period in healthy controls while those developing acute diarrhoea due to radiation&#xD;
      enteritis show a marked reduction to just 26%. Similarly, HITChip analysis showed that&#xD;
      subjects with IBS had an unstable microbiota that was stabilised following a probiotic&#xD;
      intervention trial that improved the IBS symptom score. These techniques have yet to be&#xD;
      applied to subjects undergoing bowel purgation. Moreover, there are novel approaches to&#xD;
      identify the viability of the microbiota such as the use of specific probes that allow&#xD;
      discrimination between intact, damaged and dead cells in fecal samples.&#xD;
