  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: That there is a significant central pain component in a distinct subset of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis(KOA), Chronic low back pain(CLBP), painful&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy(PDN.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis # 2: To establish a reliable strategy for differentiation of central pain&#xD;
      predominant from peripheral pain predominant knee osteoarthritis(KOA), chronic low back&#xD;
      pain(CLBP)and peripheral diabetic neuropathy(PDN) patients using clinical features,&#xD;
      experimental pain testing and magnetic resonance(MR) Spectroscopy.&#xD;

      This study will identify clinical and neuroimaging markers in chronic pain in an effort to&#xD;
      provide individual-based treatments. This study will differentiate chronic pain subjects&#xD;
      (knee osteoarthritis, low back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy) into two groups: those&#xD;
      who have central pain predominant symptoms and those who have peripheral pain predominant&#xD;
      symptoms. The response to medical treatment between these two groups is quite different, thus&#xD;
      a reliable strategy to correctly categorize chronic pain sufferers offers the opportunity to&#xD;
      provide targeted, effective treatments. Chronic pain is a prevalent problem in the VA veteran&#xD;
      population with significant associated costs; in particular knee osteoarthritis, chronic low&#xD;
      back pain and painful diabetic neuropathy are common in this population. The proposed study&#xD;
      will use different clinical pain tests and advanced neuroimaging techniques to improve our&#xD;
      understanding of chronic pain and improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
