  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogenous disease. Different patients have different presentations, course of&#xD;
      disease and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to study our population of more severe asthma and find out about&#xD;
      their profile - demographic, clinical and inflammatory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder presenting with many phenotypes. Most asthmatics have mild&#xD;
      to moderate disease. However, 5-20% of asthmatics belong to the &quot;Difficult-to-treat&quot; or more&#xD;
      severe group and they account for 50-80% of asthma health care costs. In a tertiary hospital&#xD;
      like Singapore General Hospital, most of our asthmatics belong to the more severe group. They&#xD;
      have more frequent healthcare visits, hospitalizations, medication use and higher risks of&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no local data on the phenotypic profile of our patients. Asthma phenotypes&#xD;
      which have been identified include those related to triggers ( eg. drugs such as aspirin or&#xD;
      NSAIDS, environmental allergen, occupational allergens or irritants, exercise) or clinical&#xD;
      physiological phenotypes ( eg. severity-defined, exacerbation-prone, chronic airflow&#xD;
      limitation, steroid-resistant, age -of -onset) or inflammatory phenotypes ( eg. eosinophilic,&#xD;
      neutrophilic, pauci granulocytic, mixed). With better understanding of their phenotypes,&#xD;
      treatment can then be individually tailored to improve their asthma control and reduce future&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to improve the understanding of this group of asthmatics such that better treatment&#xD;
      approaches can be developed in the future. This is not a clinical trial. Its purpose is to&#xD;
      gather information ranging from demographic data, medical history to responses to simple&#xD;
      routine questions, to lung function, inflammation, allergy and blood testing results. The&#xD;
      data are analyzed to improve our understanding of the clinical and inflammatory phenotypes (&#xD;
      or profiles) in this group of patients.&#xD;
