  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery with or without lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer that has too many of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#xD;
      on its cells and has spread to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy&#xD;
      that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery together with lapatinib&#xD;
      ditosylate is an effective treatment for brain metastasis from breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if there is a signal for an increase in complete response (CR) rate in the&#xD;
      measurable brain metastases at 12 weeks post radiation therapy (RT) (whole brain or&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) as determined by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scan of&#xD;
      the brain, with the addition of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) to whole-brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy (WBRT)/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate CR rate of the measurable brain metastases at 4 weeks post RT (WBRT/SRS) as&#xD;
      determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to&#xD;
      WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate objective response rate of measurable brain metastases at 4 and 12 weeks post&#xD;
      RT (WBRT/SRS) as determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to&#xD;
      WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific objective response rate (CR + partial response&#xD;
      [PR]) at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate central nervous system (CNS) progressive disease outside the targeted&#xD;
      measurable disease with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific progression at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate treatment related adverse events when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared&#xD;
      to WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate overall CNS complete response: disappearance of all CNS target lesions&#xD;
      sustained for at least 4 weeks; with no new lesions, no use of corticosteroids, and patient&#xD;
      is stable or improved clinically, when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate overall CNS progressive disease (within or outside targeted measurable&#xD;
      disease) with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To evaluate overall survival when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks for a total of 15 treatments or SRS&#xD;
      for 1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo WBRT or SRS as in Arm A. Patients also receive lapatinib ditosylate&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

          <title>Graded Prognostic Assessment for Breast Cancer (Breast-GPA)</title>
          <description>Breast-GPA is defined by the combination of prognostic factors: breast tumor subtype, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and age. Breast tumor subtype consists of the presence/absence of each of the following biomarkers: estrogen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and progesterone receptor. A lower GPA is associated with worse survival; a higher GPA is associated with better survival.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate in the Brain Using the RECIST 1.1 Criteria Based on Brain MRI</title>
        <description>The RECIST criteria evaluates changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions. Objective response is defined as a complete or partial response. Complete response is defined as the complete disappearance of all enhancing disease and off all steroids. Partial response is defined as ≥ 30% reduction in the sum of diameters of up to 2 of the largest target lesions. Rate is calculated by dividing the number of patients with objective response by the number of analyzable patients.</description>

        <description>The RECIST criteria evaluates changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions. CNS progressive disease outside the targeted measureable disease was determined by a retrospective central review of MRI scans by the study neuroradiology co-chair and is defined as the first occurrence since baseline of new lesions or progression of non-target lesions. Time to CNS progressive disease is defined as time from randomization to the date of progressive disease, last known follow-up (censored), or death (competing risk). Progression rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. One-year rates are provided.</description>

        <title>Overall Complete Response Rate in the Brain Using the RECIST 1.1 Criteria Based on Brain MRI</title>
        <description>The RECIST criteria evaluates changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions. Overall complete response is defined as the complete disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; with no new lesions, no use of corticosteroids, and patient is stable or improved clinically. All site-reported MRI data and all site-reporting of clinical progressive disease indicators were used in this analysis. Rate is calculated by dividing the number of participants with overall complete response by the number of analyzable participants.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. MRIs occurred at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks post RT, then every 12 weeks thereafter until progression. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 71.6 months.</time_frame>

        <title>Overall Progression Rate in the Brain Using the RECIST 1.1 Criteria Based on Brain MRI</title>
        <description>The RECIST criteria evaluates changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions.
