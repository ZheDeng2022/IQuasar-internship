  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center and competitive enrollment study of ALT-801&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine for patients who have BCG failure (defined as refractory, relapsing&#xD;
      or intolerant), non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and refuse or are not medically fit to&#xD;
      undergo a radical cystectomy recommended by the participating urologist as the standard next&#xD;
      therapy per urologic guidelines. The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a well-tolerated dose level of ALT-801, to determine the Recommended Dose&#xD;
      level (RD) and characterize the immunogenicity of ALT-801 combined with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      treated patients. The anti-tumor responses will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States with an estimated 71,000&#xD;
      new cases and approximately 14,000 deaths in 2009. Bladder cancer is also the costliest to&#xD;
      treat per patient of all cancers, with annual direct medical expenditures in excess of $3.7&#xD;
      billion in the United States. This is largely because approximately 70% of all new cases of&#xD;
      bladder cancer present as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), which tends to recur,&#xD;
      requiring repeated interventions and long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMIBC tumors are usually treated by surgical resection and intravesical chemotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Immunotherapy usually consists of intravesical administration of Bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Recent studies suggest that BCG is superior in terms of efficacy and&#xD;
      decreasing disease recurrence compared to other therapies. Although the mechanism of action&#xD;
      for BCG therapy leading to clinical efficacy is unclear, macrophages, T lymphocytes and&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells are implicated as the critical mediators of the anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response. Consequently, BCG is associated with significant toxicity, and approximately 20% of&#xD;
      patients fail to complete the course of therapy. In addition, as many as 30% of patients&#xD;
      either fail to respond to therapy or suffer disease recurrence within 5 years. Of these, 30%&#xD;
      will eventually die of bladder cancer and 50% will undergo radical cystectomy. Thus, a novel&#xD;
      therapy, either as first-line or salvage therapy, is desperately needed for NMIBC to prevent&#xD;
      disease progression and allow for bladder preservation to preserve quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. Alternatively, a novel therapy that moderates the significant and often&#xD;
      treatment-limiting side effects of BCG immunotherapy is also warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, immunotherapy is a well-established approach for treating other cancer types.&#xD;
      One strategy that has received attention is treatment with cytokines such as IL-2 to enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunity. IL-2 has been implicated as playing a pivotal role in the efficacy of&#xD;
      BCG treatment of patients with NMIBC. Studies have demonstrated that a direct IL-2&#xD;
      intervention could be of benefit to patients who are refractory or resistant to BCG&#xD;
      treatment. Unfortunately, the considerable toxicity associated with this treatment makes it&#xD;
      difficult to achieve an effective dose at the site of the tumor and limits the population&#xD;
      that can be treated. Thus, there is a critical need for innovative strategies that enhance&#xD;
      the effects of IL-2, to reduce its toxicity without compromising clinical benefit, and to&#xD;
      treat other diagnoses including NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2; ProleukinÂ®) is an approved agent for the treatment of adults&#xD;
      with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In particular, high dose intravenous&#xD;
      IL-2 treatment has demonstrated durable objective response rate in these indications.&#xD;
      However, the major toxicities associated with this regimen have precluded its widespread&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altor Bioscience Corp. has developed a tumor-targeted IL-2 fusion protein, ALT-801,&#xD;
      comprising human recombinant IL-2 genetically linked to a TCR domain capable of binding a&#xD;
      tumor associated human p53 peptide presented in the context of HLA-A2. Animal studies have&#xD;
      indicated that ALT-801 could be useful in a therapeutic approach for activating immune&#xD;
      effector cells, bringing together effector cells and tumor cells and stimulating immune&#xD;
      cell-mediated activity. In addition, pre-clinical studies of ALT-801 in an NMIBC tumor model&#xD;
      indicate that ALT-801 monotherapy may provide clinical benefit to patients with NMIBC.&#xD;
      Various mouse xenograft models also demonstrate that ALT-801 increases the efficacy but&#xD;
      lessens the side effects of high-dose rhIL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the results of a concluded phase I clinical study of a monotherapy with ALT-801 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic malignancies indicate that ALT-801 given daily for two 4-day cycles&#xD;
      at a dose level of 0.04 mg/kg is well tolerated, exhibits a favorable PK drug profile and&#xD;
      immunological potency, and provides clinical benefit in cancer patients. Also, a higher&#xD;
      dosing level (0.08 mg/kg) of ALT-801 was associated with better clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, ALT-801 will be evaluated as to whether it can prevent disease&#xD;
      progression and allow for bladder preservation to maintain the quality of life for patients&#xD;
      with BCG failure, defined as refractory, relapsing or intolerant, non-muscle invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer who refuse or are not medically fit to undergo a radical cystectomy recommended by the&#xD;
      participating urologist as the standard next therapy per urologic guidelines.&#xD;
