  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other gynecologic malignancy. The majority&#xD;
      of patients are diagnosed with Stage III-IV disease. Nearly 80% of these patients will recur&#xD;
      resulting in 5-year survival rates of 14-32%. Although enrollment is increasing in hospice,&#xD;
      hospice programs have been challenged to reach eligible patients. Several factors limit the&#xD;
      number of people who enroll in hospice and the length of their hospice stay. Prognostication&#xD;
      challenges and the increasing availability of cancer therapies for people with cancer set the&#xD;
      stage for a mismatch between certification of a 6 month prognosis and contemporary medical&#xD;
      care. Additionally patients often are not aware of hospice and the services they can provide.&#xD;

      In this study, we will pilot-test a technology-based approach for women with Stage III/IV or&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian cancer, their caregiver, and their providers to assist in and study the&#xD;
      decision-making process that surrounds end-of-life decisions, specifically, opting for&#xD;
      palliative care and/or entry into hospice care. We will randomize the women and their&#xD;
      caregivers into either our intervention or control websites. All subjects will complete a&#xD;
      battery of demographic, psychosocial, health status and outcomes, health information, and&#xD;
      decision making measures at baseline and 60-day post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant has completed the baseline survey, he/she will be automatically brought&#xD;
      to their assigned website. Both the patient and their caregiver will be assigned the same&#xD;
      group (intervention or control). All participants will have open access to their respective&#xD;
      study websites for a minimum of 60 days. During enrollment, participants will agree to access&#xD;
      their respective websites at least 2-3 times per week. Both patients and caregivers assigned&#xD;
      to the control arm will view a website containing documents generally provided as part of the&#xD;
      usual care. They will be requested to log in with the same frequency as the intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
