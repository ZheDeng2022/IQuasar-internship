  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine whether retraining via operation inspection or verbal education can reduce the&#xD;
      risk for peritonitis in PD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is prospective, randomized, controlled study. At baseline (during the first&#xD;
      month), they will receive a standard training program on performing bag exchange and&#xD;
      education on the prevention of peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the participants will be randomized into three groups: retraining via operation&#xD;
      inspection (G1), retraining via verbal education (G2) and usual care (G3). Retraining will be&#xD;
      performed every 2 months in G1 and G2 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following 2 years or a longer period, all the participants will be followed up&#xD;
      frequently with outcome events recorded.&#xD;

    <description>During retraining the patients performed bag exchange under the supervision of a nurse. The nurse ensured that each error listed in the NAC form should be avoided, thus immediately corrected any wrong steps if only.</description>

    <description>Patients in the oral education group also underwent retraining every 2 months. A nurse would address all items in the NAC form one by one, to remind the patient of the key points of bag exchange. Scores calculated by the sum of error items during the bag exchange for patients in technique inspection group, or by the sum of &quot;yes&quot; in the interactive quiz for patients in verbal education group.</description>

    <description>Retraining via operation inspection means that nurses check if patients can follow the taught skill during the procedure of bag exchange and correct wrong steps in one-to-one way every 2 months.&#xD;
Retraining via verbal education means that nurses remind patients of key points of bag exchange through interactive quiz derived from above checklist every 2 months till 24 months</description>
