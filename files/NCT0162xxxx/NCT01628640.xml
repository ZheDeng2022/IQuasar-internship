      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis&#xD;
      virus expressing interferon beta in treating patients with liver cancer or solid tumors with&#xD;
      lesions that have spread to other parts of the body and do not respond to treatment. The&#xD;
      study virus has a gene inserted into it which will allow production of interferon beta, which&#xD;
      is a substance that will restrict the spread of the virus to tumor cells and not healthy&#xD;
      cells. It will also have some independent anti-cancer activity. Although the primary goal of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety of delivery of this viral agent to people, patients may&#xD;
      benefit clinically by having shrinkage or stabilization of their tumor or reduction in their&#xD;
      cancer related symptoms (e.g., pain). Funding Source - FDA OOPD.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant vesicular stomatitis&#xD;
      virus-expressing interferon-beta (VSV-IFN-beta) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) refractory or intolerant to sorafenib therapy and patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      with liver predominant locally advanced/metastatic treatment refractory disease. (Arm A) II.&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors with subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions. (Arm B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the tumor response rate, injected lesion (TNi) and distant lesion (TNd)&#xD;
      necrosis rate (with TNi and TNd response defined as &gt;= 30% increase in necrosis from&#xD;
      baseline) and overall survival. (Arm A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with HCC by or&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors with liver predominant disease or subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions by&#xD;
      measurement of VSV-IFN-beta in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFN-beta by way of measuring serum&#xD;
      interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFN-beta listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-hIFN-beta specific) and natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess status of human interferon beta pathway pre/post therapy in tumor/normal liver&#xD;
      tissue (status of IFN-beta, interferon stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3 complex constituting&#xD;
      signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/2 and p48 (ISGF3 gamma)]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess phosphorylation of STAT1/2 post-therapy. VI. Evaluate transcription of interferon&#xD;
      mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-related&#xD;
      apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL], 2'-5' oligoadenylate/ribonucleic acid [RNA]se L proteins,&#xD;
      heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility class antigens and interferon&#xD;
      regulatory factor [IRF]-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Assess presence of VSV in tumor/normal liver subsequent to administration of VSV-human&#xD;
      IFN-beta (hIFN- beta).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. For HCC patients only, assess preliminary relationships between hepatitis C genotype&#xD;
      (in those patients that are hepatitis C positive) and any evidence of anti-tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or advanced solid tumor with liver lesions&#xD;
      receive recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta intratumorally in a&#xD;
      single tumor location on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients with advanced solid tumor with subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions receive&#xD;
      recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta intratumorally in up to 5&#xD;
      lesions on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 3 years.&#xD;
