  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is a next-generation integrase inhibitor (INI) currently in&#xD;
      phase 3 clinical trials for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fixed-dose combinations&#xD;
      (FDCs) have greatly simplified the treatment of patients with HIV. While Atripla (an FDC of&#xD;
      tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) and efavirenz (EFV)) has become the preferred first line&#xD;
      regimen due in large part to its convenient presentation as a full treatment regimen in a&#xD;
      single product, other options are needed. A fixed-dose combination of DTG/abacavir&#xD;
      (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) is one such opportunity. Part A of this study will be a single-dose,&#xD;
      two-treatment crossover pivotal bioequivalence (BE) evaluation of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet&#xD;
      in 66 healthy subjects. The reference formulations in this trial will be the 50 mg DTG tablet&#xD;
      that is currently being used in the Phase 3 clinical trials and the already marketed FDC&#xD;
      tablet product EPZICOM™ (ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg).It is intended that the results of this&#xD;
      pivotal bioequivalence study will show that the proposed commercial DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet&#xD;
      formulation is bioequivalent to DTG plus EPZICOM administered as separate tablets. Part B of&#xD;
      this study will evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the FDC tablet in 12 healthy&#xD;
      subjects that have already participated in Part A of the study. There will be a screening&#xD;
      visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and a follow up visit within 7-14&#xD;
      days after the last dose. There will be a 7 day washout between doses in each treatment&#xD;
      period. The following PK parameters for DTG, ABC and 3TC will be measured: area under the&#xD;
      concentration curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time&#xD;
      (AUC(0-infinity)), Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the&#xD;
      time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC (0-t)), maximum observed concentration&#xD;
      (Cmax), lag time before observation of drug concentrations (tlag), time of occurrence of Cmax&#xD;
      (tmax), terminal phase half-life (t½), terminal elimination phase rate constant (λz),&#xD;
      percentage of AUC obtained by extrapolation (%AUCex),apparent clearance following oral dosing&#xD;
      (CL/F) and apparent terminal phase volume&#xD;
