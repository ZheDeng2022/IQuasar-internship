      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The risk for becoming addicted to drugs varies among individual, even those using similar&#xD;
      drugs in a similar way. It is not known why some people become addicted and others do not.&#xD;
      Studies suggest that some genes may increase the risk of addiction. Negative life experiences&#xD;
      may also affect the risk of addiction. Researchers want to test smokers and nonsmokers to&#xD;
      study genetic and brain function traits that may lead to drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand brain function in people who may be at a higher risk of drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smokers (10 to 30 cigarettes per day for more than 2 years) and nonsmokers will be&#xD;
           eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will be&#xD;
           tested for drug and alcohol use. A blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve one visit. Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the visit, participants will answer questions about their health and drug use habits.&#xD;
           They will then be trained on the tasks they will do during the MRI scan. After the&#xD;
           training, they will have the scan and perform the tasks. The scan and tasks will look at&#xD;
           brain function related to rewards and impulsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other computer tests will be given after the scan. These tests will measure learning,&#xD;
           memory, and impulsiveness.&#xD;

      Background: Even under similar drug use patterns, the risk for drug addiction varies from&#xD;
      individual to individual. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this variability&#xD;
      are poorly understood and characterized. Studies suggest that certain traits observed in&#xD;
      substance dependent individuals may actually precede drug use, and could augur future&#xD;
      substance dependence. Understanding how the presence of these traits increases vulnerability&#xD;
      to substance addiction could aid in the development of early intervention, preventative&#xD;
      measures, as well as better treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary goal of this protocol is to improve our understanding of increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to developing substance addiction. We focus here on particular gene x&#xD;
      environment interactions as increased risk factors for substance dependence. The emphasis is&#xD;
      on monoaminergic neurotransmitter-related genes thought to influence adaptability to the&#xD;
      environment, and, therefore, on cognitive domains related to dopamine and serotonin: reward&#xD;
      and punishment learning, and impulse control. To achieve the above objective, the study will&#xD;
      be implemented by using cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging testing in adult addicted&#xD;
      individuals along with matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: We focus on adult (18-55 years old) smokers and matched non-smoking&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: This study involves cognitive, pharmacological and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) testing in a between-subject design involving neuroimaging and&#xD;
      cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be BOLD fMRI activation and behavioral&#xD;
      performance on various cognitive tasks that deal with impulse control and reward learning, as&#xD;
      a function of gene x environment interactions.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) while sitting at or below the following values&#xD;
        after five min rest: Systolic BP (SBP) 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) 90 mm Hg, heart rate&#xD;
        (HR) 100 bpm;&#xD;
