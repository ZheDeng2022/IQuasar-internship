  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the research is to study how individuals who wear cochlear implants&#xD;
      process sounds in noisy environments and also whether newly designed programs can help&#xD;
      improve the communicative ability of cochlear implant patients in noisy situations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implants have been successful in restoring partial hearing to profoundly deaf&#xD;
      people. Despite their success, most implant patients are not able to communicate in noisy&#xD;
      environments (e.g., in a restaurant). Communicating in noise still remains one of the biggest&#xD;
      challenges in cochlear implants. Little is known about the factors that contribute to the&#xD;
      poor performance of CI users in noise. In this project, we propose a series of experiments&#xD;
      aimed at isolating these factors. We propose new programs that can be tailored for noisy&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Post-lingually deafened adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unilateral or bilateral Nucleus implant users (this includes all three&#xD;
                  generations of the Nucleus system, i.e., CI22, CI24 and CI24R).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With or without residual hearing in the contralateral ear. Subjects may use&#xD;
                  amplification (hearing aid) in the opposite or same ear as the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A minimum test score of 30% in tape-recorded open-set sentence recognition scores&#xD;
                  (e.g., spondee identification).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum of 6 months experience with their implant device. This is done to ensure&#xD;
                  that all patients are familiar with the hearing sensations perceived by a&#xD;
                  cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum number of active electrodes: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum number of subjects for each test site: 5&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prelingually and perilingually deafened adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unilateral or bilateral Nucleus implant users.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With or without residual hearing in the contralateral ear. Subjects may use&#xD;
                  amplification (hearing aid) in the opposite or same ear as the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A minimum test score of 10% in tape-recorded open-set sentence recognition scores&#xD;
                  (e.g., spondee identification).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum of 6 months experience with their implant device. This is done to ensure&#xD;
                  that all patients are familiar with the hearing sensations perceived by a&#xD;
                  cochlear implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum number of active electrodes: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum number of subjects for each test site: 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hearing loss of neural or central origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of cochlear or VIII nerve development&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of systemic condition which would preclude use of a cochlear implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active middle ear infection/tympanic membrane perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significantly abnormal cognitive function, as determined by case history information&#xD;
             and/or clinical observations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant psychiatric disorder, as determined by case history information and/or&#xD;
             clinical observations&#xD;
