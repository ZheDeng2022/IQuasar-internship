        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 20-35 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English as primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a minimum of a high school degree (note that GED is not sufficient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of Child-bearing Potential (FOCP) must have a negative urine or serum beta HCG&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening. FOCP must abstain from sexual activity that could result&#xD;
             in a pregnancy, or use acceptable contraceptives throughout the period of study&#xD;
             treatment exposure and for 30 days after the last study treatment. Acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptives include IUDs, hormonal contraceptives (oral, implanted or injectable)&#xD;
             and double barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel). If&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives are used, the period of use must be sufficiently long to&#xD;
             achieve pharmacological effectiveness prior to study treatment exposure (refer to&#xD;
             individual product information for details on onset of effectiveness). FOCP who are&#xD;
             not currently sexually active, must agree to use acceptable contraception, as defined&#xD;
             above, if they decide to become sexually active during the period of study treatment&#xD;
             exposure and for thirty days thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good physical and mental health based on a general medical, mental health&#xD;
             questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate visual, auditory and cognitive ability to complete the assessments within the&#xD;
             Normal range (i.e., no more than 1 standard deviation below the mean for the subject's&#xD;
             age and years of education).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all requirements defined within this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to obtain at least 7 hours of nighttime sleep during the evenings prior to&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior to visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to avoid alcohol for 24 hours prior to visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from caffeine after midnight prior to visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate daily user of caffeine (approximately 1-4 cups of coffee or equivalent per&#xD;
             day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current Axis I or Axis II comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or other symptomatic&#xD;
             manifestations that, in the opinion of the examining physician (Investigator), will&#xD;
             contraindicate treatment with caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI ≤ 19 or ≥ 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug dependence or substance use disorder based upon DSM-IV-TR criteria&#xD;
             (excluding nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug or alcohol drug test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Users of nicotine products within 30 days of screening or during the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking any over the counter or prescription medications other than birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as allergic rhinitis or severe cold),&#xD;
             disability, or other condition that might confound the results of rating tests&#xD;
             administered in the study or that might increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the&#xD;
             subject will be excluded if he or she has any additional conditions that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would preclude the subject from completing the study or would&#xD;
             not be in the best interest of the subject. This would include any significant illness&#xD;
             or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in an investigational study or received an investigational drug within&#xD;
             the past 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who do not maintain a routine nighttime sleep schedule (no shift work).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women, or women planning to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension or other chronic medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable for enrollment in this study for any&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been diagnosed with phenylketonuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnea, primary or secondary insomnia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known pre-existing medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a fasting glucose of &gt;110 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an allergy to wheat, soy, nuts or any other food.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has Kosher or Halal dietary restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reports never eating biscuits, cookies or crackers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥ 12 at screening (i.e., evidence of excessive daytime&#xD;
             sleepiness).&#xD;
