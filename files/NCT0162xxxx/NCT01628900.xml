    <textblock>
      The prevalence of acute pyelonephritis (PNA) is 60-75 000/year. They are traditionally&#xD;
      classified as uncomplicated (60-65%) and complicated. If it is assumed that the uncomplicated&#xD;
      PNA can be treated as outpatients with a cure rate of over 80%, the second group is very&#xD;
      heterogeneous. Some patients are severely infected. But others, despite an older age,&#xD;
      structural urologic abnormalities or a controlled history, have no risk factors and can be&#xD;
      simply managed. The investigators propose to reclassify the PNA into 3 categories:&#xD;
      uncomplicated PNA (PNA-1), the PNA of moderate severity (PNA-2), the major PNA (PNA-3) to&#xD;
      test whether the PNA-2 can benefit from the same outpatient care that the PNA-1. The&#xD;
      existence of biological markers of the severity of bacterial infections would further support&#xD;
      a tailored approach. The pro-adrenomedullin (pro-ADM), successfully tested to identify severe&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia, is a an interesting candidate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Europe and North America, urinary tract infections (UTI) are the 2nd largest&#xD;
      community-acquired infections. In the U.S., the number of annual doctor's consultations for&#xD;
      UTI is estimated at 8 million and that of women's APN to 250,000. In Britain, an estimated&#xD;
      number of 62 of 1000 women consult for UTI annually. Extrapolated to France, these figures&#xD;
      would be 5-6 million annual consultations and 60 to 75 000 APN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APN is an infection associated with urinary and pelvic and / or the renal parenchyma, marked&#xD;
      by fever ≥ 38.5 ° C, spontaneous pain flank, pain caused to the cost vertebral angle and a&#xD;
      positive urine dipstick (BU). Conversely, pain and fever can be reduced and 30% of PNA is as&#xD;
      cystitis, a history of PNA is then so evocative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without a precise technology to detect possible renal micro-abscesses, scars of any APN,&#xD;
      direct evidence of upper tract infection is rarely made. Positive blood cultures (30-50%of&#xD;
      cases) are indirect evidence. In most cases, only infection of urine is affirmed by&#xD;
      cyto-bacteriological examination (urinalysis), which results are available 48-72 hours after&#xD;
      culturing. It is assumed that urine culture is positive when leukocyte's count is ≥ 104 cells&#xD;
      per milliliter (GB / ml) and bacteriuria ≥ 105 colony forming unit (CFU) / ml of urine&#xD;
      (maximum two) uropathogen germ. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of PNA are probabilistic&#xD;
      in the beginning, hence the interest of the BU. It is considered positive when the leukocyte&#xD;
      count is ≥ 10 ± GB/mm3 with ± nitriturie. Done correctly, it has a positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV) of 74% and NPV of 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically there are two types of PNA, the complicated PNA and the non-complicated PNA,&#xD;
      opposed by age, sex, severity, causative organisms and their sensitivity to antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncomplicated PNA is the best defined. It occurs on a normal urinary tract in nonpregnant&#xD;
      women, aged 15 to 65, with no systemic disease or urological surgery. It is not accompanied&#xD;
      with by septic shock or renal abscesses. It is due to E. Coli in 90% of cases, sometimes to&#xD;
      Klebsiella and Proteus sp, all susceptible to recommended antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its overall cure rate, defined as bacterial eradication and disappearance of signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, observed in three visits over 6 weeks follow-up, is ≥ 80% treated at home or in&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other PNA, traditionally described as complicated, are not very well defined. It includes the&#xD;
      PNA with septic shock, abscess or renal failure, the PNA in old women or in men. It also&#xD;
      ranks the PNA occurring in urinary tract malformations, whether or not it has an impact in&#xD;
      renal function (bifid pelvis or ureter, renal cyst). In all cases, the evolution is assumed&#xD;
      less simple than that of PNA of young women without being unavoidably complicated. But there&#xD;
      is no tool to measure the impact of chronic conditions on a PNA which degree of infection is&#xD;
      not very severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the evolutionary potential of these various categories of PNA would&#xD;
      adapt the therapeutic management. Different parameters would help this approach including the&#xD;
      duration of antibiotic therapy, the place of care (home or hospital) and in this case, the&#xD;
      optimal duration of hospitalization. It is recognized that the uncomplicated PNA in young&#xD;
      women can be treated immediately at home by a single oral antibiotic for 7 days. For other&#xD;
      categories of PNA, there generally recommend hospitalization to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, which should not be less than two weeks. The benefit of this therapeutic&#xD;
      approach is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of the traditional terminology &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;uncomplicated&quot; the investigators&#xD;
      propose a new classification into three categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-severe or mild PNA, corresponding to the uncomplicated PNA (PNA-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PNA of moderate severity, including less intense infectious syndrome which occurs on a&#xD;
           chronic, stable and controlled disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PNA with severe sepsis, septic shock or hemodynamic instability and / or immediately&#xD;
           complicated by the fact of the presence of altered and / or progressive chronic disease&#xD;
           with risk to decompensate (PNA-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective observational study in 34 French emergency services, 211 patients meeting&#xD;
      PNA criteria were included in two weeks. They were divided into 62.5% of PNA-1, 24.6% of&#xD;
      PNA-2 and 12.7% of PNA-3. This classification reflects the initial severity of the infection&#xD;
      and the subsequent evolutionary potential, can distinguish a class 2. This differs from the&#xD;
      other two by the lack of severity of the infection which it shares with the class 1 and by&#xD;
      the existence of factors such as age or male, stable disease or abnormalities structural&#xD;
      urological without systemic impact. The evolutionary potential risk associated with these&#xD;
      factors, independent of the ITU, has never been measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is whether patients with a PNA-2 should be treated as a benign PNA or PNA with&#xD;
      risk of further complications. The Infectious Diseases Society of America offers two&#xD;
      treatment possibilities for these patients, and whose effectiveness has never been compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment at home with oral monotherapy, preferably a fluoroquinolone (FQ) for 7 days,&#xD;
           as for a PNA-1,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Or starting parenteral antibiotics followed by 12 to 24 hours of observation in&#xD;
           short-term hospitalization unit (UHCD) before deciding if: return to home or prolong&#xD;
           hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the prognosis of ANP is mainly related to the severity of initial&#xD;
      infection and very secondarily to history or related conditions as they are controllable and&#xD;
      little or no decompensated. In fact, the table being mild infection in the NAP-1 and NAP-2,&#xD;
      they differ only by demographic factors (age, sex) or a history little influence on&#xD;
      evolution. These two categories of PNA should logically receive the same support. To support&#xD;
      this hypothesis, the investigators propose a controlled intervention trial in which the PNA-2&#xD;
      will be randomized between two treatment strategies, one of which corresponds to the&#xD;
      management of PNA-1, to demonstrate their prognostic similarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this a priori classification, clinical data of the study will be used to&#xD;
      construct a prognostic score. To this end, the investigators intend to measure the&#xD;
      pro-adrenomedullin (pro-ADM) to all patients. Adrenomedullin, a powerful natural&#xD;
      vasodilator,has also immunomodulatory and bactericidal properties which explain the increase&#xD;
      OF ADM serum levels in severe systemic infections. However, the dosage is difficult because&#xD;
      of its short half-life in blood. One of its degradation products, the pro-ADM, reflecting&#xD;
      active ADM, is more stable and easily measurable. The dosage of pro-ADM has recently allowed&#xD;
      the reliable assessment of individual prognosis of septic patients, particularly in the&#xD;
      context of community-acquired pneumonia, the leading cause of death from infection. Although&#xD;
      the pro-ADM is mainly used to predict the prognosis and that death is a rare complication of&#xD;
      PNA community, the investigators will test its ability to distinguish between hospitalized&#xD;
      PNA patients and outpatient. pro-ADM will be tested to improve the performance of the&#xD;
      prognostic score.&#xD;
