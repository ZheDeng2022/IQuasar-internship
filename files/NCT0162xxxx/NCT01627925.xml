      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is a frequently occurring complication during induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) closed claim analysis of&#xD;
      anesthesia complications indicate that a difficult airway is one of the most challenging&#xD;
      scenarios continuously facing anesthesia providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Posterior displacement&#xD;
      of soft palate, tongue and epiglottis are believed to be the primary contributing factors.&#xD;
      Obesity is well known to be an essential characteristic which reflects propensity to UAO. The&#xD;
      mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction&#xD;
      observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients&#xD;
      with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have&#xD;
      a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators hypotheses that&#xD;
      nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on&#xD;
      maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is an unpredictable and frequently occurring complication&#xD;
      during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients ( BMI&gt;30 km/ m2) are more&#xD;
      vulnerable to develop airway obstruction either during sleep or under anesthesia, and the&#xD;
      segment of obese individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway&#xD;
      management under anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event&#xD;
      related to difficult airway management under anesthesia is &quot;cannot intubate, cannot&#xD;
      ventilate&quot;. Unfortunately, even with modern technologic advances, 16% of death and permanent&#xD;
      brain damage related to anesthesia have been attributed to failure of difficult airway&#xD;
      management 3. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) closed claim analysis of&#xD;
      anesthesia complications indicate that a difficult airway is one of the most challenging&#xD;
      scenarios continuously facing anesthesia providers. Indeed, it can be a fatal complication of&#xD;
      general anesthesia. Therefore, measures used to reduce the incidence of difficult airways&#xD;
      during anesthesia remain to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Posterior displacement&#xD;
      of soft palate, tongue and epiglottis are believed to be the primary contributing factors.&#xD;
      Obesity is well known to be an essential characteristic which reflects propensity to UAO.&#xD;
      Accordingly, obese patients are a high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and&#xD;
      prone to develop progressively narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue&#xD;
      volume surrounding the pharyngeal airway. More and more evidence indicates that the mechanism&#xD;
      of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction observed&#xD;
      during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via&#xD;
      nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA,&#xD;
      if they can tolerate it. Under anesthesia, tolerance should not be an issue as the patient is&#xD;
      anesthetized. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients&#xD;
      have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators hypotheses&#xD;
      that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on&#xD;
      maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia.&#xD;
