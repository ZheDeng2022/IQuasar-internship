    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sunitinib is drug that is approved for treating various types of cancers, including kidney&#xD;
      cancers. However, it has not been approved to treat cancers of the thymus. Sunitinib works by&#xD;
      blocking proteins that are responsible for cell division and growth. Some of these proteins&#xD;
      can be found on thymus cancer cells. Researchers want to see if sunitinib can be used to&#xD;
      treat advanced thymus cancer. It will be given to people who have had at least one earlier&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment containing platinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if sunitinib is a safe and effective treatment for advanced thymus cancer that has&#xD;
      not responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced thymus cancer that has not&#xD;
           responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one previous cancer treatment must have been chemotherapy treatment containing&#xD;
           platinum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor biopsies will be used to check the&#xD;
           severity of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take sunitinib tablets once a day, in the morning. They will take the&#xD;
           tablets daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest with no sunitinib. This 6-week&#xD;
           period is called a cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment cycles may be repeated as long as the tumor does not continue to grow and&#xD;
           there are no severe side effects....&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymoma and&#xD;
      thymic carcinoma. However over 50% of these patients may fail initial therapy and therefore&#xD;
      require second-line therapy. New therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease&#xD;
      progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. Results obtained from protocol 12-C-0118&#xD;
      so far have shown impressive clinical activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent thymic&#xD;
      carcinoma with an objective response rate of 23% and disease control rate of 91% which is&#xD;
      unprecedented for this histology. Treatment at a dose of 50 mg once daily for four weeks&#xD;
      followed by 2 weeks off was poorly tolerated. Twenty five out of 41 patients needed dose&#xD;
      reductions due to development of intolerable adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the objective response rate (PR+CR) for sunitinib in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically confirmed thymoma (Group 1 only) or thymic carcinoma who&#xD;
           have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
           with progressive disease prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of&#xD;
           sunitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first group (Group 1), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous&#xD;
           schedule at 50 mg per day for 4 weeks with 2 weeks off to constitute a 6-week cycle&#xD;
           (Schedule 4/2) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second group (Group 2), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous&#xD;
           schedule at 50 mg per day for 2 weeks with 1 week off to constitute a 3-week cycle&#xD;
           (Schedule 2/1) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE Version 5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be performed every cycle for&#xD;
           Group 1 and every other cycle for Group 2 (every 6 weeks) for patients receiving&#xD;
           treatment for less than one year, and every two cycles for Group 1 and every four cycles&#xD;
           for Group 2 (every 12 weeks) for patients who have been receiving treatment one year or&#xD;
           longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory studies include evaluation of serum VEGFR2, PLGF, IL-4, IL-12, HGF, and&#xD;
           b-FGF (Group 1 only); and circulating tumor cells, endothelial progenitors, and mature&#xD;
           apoptotic endothelial cells (both groups). In Group 2, regulatory T cells (Tregs),&#xD;
           exhausted CD8 T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Th1/Th2 T cell&#xD;
           populations will also be evaluated. Where tumor samples are available, intra-tumoral&#xD;
           immune infiltrate will be assessed (both groups). Exploratory studies apply to NCI only.&#xD;

        factor 1 (CSF1), and the RET receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.3 Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to&#xD;
        poor prognosis. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and&#xD;
        whose brain disease has remained stable for 3 months without steroid therapy may be&#xD;
&#xD;
        enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.4 Patients with evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, or any concurrent&#xD;
        condition, which could compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited&#xD;
        to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, uncontrolled HBV and/or HCV&#xD;
        infection unless sustained virologic response to HCV therapy, uncontrolled diabetes,serious&#xD;

        system,stroke/cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the past 12&#xD;
        months or psychiatric illness/social situations which would jeopardize compliance with the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.5 History of a previous invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, except adequately&#xD;
        treated non-melanoma skin cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid or carcinoma in situ&#xD;
        of the uterine cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.6 Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
        nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered&#xD;
        from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;

        inhibitors can be found in Section 5.2.) An exception will be made for patients who are on&#xD;
        ritonavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy, in which case the starting dose of&#xD;
        sunitinib will be modified as indicated in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.12. Every effort should&#xD;
        be made to switch patients taking such agents or substances to other medications. A&#xD;
        comprehensive list of medications and substances known or with the potential to alter the&#xD;
        pharmacokinetics of sunitinib through CYP3A4 is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.9 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sunitinib angiogenesis inhibitor&#xD;
        with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
        but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
&#xD;
        mother with sunitinib breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;

        procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability&#xD;
        to swallow and retain sunitinib tablets are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.13 Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than&#xD;
        500 msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

        higher or diastolic blood pressure of 91 mmHg or higher) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.15 Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of coumarin derivative anticoagulants&#xD;
        such as warfarin are excluded, although doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for&#xD;
