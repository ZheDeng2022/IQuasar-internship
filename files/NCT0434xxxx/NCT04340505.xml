      We will prospectively observe patients with uveitis who are either active or were recently&#xD;
      active in the previous 6 months and are treated with the i-FA implant. All of the patients&#xD;
      will have standard clinical exams at baseline and image quantification of their inflammation&#xD;
      using OCT, OCTA and UWFFA (if needed). At baseline, ETDRS vision will be measured. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 months months. During follow-up repeat imaging will be performed&#xD;
      along with standard examinations, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity measurements. At the&#xD;
      final visit, all tests will be repeated. Data collected will be analyzed using statistical&#xD;
      software package. Correlations between changes in imaging quantification of inflammation&#xD;
      scores and changes in visual acuity, clinical grades of inflammation, and contract&#xD;
      sensitivity will be calculated.&#xD;

      Prospective imaging of the intrAvitreal fluocinoloNe acetonide implant using fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography and opTical coHerencE tomogRaphy in uveitis patients. (PANTHER)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Uveitis, a disease with high visual morbidity Uveitis accounts for up to 20% of&#xD;
      legal blindness in the developed world.It is characterized by invasion of inflammatory cells&#xD;
      into the eye with resultant permanent damage of normal ocular tissue without treatment.&#xD;
      Complications of uveitis include cataracts, glaucoma, macular edema and retinal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently treatment regimens for chronic uveitis include systemic immune suppressive&#xD;
      agents and a surgically placed steroid implant (fluocinolone acetonide). Both treatment&#xD;
      regimens have shown the ability to reduce complication risks and improve vision (MUST study&#xD;
      results). The benefits of each regimen, however are mitigated by their potential side&#xD;
      effects. The surgically placed implant has high risk of glaucoma and cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This year, a long term injectable fluocinolone acetonide (i-FA) implant was approved for use&#xD;
      in chronic uveitis patients (Yutiq, Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals). As opposed to the surgically&#xD;
      placed implant, this implant is placed in the office and has lower reported rates of glaucoma&#xD;
      and cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although approved for use, little data exists of the impact of the i-FA implant on imaging&#xD;
      measures of inflammation including OCT and fluorescein angiography. Since these imaging&#xD;
      devices are often used to monitor patient's response, a prospective evaluation of the impact&#xD;
      of the iFA implant on these measures is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous work produced an initial automated algorithm for quantifying anterior chamber&#xD;
      cells, which results a continuous measure of cells per mm3 We have already produced a&#xD;
      desktop-based software interface that allows real time quantification. We have also created&#xD;
      software that would allow clinicians to measure different types of posterior segment&#xD;
      inflammation including retinal vascular leakage on ultra wide field fluorescein angiography&#xD;
      (UWFFA) and vitreous haze with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Our group has demonstrated&#xD;
      the ability of wide field fluorescein angiogram leakage to identify patients who are actively&#xD;
      inflamed and require therapy. Additionally, we have developed an automated leakage analysis&#xD;
      algorithm to quantitate the area of leakage. We will use these tools to measure and&#xD;
      quantitate both anterior segment and posterior segment inflammation in patients receiving the&#xD;
      i-FA implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design 1. Perform observational study assessing response of i-FA implant as measured&#xD;
      on ocular imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will prospectively observe patients with uveitis who are either active or were recently&#xD;
      active in the previous 6 months and are treated with the i-FA implant. All of the patients&#xD;
      will have standard clinical exams at baseline and image quantification of their inflammation&#xD;
      using OCT, OCTA and UWFFA (if needed). At baseline, ETDRS vision will be measured. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 months. During follow-up repeat imaging will be performed along with&#xD;
      standard examinations, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity measurements. At the final&#xD;
      visit, all tests will be repeated. Data collected will be analyzed using statistical software&#xD;
      package. Correlations between changes in imaging quantification of inflammation scores and&#xD;
      changes in visual acuity, clinical grades of inflammation, and contract sensitivity will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image acquisition protocols will depend on subtype of uveitis. In those with anterior&#xD;
      uveitis, only OCT, OCTA and anterior segment OCT will be obtained by study staff. In those&#xD;
      with posterior segment uveitis, UWFFA will be obtained as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to identify imaging changes in uveitis patients receiving injectable&#xD;
      fluocinolone acetonide implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Critieria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Any patient with a diagnosis of uveitis, who is deemed active or recently active (6&#xD;
      months) by a uveitis specialist and requires an injectable fluocinolone acetonide implant to&#xD;
      treat their inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Critieria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Poor view in fundus in both eyes which precludes image acquisition in those with&#xD;
           posterior uveitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Those with any allergy to fluorescein&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Corneal opacities which prevent image acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inability to sign consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Poor candidates for injectable fluocinolone acetonide (advanced glaucoma without&#xD;
           previous filtering surgery, chronic elevated IOP (&gt;25) on maximal topical anti-glaucoma&#xD;
           drops and evidence of optic nerve progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Children under the age of 18 and pregnant/nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit, standard of care imaging performed including OCT, OCTA, UWFFA. Visual&#xD;
      function measures performed visual acuity contrast sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular follow-up per clinician standard of care Imaging protocol table&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Week 4-6 Weeks 8-12 Weeks 16-23 Month 6 Visual Function (vision and contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity) x x x x x OCT X X X X X OCTA X X X X X UWFFA (as needed) X X X X X&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Health Service (QHS) have been engaged for statistical analysis and will be&#xD;
      involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, correlations between changes in imaging outcomes over time will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All imaging in both studies will be either part of standard of care will be billed to the&#xD;
      patient and/or their insurance. or performed by study staff and not charged to patients.&#xD;
      There will be no financial compensation for the patient as part of this study, but patients&#xD;
      will receive parking vouchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      As OCT imaging is a non-contact and non-invasive technique approved by the FDA for routine&#xD;
      clinical imaging there is minimal risk involved for the patient. UWFFA is a FDA approved&#xD;
      device, with a risk of allergy secondary to fluorescein injection through a vein. Allergeric&#xD;
      reactions are rare, but will be reported to the IRB. In the rare case of an adverse event,&#xD;
      the patient will be evaluated by one of the investigators at the Cole Eye Institute and the&#xD;
      IRB will be informed. All adverse events and unanticipated problems will be reviewed and&#xD;
      managed by the principle investigator and treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated IOP, cataract worsening are known side effects of the injectable FA implant. These&#xD;
      will be monitored during the study.&#xD;
