  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONCR-177-101 is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion study of&#xD;
      ONCR-177, an oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus for intratumoral injection, alone and in&#xD;
      combination with PD-1 blockade in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous,&#xD;
      subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors or with Liver Metastases of Solid Tumors. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ONCR-177 is an intratumorally administered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of a genetically&#xD;
      engineered HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) that selectively replicates in tumor tissue.&#xD;
      Oncorus Inc. is developing ONCR-177 both as monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 blockade&#xD;
      for the treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancies. This first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1&#xD;
      dose escalation and expansion study will determine the intratumoral dose of ONCR-177 as a&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, in subjects with advanced and/or&#xD;
      refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors or with Liver Metastases&#xD;
      of Solid Tumors. This protocol will enroll subjects who have at least one lesion that is&#xD;
      visible, palpable or detectable and can be injected, and subjects who have liver metastases&#xD;
      of solid tumors. Subjects with any cancer types who are eligible for the trial and have such&#xD;
      lesions can be considered for enrollment. Additionally, preliminary evidence for clinical and&#xD;
      immunologic activity will be sought to guide ongoing studies and development of ONCR-177 in&#xD;
      subjects with cancers that are unmet medical needs. Confirmation of safety of ONCR-177&#xD;
      administration in combination with pembrolizumab will also be evaluated in this study, to&#xD;
      enable development as part of combination immunotherapy.&#xD;
