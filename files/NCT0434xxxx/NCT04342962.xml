             procedures or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient (male and female) agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the&#xD;
             duration of time on the study and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods for&#xD;
             1 week after the last infusion of tagraxofusp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB subtype M3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities of Grade≥2 from previous&#xD;
             chemotherapy (excluding alopecia, nausea, fatigue, and liver function tests [as&#xD;
             mandated in the inclusion criteria]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, wide-field radiation, or&#xD;
             biologic therapy within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received treatment with an investigational agent within 14 days of&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has previously received treatment with tagraxofusp.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an active malignancy and/or cancer history (excluding antecedent MDS)&#xD;

             history (within 2 years of entry) with substantial potential for recurrence and/or&#xD;
             ongoing active malignancy will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Patients with the&#xD;
             following neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, organ-confined prostate cancer with no&#xD;
             evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;

             New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina,&#xD;
             history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months before&#xD;
             study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not&#xD;
             controlled by medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (eg, chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has known active or suspected central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. If&#xD;
             suspected, CNS leukemia should be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or examination&#xD;
             of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy - with the exception of low-dose&#xD;
             prednisone (≤10 mg/day) - for treatment or prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
             (GVHD). If the patient has been on immunosuppressive treatment or prophylaxis for&#xD;
             GVHD, the treatment(s) must have been discontinued at least 14 days before study&#xD;
             treatment and there must be no evidence of Grade ≥2 GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or active or&#xD;
             chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C (Patients with positive serology for HBV can be&#xD;
             enrolled and must receive antiviral prophylaxis - i.e lamivudine or entcavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is oxygen-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, places&#xD;
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has AML and requires more than 1 g/day of hydroxyurea&#xD;
             (Hydroxyureaispermittedatdoses of ≤1 g/day.)&#xD;
