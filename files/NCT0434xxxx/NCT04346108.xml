  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, Japanese participants with primary immunodeficiency diseases were treated with&#xD;
      Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% solution, (IGSC, 20%). This study will be in 3&#xD;
      parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Infusions with Immunoglobulin Intravenous (IGIV) every 3 weeks for 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants will switch to weekly subcutaneous infusions with IGSC, 20% for 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: A subset will receive biweekly subcutaneous infusions with IGSC, 20% for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to assess base levels of Immunoglobulin globulin G (IgG) levels&#xD;
      in the blood of the participants after weekly and biweekly treatment with IGSC, 20% (in Parts&#xD;
      2 and 3 of the study). Their PID will be treated by their doctor according to their doctor's&#xD;
      usual clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 treatment parts (Epoch 1, 2, 3). The total evaluation period of the&#xD;
      study will be 57 weeks in which screening period is for 2-8 weeks and Epoch 1 is from Week 8&#xD;
      to Week 21, Epoch 2 is from Week 21 to Week 45, Epoch 3 is from Week 45 to Week 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive IGIV treatment in Epoch 1 for a total of 13 weeks, then switch&#xD;
      to weekly subcutaneous (SC) treatment with IGSC, 20% in Epoch 2 for a total of 24 weeks and&#xD;
      will continue into Epoch 3 for a total of 12 weeks of biweekly SC treatment with IGSC, 20%.&#xD;
      Drug dose in Epoch 2 and Epoch 3 will be adjusted so that it will be an equivalent weekly&#xD;
      dose of the dose administered in Epoch 1 and twice the dose administrated in Epoch 2&#xD;
      respectively. Epoch 2 will contain two periods, period 1: dose adjustment period (first 12&#xD;
      weeks) and period 2: evaluation period (second 12 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. In this study, 2-7 years (parent as observer), 8-13 years (participant as observer) for Peds-QL health questionnaire will be analyzed. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (QOL) for all domains of the Peds-QL. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Four dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 is a generic quality-of-life instrument that has been widely used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) of participants. In this study, 14 years and older (participant as observer) for SF-36 health questionnaire will be analyzed. Generic instruments are used in general populations to assess a wide range of domains applicable to a variety of health states, conditions, and diseases. The SF-36 consists of 36 items that are aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning, role - physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role - emotional, and mental health), with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better HRQL.</description>

    <description>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) is a global satisfaction scale used to assess the overall level of participant's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their medications. In this study, 2-12 years (parent as observer), 13 years and older (participant as observer) for TSQM health questionnaire will be analyzed. TSQM-9 is a 9-item, validated, self-administered instrument used to assess participant's satisfaction with medication. The three domains assessed are effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. The score of each of the 3 domains is based on an algorithm to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher score indicated greater satisfaction in that domain.</description>

    <description>The LQI is a self-administered questionnaire developed specifically for participants/legal guardians involved in IGIV treatments. In this study, 2-13 years (parent as observer), 14 years and older (participant as observer) for LQI health questionnaire will be analyzed. LQI consists of 15-items, divided into four domains: treatment interferences (6 items), therapy-related problems (4 items), therapy setting (3 items), and treatment costs (2 items). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1: &quot;Extremely bad&quot; to 7: &quot;Extremely good&quot;. Total scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating the highest possible satisfaction with factors such as independence, therapy convenience, social/school/work activities, and health and travel costs.</description>
