      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of Total Neoadjuvant Treatment plus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combined treatment model of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment + radical rectal&#xD;
      resection + adjuvant therapy has become the standard treatment model for locally advanced&#xD;
      mid-low rectal cancer, However, the existing evidence shows that this comprehensive treatment&#xD;
      method has reached the upper limit of efficacy and cannot continue to reduce the metastatic&#xD;
      rate and improve the survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that PD-1 antibody inhibitors have excellent curative effects on&#xD;
      the treatment of a variety of tumors and have good safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-arm, single-center, prospective, phase II clinical study. It is&#xD;
      designed to test the efficacy and safety of Total Neoadjuvant chmoradiation Treatment plus&#xD;
      SHR1210 for High-risk locally advanced Rectal Cancer, Meanwhile, screening effective&#xD;
      Biomarker base on neoantigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with high-risk rectal cancer will receive 3 cycles induction CapeOX&#xD;
      and SHR-1210, intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and 2 cycles&#xD;
      consolidation CapeOX and total mesorectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to recruit 25 patients in all.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer will receive chemotherapy and SHR-1210 before chemoradiaton, after chemoradiaton, patient will receive consolidation chemotherapy. This arm is called Total Neoadjuvant Treatment (TNT) plus SHR-1210. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen is designed as 3 cycles of CapeOX ( Capecitabine + Oxaliplatin ) plus SHR-1210 over a period of approximately 8 weeks. Tumor response will be evaluated after chemotherapy. Then patients will undergo 22f-IMRT (Intensity modulated radiotherapy) with capecitabine. Patients will receive two more cycles of consolidation CapeOX if tolerable when there was no progressed disease in induction CapeOX.&#xD;
Finally, patients will receive TME (Total mesorectal excision) following TNT+SHR1210 if no metastasis occurs.</description>
