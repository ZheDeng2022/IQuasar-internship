  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single arm, integrated 3-part&#xD;
      dose escalation and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of AK117 administered&#xD;
      intravenously to adult subjects with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors&#xD;
      or lymphomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises 3 parts: a dose escalation phase for estimating the optimal priming dose&#xD;
      (Part A), a dose escalation phase for estimating the optimal maintenance dose (Part B), and a&#xD;
      dose expansion phase (Part C). The 3 parts will be conducted sequentially. Approximately 159&#xD;
      subjects (up to 27 subjects in Part A, up to 72 subjects in Part B, and up to approximately&#xD;
      60 subjects in Part C) will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
