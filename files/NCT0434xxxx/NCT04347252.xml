  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon is a 30 amino acid peptide hormone that is produced exclusively in alpha-cells of&#xD;
      the pancreatic islets. Glucagon binds to a G-protein coupled receptor and activates&#xD;
      intracellular signaling by increasing the synthesis of cyclic AMP by adenylate cyclase. The&#xD;
      glucagon receptor is most prominently expressed by hepatocytes and the cardinal action of&#xD;
      glucagon is to stimulate hepatic glucose output by increasing glycogenolysis and&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis. A deep body of literature supports physiologic actions of glucagon to&#xD;
      maintain fasting blood glucose and counter-regulate hypoglycemia, and the current view of&#xD;
      glucose metabolism is that insulin and glucagon have opposing and mutually balancing effects&#xD;
      on glycemia. However, it has long been appreciated that glucagon actually stimulates insulin&#xD;
      secretion and islet β-cells express the glucagon receptor and respond to its activation by&#xD;
      increasing cAMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most potent stimulus for glucagon release is hypoglycemia and both low glucose per sé, as&#xD;
      well as sympathetic nervous system activity are potent activators of the alpha-cell. However,&#xD;
      glucagon is also stimulated by elevations of circulating amino acids, including after protein&#xD;
      containing meals; this setting is one in which the release of glucagon during a period of&#xD;
      elevated glycemia could contribute to postprandial insulin secretion. In fact, we have&#xD;
      demonstrated that normal mice injected with glucagon while fasting (BG 75 mg/dl) have a&#xD;
      prompt rise in blood glucose, whereas mice given glucagon while feeding (BG 150 mg/dl)&#xD;
      increase insulin output 3 fold and have a decrease in glycemia. Moreover, in studies with&#xD;
      isolated mouse and human islets we have demonstrated that glucagon stimulates insulin release&#xD;
      by activating both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. This counter-intuitive observation has&#xD;
      been reported by several other groups as well as ours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the studies proposed herein we wish to extend our novel observations to humans. The&#xD;
      possibility that glucagon acts in the fed state to promote insulin secretion and glucose&#xD;
      disposal would change current views of physiology in both healthy and diabetic persons.&#xD;
      Moreover, since one of the more promising area of drug development is the creation of&#xD;
      peptides that activate multiple receptors (GLP-1 + glucagon, GLP-1 + GIP + glucagon) the&#xD;
      results of our studies have potential implications for therapeutics as well.&#xD;

      Subjects will have a screening visit for history, medication usage, and blood work; those who&#xD;
      qualify will be offered participation. Subjects will be instructed to consume their usual&#xD;
      diet, including at least 200 g carbohydrate, and not to engage in strenuous physical activity&#xD;
      for the 3 days prior to a study. After an overnight fast they will present to the CRU at the&#xD;
      Stedman Building on the Center for Living campus and have intravenous catheters placed in&#xD;
      both forearms, one for infusion of test substances and the other for blood sampling; the&#xD;
      sampling arm will be warmed with a heating pad to improve venous blood flow. All studies will&#xD;
      start following withdrawal of several basal samples over an extended period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Glucagon infusion in fasting and hyperglycemic subjects: dose finding. Subjects receive&#xD;
           graded doses of intravenous glucagon after a 12-14 hour fast. Doses will start at 10&#xD;
           ng/kg/min and be increased to 50 and 100 ng/kg/min at 30 minute intervals. Glucose&#xD;
           concentrations will be measured at the bedside using a YSI glucose analyzer. Plasma&#xD;
           samples will be collected at 10 minute intervals for assay of insulin, C-peptide, and&#xD;
           glucagon. These pilot studies will provide insight into the relative sensitivity of&#xD;
           hepatic glucose production (fasting study) and insulin secretion (glucose infusion&#xD;
           study) to glucagon. These studies will include up to 10 volunteers each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effects of glycemia to mediate glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production (HGP) and&#xD;
           insulin secretion. Following placement of intravenous catheters subjects will have an&#xD;
           infusion of saline with a tracer dose of deuterated glucose for the remainder of the 300&#xD;
           minute protocol. [6, 6]2H2 glucose will be started as a 4 mg/kg bolus over 5 minutes&#xD;
           followed by a continuous infusion of 0.020-0.4 mg/kg/min. After a 2 hour equilibration&#xD;
           period to label the glucose pool, subjects will have A) saline infusion, B) initiation&#xD;
           of a hyperglycemic clamp, C) infusion of exendin-(9-39) 750 pmol/kg/min and a&#xD;
           hyperglycemic clamp. The clamp will be generated with the infusion of a 20% solution of&#xD;
           dextrose enriched to 2% with deuterated glucose. The infusion rate will be started at 30&#xD;
           mg/kg/h and adjusted every 5 minutes until the blood glucose reaches ~150 mg/dl; the&#xD;
           infusion will be adjusted thereafter to maintain this level of glycemia. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be taken at 10 minute intervals throughout the study to measure: enrichment with&#xD;
           [6, 6]2H2 glucose, insulin, glucagon and C-peptide. After 120 minutes of A) tracer&#xD;
           alone, B) hyperglycemia, or C) exendin-9 plus hyperglycemia, subjects will receive&#xD;
           glucagon as an infusion of 10-100 ng/kg/min for 30 or 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variables from these experiment will be HGP and insulin secretion. The&#xD;
      hypothesis to be tested is that glucagon given at fasting glucose levels will cause a rapid&#xD;
      rise in HGP and blood glucose (50-150 mg/dl over basal) with a secondary rise of insulin&#xD;
      secretion that follows the change in glycemia; and that glucagon given at mild hyperglycemia&#xD;
      will promptly stimulate insulin secretion and limit the response of HGP. The protocol and&#xD;
      predictions of results are depicted below.&#xD;
