  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 40% of the world's population is now impacted by allergic disease and this figure&#xD;
      continues to rise. It is now understood that allergic disease arises from complex&#xD;
      interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Exposure to allergens such as dust&#xD;
      mites and pollen, as well as air pollutants such as diesel exhaust particulates, can alter&#xD;
      the ability of critical genes to be expressed appropriately, a process known as epigenetic&#xD;
      modification. The epigenetic modifications induced by allergens and pollutants appears to be&#xD;
      reversible, thus providing a mechanism by which allergic disease can be treated. Budesonide&#xD;
      (Rhinocort®) is a corticosteroid nasal spray commonly used to treat allergy symptoms. While&#xD;
      the anti- inflammatory and other pharmacological aspects of budesonide are well understood,&#xD;
      recent studies have suggested that budesonide may also work by reversing the epigenetic&#xD;
      modifications caused by allergen exposure, although this has not been examined in the context&#xD;
      of real-world exposures in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to harness the power of epigenetic analysis to determine whether the&#xD;
      epigenetic landscape in patients suffering from allergic disease can be modified by the&#xD;
      administration of budesonide. It will fill critical gaps in understanding of epigenetic&#xD;
      effects and provide information to examine the connection between environmental impacts and&#xD;
      treatment effects. The research will expand the mechanistic understanding of the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of budesonide for relief of nasal rhinitis symptoms and may reveal new mechanisms&#xD;
      that could improve treatment of allergies or pollution exposure, or serve as a tool for&#xD;
      evaluating future therapies. If this venture is successful, it will serve as a model for&#xD;
      studying and optimizing the epigenetic effects of other treatments and other diseases.&#xD;

      To test this, the investigators have planned for two treatment trials where participants will&#xD;
      act as both the control and tester (crossover design method). Participants will be provided a&#xD;
      randomized treatment order of either 1) Budesonide (Rhinocort) or 2) placebo (no medication)&#xD;
      nasal spray for the treatment trial. Participants will go through a series of nasal sampling,&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaires, nasal inhalation flow readings during the in-person visits at the&#xD;
      hospital. Investigators will also attempt to mimic allergen and pollution exposures, and&#xD;
      track how the treatment affects one's nasal responses during visits. On days where&#xD;
      participants do not have in-person visits, participants will continue using the treatment&#xD;
      product on a daily basis. After one cycle of treatment, participants will go through a&#xD;
      wash-out period before starting the second cycle with the opposite treatment (Budesonide&#xD;
      (Rhinocort)/placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are not expecting that participants' responses to the treatments or exposures&#xD;
      will be noticeable to the participants. Any responses that may occur will probably only be&#xD;
      detectable through careful examination of the collected nasal samples on a genetic basis.&#xD;
      However, being able to understand the subtle changes will help investigators optimize and&#xD;
      better understand the use of these treatments in the future.&#xD;
