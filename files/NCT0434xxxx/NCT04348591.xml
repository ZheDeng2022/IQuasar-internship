  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Misophonia, the inability to tolerate certain repetitive aversive sounds that are common, is&#xD;
      gaining recognition as a debilitating condition. It is not a well-understood condition and&#xD;
      there are no known treatments. Up to one in five people report moderate or higher misophonia&#xD;
      symptoms; nevertheless, resources aimed at understanding and treating this problem are&#xD;
      scarce. In order to align misophonia research with the priorities of large funding agencies&#xD;
      such as the National Institute of Mental Health, the investigators propose a novel study&#xD;
      aimed at separating misophonic distress from other types of emotional distress. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to examine changes in brain activation during presentation and regulation&#xD;
      of misophonic versus distressing sounds. Emergent neural networks that may be involved in&#xD;
      misophonia will then be tested in the lab with the use of noninvasive neurostimulation, a&#xD;
      novel tool that can enhance or inhibit activation in a targeted brain region. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to modulate activation in key areas of the misophonia brain circuitry with&#xD;
      the aim to identify the optimal neural target for misophonia interventions. Our&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team at the Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation brings&#xD;
      together experts in misophonia, neuroscience, neuromodulation, neurology, and biostatistics&#xD;
      who share the long-term goal of developing and refining an intervention for this condition in&#xD;
      an environment that is optimal to conduct the proposed research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit adults who self-report significant misophonia symptoms&#xD;
      and adults who meet criteria for a current psychiatric disorder and who self-report&#xD;
      difficulties calming down when upset. All participants will undergo a brain imaging session&#xD;
      during which misophonic cues; distressing, non-misophonic cues; or neutral cues will be&#xD;
      presented. Participants will then be asked to experience, or attempt to downregulate emotions&#xD;
      associated with these cues. Based on the imaging results, two personalized neurostimulation&#xD;
      targets will be identified: (1) the region in the frontal cortex with the most activity&#xD;
      during the downregulation of misophonic versus neutral sounds and (2) the prefrontal region&#xD;
      with the strongest functional connectivity to the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a brain&#xD;
      region previously identified to be critical for misophonic distress. Participants will&#xD;
      receive real or sham neurostimulation over the prefrontal cortex and insula in a random&#xD;
      order, while engaging in listening to versus downregulating misophonic, aversive, or neutral&#xD;
      cues. The investigators plan to assess emotional dysregulation, psychopathology, and&#xD;
      misophonia with a multi-method battery of measures during all three study appointments.&#xD;
      Feasibility and acceptability will be examined qualitatively. The investigators will use&#xD;
      results from this study to design larger trials and to seek federal funding with the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of designing an effective misophonia intervention. If successful, our study can be the&#xD;
      first step in a series of investigations that establish the unique targets for neural&#xD;
      intervention for misophonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consistent with NIMH strategic priorities, neural targets that account for individual&#xD;
      differences are needed for the next generation of mental health interventions. Misophonia,&#xD;
      the inability to tolerate certain aversive repetitive and common sounds, is gaining rapid&#xD;
      recognition as a debilitating condition that is not currently well understood and for which&#xD;
      interventions do not yet exist. In order to align research efforts to understand and treat&#xD;
      misophonia with NIMH priorities, the investigators propose to conduct an experimental study&#xD;
      that differentiates the neural circuitry of misophonia-induced distress from other types of&#xD;
      emotional distress, and that begins to identify the optimal neural target for possible&#xD;
      interventions. Noninvasive neurostimulation (i.e., the purposeful modulation of neural&#xD;
      circuitry), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), is a powerful tool&#xD;
      which can modulate neuronal activation and can be used to examine the responsiveness of&#xD;
      neural circuits to intervention. Therefore, for this project, the investigators bring&#xD;
      together a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in misophonia, neuroscience,&#xD;
      neuromodulation, biostatistics, and neurology with the aims to: (1) differentiate the brain&#xD;
      circuitry dysfunction in misophonia compared to non-misophonia emotional distress and (2)&#xD;
      identify the optimal intervention target for changing misophonic distress using rTMS. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to recruit adults who self-report significant misophonia symptoms and a&#xD;
      comparison group of adults who meet criteria for a current psychiatric disorder and who&#xD;
      self-report high emotional dysregulation. Those who have contra-indications for MRI or rTMS&#xD;
      will be excluded. All participants will undergo an MRI session during which misophonic cues;&#xD;
      aversive, non-misophonic cues; or neutral cues will be presented. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to listen only or listen and attempt to downregulate emotions associated with these cues.&#xD;
      Functional MRI (fMRI) analysis will then be performed to define two personalized&#xD;
      neurostimulation targets defined as the region in the frontal cortex that is the most (1)&#xD;
      activated during emotion regulation and (2) connected to the anterior insular cortex (AIC)&#xD;
      during emotional experiencing. Participants will be assigned to receive active or sham&#xD;
      neurostimulation over target 1 and target 2 in a random order, while engaged in listening to&#xD;
      versus downregulating misophonic, aversive, or neutral cues. The investigators plan to employ&#xD;
      excitatory neuromodulation to examine the effects of enhancing prefrontal cortex activation&#xD;
      during emotion regulation. The investigators also plan to employ inhibitory neuromodulation&#xD;
      to examine the effects of inhibiting AIC activation during listening only without efforts to&#xD;
      regulate emotional distress. The investigators plan to assess emotional dysregulation,&#xD;
      psychopathology, and misophonia with a multi-method battery of measures during all three&#xD;
      study appointments. Feasibility and acceptability will be examined qualitatively. The&#xD;
      investigators will use results from this study to design larger trials and to seek federal&#xD;
      funding with the ultimate goal of designing an effective misophonia intervention. If&#xD;
      successful, our study can be the first step in a series of investigations that establish the&#xD;
      unique targets for neural intervention for misophonia.&#xD;
