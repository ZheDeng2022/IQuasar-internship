      -  The main purpose of this study is to learn if incorporating a loop diuretic such as&#xD;
           furosemide along with labetalol in the routine management of postpartum gestational&#xD;
           hypertensive disorders could lower the need for additional anti-hypertensive agents to&#xD;
           control blood pressures, improve blood pressures (as measured by systolic blood&#xD;
           pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressures), shorten hospital&#xD;
           stays and decrease readmissions for patients with gestational hypertensive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on a study by Veena et al1, there is reason to believe that the addition of&#xD;
           furosemide to other anti-hypertensives may help decrease the need to add or increase the&#xD;
           dose of medication to control blood pressures. There may be potential to shorten&#xD;
           hospital stays and decrease readmissions, as well. Collecting data will be done using a&#xD;
           prospective, randomized 1:1 controlled study assigning postpartum patients with a&#xD;
           gestational hypertensive diagnosis to either labetalol alone or labetalol plus&#xD;
           furosemide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be performed in the postpartum wing of Miami Valley Hospital Main Campus&#xD;
           and would use patients who have consented to participate in the study with enrollees&#xD;
           coming from the OB Staff population.&#xD;

      Background and Literature Review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There have been four documented studies investigating loop diuretics in the management&#xD;
           of postpartum hypertensive disorders- Matthews et al2, Ascarelli et al3, Amorim et al4,&#xD;
           and Veena et al. Of these studies, only Amorim and Veena were able to show statistical&#xD;
           significance on any parameters. Amorim was able to show that there was an improvement of&#xD;
           SBP, DBP and MAP, but the research was only presented as an abstract at a conference and&#xD;
           not published, thereby making it impossible to draw any conclusions or practice&#xD;
           guidelines. Veena demonstrated that by using furosemide and nifedipine in combination,&#xD;
           the need for additional antihypertensive medication in severe pre-eclampsia in the&#xD;
           postpartum period was reduced when compared to nifedipine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A systematic review5 of postpartum hypertensive disorder management suggested that there&#xD;
           was insufficient data to recommend any single pharmacological intervention at this time&#xD;
           in the management of gestational hypertensive disorders. The review emphasized the need&#xD;
           for further studies to be conducted to help guide management of patients affected by&#xD;
           gestational hypertensive disorders in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● Main Question&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of furosemide plus labetalol improve blood pressures in the postpartum&#xD;
           period of patients with gestational hypertensive disorders versus labetalol alone?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
           ■ Will there be a requirement to escalate antihypertensive therapy to control blood&#xD;
           pressures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improvement of gestational hypertensive disorders by measurement of systolic blood&#xD;
                pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Shortened hospital stay in patients with hypertensive disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Breastfeeding status at 1 week postpartum visit in mothers planning to breastfeed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Readmission for postpartum hypertensive disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance to patient, institution, and profession&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a referral center and being the region's leader, Miami Valley is very accustomed to&#xD;
           accepting transfers of high acuity patients often times with hypertensive disorders&#xD;
           being the root cause of the transport&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The majority of the OB staff population being served at Miami Valley Hospital is African&#xD;
           American. According to Myatt6, the incidence of pre-eclampsia in the African American&#xD;
           population is greater than double the Caucasian population (11% to 5%) thereby making&#xD;
           this study very applicable to the patient population served at Miami Valley Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With the construct of the study, costs abe kept low by utilizing already established&#xD;
           resources and practices (blood pressure cuffs, nurses, routine one week blood pressure&#xD;
           checks) while only adding on the unit cost of furosemide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If treatment with labetalol and furosemide is found to be useful, it would be not only a&#xD;
           very inexpensive, cost effective way of improving patient outcomes and possibly&#xD;
           decreasing lengths of stay stateside, but in improving global practice in places that&#xD;
           are lacking in resources privy to first world countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study would be designed as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A prospective randomized 1:1 controlled trial including postpartum women with&#xD;
                gestational hypertension or preeclampsia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with chronic hypertension would be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One arm receiving 400mg labetalol BID alone on PPD#1 or 24 hours after magnesium&#xD;
                sulfate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One arm receiving 400mg labetalol BID and a five day course of furosemide 20mg QD&#xD;
                on PPD#1 or 24 hours after magnesium sulfate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recording any occurrence when an increased amount of labetalol is needed to&#xD;
                maintain blood pressures below 150 SBP and/or 100 DBP per ACOG recommendations.7&#xD;
&#xD;
                ■ In the event of persistently elevated blood pressures, labetalol will be&#xD;
                increased to 400mg TID and escalated to 600mg TID and finally 800mg TID as&#xD;
                indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of blood pressure every four hours after administration until patient&#xD;
                discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of urine output every 12 hours until discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compare average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures between the two&#xD;
                groups during admission and at one week postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected using the OB Staff population at Miami Valley Hospital Main&#xD;
           Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research will be analyzed and interpreted by the research team conducting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential difficulties and limitations include compliance concerns of mandatory one week&#xD;
           blood pressure follow up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the Veena et al paper as a frame of reference, a sample size of 140 divided evenly&#xD;
           across the two treatment arms would achieve statistical significance in determining the&#xD;
           need to escalate anti-hypertensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The unit cost of one tablet of labetalol 200mg and furosemide 20mg is currently $0.32&#xD;
           and $1.23, respectively. 8,9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study would use already readily available automated blood pressure cuff machines on&#xD;
           the postpartum wing.&#xD;
