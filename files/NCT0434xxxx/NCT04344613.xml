  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABO-incompatible red blood cell transfusions still represent an important hazard in&#xD;
      transfusion medicine. Therefore, some countries have introduced a systematic bedside ABO&#xD;
      agglutination test checking that the right blood is given to the right patient. However, this&#xD;
      strategy is entirely manual, requires an extremely time-consuming learning program and relies&#xD;
      on a subjective interpretation of agglutination on ABO test cards (for example Biorad,&#xD;
      Diagast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ULB spinoff Antigon developed a prototype device on the basis of a technology developed&#xD;
      in the Translational research laboratory of CHU-Brugmann, ULB. This device is specifically&#xD;
      dedicated to perform a &quot;near patient&quot; control of the blood group of the patient and of the&#xD;
      blood bag just before transfusion, and to control that the right blood bag is given to the&#xD;
      right patient by cross-checking their identifications. The principle of the assay relies on&#xD;
      an agglutination and filtration in a disk including anti A,B and D antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to validate the analytical performances of this device (phase A)&#xD;
      and to validate the clinical performances of this device (phase B).&#xD;

&#xD;
      The ULB spinoff Antigon developed a prototype device on the basis of a technology developed&#xD;
      in the Translational research laboratory of CHU-Brugmann, ULB. This device is specifically&#xD;
      dedicated to perform a &quot;near patient&quot; control of the blood group of the patient and of the&#xD;
      blood bag just before transfusion, and to control that the right blood bag is given to the&#xD;
      right patient by cross-checking their identifications. The principle of the assay relies on&#xD;
      an agglutination and filtration in a disk including anti A,B and D antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of a preliminary study using a first Proof of Concept Prototype demonstrated the&#xD;
      feasibility of ABO determination with a simple device, eliminating manipulation and&#xD;
      subjective interpretation responsible for transfusion errors.The investigators then developed&#xD;
      an end-user friendly, portable device using disposable fluidic disks and including everything&#xD;
      needed to perform an agglutination test to determine the ABO group + RHD status of a patient&#xD;
      and a blood bag, or alternatively of two patients.The system is designed to be used near the&#xD;
      patient just before the beginning of transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to validate the analytical performances of this device (phase A)&#xD;
      and to validate the clinical performances of this device (phase B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A will be conducted in the laboratory and will allow the determination of the cut off&#xD;
      values for the quantitative optical measures. These cut-off values will define the presence&#xD;
      or absence of antigens A, B or D. Blood groups will be determined using the prototype and&#xD;
      compared to the blood group determined in the blood transfusion laboratory with an automate&#xD;
      using gel filtration technology. The validation will be performed both on blood bag samples&#xD;
      and on random EDTA blood samples collected from consecutive unselected patients of our&#xD;
      institution for whom a blood group had been requested (no additional sampling procedure nor&#xD;
      additional blood volume will be required). The performances of the defined cut-off values&#xD;
      will be tested in a second step on additional blood pathological samples selected from the&#xD;
      routine samples received at the laboratory. They will cover a large range of hematological&#xD;
      and immunological anomalies susceptible to interfere with or impair test performance and&#xD;
      results. Finally, tests will be run on residual blood samples of neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B will be conducted to investigate the performances of the device in real conditions&#xD;
      for the ultimate control of the ABO compatibility by comparing the patient and blood bag ABO&#xD;
      groups. It will be conducted for its most part inside the laboratory and for another part in&#xD;
      clinical units where the test will be performed by the nurses, with the assistance of the&#xD;
      technologist involved in the validation of the device. For the part of the study conducted&#xD;
      inside the lab, blood bags routinely attributed to patients will be selected the be tested on&#xD;
      the device in parallel with the blood from the correct patient or from a 'wrong' (with other&#xD;
      blood group) patient, in order to simulate situations of transfusion errors and evaluate the&#xD;
      performances of the device to identify and block these errors. If the results are satisfying,&#xD;
      the device will be tested in real life at the bedside in real conditions of transfusion. For&#xD;
      this part of validation the results provided by the device (expressed as Compatible/not&#xD;
      compatible/undetermined) will be compared with the results obtained with the manual point of&#xD;
      care compatibility control (according to local procedure), and with the known groups of the&#xD;
      patient and the blood bag stored in the patient blood bank file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of ABO tests both on patients and on blood bag from donors has been determined in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommendations from European Commission for Technical Specifications for&#xD;
      In vitro diagnostic medical devices. ABOD assay performances have to be evaluated on at least&#xD;
      3000 samples.&#xD;

    <description>The device has been developed by a consortium including the Université Libre de Bruxelles, research centers (SIRRIS, CER), a private company (CISEO), and the spin-off Antigon S.A..The device includes a reader and a disposable disk (ABOD disk) for testing one patient et a blood bag. Four blood drops from the patient are deposited on one side of the disk and 4 blood drops from the blood bag one the other side. The disk correctly filled is inserted in the reader and after 2 minutes the result is displayed on the screen as a message GO or No GO. In case of incompatibility or any other problem a red Stop message will appear on the screen.</description>
