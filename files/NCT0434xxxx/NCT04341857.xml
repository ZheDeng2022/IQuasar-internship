      This is a prospective single arm phase II clinical study to compare the safety and efficacy&#xD;

      Into a set of 25 cases of the gastric carcinoma confirmed by pathology or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction adenocarcinoma (cT4 and/or N + M0, Multi-Disciplinary Team thought line to&#xD;
      perioperative treatment) patients, preoperative accept four cycle by bead a resistance +&#xD;
      sintilimab + capecitabine plus oxaliplatin into new adjuvant chemotherapy, because PD1&#xD;
      antibodies distance between surgery time interval is the lack of clinical data, judging by&#xD;
      the researchers is 4 cycles of chemotherapy combination of sintilimab .The patient was able&#xD;
      to undergo D2 radical surgery.Pathological examination was carried out to observe the pCR and&#xD;
      the infiltration rate of immune cells.After the operation, patients continued to receive 4&#xD;
      cycles of capecitabine + oxaliplatin adjuvant therapy, and the total number of chemotherapy&#xD;
      cycles was 8 cycles.Disease-free survival time and safety of treatment were observed, and OS,&#xD;
      ORR and quality of life of all patients were followed up.&#xD;

    <description>The interval between the dates of the first dose of trial treatment until first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients with new non-breast cancer malignancy must continue to be followed for progression of the original breast cancer. For patients without progression, follow-up is censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurs within 12 weeks following the date last known progression-free, in which case the death will be counted as a DFS event.</description>
