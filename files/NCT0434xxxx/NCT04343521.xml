      The trial will be conducted in the city of Merida extending ongoing longitudinal cohort to&#xD;
      follow a population of 4,600 children 2-15 years old randomly allocated to receive either&#xD;
      TIRS treatment or not. If efficacious, TIRS will drive a paradigm shift in Aedes control by:&#xD;
      considering Ae. aegypti behavior to rationally guide insecticide applications; the change to&#xD;
      preventive control (pre- ABD transmission season rather than in response to symptomatic&#xD;
      cases); the use of third generation insecticides to which Ae. Aegypti is susceptible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contemporaneous urban vector control (truck-mounted ultra-low volume spraying, thermal&#xD;
      fogging, larviciding) has failed to contain dengue epidemics and to prevent the global range&#xD;
      expansion of Aedes-borne diseases (ABDs: dengue, chikungunya, zika). Part of the challenge in&#xD;
      sustaining effective ABD control emerges from the remarkable paucity of evidence about the&#xD;
      epidemiological impact of any vector control method. Furthermore, the classic deployment of&#xD;
      interventions in response to clinical cases fails to account for the important contribution&#xD;
      of out-of-home human mobility and asymptomatic infections.&#xD;
