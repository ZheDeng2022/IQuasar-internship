  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, single-dose study designed to assess the effect&#xD;
      of renal impairment on the PK of setmelanotide. A total of approximately 32 subjects&#xD;
      (approximately 8 subjects in each renal impairment group and 8 healthy subjects with normal&#xD;
      renal function) are planned to be enrolled across 4 centers in the United States. At&#xD;
      screening, subjects will be assigned to a study group according to eGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A - Mild Renal Impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B - Moderate Renal Impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C - Severe Renal Impairment&#xD;
