      Background There are significant limitations in the current approaches to assessing 2&#xD;
      important areas of cardiovascular physiology - the systemic circulation and left ventricular&#xD;
      (LV) performance. The investigators' have repurposed the concepts of &quot;systemic vascular&#xD;
      conductance&quot; to assess systemic circulation, and the &quot;head capacity principle&quot; to assess LV&#xD;
      performance. The investigators' now seek to test these concepts in human adults, with heart&#xD;
      failure and without heart failure, using non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis There will be a depressed head-capacity curve and reduced power among patients&#xD;
      with heart failure which will indicate compromised left ventricular pump function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The research study will involve a single outpatient visit per subject. The study will&#xD;
      take place with the subject supine on a bed/table. The subjects will be instrumented with EKG&#xD;
      electrodes and finger blood pressure cuffs. The continuous finger BP device performs a&#xD;
      waveform analysis in real-time to determine the non-invasive stroke volume, cardiac output,&#xD;
      and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be supine for at least 5 minutes to collect baseline data before being&#xD;
      handed a dynamometer device. The subject will then be asked to squeeze the dynamometer with&#xD;
      maximum force for a minimum of 2 minutes while only engaging their forearm and remaining&#xD;
      relaxed in the rest of their body. The subject will then release the dynamometer and remain&#xD;
      supine, in recovery, for a minimum of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the handgrip test, the instrumentation will be removed and the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the study will be complete. The study duration should be about 20 min.&#xD;

      Background There are significant limitations in our current approaches to assessing 2&#xD;
      important areas of cardiovascular physiology - the systemic circulation and left ventricular&#xD;
      (LV) performance. Using engineering principles, the investigators' have repurposed 2 concepts&#xD;
      to develop novel (and hopefully improved) interpretation of integrated cardiovascular&#xD;
      function. These concepts are &quot;systemic vascular conductance&quot; for systemic circulation and the&#xD;
      &quot;head capacity principle&quot; for LV performance, which have been demonstrated in animal&#xD;
      physiology experiments using a porcine model. In this protocol, the investigators' seek to&#xD;
      test these concepts in human adults, with heart failure and without heart failure, using&#xD;
      non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Hypotheses Primary Aim: To evaluate cardiovascular function in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure using a head-capacity relation to assess left ventricular pump function as well as by&#xD;
      assessing systemic vascular conductance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a depressed head-capacity curve and reduced power among patients&#xD;
      with heart failure which will indicate compromised left ventricular pump function. In&#xD;
      addition, heart failure patients will have decreased systemic vascular conductance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim#1: The investigators' will compare patients with heart failure with reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) to healthy (no heart failure) control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: The investigators' will compare patients with heart failure with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) to healthy (no heart failure) control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The research study will take place in the TRW Building on the University of Calgary&#xD;
      Foothills Campus. This will involve a single outpatient visit per subject. Patients can be&#xD;
      brought to the TRW building from the Cardiac Function Clinic or Cardiac Device Clinic in a&#xD;
      wheelchair, accompanied by a member of the research team or can arrive to the TRW building by&#xD;
      their own means. As a part of the consent process, the subject will be asked to allow access&#xD;
      to their clinical records for research purposes. This will include collecting information&#xD;
      about their heart failure such as their ejection fraction, NYHA class, medications, and&#xD;
      whether they have an implanted permanent pacemaker or implanted defibrillator capable of&#xD;
      atrial and ventricular pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place with the subject supine on a bed/table. The subjects will be&#xD;
      instrumented with EKG electrodes and finger blood pressure cuffs. The continuous finger BP&#xD;
      device performs a waveform analysis in real-time to determine the non-invasive stroke volume,&#xD;
      cardiac output, and blood pressure. These will be connected to a laptop for continuous&#xD;
      digital acquisition through an analog:digital conversion card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be supine for at least 5 minutes to collect baseline data before being&#xD;
      handed a dynamometer device. The subject will then be asked to squeeze the dynamometer with&#xD;
      maximum force for a minimum of 2 minutes while only engaging their forearm and remaining&#xD;
      relaxed in the rest of their body. The subject will then release the dynamometer and remain&#xD;
      supine, in recovery, for a minimum of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the handgrip test, the instrumentation will be removed and the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the study will be complete. The study duration should be about 20 min.&#xD;
