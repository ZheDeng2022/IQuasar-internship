  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While much evidence exists to support the association between physical training and improved&#xD;
      motor skill performance, there is little evidence that supports the association between&#xD;
      movement education and improved motor skill performance. In short, the investigators would&#xD;
      like to study the effect of movement education (as provided by the Sports Safety athlete&#xD;
      education program) on immediate and sustained changes in motor skill performance (jumping and&#xD;
      landing technique) using the DARI motion capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the change in motor performance for high school athletes who did and&#xD;
      did not attend the Sport Safety athlete Education Program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Successful models of injury prevention in occupational health settings focus largely on motor&#xD;
      skill education for employees. Sports-related injury prevention programs lack this critical&#xD;
      component. This research question is being asked to help inform the development of a&#xD;
      comprehensive implementation strategy for a high school sports injury prevention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Sports Safety ACL Program is a unique, public health&#xD;
      approach to ACL injury risk management. The program offers pioneering education to those&#xD;
      directly responsible for the safety of young athletes. The program offers diverse educational&#xD;
      opportunities and innovative risk management resources directly to coaches, parents,&#xD;
      administrators, and young athletes. The program has already held over 200 live workshops,&#xD;
      teaching coaches, parents and young athletes how to identify injury risk factors and how the&#xD;
      relationship between movement quality and sports performance impacts injury rates. Though&#xD;
      several research studies have been conducted with the HSS Sport Safety Program, this study is&#xD;
      the first to evaluate the association between athlete motor learning and movement quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programs focus on clinicians and&#xD;
      coaches leading a series of neuromuscular training exercises repeatedly throughout a sports&#xD;
      season to improve athlete strength, balance, flexibility, and agility. While this has shown&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in controlled research settings, there have been many problems&#xD;
      with implementation, including low compliance. Hartigan et al recently conducted a study&#xD;
      showing that athletes had improved jumping and landing technique after viewing video&#xD;
      feedback. This is evidence that movement education/feedback has the ability to affect motor&#xD;
      skills. Demonstrating an association between motor skill education and improved movement&#xD;
      quality would allow the responsibility of ACL injury prevention to be more readily shared by&#xD;
      both sports medicine clinicians and athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evidence would provide support for the public health approach to ACL injury risk&#xD;
      management on which the HSS Sport Safety Program was based. In addition, providing solid&#xD;
      evidence of the program's success will make the program more marketable to schools, clubs,&#xD;
      and other sports groups nationally and internationally.&#xD;
