  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled study examines whether a daily practice over 8 weeks of Kundalini&#xD;
      Yoga or Meditation can help to reduce pain and/or fatigue among patients with symptoms that&#xD;
      persist despite prior antibiotic treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research reports indicate that approximately 5-20% of patients treated for Lyme disease with&#xD;
      the IDSA-recommended 2-4 week course of antibiotics will continue to have symptoms of&#xD;
      fatigue, pain, cognitive problems, and/or joint and muscle aches despite prior antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. The symptoms can last months to years after treatment. The medical community&#xD;
      officially calls this condition &quot;Post-treatment Lyme disease Syndrome&quot; (PTLDS) when patients&#xD;
      meet strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patient community commonly calls this&#xD;
      condition &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; (CLD). Although there is debate about the exact cause of&#xD;
      these symptoms, there is widespread agreement that this is a growing public health problem as&#xD;
      an increasing number of patients are suffering with symptoms of pain, fatigue, and cognitive&#xD;
      problems (&quot;brain fog&quot;) despite having received not just the standard treatment courses but&#xD;
      even after many courses of antibiotics and other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While antibiotic therapy is the key to the treatment of active infection, other approaches&#xD;
      are needed for those patients whose symptoms persist despite the best antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      efforts. Alternative treatments that can assuage fatigue, muscle and joint pains, and improve&#xD;
      cognitive function are urgently needed. Recent studies indicate that mind body practices&#xD;
      (e.g., meditation; Kundalini Yoga) can be helpful strategy in reducing chronic symptoms, such&#xD;
      as pain, fatigue, and poor mental focus. This study examines the efficacy of two mind-body&#xD;
      therapies among patients with PTLDS and CLD: a) the breathing, meditation, and stretching&#xD;
      techniques common to Kundalini Yoga practice; and b) meditation and breathing techniques&#xD;
      common to Western meditation practices. We plan to assess the degree to which these practices&#xD;
      can reduce the chronic symptoms compared to a wait-list control group. Because fatigue and&#xD;
      multi-system symptoms are so common among patients with PTLDS or CLD, these will be the&#xD;
      primary focus of this study. Primary outcome will be improvement in these self-reported core&#xD;
      symptoms and in self-reported quality of life. Secondary outcomes will assess cognitive&#xD;
      complaints, pain, physical and mental functioning, somatic symptoms, and psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an on-line study. During this study, patients will be screened through an&#xD;
      on-line process, review consent, and complete self-report questionnaires. 225 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Of these, 75 will be randomly assigned to Kundalini yoga and meditation therapy,&#xD;
      75 will be assigned to a meditation &amp; mindfulness App, and 75 will be assigned to a&#xD;
      &quot;treatment as usual&quot; wait-list. Assessments will be conducted weekly for 8 weeks; there will&#xD;
      also be a 6 month follow-up by questionnaire. Study participants randomized to the &quot;treatment&#xD;
      as usual&quot; control group will be offered the option of receiving guided on-line meditation at&#xD;
      the end of the 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this study find evidence suggesting that either meditation therapy and/or Kundalini&#xD;
      Yoga are helpful in reducing the symptoms that persist after Lyme disease treatment, this&#xD;
      would be a valuable and welcome research finding.&#xD;
