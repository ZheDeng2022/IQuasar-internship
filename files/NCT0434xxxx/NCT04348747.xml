    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well dendritic cell vaccines against Her2/Her3, cytokine&#xD;
      modulation (CKM) regimen, and pembrolizumab work for the treatment of triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer or HER2+ breast cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastasis). Dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccines work by boosting the immune system (a system in the body that protect against&#xD;
      infection) to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. CKM regimen, consisting of&#xD;
      rintatolimod, interferon alpha-2b and celecoxib, attempt to direct the immune cells to the&#xD;
      cancer cells and maximize the effectiveness of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an &quot;immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor&quot; which is designed to either &quot;unleash&quot; or &quot;enhance&quot; the cancer immune&#xD;
      responses that already exist by either blocking inhibitory molecules&quot; or by activating&#xD;
      stimulatory molecules. Giving dendritic cell vaccines, CKM regimen, and pembrolizumab may&#xD;
      shrink the cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The best overall central nervous system (CNS) response as per Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Volumetric quantification of brain metastases. II. The non-CNS (i.e. of systemic disease)&#xD;
      response rate as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. The median CNS, non-CNS and overall progression free survival (PFS). IV. The median&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). V. The safety of this regimen. VI. The proportion of patients not&#xD;
      requiring retreatment for their brain metastasis at 6 months since the first dose of&#xD;
      anti-HER2/3 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Rate of failure of irradiated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate baseline and post-treatment molecular biomarkers (including PD-L1 (via 22C3&#xD;
      assay)) in peripheral tumor tissue and peripheral blood, and correlate with treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE: Patients receive anti-HER2/HER3 dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on&#xD;
      days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID),&#xD;
      recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV on days 15-17 and&#xD;
      29-31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients may also receive a booster dose of anti-HER2/HER3 dendritic cell vaccine ID,&#xD;
      celecoxib PO BID, recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV&#xD;
      every 3 months in the opinion of principal investigator.&#xD;

          -  WOCBP must agree to use acceptable birth control methods for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and until persistence of the study drug is no longer detected in the peripheral&#xD;
             blood:this may be a period of several years. Methods for acceptable birth control&#xD;
             include: condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, and&#xD;
             hormonal contraception; it is recommended that a combination of two methods be used.&#xD;
             NOTE: If the risk of conception exists, patients must agree to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study and for at least two years following the last study&#xD;
             treatment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum and highly sensitive urine pregnancy test(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) within 72 hours prior to study allocation; ii) following initiation of treatment,&#xD;
             pregnancy testing will be performed for WOCBP and interpreted prior to every cycle of&#xD;
             pembrolizumab (Initial Treatment Phase); iii) at the End of Treatment (EOT)&#xD;
             Assessment; and iv) whenever pregnancy is otherwise suspected. Note: In the event that&#xD;
             72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment, another pregnancy test must be performed and must be negative in order for&#xD;
             subject to start receiving study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
             (TNBC) (estrogen receptor [ER] =&lt; 1%, progesterone receptor [PR] =&lt; 1% HER2 negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HER2 testing should be performed on the invasive component using a validated&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) assay&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IHC staining is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  IHC 3+ if there is complete and intense circumferential membrane staining&#xD;
                       within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 3+ tumors are considered HER2&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  IHC 2+ if there is incomplete and/or weak/moderate, circumferential membrane&#xD;
                       staining within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 2+ tumors are reported&#xD;
                       as HER2 equivocal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  IHC 1+ if there is faint or barely perceptible, incomplete membrane staining&#xD;
                       within &gt; 10 percent of tumor cells. All IHC 1+ tumors are reported as HER2&#xD;
                       negative&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  IHC 0 if (1) no staining is observed, or (2) there is faint or barely&#xD;
                       perceptible, incomplete membrane staining within &lt; 10 percent of tumor&#xD;
                       cells. All IHC 0 tumors are reported as HER2 negative&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Equivocal HER2 testing should trigger reflex HER2 testing using ISH on the&#xD;
                       same specimen or a new test (using a different specimen with either IHC or&#xD;
                       ISH)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Results from ISH are defined as the ratio of gene amplification of HER2 and the&#xD;
                  chromosome 17 enumeration probe (CEP17). Results are reported as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ISH positive if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &gt;= 2.0, and the HER2 copy number&#xD;
                       signals/cell is &gt;= 4&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Definitive diagnosis will be rendered pending further workup in the&#xD;
                       following instances:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &gt;= 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number is &lt;&#xD;
                            4.0 signals/cell - negative if confirmed on retesting&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and the average HER2 copy number is &gt;=&#xD;
                            6.0 signals/cell positive - if confirmed on retesting&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number is&#xD;
                            between &gt;= 4.0 and &lt; 6.0 signals/cell negative - if confirmed on&#xD;
                            retesting&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ISH negative if the HER2/CEP17 ratio is &lt; 2.0 and average HER2 copy number&#xD;
                       is &lt; 4.0 signals/cell&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable brain disease as per RANO-BM criteria. Have at least one untreated brain&#xD;
             metastasis approved by a research team that meets the following size requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt;= 0.5 cm AND twice the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice thickness; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &lt; 3.0 cm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of&#xD;
                  enrollment (i.e. target lesion[s])&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Of note, lesions &gt;= 0.5 cm and &lt; 3 cm may be determined ineligible by the&#xD;
                  research team because of location or symptoms. An untreated brain metastasis is&#xD;
                  defined as a lesion not present at the time of whole brain radiation therapy or&#xD;
                  not included in a stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 0.5 cm of a treated&#xD;
                  lesion), or any lesion that is new or unequivocally progressing since prior&#xD;
                  radiation therapy or prior surgery. If &gt;= 0.5 cm is used, then the MRI imaging&#xD;
                  should have a 1.5 mm slice thickness or less must be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any brain metastasis &gt;= 3.0 cm or causing symptoms must have previously been treated&#xD;
             with local therapy (i.e. radiation or surgical resection, as clinically appropriate)&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment. Any lesion present at the time of whole brain radiation&#xD;
             therapy (WBRT) or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 5 mm of&#xD;
             the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to&#xD;
             have progressed since treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and/or prior radiotherapy is permitted &gt;=2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to initial Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccine dose (leaving one or more lesions which are not&#xD;
             radiated and will be used as target lesions) but a follow up brain MRI should be&#xD;
             obtained prior to dendritic cell (DC) vaccine to determine stability of the lesions.&#xD;
             An interval of at least 4 weeks after the end of whole brain radiation or for any&#xD;
             surgical resection of brain lesions is permitted ; an interval of at least 4 weeks or&#xD;
             5 half-lives (whichever is sorter) after the last cytotoxic, targeted,&#xD;
             immunotherapeutic or investigational agent is permitted (prior to the start of DC&#xD;
             vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous whole brain radiation is allowed if patient has been diagnosed with&#xD;
                  recurrent, progressive brain metastasis. Previously irradiated lesions would be&#xD;
                  considered non-target lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previously resected lesions or those treated with SRS would be considered&#xD;
                  nontarget lesions. There is no limitation on prior local therapies to other&#xD;
                  lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
