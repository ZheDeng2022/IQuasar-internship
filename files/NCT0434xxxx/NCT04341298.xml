  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to assess how well the Avulux® migraine lenses work in&#xD;
      reducing the impact of migraine headaches as measured by improvement in an 11-point pain&#xD;
      scale after two and four hours of device application, when compared to a control device.&#xD;

      Avulux® is intended to reduce the severity of headache pain in adult patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      episodic migraine headaches. In this study, the investigative Avulux® device shall consist of&#xD;
      a pair of optical filters in the form of spectacle lenses, provided in a standard spectacle&#xD;
      frame; the lenses contain a dye that effectively blocks light at specified wavelength ranges&#xD;
      while minimizing distortion of the visible spectrum. The optical filters block a portion of&#xD;
      the optical spectrum that is suspected to stimulate photophobic responses that trigger some,&#xD;
      and exacerbate most, migraines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control/sham device for this study shall be a pair of plastic lenses provided in a&#xD;
      standard spectacle frame, which will have negligible light-blocking properties at the optical&#xD;
      wavelengths which are blocked by the Avulux® device.&#xD;
