      Measurement Algorithm Control and Optimization with Subsequent Performance Evaluation of the&#xD;

      This study is a combined, open label, prospective, comparative single-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is separated in 3 consecutive study parts. The first 2 study parts include 16&#xD;
      patients each. In the third study part 16 additional patients will be enrolled. Study part 1&#xD;
      and 2 will be used for optimization and validation of the measurement algorithms of the Vital&#xD;
      USA biosensor. During the third study part with enrolment of 16 additional patients, the&#xD;
      precision and accuracy of the final Vital USA biosensor algorithm will be demonstrated. The&#xD;
      visit schedule for all participants of all 3 study parts will be exactly the same. In all&#xD;
      groups of participants, the Vital USA non-invasive monitoring biosensor will be individually&#xD;
      introduced and assigned. During the experimental study visit, a standardized meal will be&#xD;
      given to the participants. Before and after the standardized meal, glucose, heart rate, and&#xD;
      pO2 will be measured using the Vital USA monitoring biosensor at time-points -30, 0, 15, 30,&#xD;
      45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min. The glucose measurements will be compared to capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose measurements by YSI Stat 2300. Parallel measurements of the heart rate and the&#xD;
      pO2 using a patient monitor will be compared to the device readings.&#xD;
