  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon ablation is well established method for the&#xD;
      treatment of atrial fibrillation. As a rule, cryoenergy delivery is preceded by documenting&#xD;
      the full vein occlusion. It is assessed by venography, performed by injecting contrast&#xD;
      through the inner lumen of the balloon catheter after the vein is blocked with a balloon.&#xD;
      Achieving full vein occlusion in certain situations can be challenging and may require&#xD;
      multiple attempts, which may expose the patient to increased doses of contrast and&#xD;
      radiation.. At the same time, the purpose of ablation is an electrical isolation of pulmonary&#xD;
      veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts postulate ablation in the antrum and the so-called &quot;proximal-seal technique&quot;, which&#xD;
      in some cases may require to start cryoapplication before the vein is fully sealed. This&#xD;
      approach minimizes the risk of the pulmonary vein stenosis, damage to structures immediately&#xD;
      adjacent to the atrium and phrenic nerve palsy. In addition, in many cases the displacement&#xD;
      of the balloon after several dozen seconds of cryoapplication, usually by pulling it, causes&#xD;
      full sealing of the vein, contributes to further lowering the temperature and leads to full&#xD;
      electrical isolation of the vein, which is the aims of ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above-mentioned facts indicate that demonstrating full vein occlusion using&#xD;
      angiography before the initiation of cryoenergy application is of limited value. Moreover,&#xD;
      there are a number of parameters related to cryoballoon ablation that indicate acute and long&#xD;
      term vein isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the arguments presented above, it seems that it is possible to perform an&#xD;
      effective and safe isolation of the pulmonary veins using the cryoballoon ablation technique&#xD;
      without confirmation by venography that PV is occluded. Along with dissemination of the&#xD;
      method, such attempts are and will be made by some operators. Therefore, a systematic&#xD;
      approach to this issue is important. It should define the conditions that should be met in&#xD;
      order for the procedure in the proposed modification to be implemented effectively and&#xD;
      safely. In addition, a protocol of ablation for this modification is required.&#xD;

      order for the procedure in the proposed modification to be implemented effectively and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Course of ablation. All ablations will be performed using Medtronic Arctic Front Advance&#xD;
      catheter system as well as future generations of Medtronic cryoballoon catheter systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the cryoenergy will be delivered without previous venography confirming full vein&#xD;
      occlusion. Then, in case of vein isolation failure after 5 minutes of cryoenergy delivery,&#xD;
      further attempts to isolate the vein will be preceded by venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The assumed sample size (N = 50 patients/ 200 veins) will allow to&#xD;
      estimate the number and percentage of pulmonary veins that will be isolated without the use&#xD;
      of contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will use standard descriptive statistics tools: frequency tables for&#xD;
      categorical variables; extreme values, mean value and standard deviation for normal&#xD;
      distributed variables; and extreme values and quartiles for non-normal distributed variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters assessed during the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning a single energy cryoapplication&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Possibility of registration (occurrence vs. non-occurrence) of pulmonary vein potentials&#xD;
           before the cryoapplication, and after the occlusion of the vein by the balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to vein isolation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cryoenergy application time / freezing time&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The minimum temperature obtained during cryoapplication&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Time to obtain temperature - 30 ° C and - 40 ° C&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Temperature after 30, 60 and 90 seconds from the beginning of cryoenergy application&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cryoballoon heating time from -30 C to +15 C Concerning the isolation of a single vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Total time to complete isolation of a vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The number of cryoenergy applications&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Total time of cryoenergy application per vein&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concerning the entire procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Total cryoenergy application time per procedure / patient&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The total amount of contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Radiation dose&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Time of radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Left atrial dwelling time&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Duration of the procedure (from puncture of the vein to sheaths removal)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination of cryoenergy delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If temperature does not reach - 30 ° C after 60 seconds of cryoenergy application&#xD;
           (inefficient application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If vein isolation does not occur after 90 seconds of cryoenergy application (inefficient&#xD;
           application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If temperature after 30 seconds of cryoapplication falls lower than - 50° C (unsafe&#xD;
           application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When temperature reaches - 55° C (unsafe application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If phrenic nerve injury occurs or if symptoms suggesting its imminent occurrence are&#xD;
           noticed (unsafe application).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the operator considers that the application is ineffective or performed too distally&#xD;
           (inefficient or unsafe application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective cryoenergy applications will be terminated 120 seconds after vein isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veins with no recordable pulmonary vein potentials - The above-mentioned veins will be&#xD;
      isolated - 1 application 240 seconds. Applications will be considered effective if the&#xD;
      minimum temperature achieved will be less than 35C and the stimulation performed from the&#xD;
      vein after application will be ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental cryoapplications. Supplemental cryoenergy applications will not be delivered&#xD;
      after successful isolation of the vein&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vein isolation assessment. Pulmonary vein isolation will be assessed by demonstrating&#xD;
      entrance and exit block&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phrenic nerve function monitoring. In order to prevent PN injury/ palsy the balloon will be&#xD;
      inflated outside PV ostia and maintained as antrally as possible during vein isolation. For&#xD;
      phrenic nerve function monitoring pacing of the nerve during right pulmonary vein isolation&#xD;
      will be performed. Additionally, intermittent fluoroscopy during pacing will be used for&#xD;
      monitoring diaphragmatic motion. The ablation will be stopped at the first sign of imminent&#xD;
      phrenic nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications assessed. Transient phrenic nerve injury or palsy (resolving until discharge&#xD;
      after index procedure) is considered a minor complication. Death, stroke, tamponade,&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm, persistent (resolving during follow up) or permanent&#xD;
      (if not resolved at end of follow up, but &gt;12 months) phrenic nerve palsy, bleeding with a&#xD;
      decrease in haemoglobin of at least 2 g / dl or any other state requiring prolongation of&#xD;
      hospitalization are considered major complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the project and follow-up. The study is expected to last two years.&#xD;
      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled, with one year follow-up. All patients will have&#xD;
      follow-up visits in an out-patient clinic at least 3 and 12 months post PVI. Additionally at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 6 and 9 months post ablation telephone follow-up will be conducted by the study&#xD;
      coordinator using standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
