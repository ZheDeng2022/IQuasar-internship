  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever affects more than 11 million children and adults&#xD;
      globally each year including 7 million in South Asia. Up to 1% of patients who get typhoid&#xD;
      may die of the disease and, in those that survive, a prolonged period of ill health and&#xD;
      catastrophic financial cost to the family may follow. In the last 20 years, treatment of&#xD;
      typhoid fever with a 7-day course of a single oral antimicrobial, such as ciprofloxacin,&#xD;
      cefixime or azithromycin, given in an out-patient setting has led to patient recovery in 4 to&#xD;
      6 days without the need for expensive hospitalization. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in&#xD;
      Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, threatens the effectiveness of these treatments and increases&#xD;
      the risk of prolonged illness and severe disease. The recent emergence of a particularly&#xD;
      resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan, and subsequent international spread, adds urgency to&#xD;
      this problem and Salmonella is now listed as a high (Priority 2) pathogen by world health&#xD;
      organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with combinations of antimicrobials may be more effective for treating typhoid&#xD;
      fever and mitigate the problems of resistance. This suggestion is based on expert opinion but&#xD;
      not backed up by good quality evidence. The ACT-South Asia study aims to compare a&#xD;
      combination of azithromycin and cefixime with azithromycin alone in the outpatient treatment&#xD;
      of clinically suspected and confirmed uncomplicated typhoid fever. The total recruitment will&#xD;
      be 1500 patients across sites in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. A placebo (sugar&#xD;
      pill) will be used instead of cefixime in the single drug arm so that neither the patient nor&#xD;
      the study team know which patient is receiving which treatment.Investigators will assess&#xD;
      whether treatment outcomes are better with the combination after one week of treatment and at&#xD;
      one and three month follow-up. Both antimicrobials are widely used and have excellent safety&#xD;
      profiles. If the combination treatment is better than the single antibiotic treatment, this&#xD;
      will be an important result for patients across South Asia and other typhoid endemic areas.&#xD;
      This study will additionally investigate the financial implications for families and health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

Typhi or S. Paratyphi on day 7 of treatment regardless of the presence of fever (microbiological failure) OR blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment.</description>
