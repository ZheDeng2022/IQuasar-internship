    <textblock>
      This is a prospective imaging study evaluating the utility of baseline metabolic MR imaging&#xD;
      as a diagnostic and response monitoring tool in patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Preliminary pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrates the ability of HP C-13&#xD;
      pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging to detect high-grade prostate cancer, including cancer with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine differentiation, as well as provide early evidence of metabolic response and&#xD;
      resistance following application of systemic therapies for the treatment of advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients. In the proposed study, the investigators aim is to extend the initial&#xD;
      clinical results and further develop HP C-13 MRI as an imaging modality in advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the kPL (metabolic flux from hyperpolarized [HP] [1-13C]pyruvate to&#xD;
      [1-13C]lactate) and kPG (metabolic flux from HP [2-13C]pyruvate to [5-13C]glutamate) within&#xD;
      target lesion. (Cohort A) II. To determine the mean percent change from baseline in&#xD;
      intra-tumoral kPL and kPG within target lesion. (Cohort B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To descriptively report on the intra-tumor heterogeneity in kPL and kPG measurement within&#xD;
      target lesion. (Cohorts A and B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY (CORRELATIVE) OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the change from baseline in kPL and kPG is associated with subsequent&#xD;
      clinical outcomes on treatment including prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate and&#xD;
      radiographic progression-survival by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.&#xD;
      (Cohort B) II. In target lesions that are measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, to determine whether baseline and/or change from baseline in&#xD;
      intratumoral kPL and kPG is associated with subsequent objective response by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
      (Cohort B) III. To determine the mean percent change from baseline in peak intra- tumoral HP&#xD;
      lactate (lac)/pyruvate (pyr) and glutamate (glu)/pyr ratios on repeat metabolic magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at the time of radiographic disease progression by PCWG3&#xD;
      criteria. (Cohort B) IV. To investigate for association between HP kPL and kPG as well as&#xD;
      area under the curve (AUC) lac/pyr and glu/pyr ratios with tissue- based markers of elevated&#xD;
      lactate and glutamate metabolism including MYC and LDHA and PDH protein expression. (In&#xD;
      participants who undergo optional tumor biopsy [Cohort A or B]) V. To investigate for an&#xD;
      association between HP kPL and kPG as well as area under the curve (AUC) lac/pyr and glu/pyr&#xD;
      ratios with histologic evidence of small cell/neuroendocrine differentiation. (In&#xD;
      participants who undergo optional tumor biopsy [Cohort A or B])&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A (SINGLE TIME-POINT): Patients receive C-1 labeled hyperpolarized carbon C 13&#xD;
      pyruvate intravenously (IV) over less than 1 minute then undergo magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) over less than 5 minutes. Patients may also receive an optional&#xD;
      C-2 labeled hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI within 15-60 minutes&#xD;
      following completion of the first scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B (MULTIPLE TIME-POINT): Patients receive C-1 labeled hyperpolarized carbon C 13&#xD;
      pyruvate IV over less than 1 minute then undergo MRSI over less than 5 minutes. Patients may&#xD;
      also receive an optional C-2 labeled hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI&#xD;
      within 15-60 minutes following completion of the first scan at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
