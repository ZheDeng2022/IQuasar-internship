    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. The&#xD;
      investigational drug is HBM9161 injection, and the indication is MG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomized to three dose groups (340mg, 680mg and placebo) for a 6&#xD;
      weeks' double-blind treatment period followed by an open-label extension treatment period.&#xD;
      The study will investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic of&#xD;
      HBM9161 in patients with attack of MG in China.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score from baseline to Day 43</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MG-ADL profile provides an assessment of MG symptom severity and measures 8 items on a 0-3 scale, with 0 being the least severe. The total sum of the 13 items represents the ADL score. The ADL score can range from 0 (least severe) to 24 (most severe)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score from baseline to Day 43</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The total QMG score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (13 items; Responses: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3). The score ranges from 0 to 39, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score from baseline to Day 43</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QMG test is a standardized quantitative strength scoring system and measures 13 items on a 0-3 scale, with 0 being the least severe. The total sum of the 13 items represents the QMG score. The QMG score can range from 0 (least severe) to 39 (most severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15(MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Day 43</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MG-QoL 15r scale is a patient-reported score that assesses the patient's perception of impairment and disability and the degree to which the patient tolerates disease manifestations. Each question was graded on a 3-point scale from 0=normal to 2=severe with a score of 0 to 30; the higher score indicates worse MG disease activity</description>
