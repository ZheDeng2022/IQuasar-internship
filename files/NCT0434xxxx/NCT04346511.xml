  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are both leading causes&#xD;
      of death in the United States. Epidemiological data have shown that increased prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension is related to these outcomes. However, despite the strong association of poor&#xD;
      brain health outcomes in patients with hypertension (HTN), the understanding of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (CBF) regulation and treatment options for HTN remain limited. Acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment (AT), which is considered a promising complementary and integrative modality, has&#xD;
      been known to reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function in HTN. However, very&#xD;
      few studies have investigated AT's effect on cerebrovascular function and the possible&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties directly via regulating HTN. Exercise is used as a stimulus that&#xD;
      increases the brain's metabolism and requires cerebrovascular responses (vasodilation) to&#xD;
      meet the new metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the specific aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that an antihypertensive&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment can acutely improve cerebrovascular responses in hypertensive humans&#xD;
      during moderate exercise.&#xD;

      After IRB approval, experiments will take place in the Human Circulation Research Laboratory&#xD;
      in the Department of Health and Exercise on the OU Norman campus. All subjects will complete&#xD;
      a total of 3 visits. The first is a screening visit to provide informed consent and to ensure&#xD;
      the potential participant meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. Once&#xD;
      enrolled, participants will complete two experimental trials (Placebo (PL, Sham Acupuncture)&#xD;
      or Real Acupuncture (RA), randomized) in a single-blinded crossover design. PL or RA&#xD;
      treatment will precede testing by ~25min before to maximize acute responses. Test begins with&#xD;
      5 min of quiet rest where baseline measurements are taken, followed by 5 min of exercise.&#xD;
      After exercise, subjects will be given 5 min of quiet rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening day): ~1.5 hours. The screening visit will include informed consent,&#xD;
      health history, physical activity questionnaires and blood sample. If qualified, the subject&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study and they will complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) cycle&#xD;
      ergometer test to determine fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 &amp; 3 (Study day): ~1.5 hours. Instrumentation: Subjects will be equipped with ECG for&#xD;
      heart rate (HR), photoplethysmography for blood pressure, pulse oximeter, mouthpiece for&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and oxygen uptake (VO2), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for active&#xD;
      muscle oxygenation and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) for CBF. Real Acupuncture (RA): Subjects&#xD;
      will receive ~20 minutes of RA treatment prior to exercise. Placebo (PL): Specially designed&#xD;
      Sham Acupuncture needles will be used in the same acupoints, for the same duration as RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete a total of 3 visits separated by a minimum of 48 hours. Each study&#xD;
      visit will take ~1.5 hours. The investigators anticipate ~ 6 hours or less of total&#xD;
      involvement of the participants' time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-blind crossover design. Participants will be blinded in two trials.&#xD;
      Practitioners and operators will not be allowed to communicate with the participants&#xD;
      concerning the type of acupuncture devices. Outcome assessors and statisticians may not be&#xD;
      blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key dependent variable of interest is change (delta) in cerebrovascular conductance index&#xD;
      (CVCi = CBF/blood pressure) from rest to exercise (delta CVCi = CVCiExercise - CVCiRest).&#xD;
      Delta CVCi is the most common assessment of vasodilation in humans as it normalizes&#xD;
      differences in blood flow to differences in blood pressure. CVCi calculates how much blood&#xD;
      flow is observed for a given pressure. A change in CVCi (delta CVCi) has a predictable&#xD;
      relationship where + delta CVCi indicates vasodilation (more flow for a given pressure) and -&#xD;
      delta CVCi indicates vasoconstriction (less flow for a given pressure). Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using a general linear model approach (similar to ANOVA). Based on pilot data, a total sample&#xD;
      size of 40 (20 CON and 20 HTN) will provide a power of 0.9. A minimum of 60 participants will&#xD;
      be to recruited to ensure statistical power is achieved.&#xD;
