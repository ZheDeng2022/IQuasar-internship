  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine perceptions and smoking behavior of menthol and non-menthol very low&#xD;
      nicotine cigarettes in young adult smokers. The aims are to examine perceptions and smoking&#xD;
      behavior in the laboratory and in the natural environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal includes three different aspects of assessment for menthol smoking young&#xD;
      adults. The laboratory phase includes three separate sessions of laboratory smoking through a&#xD;
      machine designed to measure puff behavior; the EMA phase includes 21 days of monitoring&#xD;
      smoking behavior and attitudes related to smoking when smoking one's usual brand cigarette,&#xD;
      the assigned menthol low nicotine cigarette, and the assigned non-menthol low nicotine&#xD;
      cigarette in the participant's natural environment. The order of administration of smoking&#xD;
      menthol and non-menthol VLNC will be counterbalanced. There will be a 7-day wash-out period&#xD;
      between each 7-day period of using low nicotine cigarettes. The final phase includes a&#xD;
      virtual marketplace where participants can purchase and use the research cigarettes in the&#xD;
      context of other available tobacco products on the market, or purchase no tobacco products at&#xD;
      all. There will be a final assessment, over the phone or in-person, 30-days after the final&#xD;
      study visit (at week 8), to assess tobacco use behavior and attitudes about tobacco use.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled for approximately 9 weeks. Week 1 will consist of smoking one's&#xD;
      usual brand of cigarette in the laboratory and then in their home environment for 7-days.&#xD;
      Week 2 will consist of smoking the first very low nicotine cigarette in the home environment&#xD;
      for 7 days and then in the laboratory. Week three will consist of a 7-day wash-out period&#xD;
      where participants can smoke their usual brand again, as they normally would. Week 4 will&#xD;
      consist of smoking the second very low nicotine cigarette at home for 7 days and then in the&#xD;
      laboratory. Week 5 will consist of returning to the laboratory for a final study visit and&#xD;
      complete a hypothetical experimental tobacco marketplace. One month (4 weeks) after the final&#xD;
      study visit (week 9), participants will complete a 30-day follow-up of cigarette smoking and&#xD;
      other tobacco use behavior.&#xD;
