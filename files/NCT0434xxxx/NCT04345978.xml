    <textblock>
      In 2018, colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumor in terms of morbidity and&#xD;
      second mortality in the world. Surgical resection is still the main treatment for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.With the introduction of the ERAS, the latest international and domestic guidelines&#xD;
      for fasting before surgery all advocate shortening the fasting time. For example, 2 hours&#xD;
      before surgery, oral take cleared fluids, including water, sugar water, fruit juice, tea and&#xD;
      black coffee (without milk) is allowed.Solid food can be consumed 4 hours before surgery, and&#xD;
      oral diet should be resumed as soon as possible after surgery. Changes in diet, nutritional&#xD;
      status, and physical activity are closely related to the incidence of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Therefore, we believe that the intestine may be very sensitive to different fasting times&#xD;
      during the perioperative period. Prolonging the fasting time may improve the prognosis by&#xD;
      improving postoperative insulin resistance, reducing inflammation and protecting anti-tumor&#xD;
      immune function in patients with colorectal cancer.Prolonged fasting time seems to be&#xD;
      contrary to the results of some studies, and whether it is applicable to patients with tumor&#xD;
      surgery is unclear. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct large-scale, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical studies to clarify the most suitable perioperative fasting&#xD;
      strategy (including composition, interval, and amount) for cancer patients, which can not&#xD;
      only reduce surgical stress and speed up postoperative rehabilitation,reduce postoperative&#xD;
      metastasis and recurrence and improve mid- and long-term prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As early as a century ago, Investigators proved that diet restriction can prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of transplanted tumors in mice. Following this milestone, many animal studies&#xD;
      (from mice to primates) have confirmed that diet restriction can slow the development of&#xD;
      spontaneous tumors and transplanted tumors. A study of macaque monkeys for more than 20 years&#xD;
      revealed that restricting diet by 30% can reduce the incidence of tumors by 50%, which makes&#xD;
      people see the potential value of restricting diet to humans. However, whether diet&#xD;
      restriction can also reduce the incidence of human tumors is not entirely clear. The growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells requires a nutrient-rich environment, and the lack of glucose and amino acids&#xD;
      caused by diet restrictions is very detrimental to tumor cells. Unlike normal cells, tumor&#xD;
      cells mainly rely on glycolysis (Warburg effect) rather than energy and biosynthetic&#xD;
      precursors provided by oxidative phosphorylation for proliferation. These characteristics&#xD;
      make tumor cells extremely sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment, which is&#xD;
      called differential stress sensitization (DSS).Investigators found that the use of low sugar&#xD;
      and low serum in a cell model to simulate periodic fasting can enhance the sensitivity of&#xD;
      human or animal tumor cells to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and also found that they&#xD;
      were transplanted subcutaneously in mice Melanoma or breast cancer, diet combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy is better than chemotherapy alone; in the mouse metastatic neuroblastoma model,&#xD;
      fasting before high-dose chemotherapy can successfully reduce the toxic side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs and reduce metastasis and prolong the tumor-free survival. Surgery and&#xD;
      stress are twin brothers. Surgical resection, blood flow blockage, ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury, tissue damage, local inflammatory factor release, and changes in systemic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and metabolism all affect blood flow, blood coagulation, and immune function.&#xD;
      Investgators found restricted diet can reduce the inflammatory response after myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Many animal experiments have confirmed that&#xD;
      perioperative fasting can effectively protect the liver, kidneys, and brain from organ&#xD;
      damage. The specific mechanism may be related to fasting increasing antioxidant enzyme&#xD;
      activity, reducing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and activating the autophagy&#xD;
      pathway. Similar to chemotherapy, there is currently no randomized clinical controlled study&#xD;
      to evaluate the impact of individualized perioperative dietary regimens (such as restricted&#xD;
      diet) on the prognosis of tumor surgery.&#xD;
