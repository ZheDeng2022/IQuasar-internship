  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a single-center, open-label, prospective, controlled, clinical study, it is planned to&#xD;
      include 300 patients hospitalized in the cardiology department of SBHI Penza regional&#xD;
      clinical hospital n.a. N.N. Burdenko. Recruitment of patients will be carried out at the&#xD;
      Department of Therapy of the Medical Institute of the Penza State University. Patients&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting the exclusion criteria will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin is prescribed at a dose of 80 mg / day&#xD;
      from the first 24-96 hours of AMI in addition to the standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no achievement of the target level of LDL-C, ≤1.5 mmol / L after 5-6 weeks from&#xD;
      the AMI onset, patients additionally receive ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg 1 time / day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard AMI treatment includes dual antiplatelet therapy, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers (if&#xD;
      indicated). Prescription of proton pump inhibitors and nitrates is possible (if indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total follow-up is 96 weeks. Prescreening - 600 people; screening and randomization - 300&#xD;
      people. Parameters of electrical myocardial heterogeneity, myocardial deformation&#xD;
      characteristics, vascular rigidity, and quality of life will be assessed according to the&#xD;
      study plan.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood chemistry test. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, AST, ALT, CPK,&#xD;
           glucose, CRP, creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2D and 3D transthoracic echocardiography (Vivid GE 95 Healthcare (USA). 3D speckle&#xD;
           echocardiography (3DSTE) for a detailed study of the phase-by-phase movement and spatial&#xD;
           interaction of all muscle layers of the left ventricle in different phases of the&#xD;
           cardiac cycle to obtain quantitative values of the deformation of the left ventricle&#xD;
           individual segments in the longitudinal, circumferential and radial directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The analysis of standard indicators of echocardiography: biplane ejection fraction&#xD;
           according to the Simpson method, 3D ejection fraction, EDV (end-diastolic volume), ESV&#xD;
           (end-systolic volume) and their indices. The left ventricular myocardial mass index&#xD;
           (LVMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using a tissue doppler, the parameters characterizing the diastolic function are&#xD;
           recorded: the LA volume, the early diastolic velocity of the mitral valve fibrous ring,&#xD;
           the ratio of the early diastolic transmitral flow E to the average early diastolic speed&#xD;
           of the fibrous ring e´, and the maximum tricuspid regurgitation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Myocardial strain is analyzed using specialized software - EchoPac Software Only&#xD;
           (General Electric Co., 2018). For three-dimensional strain analysis, the left ventricle&#xD;
           is automatically divided into 17 segments using standard segmentation schemes. The&#xD;
           software allows obtaining strain values in the endocardial, middle and epicardial layers&#xD;
           of the myocardium. Over a period of time, indicators for each segment are automatically&#xD;
           calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
           longitudinal strain/strain rate (LS,%/LSR, cm / s-1), circumferential strain/strain rate&#xD;
           (CS,%/CSR, cm / s-1), radial strain/strain rate(RS,%/RSR, cm / s-1), area strain),&#xD;
           rotation, rotation along the axis of the left ventricle (Torsion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term ECG monitoring over 3 leads with an assessment of the parameters of myocardial&#xD;
           electrical instability A long-term ECG recording (120 hours) in patients with myocardial&#xD;
           infarction will be performed using the Astrocard ECG system (CJSC Meditek, Russia) with&#xD;
           3-channel recorders. Long-term recordings will be analyzed separately for 3 time&#xD;
           intervals: 24, 72 and 120 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pauses of rhythm, rhythm disturbances - extrasystole, unstable tachycardia, AF paroxysm&#xD;
           and atrial flutter, ventricular fibrillation, conduction disturbance will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of the ST segment dynamics will be carried out with detection of ischemia&#xD;
           episodes, which will be detected when the ST segment is displaced ≥10 mV from the&#xD;
           baseline 80 ms after the J point for at least 1 min - episodes of elevation and&#xD;
           depression of the ST segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the long-term ECG monitoring recordings, the following parameters will be&#xD;
           analyzed (separately for 3 intervals - 24, 72 and 120 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
           circadian dynamics of heart rate; late ventricular potentials (LVP); variance and&#xD;
           duration of the QT interval; heart rate variability (HRV); heart rate turbulence (TCP);&#xD;
           chronotropic load (CL). Circadian dynamics of heart rate. The circadian dynamics of&#xD;
           heart rate will be analyzed with an estimate of the minimum, average and maximum heart&#xD;
           rate per day, during waking hours and night sleep. The circadian index (CI) will be&#xD;
           defined as the ratio of the average heart rate in the daytime and the average heart rate&#xD;
           in the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
           LVP. The LVP will be evaluated in the standard averaging mode in the range of 40-100 Hz&#xD;
           by the noise level not exceeding 0.9 μV. Records of the 24-h ECG in patients who have a&#xD;
           decrease in intraventricular conduction, bundle branches blockade, will not be subjected&#xD;
           to LVP analysis. An automatic analysis of late post-depolarization begins with a search&#xD;
           for the QRS reference complex, which will be used later as a reference for averaging.&#xD;
           Subsequently, the ECG signal will be processed programmatically by the time analysis&#xD;
           method, at the end of which the following parameters will be evaluated: the width of the&#xD;
           filtered QRS complex (QRSf), the duration of the low-amplitude potentials at the end of&#xD;
           the QRS complex of the final part of the complex (HFLA), the rms value of the last 40 ms&#xD;
           QRS (RMS ) Dispersion and QT interval duration. For a detailed study of the&#xD;
           repolarization process in the analysis of records, close attention will be paid to the&#xD;
           analysis of the duration, variability and variance of the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HRV. The following HRV time indicators will be considered:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean NN (ms) - average value of all RR-intervals;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SDNN (ms) - standard deviation of the average values of RR-intervals;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SDNNi (ms) - average value of standard deviations RR for 5-minute recording&#xD;
                periods;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SDANN (ms) is the standard deviation of the mean values of the sinus intervals RR&#xD;
                for 5 min;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  rMSSD (ms) is the square root of the sum of the differences of subsequent RR&#xD;
                intervals;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pNN50 (%) is the percentage of successive RR intervals differing by more than 50&#xD;
                ms;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HRVti - triangular index;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TINN is the index of triangular interpolation of the histogram of RR-intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HRV frequency parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TotP (ms2) is the power of the total spectrum;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ULfP (ms2) - spectrum power in the ultralow frequency range;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  VLfP (ms2) is the power of the spectrum within very low frequencies;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LfP (ms2) - low-frequency range of frequencies; HfP (ms2) - high-frequency&#xD;
                component of HRV; L / H - an indicator of the balance of the vagosympathetic&#xD;
                balance. Evaluation of the above HRV parameters will be carried out per day, night&#xD;
                and day hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TCP is characterized by two independent parameters - the beginning of turbulence (TO)&#xD;
           and the slope of turbulence (TS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Heart CL is assessed by the level and duration of exceeding the actual (observed in the&#xD;
           patient during monitoring) heart rate values of the threshold heart rate calculated&#xD;
           individually according to the proposed formulas with differentiation for periods of&#xD;
           wakefulness and night sleep:&#xD;
&#xD;
           THR-W (bpm) = HRmax (bpm) × 0.45, where THR-W is the threshold value of the heart rate&#xD;
           during wakeful hours in beats per minute, heart rate max is the age-appropriate value of&#xD;
           the maximum possible heart rate in beats per minute, 0.45 is the coefficient of the&#xD;
           threshold level of heart rate; THR-S (bpm) = THR-W (bpm): 1.24, where THR-S (bpm) is the&#xD;
           threshold value of the heart rate during the night's sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ultrasound of the common carotid arteries with RF high frequency signal technology The&#xD;
           study of local vascular stiffness by high-frequency RF signal technology using&#xD;
           ultrasound of the common carotid arteries (CCA) will be carried out in B mode using&#xD;
           MyLab 90 (Esaote, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RF signal technology includes two programs: RF-QIMT and RF-QAS. The following CCA&#xD;
           indicators are analyzed: IMT - intima-media thickness, loc Psys - local systolic&#xD;
           pressure in the carotid artery, loc Pdia - local diastolic pressure, P (T1) - pressure&#xD;
           at the local point, stiffness indices β and α, DC is the coefficient of lateral&#xD;
           distensibility, CC - coefficient of lateral compliance, Aix is the augmentation index,&#xD;
           AP is the amplification pressure, PWV is the local pulse wave velocity in the carotid&#xD;
           artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ultrasound of the brachiocephalic and femoral arteries The brachiocephalic and femoral&#xD;
           arteries will be scanned using a Vivid GE 95 ultrasound scanner (Healthcare, USA) using&#xD;
           a linear sensor in B-mode, spectral Doppler imaging and color Doppler imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative analysis of atherosclerotic plaque includes determining the extent and&#xD;
           degree of narrowing of the lumen of the vessel (percentage of stenosis) by the&#xD;
           cross-sectional area (Sa) of the vessel:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sa = (A1 - A2) × 100% / A1, where A1 is the true cross-sectional area of the vessel, A2&#xD;
           is the passable cross-sectional area of the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Applanation tonometry. SphygmoCor apparatus (AtCor Medical, Australia) uses pulsed wave&#xD;
           to calculate the characteristics of central pressure in aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The applanation tonometry technique includes two programs: PWA and PWV. The first allows&#xD;
           to record central aortic pressure indicators: systolic aortic pressure - SBPao,&#xD;
           diastolic - DBPao, pulse - PPao, mean hemodynamic - MBPao based on registration of the&#xD;
           radial artery PWV. Using the PWV program, sequential recording of PWV from the common&#xD;
           carotid and femoral arteries simultaneously with the ECG channel analyzes the PWV in the&#xD;
           aorta (cfPWV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Volume sphygmography. The measurements will be carried out with the VS-1000 device&#xD;
           (Fukuda Denshi, Japan) while simultaneously recording plethysmograms on four limbs&#xD;
           (using cuffs), ECG, phonocardiogram, and PWV on the carotid and femoral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PWV is evaluated in different parts of the circulatory system (i.e., aorta (PWV),&#xD;
           predominantly elastic arteries (R/L-PWV) and predominantly muscular arteries (B-PWV)).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) is determined - an indicator that reflects the true&#xD;
           stiffness of the vascular wall. CAVI is calculated by registering PWV at two points and&#xD;
           measuring SBP and DBP. Additionally augmentation index and biological age will be&#xD;
           calculated automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Flow-mediated dilation. Endothelial function is evaluated by ultrasonic determination of&#xD;
           flow-mediated dilation (FMD) during the postocclusive reactive hyperemia test using the&#xD;
           method described by D. Celenmajer et. al.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Six-minute walk (6MW) test. The patient should not take cardiological drugs and should&#xD;
           not smoke within at least 2 hours before the test. Before the 6MW test, the patient&#xD;
           should have a 10-minute quiet rest in a sitting position. During this rest period, the&#xD;
           following text should be read to the patient: &quot;You will have to walk for 6 minutes,&#xD;
           without using continuous running or alternate running and walking, with the aim to cover&#xD;
           a maximum distance. You will walk back and forth along the corridor. You can slow down&#xD;
           the pace, stop and have a rest in case of dyspnea or weakness. You can lean against the&#xD;
           wall during rest. Then, you will have to resume the walk. Remember that your aim is to&#xD;
           cover maximum distance in 6 minutes.&quot; At the 6-minute time point, the patient should be&#xD;
           asked to stop and stand still until the covered distance has been measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Computer Pulse Oximetry. During the 6-minute walk test, computer pulse oximetry is&#xD;
           planned on a PulseOx 7500 instrument (SPO medical, Israel) to study saturation dynamics&#xD;
           in comparison groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Treatment compliance will be evaluated by standard methods (counting the remaining&#xD;
           tablets). Morisky-Green Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Quality of Life Assessment. The following questionnaires are planned to be completed:&#xD;
           Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), Minnesota Questionnaire, Clinical Assessment Scale&#xD;
           for CHF (MQCAS) (modified by Mareev VY, 2000), analog-visual scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Assessment of physical activity. It is planned to fill out a questionnaire for assessing&#xD;
           the level of physical activity and a short international questionnaire for determining&#xD;
           the physical activity of the International Questionnaire On Physical Activity - IPAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Assessment of Anxiety Depression. An analysis of anxiety and depressive disorders in&#xD;
           patients using the hospital scale of anxiety and depression (HADS) is planned&#xD;
