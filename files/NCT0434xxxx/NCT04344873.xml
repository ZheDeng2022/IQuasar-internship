  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States and other industrialized societies, and advanced age is the major risk factor for&#xD;
      development of CVD. Advancing age appears to exert its pathological influence primarily via&#xD;
      adverse functional and structural effects on arteries. Aging is associated with increased&#xD;
      stiffness (reduced compliance) of large elastic arteries and impaired arterial endothelial&#xD;
      function that is characterized by reductions in nitric oxide (NO)- mediated&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD). While several changes to arteries may contribute to&#xD;
      age-associated increases in CVD risk; the development of endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      stiffening of the large elastic arteries are among the most important contributors. Both are&#xD;
      predictors of CV events and clinical CVD with increasing age. Although the importance of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening with age are well established, the initiating&#xD;
      events of these deleterious changes are elusive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced age is the primary and most predictive risk factor for CVD. The investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated that there is a pronounced age-associated increase in T cell infiltration into&#xD;
      the perivascular space around large elastic arteries and small resistance arteries. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine if and how T cells contribute to age-related arterial&#xD;
      inflammation and dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is evidence from rodent studies that T cells play a critical role in arterial&#xD;
      dysfunction, it is unknown whether this occurs in humans. Abatacept, a T cell co-stimulation&#xD;
      inhibitor, is FDA approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, Abatacept&#xD;
      decreases the inflammatory phenotype of circulating T cells. Abatacept will be used in older&#xD;
      adults to be the first to determine if T cell inflammation contributes to arterial&#xD;
      dysfunction in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that older adults treated with&#xD;
      Abatacept will exhibit greater flow-mediated dilation, decreased pulse wave velocity,&#xD;
      decreased or unchanged blood pressure, decreased inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in&#xD;
      endothelial cells, decreased plasma free radicals, decreased proportion of memory T cells,&#xD;
      and experience a shift away from a pro-inflammatory T cell phenotype compared to placebo.&#xD;
      These results will be interpreted to mean that T cells play a role in mediating age-related&#xD;
      arterial dysfunction in humans.&#xD;
