  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of low dose oral selinexor&#xD;
      (KPT-330) and to evaluate the clinical recovery, the viral load, length of hospitalization&#xD;
      and the rate of morbidity and mortality in participants with severe COVID-19 compared to&#xD;
      placebo. The study had 2 arms and evaluated selinexor 20 mg + standard of care (SoC) and&#xD;
      placebo + SoC. As the treatment for COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, the SoC varied over time&#xD;
      and across regions of the world.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration up to Day 58</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs are defined as those AEs that develop or worsen after the first dose of study drug. TEAEs included both Serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs are defined as those AEs that develop or worsen after the first dose of study drug. TEAEs included both Serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
