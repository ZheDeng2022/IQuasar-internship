  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial asthma is characterized by the presence of symptoms that vary over time and of&#xD;
      severity. Asthma symptoms tend to worsen at night and in the early hours of the morning, and&#xD;
      the presence of nocturnal symptoms is an important indicator of therapeutic intervention in&#xD;
      order to control the severity of the disease. Aim of the study is to investigate sleep&#xD;
      disorders and quality, as well as and depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients affected by&#xD;
      severe asthma before and after 6 months of treatment with monoclonal therapy. An&#xD;
      observational, cohort, prospective, monocentric study will be conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      subjective quality of sleep at baseline and post monoclonal treatment.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous and highly prevalent disease; moreover, it represents one&#xD;
      of the main cost of the Italian National Health Care System. According to international&#xD;
      guidelines, asthma is characterized by the presence of symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnoea,&#xD;
      chest tightness and / or cough, and limitation of expiratory air flow, that vary over time&#xD;
      and of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main therapy consists of the use of inhaled corticosteroids in order to reduce airway&#xD;
      inflammation; however, in conditions characterized by frequent exacerbations, patients take&#xD;
      oral corticosteroids (OCS) cyclically or chronically to control their symptoms. Asthma&#xD;
      symptoms tend to worsen at night and in the early hours of the morning, and the presence of&#xD;
      nocturnal symptoms is an important indicator of therapeutic intervention in order to control&#xD;
      the severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that nocturnal symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are&#xD;
      associated with circadian oscillations of airway inflammation and physiological variables,&#xD;
      with consequent air flow limitation of and bronchial hyperreactivity. Moreover, it is known&#xD;
      that patients receiving OCS are subjected to significant alterations of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenergic axis function, therefore the assumption of these drugs&#xD;
      could cause a modification of the circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since sleep fragmentation that accompanies the worsening of nocturnal asthmatic symptoms is&#xD;
      probably caused by the degree of severity of nocturnal bronchoconstriction, it is possible&#xD;
      that severe asthmatic patients have greater bronchoconstriction and therefore more disturbed&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with severe asthma, the 5-10% of the total asthmatic population, report symptoms&#xD;
      that persist despite inhalation therapy, and have many exacerbations, Emergency Room access&#xD;
      or hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients use systemic steroids at least twice a year due to asthmatic exacerbations and&#xD;
      / or continuous therapy with systemic steroids for at least 6 consecutive months, with the&#xD;
      development of side effects such as high blood pressure, overweight, meta-steroid diabetes&#xD;
      and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last ten years, the availability of alternative therapies such as monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, which block the inflammatory cascade at different levels (Anti Immunoglobulin E,&#xD;
      Anti interleukin-5 (II-5)e anti receptor Il-5) has allowed to reduce the dosage of steroid&#xD;
      therapy up to its complete suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is one of the most common asthma comorbidities, especially&#xD;
      severe, affecting about 26% of patients. When evaluated with polysomnography, the prevalence&#xD;
      of OSA is equal to 88% in patients with severe asthma and 58% in those with moderate asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that OSA could contribute to asthma exacerbations, to diurnal and nocturnal symptoms&#xD;
      and to the scarce quality of life; it also seems to modulate airway inflammation and&#xD;
      remodeling. Asthmatic patients with OSA show a greater decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in&#xD;
      the first second (FEV1) over time than non-OSA, and Continuous Positive Airways Pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) treatment seems to slow down this deterioration. Serrano Pariente et al. have&#xD;
      demonstrated that 6 months CPAP treatment improves the outcomes of Asthma in patients with&#xD;
      moderate OSA. Finally, a recent study has shown that patients with poorly controlled asthma&#xD;
      tend to have worse sleep quality and greater diurnal sleepiness. The same study has&#xD;
      demonstrated a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in female patients with poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to investigate sleep disorders and quality, as well as and depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms in patients affected by severe asthma before and after 6 months of treatment&#xD;
      with monoclonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is to evaluate subjective quality of sleep at baseline and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are: to verify pre and post treatment: the presence of insomnia,&#xD;
      respiratory disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, diurnal sleepiness or anxiety and&#xD;
      depression symptoms.&#xD;
