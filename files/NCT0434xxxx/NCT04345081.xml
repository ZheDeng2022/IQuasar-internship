      This is a response-adaptive (RAR) prospective randomized study with a long-term follow-up and&#xD;
      the aim of this clinical study is to measure with qualitative and quantitative indicators the&#xD;
      changes in cosmetic results, quality of life and patient satisfaction after delayed-&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction with standardized technique Skin Reducing Nipple sparing&#xD;
      mastectomy, SRNSM and SSM with standardized horizontal skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our hypothesis, SRNSM with standardized technique on pendulous/ ptotic breasts&#xD;
      is a safe procedure compared to SSM. It also promotes the cosmetic efficacy of SRNSM with the&#xD;
      removal of the entire glandular tissue through avoidance of the reduction of projection, the&#xD;
      need later nipple reconstruction surgery and of areola tattoo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we propose that compared to one of the well-known and widely investigated&#xD;
      studied SSM, our current standardized SRNSM technique is able to perform similar&#xD;
      oncologically safe entire gland tissue removal, with low complication rate, accommodating for&#xD;
      adjuvant treatments. Furthermore, it may provide superior cosmetic results than SSM (NAC is&#xD;
      not removed, projection is maintained, and there is no need for further nipple reconstruction&#xD;
      or tattoo) with high patient satisfaction which is maintained long term.&#xD;

      Introduction The indication of total breast removal is primarily the part of a correct&#xD;
      oncological therapy, but secondly the removal of the full parenchyma can be prophylactic&#xD;
      among high risk patients with positive genetic testing. In modern breast surgery, mastectomy&#xD;
      means the removal of the entire glandular tissue. Surgery can be done in the absence of&#xD;
      contraindication (eg. skin infiltration, mastitis carcinomatosis), by preserving the&#xD;
      nipple-areola complex (NAC) and the skin layer above the parenchyma (nipple-sparing&#xD;
      mastectomy, NSM) by removal of the whole or a part of the NAC (skin-sparing mastectomy, SSM)&#xD;
      or by removal of the nipple but with the preservation of the areola (areola-sparing&#xD;
      mastectomy, ASM). It is important to emphasize that similarly to the classic simplex&#xD;
      mastectomy in the cases of SSM, ASM and NSM techniques provided by an experienced and&#xD;
      qualified breast surgeon, the complete oncological removal of the mammary gland is done[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The essence of advanced mastectomy techniques is that they ensure the combination of radical&#xD;
      oncological resection and immediate (immediate breast reconstruction, IBR) or&#xD;
      delayed-immediate breast reconstructive surgery (delayed immediate breast reconstruction,&#xD;
      D-IBR) (insertion of a tissue expander during the first operation, then as a second step&#xD;
      replace it with a silicone implant). It avoids all the burden and negative effects of distant&#xD;
      flap surgery, like donor scars, loss of movements etc. One or two-step post-mastectomy breast&#xD;
      reconstructive surgeries are mainly implant-based techniques and less commonly autologous&#xD;
      tissue techniques like distant pedicle flaps or free flaps. The tissue expander or silicone&#xD;
      implant is placed primarily in a submuscular position but also can be inserted in a&#xD;
      subcutaneous position in front of the large pectoral muscle. The coverage of the lower pole&#xD;
      or even the entire surface of the implant may be strengthened with biological (so-called&#xD;
      acellular dermal matrix) or synthetic materials (Ultrapro mesh) to reduce the pressure load&#xD;
      of the implant on the preserved skin, the consequent skin perforation and so the loss of the&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international literature of immediate or delayed-immediate postmastectomy breast&#xD;
      reconstructive techniques is extensive and the correlation between these procedures and the&#xD;
      oncological treatments (such as adjuvant radiotherapy) are well known [2]. According to the&#xD;
      currently available evidence, reconstructive techniques do not adversely affect oncological&#xD;
      outcome, so these breast surgical techniques are nowadays considered standard procedures in&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer surgery[3]. Postmastectomy breast reconstruction surgeries are&#xD;
      well-known as effective rehabilitation procedures, with significant psycho-oncological&#xD;
      benefits to patients with low complication rates and high patient satisfaction. [4, 5].&#xD;
      Postmastectomy breast reconstructive surgery however require more sophisticated surgical&#xD;
      techniques, special expertise, longer surgical time and significantly higher costs than&#xD;
      simplex mastectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting the type of advanced mastectomy (SSM/NSM/ASM) of breast cancer depends on the&#xD;
      location of the lesion, the size of the breast and its ptosis. Absolute contraindications of&#xD;
      NSM are Paget disease of the nipple, bloody discharge, skin and nipple infiltration. Relative&#xD;
      contraindications comprise pendolous/ptotic or large/larger sized breast and a distance&#xD;
      between the nipple and tumor of less than 2cm. To achieve best cosmetic results, sparing the&#xD;
      NAC became of prime importance, with widespread use of skin-sparing mastectomies. Sparing the&#xD;
      skin layer and the NAC during removal of the entire glandular tissue promotes the efficiency&#xD;
      of breast reconstruction by avoiding the reduction of projection, nipple reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery and nipple tattoo. The cosmetic results and quality of life of those patients who had&#xD;
      SSM instead of having NSM due to pendolous/ptotic breast are provenly unfavorable [6].&#xD;
      Numerous studies have proven that NSM with proper technique is an oncologically reliable&#xD;
      method, hence it has become the part of several international protocols [7]. In the case of&#xD;
      the high volume pendulous/ ptotic breasts, NSM and optimal implant-based breast&#xD;
      reconstruction are achievable only by reduction of the skin-layer of the breast. The optimal&#xD;
      surgical technique of skin-reducing nipple sparing mastectomy (SRNSM) has not been&#xD;
      standardized yet. Due to the lack of high quality evidence and knowledge relating to the&#xD;
      blood supply of NAC, safety of the procedure, complication rate, and oncological radicality&#xD;
      the technique has not gained widespread popularity[8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our present study validates the SRNSM operative technique, and also compares its results to&#xD;
      that of classic SSM and delayed- immediate reconstruction in a response- adaptive prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study This is a response-adaptive (RAR) [10] prospective randomized study with a&#xD;
      long-term follow-up and the aim of this clinical study is to measure with qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative indicators the changes in cosmetic results, quality of life and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after delayed- immediate breast reconstruction with standardized technique Skin&#xD;
      Reducing Nipple sparing mastectomy, SRNSM and SSM with standardized horizontal skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our hypothesis, SRNSM with standardized technique on pendulous/ ptotic breasts&#xD;
      is a safe procedure compared to SSM. It also promotes the cosmetic efficacy of SRNSM with the&#xD;
      removal of the entire glandular tissue through avoidance of the reduction of projection, the&#xD;
      need later nipple reconstruction surgery and of areola tattoo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we propose that compared to one of the well-known and widely investigated&#xD;
      studied SSM, our current standardized SRNSM technique is able to perform similar&#xD;
      oncologically safe entire gland tissue removal, with low complication rate, accommodating for&#xD;
      adjuvant treatments. Furthermore, it may provide superior cosmetic results than SSM (NAC is&#xD;
      not removed, projection is maintained, and there is no need for further nipple reconstruction&#xD;
      or tattoo) with high patient satisfaction which is maintained long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and method Participation in the study is voluntary. In this response-adaptive (RAR)&#xD;
      prospective randomized study, the used standardized SSM are considered to be routine&#xD;
      procedures in the literature and in our department as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to literature the SRNSM technique in not a widely used procedure. The&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery after SSM or SRNSM do not represent new surgical procedures for our&#xD;
      patients either in their technique nor in the indication, this prospective trial guarantee&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data collection only. Applied oncological therapies are&#xD;
      unaffected by the study and still follows the decisions of the Institute's preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative multidisciplinary breast cancer committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not change the complex oncological treatment in any way compared to the&#xD;
      institute's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response-adaptive classification in this study means that the choice of the optimal surgical&#xD;
      technique for the patient is not affected by the clinical trial. The selection of the&#xD;
      surgical technique is based on the decision-making models that we use for a long time&#xD;
      (absolute and relative contraindications), and made individually for the patient's&#xD;
      oncological disease (eg. nipple removal), locations of the tumor, in accordance of the&#xD;
      involvement of the skin and the existence of Paget's disease (SRNSM vs SSM), which is the&#xD;
      same way as we treat our patients out-of-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in a scientific sense, this study does not involve treatments other than routine&#xD;
      treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using correlation analysis to measure objective changes and the changes over time in&#xD;
      oncological control, cosmetic results, quality of life and patient satisfaction achieved by&#xD;
      different surgical techniques at one, two, three, four, and five years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Filling out the BREAST-Q questionnaire [11]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, weight, body mass, BMI, skin type typisation (normal, atypical, seborrheals, dehidrated,&#xD;
      hyperhydrated (oedamatic)), preoperative cup size, presence of preoperative breast assymetry&#xD;
      and its severity , past history, medication, smoking habits, oncological data, cTNM, pTN,&#xD;

      primary reconstruction, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, type of axillary treatment, , the&#xD;
      size of used silicone implant(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications were classified following Clavien-Dindo Classification. [12, 13]&#xD;
      Grade I complication does not require medication or surgical treatment (light inflammations,&#xD;
      non-surgical haematoma or suffusion, seroma formation, partial skin/NAC loss, limited fat&#xD;
      necrosis, SSI and lymphoedema). Grade II complication is a Grade I complication that requires&#xD;
      medication or surgical interaction (antibiotic therapy, resuture due SSI and multiple&#xD;
      puncture due chronic seroma). Grade III complication requires invasive surgical action&#xD;
      (haematoma evacuation, chronic inflammation which requires reoperation, severe fat necrosis,&#xD;
      full skin/ NAC necrosis and wound dehiscense). Grade IV complication means temporary organ&#xD;
      failure. Grade V complication is one that leads to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data are collected in this trial: preoperative jugulum-nipple width,&#xD;
      nipple-midline width, nipple-IMF width, vertical and horizontal width of the areola, Regnault&#xD;
      Classification of the breast ptosis then repeating the above measurements during the&#xD;
      follow-up (every 6 months) with parallel photo documentation and data recording of the&#xD;
      BREAST-Q questionnaire and 5 point Likert-scale. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patient who require unilateral SSM or SRNSM have undergone preoperative photo&#xD;
      documentation, they filled out preoperative BREAST Q questionnaire and Regnault&#xD;
      Classification of the breast ptosis. In case of neoadjuvant therapy, the procedure is the&#xD;
      same and the patient selection and data recording are performed preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients after modern removal of the mammary gland (SSM or SRNSM) receive adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy based on the decision of the multidisciplinary breast cancer board of the Institute.&#xD;
      The patients have undergone body measurements, postoperative photo documentation; they filled&#xD;
      out postoperative BREAST Q questionnaire in the 4-6. week then 3rd and 6th months then every&#xD;
      6 months . Patients follow up is until the end of the 5th postoperative year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical therapy The treatment of the patients examined in the study relied on the techniques&#xD;
      of the Breast and Sarcoma Department of the National Cancer Institute including standardized&#xD;
      SSM in the SM control group. (See the detailed description of these: Z Mátrai, G Gulyás, T&#xD;
      Kovács, M Kásler Principles and practice of oncoplastic breast surgery. Medicina Kiadó Zrt,&#xD;
      2019. 11.6. Skin-sparing and areola-sparing mastectomy) [15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the valid protocol of the National Cancer Institute, the surgery of the axilla&#xD;
      can be either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymphadenectomy/ axillary block&#xD;
      dissection, if needed with radiotherapy of the axillary and supraclavicular region depending&#xD;
      on the regional stage of the breast cancer. (see as well in Z Mátrai, G Gulyás, T Kovács, M&#xD;
      Kásler Principles and practice of oncoplastic breast surgery. Medicina Kiadó Zrt, 2019. 8.&#xD;
      fejezet: Tradicional breast surgery, 8.1.2. Axillary lymph nodee dissection; 9. Sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy in breast cancer) [15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      See the detailed standardized techniques of immediate or delayed-immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction below: Z Mátrai, G Gulyás, T Kovács, M Kásler Principles and practice of&#xD;
      oncoplastic breast surgery. Medicina Kiadó Zrt, 2019. 11. fejezet Postmastectomy breast&#xD;
      reconstruction, 11.4. Immediate breast reconstruction, 11.8. Subpectoral/subserratus implant&#xD;
      based breast reconstruction) [15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin reduction and the removal of the entire glandular tissue are selected according to&#xD;
      the ptosis of the breast during SRNSM surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of stage C-D Regnault ptosis in the upright position we mark the skin to be&#xD;
      de-epithelialized, the footprint and the line between the midclavicular point and the nipple&#xD;
      continuing it distally crossing the lower deflection line in accordance to stationary&#xD;
      inverted T technique (Figure 1/A). According to the inverted T-technique, the skin reduction&#xD;
      is carried out with gentle de-epithelization sparing the subdermal plexus. The blood supply&#xD;
      of the nipple is secured from medial direction through the so-called medial dermal flap.&#xD;
      Medial to the NAC, de-epithelialization should be performed with maximum sparing of subdermal&#xD;
      plexus. (Figure 1/B) It is essential to spare the parasternal perforator vessel in the&#xD;
      submuscular then in the subcutan space, therefore preoperative Doppler -ultrasound&#xD;
      localization is carried out. Henceforth the removal of the entire mammary gland is performed&#xD;
      according to the inverted T incision, with a transdermal incision from the NAC leading&#xD;
      laterally and a supplementary T-shape incision in accordance to inverted T technique (Figure&#xD;
      1/C-D), standardized NSM surgery (see the detailed surgical technique below: Z Mátrai, G&#xD;
      Gulyás, T Kovács, M Kásler Principles and practice of oncoplastic breast surgery. Medicina&#xD;
      Kiadó Zrt, 2019. 11.7. Nipple-sparing mastectomy) [15]. It is important to note that during&#xD;
      the removal of the entire glandular tissue and the subpectoral preparation, sparing the 2-4.&#xD;
      perforator vessels is of high priority as these provide blood supply to the medial skin flap&#xD;
      and thereby for the nipple. (Figure 1/E) Following the subcutaneous absorbable stitches the&#xD;
      wound is closed by running suture. The position of the neo NAC and the preparation of the&#xD;
      implant site on the skin layer with further de-epithelialization is determined&#xD;
      intraoperatively; the preferable distance between the IMF and the neo nipple being 7-9 cm.&#xD;
      (Figure 1/F)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using and collecting cosmetic results The following data collected in standing position after&#xD;
      marking the midline and the IMF: jugulum-nipple width, nipple-midline width and nipple-IMF&#xD;
      width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breast ptosis examination performed to Regnault Classification at the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photo documentation performed the standard way in 5 position (antero-posterior (ap), 45&#xD;
      degree oblique and 90 degree lateral), in ap direction both ways arms up and down with strict&#xD;
      adherence to personal privacy policies. The patients are anonymous on the pictures without&#xD;
      their faces, and the photo documentation performed without jewelry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life is measured by BREAST-Q validated questionnaire. According to this, we&#xD;
      give a score in a 1-100 scale measuring the variables of &quot;satisfaction with the breast&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;discomfort by radiotherapy&quot;, &quot;psychosexual wellbeing&quot; and &quot;physical wellbeing&quot;. We use&#xD;
      preoperatively a preoperative questionnaire and postoperatively a postoperative&#xD;
      questionnaire. Higher rates show better quality of life [11]. The questionnaires are filled&#xD;
      before the procedure and after the surgery in the 3rd months and every 6th months. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is also completed by the simplex mastectomy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use the Likert scale (1. definitely not, 2: no, 3: abstain, 4: agree, 4: definitely agree)&#xD;
      for evaluating the subjective aesthetic outcome based on the photo documentation&#xD;
      (preoperative, 4 weeks after delayed reconstruction with symmetrization, then 3rd and 6th&#xD;
      months and every 6 months 5 years long). Based on the photo documentation three, non-involved&#xD;
      breast surgeons make the evaluation separately without communication. The results are&#xD;
      collected and averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up is similar to the surgical and oncological follow-up in the National&#xD;
           Cancer Institute, so it is not a burden for the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary check-up and data registration performed preoperatively, the second check-up&#xD;
           performed 4-6th weeks then 3rd and 6th postoperative months with photo documentation,&#xD;
           body measurements, body mass calculation and BREAST-Q questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this the photo documentation, body measurements, body mass calculation and&#xD;
           BREAST-Q questionnaire examination performed every 6 months until the 5th year.&#xD;
&#xD;
