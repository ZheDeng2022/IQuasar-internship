  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to reduce the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      and its consequences for an aging U.S. population. To accomplish this, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of an advance care planning (ACP) video&#xD;
      intervention (vs. usual care) among older patients with CKD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The video intervention consists of a video decision aid along with a video declaration&#xD;
      (ViDec), which is recorded by the patient. The video decision aid explores ACP options for&#xD;
      medical care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and reviews hemodialysis, peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis, as well as medical management without dialysis; it also reviews cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR). Patients will also audio- or video-record their preferences using a&#xD;
      tablet. The video will be shared with their nephrologist. The patient will have a copy of the&#xD;
      video to take with them and share with their loved ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will answer survey questions about their preferences, knowledge, decisional&#xD;
      conflict, and ACP engagement. They will be surveyed every two months for one year or death&#xD;
      (if they die before one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from 10 nephrology clinics: Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital (n=75), Brigham and Women's Hospital (n=75), University of Pittsburgh (n=75),&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research,&#xD;
      University of Washington, Renal &amp; Transplant Associates of New England, University of New&#xD;
      Mexico and Boston Medical Center.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Kidney Disease (KD) Specific Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>KD-QOL is a validated instrument to assess QOL that includes 36 questions with response options in likert scale format. The outcome measure is the difference in averaged scores between baseline and 12 months; It is calculated as (Score at visit 2 - Score at visit 1).&#xD;
QOL is assessed by three components; physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score. Physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score are averaged scores of sub-scales. The range of each score and each sub-scale are 0 - 100, and higher values indicate better QOL status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed using a validated instrument EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) which has two components. There is a descriptive system with 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. the other component is a visual analogue scale (VAS) that records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>
