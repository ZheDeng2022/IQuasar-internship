  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Camrelizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either Camrelizumab monotherapy or chemotherapy of&#xD;
      investigators' choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with Camrelizumab prolongs&#xD;
      Progression-free Survival (PFS) in participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin&#xD;
      Lymphoma compared to treatment with Chemotherapy.&#xD;
