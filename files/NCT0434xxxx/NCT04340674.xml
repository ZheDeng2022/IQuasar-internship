  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is the most common cause of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      and is characterized by pain associated with generalizad sensitivity, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      disturbances and psychological problems. Due to the chronic nature of the pathology and the&#xD;
      great dependence on analgesic drugs that it often entails, in these patients it is considered&#xD;
      necessary to provide an individualized approach and provide strategies that allow symptoms to&#xD;
      be controlled conservatively and non-pharmacologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to analyse the immediate effects on pain, mechanical pain&#xD;
      sensitivity, impact of fibromyalgia, pain catastrophizing, psychological distress and&#xD;
      physical function when a telerehabilitation program based on aerobic exercise is applied in&#xD;
      women with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial single-blind&#xD;
      (examiner). The investigators included female patients diagnosed of fibromyalgia according to&#xD;
      the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four women with fibromyalgia are included and randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
      telerehabilitation program group based on aerobic exercise and control group. Exercise group&#xD;
      receive 2 treatment sessions a week over 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the variables are measured at the beginning of intervention and after the intervention.&#xD;
