  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle mass and strength is a well-established outcome of normal aging. Muscle&#xD;
      strength and mobility are also dependent on the quality and strength of connective tissue,&#xD;
      which surrounds skeletal muscle. These layers, which are continuous with tendons, allow for&#xD;
      the effective transfer of tension from skeletal muscle to bone to enable movement.&#xD;
      Importantly, skeletal muscle strength is directly related to connective tissue strength.&#xD;
      Greater tendon connective tissue cross-sectional area and stiffness optimize force transfer&#xD;
      through tendon to maximize musculoskeletal function. As with skeletal muscle, tendon&#xD;
      connective tissue quality declines with age. Previous research indicates that resistance&#xD;
      training can improve muscle strength in older adults, but may not counter the effects of&#xD;
      aging on tendon. The specific problem is that no approaches are available that benefit both&#xD;
      skeletal muscle and tendon health to minimize loss of muscle mass and quality while also&#xD;
      improving connective tissue quality and function in older adults. A critical need exists to&#xD;
      assess approaches that improve both muscle and connective tissue strength and function. This&#xD;
      need is highly relevant for older women, due to their higher risk of sarcopenia than men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training, especially when combined with higher protein intake, has been&#xD;
      consistently shown to improve muscle mass and strength in older adults. Further, emerging&#xD;
      research indicates that diets rich in total and indispensable amino acids (as in beef)&#xD;
      augment exercise-induced improvements in tendon cross-sectional area in rodents and young&#xD;
      humans. However, limited research exists on the impact of beef consumption combined with&#xD;
      resistance training on muscle and tendon tissue outcomes, especially in older women. This&#xD;
      research study will assess the effects of consuming a healthy, protein-rich diet emphasizing&#xD;
      lean beef, compared to a healthy, normal-protein, lower beef diet (control 1), and a healthy&#xD;
      protein-rich, lower beef diet emphasizing non-beef/red meat protein (control 2) on resistance&#xD;
      training-induced changes in muscle and tendon tissue size, strength, and quality in older&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, i.e., loss of muscle mass and strength, is a well-established consequence of&#xD;
      normal aging. Skeletal muscle strength and mobility is also dependent on the composition and&#xD;
      mechanical properties of connective tissue, which encase skeletal muscle allowing for&#xD;
      effective transfer of tension developed during cross-bridge cycling. Importantly, skeletal&#xD;
      muscle strength and function is directly related to connective tissue strength. Specifically,&#xD;
      greater tendon connective tissue cross-sectional area (CSA) and stiffness optimize force&#xD;
      transfer through tendon to maximize musculoskeletal function, including muscle power output,&#xD;
      locomotion economy, and control of balance. As with skeletal muscle, aging leads to the&#xD;
      decline of tendon connective tissue quality, including reductions in tendon collagen (the&#xD;
      primary structural component of tendon), and a decrease in tendon CSA. Previous research&#xD;
      indicates that resistance training (RT) can improve muscle mass and strength in older adults&#xD;
      but may not counter the effects of aging on tendon. Specifically, a 12-week RT protocol&#xD;
      improved tendon properties in young but not older adults. The specific problem is that no&#xD;
      approaches are available that target both skeletal muscle and tendon health to minimize loss&#xD;
      of muscle mass and quality while simultaneously improving connective tissue quality and&#xD;
      function in older adults. Therefore, a critical need exists to scientifically assess&#xD;
      interventions that concomitantly improve muscle and connective tissue strength and function.&#xD;
      This need is highly relevant for older women, due to their higher risk of sarcopenia than&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training, especially when combined with higher protein intake, has been&#xD;
      consistently shown to improve muscle mass and strength in older adults. However, limited&#xD;
      research exists on the impact of beef consumption combined with RT on sarcopenia-related&#xD;
      outcomes, especially in older women. Further, emerging research indicates that diets rich in&#xD;
      leucine or glycine (as in beef) augment resistance or aerobic exercise-induced improvements&#xD;
      in tendon CSA in rodents and young humans. However, the potential benefit of lean proteins,&#xD;
      such as beef, on connective tissue adaptations in older adults requires investigation. This&#xD;
      study will assess the effects of consuming a healthy, protein-rich diet emphasizing lean beef&#xD;
      on RT-induced changes in skeletal muscle and tendon connective tissue size, strength, and&#xD;
      quality in older women. It is hypothesized that consumption of a healthy diet high in protein&#xD;
      from predominately lean beef will augment improvements in both skeletal muscle and tendon&#xD;
      responses to RT, when compared to consuming a healthy diet with normal or high-protein and&#xD;
      less total red meat. The overall healthy diet will be modeled from the U.S. Healthy Eating&#xD;
      Pattern and consistent with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
