      The investigators will conduct a phase II clinical trial of sequential chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor T cell targeting at different B-cell antigens in refractory or relapsed B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia children in Beijing Boren Hospital. The study will be approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review board of Beijing Boren Hospital, and informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All these participants will be matched the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for (r/r) B-ALL according to the WHO classiﬁcation and complete&#xD;
      morphological evaluation, immunophenotype analysis by flow cytometry (FCM), cytogenetic&#xD;
      analysis by routine G-banding karyotype analysis and leukemia fusion gene screening by&#xD;
      multiplex nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Participants will be&#xD;
      eligible if they are heavily treated B-ALL who failed from re-induction chemotherapy after&#xD;
      relapse or continued MRD+ for more than three months, and had positive CD19 and CD22&#xD;
      expressions on leukemia blasts by FCM (&gt;95% CD19 and &gt;95% CD22). After CAR T-cell infusion,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), adverse&#xD;
      effects and relapse will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>CAR-T cells were manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected by leukapheresis and frozen for multiple uses. Before each CAR T-cell infusion (day 0), patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy composing of Fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and Cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2/day) on days -5 to -3. No bridging chemotherapy was given between enrollment and infusion. In sequential CAR-T clinical trials, CAR-T cells will be given twice（anti-CD19 CAR-T first, then anti-CD22 CAR-T). All patients underwent bone marrow (BM) biopsy examination and radiology studies on days 30 and every month to determine the response and remission status. Bone biopsy, MRD status by FCM and RT-PCR (if the patient had fusion gene), and EMDs evaluation by CT/MRI/PET-CT were also conducted before CAR-T cell infusion to determine the disease status.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were diagnosed as primary refractory or relapsed B-ALL.&#xD;
             (Criterion-reference: NCCN, 2020.1); All the patients matched the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
             of ALL according to the WHO classification, and conducted morphological evaluation,&#xD;
             immunophenotype analysis by flow cytometry (FCM), cytogenetic analysis by routine&#xD;
             G-banding karyotype analysis, screen of 56 leukemia-related fusion genes by multiplex&#xD;
             nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and quantification of&#xD;
             fusion genes by real-time PCR with ABL1 as reference. 339 hematological&#xD;
             malignancies-related genes were also screened by Illumina sequencing. Extramedullary&#xD;
             diseases (EMDs) were confirmed CD19+ and CD22+ by FCM and evaluated by positron&#xD;
             emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), CT, MRI or ultrasonography. The&#xD;
             patient relapsed during chemotherapy, failed from re-induction chemotherapy (including&#xD;
