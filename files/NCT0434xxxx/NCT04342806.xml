      The HERO Registry provides a resource for collecting information on Healthcare Workers (HCWs)&#xD;
      currently working in the United States, and their families and communities. The overall goal&#xD;
      of the Registry is to develop the infrastructure necessary to create and engage a community&#xD;
      of people who may be eligible for participation in future research studies, including those&#xD;
      of COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment.&#xD;

      The HERO Registry provides a resource for collecting information on Healthcare Workers (HCWs)&#xD;
      currently working in the United States, and their family members and communities. The overall&#xD;
      goal of the Registry is to create and engage a community of HCWs and their families and&#xD;
      communities who may be eligible for participation in future research studies, including those&#xD;
      of COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment. The HERO registry will create a repository of adults&#xD;
      interested in COVID-19 research that can be eligible for future research studies. The main&#xD;
      objectives of the study are 1) create a virtual community of adult HCWs in the United States,&#xD;
      and their families and communities, 2) Identify adults interested in engaging in upcoming&#xD;
      research studies, including those related to COVID-19, and 3) Create a dataset of health&#xD;
      related measurements, risk factors, and outcomes for future analysis. The population of&#xD;
      interest is adult healthcare workers in the United States, and their families and&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis of the HERO Registry will be exploratory in nature. Analysis may include&#xD;
      descriptive statistics of the cohort, statistical associations between variables of interest,&#xD;
      and predictive modeling for health outcomes and behaviors. Analyses may be conducted on all&#xD;
      participants in the HERO Registry or may be conducted on subpopulations defined based on&#xD;
      clinical, demographic or other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit to the participants for their participation in this study, but the&#xD;
      information obtained will be used in scientific research and may be helpful to the&#xD;
      participant or others in the future. Participants may experience indirect benefits such as&#xD;
      learning about their own health, access to health data, and opportunities to participate in&#xD;
      future research.&#xD;
