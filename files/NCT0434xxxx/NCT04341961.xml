  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk is universally recognized as the best food for newborns. Studies have&#xD;
      scientifically shown that breastfeeding provides optimal nutrients for infants, strengthens&#xD;
      their immune system, and improves mother-and-child bonding. Demonstrating health benefits of&#xD;
      pomegranate consumption on infant health could lead to greater incentive for women to breast&#xD;
      feed. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether pomegranate metabolites&#xD;
      (products produced by breakdown) is secreted into breastmilk and whether they have an effect&#xD;
      on breast-fed infants who are born vaginally.&#xD;

      The study will require participants to continue with their usual diet and to avoid&#xD;
      pomegranate juice (other than what is provided), berries (strawberries, blackberries,&#xD;
      raspberries (red, black, yellow), cranberries), walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, pecans,&#xD;
      chestnuts, red and white guava, pomegranates, flaxseeds, dark chocolate and cocoa, coffee,&#xD;
      tea, rose hip, olives, artichoke, dried herbs and beefsteak tongue mushrooms) . They will be&#xD;
      asked to consume the pomegranate juice daily for 14 days. The pomegranate juice will be&#xD;
      provided to participants. If the participants are unable to complete the study on the 14th&#xD;
      day they will be asked to continue drinking the juice until they are able to complete the&#xD;
      visit. For instance if day 14 falls on a Friday and they cannot come in until Monday&#xD;
      participants will be asked to continue drinking the juice until Monday. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to collect 10ml (or 2 tsp) of breast milk; the collection materials will be provided,&#xD;
      and participant will need to store the specimen in their home refrigerator and dropped off to&#xD;
      the study site within 18-24 hours of the collection time. Participants will also be&#xD;
      instructed to collect their stool and will be provided with the sterile collection materials&#xD;
      and instructions for collection. Participants will be provided with a disposable cooler and&#xD;
      ice packs to keep the specimen refrigerated during transport. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided with a urine collection container and asked to collect all of your urine over a&#xD;
      24-hour period (on 2 separate occasions). Lastly, infant stool and urine will also be&#xD;
      collected using collection bags with an adhesive strip.&#xD;
