  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of eltrombopag in combination with a&#xD;
      short course of high-dose dexamethasone to induce sustained response off treatment in&#xD;
      patients with newly-diagnosed ITP versus 1-3 cycles of dexamethasone monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unmet clinical need and the potential for eltrombopag when added to steroids to improve&#xD;
      the treatment outcome and the potential to induce sustained response off treatment serve as&#xD;
      the basis for clinical investigation of eltrombopag in first-line ITP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, open-label study to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of eltrombopag in combination with a short course of high-dose dexamethasone to 1-3&#xD;
      cycles of high-dose dexamethasone monotherapy, as first-line treatment in adult patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP who have platelet counts &lt; 30 × 109/L and require&#xD;
      treatment will be screened, and if eligible, will be randomized to either Arm A (eltrombopag&#xD;
      in combination with a short course of dexamethasone) or Arm B (1-3 cycles of dexamethasone&#xD;
      monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period: Patients will be screened for 14 days based on the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period: Arm A: Patients will be treated for 26 weeks during the treatment period.&#xD;
      Patients who reach platelet counts ≥ 30 × 109/L and maintain counts ≥ 30 × 109/L during the&#xD;
      tapering phase will be eligible for treatment discontinuation. Duration of tapering before&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation at Week 26 will be 6 weeks. Arm B: Patients will be treated up to&#xD;
      12 weeks during the treatment period. Patients who reach platelet counts ≥ 30 × 109/L and&#xD;
      maintain counts ≥ 30 × 109/L after 1-3 cycles of dexamethasone treatment will be eligible for&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation. Patients with platelet counts &lt; 30 × 109/L after 3 cycles of&#xD;
      dexamethasone treatment will be offered a course of eltrombopag treatment within the study&#xD;
      and will discontinue from study at week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation period: After completion of treatment period, all patients will be observed for&#xD;
      sustained response off treatment until week 52. Only patients with sustained response at week&#xD;
      52 will be followed for another 26 weeks. Patients who relapse between Week 52 and Week 78&#xD;
      will discontinue the study.&#xD;
