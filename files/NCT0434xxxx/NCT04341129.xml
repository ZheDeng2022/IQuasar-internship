      Standard breast MRI studies often have lengthy protocols that make them inherently expensive&#xD;
      and time-consuming. Several studies of the use of abbreviated MRI protocols have shown that&#xD;
      the shorter protocols have diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of the conventional full&#xD;
      MRI protocol. There are also promising results of ultrafast DCE-MRI studies with shorter&#xD;
      breast MRI protocols that provide not only morphologic but also valuable kinetic information&#xD;
      about a lesion. The shorter imaging times achieved with the abbreviated and the ultrafast&#xD;
      DCE-MRI protocols have the potential to increase efficiency and lower cost by decreasing time&#xD;
      in the MRI suite, which in turn may make breast MRI accessible for population-based mass&#xD;
      screening. The focus of the proposed research is the investigation of an abbreviated MRI&#xD;
      protocol with ultrafast imaging using Dotarem® (Gadoterate Meglumine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is second to lung cancer as the leading cause of death among women in the&#xD;
      United States. Over 40,000 women were estimated to die of breast cancer in 2016. Early&#xD;
      detection is key to improved survival, and overall prognosis is directly linked to the stage&#xD;
      of disease at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year relative survival rate has increased since&#xD;
      the mid 1970's, in part owing to improvements in early breast cancer detection with screening&#xD;
      mammography. Screening with mammography is associated with a 16-40% relative reduction in&#xD;
      breast cancer mortality among women aged 40-74 years old, and mammography is the most&#xD;
      cost-effective method of breast cancer screening. However, cancers can be missed at&#xD;
      mammography, particularly in women with dense breasts. Screening with mammography alone may&#xD;
      be insufficient in the screening of women who are at high risk of breast cancer. The need for&#xD;
      more effective screening strategies to supplement mammography in these groups of women has&#xD;
      led to the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI. Of the available modalities for&#xD;
      evaluation of the breast, MRI has been found to have the highest sensitivity for the&#xD;
      detection of breast cancer, irrespective of breast density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of evidence from nonrandomized trials and observational studies, breast MRI is&#xD;
      indicated as a supplement to mammography for patients at high risk with greater than 20%&#xD;
      relative lifetime risk. This cohort of women includes those with: a known BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      genetic mutation, an approximately 20-25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer according&#xD;
      to risk assessment tools, a strong family history of beast or ovarian cancer, a history of&#xD;
      being treated for Hodgkin's disease and certain genetic syndromes (i.e. Li-Fraumeni syndrome,&#xD;
      Cowden syndrome or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome). However, for women at intermediate&#xD;
      risk, including those with dense breast tissue, screening MRI in the United States is not&#xD;
      cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of screening breast MRI depends on estimated breast&#xD;
      cancer incidence and examination cost. The rationale for limiting supplemental screening&#xD;
      breast MRI to those at greatest risk is in part due to its high cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have looked at ways of reducing the cost of breast MRI to improve access to it&#xD;
      as a supplement screening method for women who are not necessarily in the highest risk group.&#xD;
      One way to achieve the efficiency and rapid throughput found with screening mammography is to&#xD;
      shorten screening breast MRI protocols, decrease image acquisition time, and shorten image&#xD;
      interpretation time. Study results have suggested that shorter protocols and shorter&#xD;
      acquisition times can be achieved with maintenance of diagnostic accuracy comparable to that&#xD;
      obtained with conventional MRI protocols. Use of these abbreviated MRI protocols could result&#xD;
      in lower cost and faster throughput, increasing availability and providing women with dense&#xD;
      breasts or at intermediate risk (lifetime risk, 15-20%) greater access to breast MRI.&#xD;
