  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility and acceptability study to inform the development and testing of&#xD;
      a novel communication intervention to support parents in their communication with children&#xD;
      about cancer. The research questions to be answered by this study are whether the&#xD;
      intervention being tested can be feasible and acceptable, and provide preliminary estimates&#xD;
      of improvement in parental psychological distress.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, single center pilot study using a pretest-posttest design to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel psychosocial intervention, Fathers and Mothers&#xD;
      with cancer Communication Tool (Fam-CT). The purpose of the intervention is to decrease&#xD;
      parental anxiety by facilitating parental communication about cancer with their children. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis being tested is that an intervention that assists parents with their&#xD;
      communication needs with their children can be feasible, acceptable, and reduce parental&#xD;
      psychological distress. Findings from this study will inform a future grant application to&#xD;
      further test this intervention in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days, 84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the change in patient's communication self-efficacy. The adapted Communication Self-Efficacy scale is a 9-item Visual Analogue Scale assessing parent's confidence in their ability to tell their child about parental medical illness. The score range is 0 to 900 with higher scores indicating higher confidence.</description>

    <description>Assess the change in patient's communication behaviors using a study-specific communication instrument, the Parental Cancer Communication Questionnaire. The two items that will be used in the measure are: whether the parent discussed their illness with their child (yes/no); and whether the parent had follow-up conversations with their child about their illness (yes/no)</description>
