  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be held to assess the effect of minimal dose muscle relaxant on postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary function. The time to extubation in minutes will be the primary outcome as a&#xD;
      clinical indicator of the return of muscle power. The extubation time will be defined as the&#xD;
      time from injecting the muscle relaxant reversing agent given when regain the train of four&#xD;
      (TOF) ratio to 0.9 till removal of endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative surgical conditions will be assessed in the form of surgeon satisfaction and&#xD;
      the need for more muscle relaxant boluses. Postoperative complications as desaturation&#xD;
      (peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo2) less than 90%), the need for re-intubation or&#xD;
      ventilation support will be recorded. Patient lung will be assessed using ultrasound-based&#xD;
      lung aeration score. Also, the diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle function will be assessed&#xD;
      in the early postoperative period. Immediate postoperative pulmonary function tests will be&#xD;
      evaluated using simple spirometer. Patients will be followed up for 28 days for detection of&#xD;
      pulmonary complications.&#xD;

      After arrival to the operating theater, a thoracic US examination will be done using LUS&#xD;
      dynamic re-aeration score. Patients will be randomly allocated via sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
      into 2 groups of 30 patients each; control (C) group and minimal dose (Min) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For general anesthesia; intubating dose of muscle relaxant will be injected according to the&#xD;
      study group; in C group; atracurium 0.5 mg/kg while in min group 0.2 mg/kg will be injected.&#xD;
      The trial for intubation will be assessed and recorded. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation will&#xD;
      be maintained less than 2 throughout the intraoperative period in the control group. While,&#xD;
      in the min group, boluses of muscle relaxant will be given only upon complain of the surgeon&#xD;
      and after a bolus dose of propofol 0.5 mg/kg. When required, 20% of the initial dose of&#xD;
      muscle relaxant will be provided as a bolus to achieve this goal.&#xD;
