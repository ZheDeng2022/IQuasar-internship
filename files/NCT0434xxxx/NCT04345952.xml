  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is a common strategy used to treat colorectal cancer patients, but is often&#xD;
      leads patients and survivors to experience a host of symptoms, of which acute emotional&#xD;
      distress is a major concern. Smartphone-based meditation via an already-developed app (i.e.,&#xD;
      Calm) is a unique and novel way of providing a potentially helpful symptom-management&#xD;
      strategy to colorectal cancer patients and survivors both during their chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      sessions for the management of distress and between treatment sessions for the management of&#xD;
      other more chronic symptoms. Our hypothesis is that colorectal cancer patients using the Calm&#xD;
      smartphone app throughout their chemotherapy treatment will see lower psychological distress&#xD;
      during individual chemotherapy treatment sessions, greater chemotherapy tolerability, lower&#xD;
      chemotherapy toxicity symptoms, lesser fatigue, and higher quality of life as compared to a&#xD;
      usual care control group. Colorectal cancer patients (N=30) will be randomly assigned to an&#xD;
      intervention (n=15) or control group (n=15) for the duration of their chemotherapy treatment,&#xD;
      with study outcome measurement occurring throughout their treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is a common treatment modality among colorectal cancer patients. Despite&#xD;
      improvements in survival among those receiving chemotherapy, patients often experience side&#xD;
      effects including pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in appetite and weight, fatigue, depressed&#xD;
      mood, and reduced quality of life. Colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy also&#xD;
      experience acute elevation in psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, stress). Worldwide, as&#xD;
      many as 40% of cancer patients currently report using complementary and alternative medicine&#xD;
      (CAM) for the management of their diagnosis and treatment-related side effects. Evidence to&#xD;
      support the efficacy of various CAM approaches is still in its infancy, and further research&#xD;
      is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based strategies, a popular CAM approach among cancer patients, may have unique&#xD;
      benefits for addressing both treatment-related side effects as well as the management of&#xD;
      acute levels of psychological distress experienced while undergoing chemotherapy. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence supports the benefits of meditation, relaxing sounds, and progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation for the reduction of distress and state anxiety as well as the improvement of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine responses, indicative of improved stress response, among cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy. Additionally, meditation has been shown to improve distress,&#xD;
      cognitive function, mental health, quality of life, and chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity&#xD;
      symptoms among cancer patients that had undergone chemotherapy treatment. Despite preliminary&#xD;
      evidence to support mindfulness-based strategies to help cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy, further research is needed to determine their efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphone applications (apps) are a unique mode of delivering mindfulness-based strategies&#xD;
      to cancer patients and may help make CAM more accessible to cancer patients reporting&#xD;
      barriers to participation in in-person interventions (e.g., pain, fatigue, transportation,&#xD;
      scheduling difficulties, etc.). Additionally, smartphone apps are a way of providing&#xD;
      mindfulness-based strategies to patients while undergoing chemotherapy without the need of&#xD;
      specialized personnel to lead mindfulness-based sessions for patients in the clinic.&#xD;
      Smartphone accessibility is becoming more ubiquitous, with nearly three quarters of cancer&#xD;
      patients reporting access to a mobile smartphone. To our knowledge there have been no studies&#xD;
      that have tested the effects of meditation delivered specifically via a smartphone app to&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (one study used an iPad). The investigators have&#xD;
      previously demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary effects of delivering four weeks of&#xD;
      smartphone-based meditation (via the Calm app) to hematological cancer patients to improve&#xD;
      symptom burden. However, these patients were not undergoing chemotherapy. A meditation app&#xD;
      such as Calm could be used to deliver mindfulness-based strategies to cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy while in clinic and outside of clinic for the management of acute&#xD;
      psychological distress and chemotherapy-related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calm app has over 2 million paying users and 65 million downloads, and was named Apple's&#xD;
      &quot;App of the Year&quot; in 2017.9,10 The Calm app was developed based on tenets of mindfulness and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy, and provides its users with a range of mindfulness-based&#xD;
      options to choose from, including meditations, Sleep Stories, and Soundscapes. In the&#xD;
      proposed study, the investigators will investigate the use of Calm among a small sample of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients (N=30; n=15 per group) who are beginning adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      within 12-weeks post-surgery as compared to a usual care control group to determine its&#xD;
      effects on acute psychological distress within a single chemotherapy session as well as&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Investigate the effects of using a meditation app to reduce psychological&#xD;
      distress (measured using the Distress Thermometer), across multiple chemotherapy sessions&#xD;
      (n=15) among colorectal cancer patients as compared to usual control (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this objective is that those using a meditation app will&#xD;
      experience a reduction in psychological distress from beginning to end of each chemotherapy&#xD;
      session as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Investigate the effects of using a meditation app on chemotherapy toxicity and&#xD;
      tolerability (measured using patient medical records; dose reduction/modification, dose&#xD;
      delays, # of cycles completed, hospitalization, cytopenias, etc.), fatigue (measured using&#xD;
      the Brief Fatigue Inventory), and quality of life (measured using the General Version of the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
      Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) among colorectal cancer patients during a chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment cycle (i.e., two-three week cycle between the sessions) as compared to a usual care&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this objective is that those using the meditation app will&#xD;
      experience less severe chemotherapy toxicity, greater chemotherapy tolerability, less&#xD;
      fatigue, and greater quality of life as compared to the usual care control group.&#xD;
