  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As an important micro-ecological factor in human body, intestinal flora is closely related to&#xD;
      the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder. The purpose of our study is to&#xD;
      investigate a microbiome probe of depression. This study is a 6-months open trial that will&#xD;
      enroll approximately 30 patients in major depressive disorders and 10 age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      healthy controls. We will comparing gut bacteria community structures of pre- treatment,&#xD;
      those of 1 month and 6 months after treatment to remission. With the microbiome change in a&#xD;
      preliminary analysis of pre-and post-treatment, we will reveal the diversity before and after&#xD;
      the depression treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants (30 patients and 10 controls) will be recruited in the clinical psychological&#xD;
      department of Beijing Chaoyang hospital. Patients with first-episode major depressive&#xD;
      disorder confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (Chinese mini version) and assessment&#xD;
      of symptom severity (Hamilton Depression Scale-17, HAMD-17) will be enrolled in a six-month&#xD;
      open study. Healthy controls matched for age, sex and body-mass index (BMI) will have only&#xD;
      baseline stool and electroencephalography (EEG) collections. We then will make an assessment&#xD;
      of HAMD-17, patient-reported outcomes, and EEGs identified at the pre-treatment and those&#xD;
      same parameters at the 1- to 6-month point. Treatment response (50% reduction in HAMD-17),&#xD;
      treatment remission (HAMD-17&lt;7, at least 3 weeks) will be analyzed with change in microbiome,&#xD;
      inflammation markers and EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze the differences in the intestinal flora community structure and diversity of&#xD;
      patients and controls in order to obtain information on key different bacteria. We will&#xD;
      conduct the correlation between each genus of bacteria in the intestinal flora and the total&#xD;
      score of HAMD-17 in order to reveal the dynamic succession change of the intestinal flora&#xD;
      with the disease state of major depressive disorder. The analysis with multiple testing&#xD;
      corrections will be analyzed between depressive severity, EEG and gut microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide the objective and direct biomarkers for major&#xD;
      depressive disorder to achieve remission. This study will bring an important scientific basis&#xD;
      to further optimizing treatment methods and improvie clinical effect.&#xD;
