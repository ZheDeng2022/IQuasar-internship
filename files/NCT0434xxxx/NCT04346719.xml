  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-frequency alternating currents of greater than 1 kHz applied on peripheral nerves has&#xD;
      been used in animal studies to produce a motor nerve block. It has been evidenced that&#xD;
      frequencies higher than 5 kHz are necessary to produce a complete peripheral nerve block in&#xD;
      primates, whose nerve thickness is more similar to humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous studies with transcutaneous HFAC, suggest high-frequency stimulation (10 and 20&#xD;
      kHz) have an inhibitory effect over muscle strength and somatosensory threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in these studies the intensity needed to reach block threshold is very high. The&#xD;
      purpose of the present work is to reduce the amount of current intensity needed using a&#xD;
      percutaneous approach by apply two acupuncture needles near the nerve as electrodes.&#xD;
