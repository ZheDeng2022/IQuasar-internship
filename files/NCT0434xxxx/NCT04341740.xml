  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect health-related information as well as bone marrow&#xD;
      and blood specimens to determine if a new form of treatment for patients with kidney and&#xD;
      bladder cancer may be possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will collect specimens from the bone marrow and blood to determine if a new&#xD;
      treatment for kidney or bladder cancer may be possible. This research study will collect a&#xD;
      bone marrow sample as well as a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the research study will last approximately 60 days which includes time to&#xD;
      determine if the patient is eligible to participate in the study, perform the research&#xD;
      procedures and follow-up with the patient following the research procedures to determine if&#xD;
      they are experiencing any side effects. Participation will end approximately 30 days&#xD;
      following the bone marrow collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone marrow and blood samples will be collected from all patients in both cohorts only at&#xD;
      a single time point, after they have been enrolled on the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic RCC (cohort A)&#xD;
             or UC (cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of ≤1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC ≥ 1.0 ×10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 ×10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo bone marrow aspiration (BMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation to the pelvic region&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids within 28 days of BMA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of another primary malignancy that has been diagnosed or required therapy&#xD;
             within the past 2 years (except completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and completely resected&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of any site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             systemic lupus erythematosis) requiring active systemic treatment. If the autoimmune&#xD;
             disease has been treated, it must be stable clinically. (Hypothyroidism without&#xD;
             evidence of Grave's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not considered an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females as documented by a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)&#xD;
             pregnancy test consistent with pregnancy, obtained within 21 days of BMA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infection requiring treatment with antibiotics, antifungal, or antiviral agents within&#xD;
             7 days of BMA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of HIV or CMV infection or active viral hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of hematopoietic growth factor support within 14 days before bone&#xD;
             marrow aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy administration within 28 days of BMA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history,&#xD;
             physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could&#xD;
             affect the safety of the subject.&#xD;
