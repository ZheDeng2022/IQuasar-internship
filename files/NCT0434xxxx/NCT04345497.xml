  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effect of a diabetes-specific formula (DSF) used as a&#xD;
      (partial) meal replacement on long-term glycemic control and short-term glycemic variability&#xD;
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study. Eligible participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated (at 1 :1 ratio) to one of two groups: DSF group or control group.The total expected&#xD;
      duration of the study is 97 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two periods in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) &quot;Run-in Period&quot; (Study Days -6 to -1): participants will wear the CGMS:Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (FreeStyle Libre Pro) and will be asked to follow and track their diet and&#xD;
      physical activity on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) &quot;Intervention Period&quot; (Study Days 0 to 90): participants will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      the two groups (n = 125 per group): DSF group or control group.&#xD;
