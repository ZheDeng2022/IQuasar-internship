    <textblock>
      A Phase I, Open-Label study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of ipatasertib in Chinese participants. Approximately 20 Chinese participants with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has&#xD;
      proven ineffective will be enrolled to provide sufficient data. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      400-mg ipatasertib dose (two 200-mg tablets) daily orally (PO). Participants deriving&#xD;
      clinical benefit may be offered continued treatment with ipatasertib until disease&#xD;
      progression, at the discretion of the investigator (as assessed by the investigator) or until&#xD;
      the study is terminated by the Sponsor.&#xD;
