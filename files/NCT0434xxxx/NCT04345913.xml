  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib and how well it&#xD;
      works when given together with eribulin in treating patients with triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced stage). Copanlisib stops the&#xD;
      growth of a protein called PI3K, which is often changed in tumor cells and causes resistance&#xD;
      to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving copanlisib and eribulin may work better in treating advanced&#xD;
      stage triple negative breast cancer compared to eribulin alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of copanlisib hydrochloride (copanlisib) in&#xD;
      combination with eribulin mesylate (eribulin) in metastatic triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      (TNBC). (Phase I) II. To compare progression free survival (PFS) between eribulin and&#xD;
      eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with prior taxane and&#xD;
      anthracycline. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the&#xD;
      combination. (Phase I) II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) III. To&#xD;
      compare the ORR, CBR (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD] &gt;= 24&#xD;
      weeks) and safety of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms. (Phase II) IV. To compare&#xD;
      the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors&#xD;
      harboring mutations in PIK3CA/ PTEN or with loss of PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) on baseline tumor biopsy. (Phase II) V. To compare the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and&#xD;
      eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors lacking PIK3CA/ PTEN pathway&#xD;
      alterations. (Phase II) VI. To compare the ORR, CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus&#xD;
      copanlisib arms in patients with tumors harboring loss of PTEN expression by IHC in&#xD;
      pre-treatment metastatic site (in patients with available tissue from metastatic site).&#xD;
      (Phase II) VII. To compare PTEN IHC results between paired archival primary tumor vs.&#xD;
      baseline tumor biopsies. (Phase II) VIII. To assess targeted inhibition by copanlisib and&#xD;
      eribulin by measuring treatment induced changes in phosphorylated (phospho)-AKT (T308),&#xD;
      phospho-AKT (S473), phospho-histone H3, and inhibition of apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3)&#xD;
      between post-treatment tumor (C2D1-2) versus baseline. (Phase II) IX. To compare the ORR,&#xD;
      CBR, PFS of eribulin and eribulin plus copanlisib arms in patients with tumors harboring&#xD;
      mutations in PIK3CA/PTEN by circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at&#xD;
      baseline, and potential changes over time. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare PTEN IHC results between paired baseline tumor biopsy versus at time of disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess baseline (pre-treatment) tumor tissue mutation or gene expression profiles to&#xD;
      correlate treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms by analyzing pre and post treatment&#xD;
      biopsies for gene expression and proteomic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation profiles at baseline and changes in&#xD;
      mutation profile and variant allele frequencies (VAFs) on cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1) and at disease&#xD;
      progression compared to baseline to correlate with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess circulating biomarkers predictive of treatment response. VI. Assess plasma and&#xD;
      serum proteomics and metabolomics predictive of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of copanlisib and eribulin followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive eribulin intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive copanlisib IV over 60 minutes and eribulin IV over 2-5 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 8 or days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 21 or 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with nitrosoureas or mitomycin C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with eribulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormality, including prolonged corrected QT (QTc)&#xD;
             interval &gt; 480 msec or history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (i.e.&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradyarrhythmias, family&#xD;
             history of long QT syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myeloid growth factors within 14 days prior to treatment start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet transfusion within 7 days prior to treatment start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive therapy is not allowed while on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known tumor AKT mutation from archival tumor tissue analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors, or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) are not permitted&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that&#xD;
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be&#xD;
             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed&#xD;
             tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) screening. If a patient is on chronic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed&#xD;
             dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
             Short-term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids above 15 mg prednisolone or&#xD;
             equivalent will be allowed for the management of acute conditions (e.g., treatment&#xD;
             non-infectious pneumonitis). The use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to&#xD;
             copanlisib administration will not be allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active, clinically serious infections &gt; grade 2 (Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 [CTCAEv5.0]) (viral, bacterial or fungal&#xD;
             infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism within 3 months before the start of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent diagnosis of pheochromocytoma due to risk of hypertension with copanlisib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as blood pressure &gt;= 150/90 mm/Hg) despite optimal&#xD;
             medical management (per investigator's opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proteinuria as estimated by urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 3.5 g/g on random urine&#xD;
             sample or grade &gt;= 3 as assessed by 24-hour urine protein collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of or current autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with congenital QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden&#xD;
             cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor&#xD;
             agent and eribulin is an anti-tubulin agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with copanlisib and&#xD;
             eribulin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             copanlisib and/or eribulin. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used&#xD;
             in this study&#xD;
