  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the impact on the frequency of occurrence of&#xD;
      delirium of an early inhaled sedation strategy (from induction in rapid sequence if&#xD;
      intubation in intensive care, or from admission if intubated in pre -hospital) by Isoflurane&#xD;
      using an ANACONDA â„¢ type system, compared to a conventional intravenous sedation strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation-analgesia is used in most patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV). The&#xD;
      usual benzodiazepine and morphine sedation reduces pain and anxiety and allows tolerance of&#xD;
      invasive procedures in intensive care. These molecules, used as part of the sedation&#xD;
      titration protocol or the daily sedation stop protocol, have improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although necessary, these drugs, by mechanisms still uncertain, would promote the occurrence&#xD;
      of resuscitation delirium. Delirium itself responsible for worsening morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (increase in the duration of MV, increase in the length of hospital stay, discussed increase&#xD;
      in mortality, long-term cognitive sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding favored the use of new drugs in the sedation strategies of patients on MV.&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine has for example reduced the number of days of delirium, the number of days of&#xD;
      coma and even mortality in septic patients. Its large-scale use has however been questioned&#xD;
      by a recent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halogenated gases have been used for a long time in anesthesia. Their pharmacodynamics, their&#xD;
      positive and adverse effects, their therapeutic margins are well known. Thanks to technical&#xD;
      innovations they can be used on resuscitation respirators. Several studies on targeted&#xD;
      populations have shown the feasibility and the benefits of this use, in particular, the&#xD;
      absence of accumulation, the absence of tachyphylaxis, the broad therapeutic range, the small&#xD;
      interindividual variation, the rapidity of efficacy and the speed of awakening. Safety in use&#xD;
      for the staff in charge of the patient is established. In addition, their potential&#xD;
      neuroprotective effect would make it an anesthetic of choice in the prevention of&#xD;
      resuscitation delirium.&#xD;
