  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and race is a risk factor&#xD;
      for poor outcomes. African-Americans (AAs) report greater OA-related disability and pain&#xD;
      severity compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. These disparities are&#xD;
      reinforced through social and biological mechanisms, ultimately resulting in dramatic racial&#xD;
      disparities in pain experience and associated quality of life. Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs)&#xD;
      reduce inflammation and pain independent of weight loss, but significant racial differences&#xD;
      exist in metabolism that are rarely addressed in diet interventions. The overall objective of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to determine whether the beneficial effects of an LCD for knee OA pain&#xD;
      are related to race. The investigators will recruit 20 adult women (65-75) with knee OA with&#xD;
      equal representation across racial groups (10 AA, 10 NHW). Following one week of diet and&#xD;
      pain self-report, the investigators will assess quality of life, depression, experienced pain&#xD;
      and evoked pain. Participants will be placed on a LCD wherein all meals and snacks will be&#xD;
      delivered weekly after consult with study personnel. Participants will return every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for testing during the 12-week intervention with blood drawn at baseline and at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the 12-week diet. Blood will be assayed for oxidative stress markers. This will&#xD;
      be the first assessment of racial differences in the efficacy of a LCD to reduce knee OA&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine whether the LCD reduces pain after 12 weeks. Hypothesis: The LCD&#xD;
      will significantly reduce evoked and self-reported pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To determine whether the benefits of the LCD differ based on race. Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
      The LCD will reduce evoked and self-reported pain more in AA than in NHW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: AAs will experience greater improvements in depression, quality of life, pain&#xD;
      interference and show more weight loss than NHWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To determine whether the LCD has a differential impact on oxidative stress by&#xD;
      race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The LCD will significantly reduce oxidative stress over 12 weeks. Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
      AAs will show greater reductions in oxidative stress than NHWs. The reduction in oxidative&#xD;
      stress will be correlated with reduction in evoked pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A telephone screening interview will be used to assess each participant's OA status and&#xD;
      assessment of the reported duration of knee OA, current and past treatments, comorbid&#xD;
      conditions, current medication use, dietary conditions and other exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Eligible, participants will be invited to the testing facilities in Campbell Hall for&#xD;
      informed consent and baseline measures. Following this visit, participants will record daily&#xD;
      food consumption for one week as well as daily pain ratings. After one week, participants&#xD;
      will visit the Clinical Research Unit for fasted blood draw and additional testing.&#xD;
      Immediately following this session, participants will be asked to select one week of meals&#xD;
      and snacks from a menu of commercially-available meals. Study personnel will record the&#xD;
      choices and order the meals to be delivered to the participants to initiate the intervention.&#xD;
      During the 12-week intervention, participants will be contacted by study personnel weekly to&#xD;
      place food orders and be instructed to record any beverages consumed during the week. Every&#xD;
      three weeks, participants will return for testing. At the end of 12 weeks, blood will be&#xD;
      taken prior to testing/debriefing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. The investigators will recruit 20 adult women (65-75) with knee OA with equal&#xD;
      representation across racial groups (10 AA, 10 NHW). Peak prevalence rates for OA are at the&#xD;
      65-75 years of age, so the investigators feel confident that there will be no trouble&#xD;
      recruiting this population. Participants will be recruited using existing databases,&#xD;
      community flyers and community outreach. The feasibility trial used prescribed diets and had&#xD;
      an attrition rate of 0% in the LCD group. Here, provision of all of the food for the&#xD;
      intervention is expected to have lower rates of attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. diagnosis of knee OA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pain in at least 4/7 days/week for the past 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. age between 65-75;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. average daily consumption of &gt;100 g carbohydrates;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. understanding of verbal and written English;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. self-identification as either AA or NHW;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. unwillingness to follow prescribed diets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. recent weight change (&gt;4 kg in past month);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. currently on a diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. history of eating disorders or other psychiatric disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. digestive diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. difficulty chewing or swallowing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. reliance on others for meal preparation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. cardiovascular or pulmonary disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. daily opioid pain medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. use of medications known to alter metabolism or digestion (e.g., proton-pump&#xD;
           inhibitors);&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. use of anti-hypertensive medications that affect glucose tolerance;&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. use of tobacco;&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. participation in extreme exercise,&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet Intervention. All foods will be provided under the direction of study personnel and will&#xD;
      be delivered weekly to participants' home address. Weekly contact will maintain retention in&#xD;
      the intervention and improve adherence. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests 225-325&#xD;
      g of carbohydrates/day. Therefore, those participants consuming less than 100 g/day would be&#xD;
      considered as consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet and will be excluded. Participants are&#xD;
      directed to reduce their total (not net) carbohydrate intake to ≤ 40 g/day. Meals will be&#xD;
      offered such that no combination of chosen meals will exceed our limit. Fats will not be&#xD;
      restricted, nor will protein (meats, eggs). Fruits will be restricted and vegetables&#xD;
      permitted in limited quantities (2 cups/day of leafy greens, 1 cup/day non-starchy&#xD;
      vegetables, etc.). Participants will be instructed as to the types and quantities of&#xD;
      beverages that are permitted to accompany the LCD. Daily or almost-daily consumption of&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with lowered optimism in chronic pain sufferers and&#xD;
      greater risk for depression in healthy women. Artificial carbohydrate-free sweeteners (stevia&#xD;
      or sucralose) will be permitted, but powdered sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin, stevia,&#xD;
      sucralose) can only be used in limited quantities as they contain maltodextrin (1 g of&#xD;
      rapidly digesting carbohydrate). LCDs are known to be safe and first-line treatments for&#xD;
      diabetes. LCDs are also known to reduce inflammatory biomarkers to a greater extent than&#xD;
      low-fat diets. In fact, a LCD resulted in improved insulin sensitivity as well as reduced&#xD;
      triglycerides even when weight loss was accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropocentric Measures. Body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, and heart&#xD;
      rate will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain-Specific Questionnaires. Pain and disability will be measured using the Brief pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI) short form and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Index (WOMAC). The BPI is used to assess the severity of pain and the degree to which that&#xD;
      pain interferes with daily activities. This inventory also allows for reports on medications&#xD;
      used to treat pain. The WOMAC is commonly used in studies of arthritis and has been validated&#xD;
      in numerous clinical trials. Specifically, the WOMAC allows for assessment of pain and&#xD;
      interference, but also is specific to aspects of stiffness in the joints not accessed by&#xD;
      other surveys. The investigators have previously utilized these measures for chronic pain&#xD;
      sufferers. These assessments will be given at baseline and every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evoked Pain Testing. Functional tests will be carried out by study personnel. Participants&#xD;
      will rate the intensity and unpleasantness of the pain in their affected knee (0-100 scale)&#xD;
      prior to and immediately following the tests. The numerical rating scale will be anchored at&#xD;
      0 (no pain) and 100 (worst pain imaginable). Questionnaires will be given between each task&#xD;
      to allow for a rest period. Task order will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal summation will be assessed on the patellar of the affected knee using a nylon&#xD;
      monofilament (Touch test Sensory Evaluator 6.65) calibrated to bend at 300 g of pressure.&#xD;
      Participants will provide a pain rating following a single contact of the monofilament, after&#xD;
      which they will provide another pain rating following a series of 10 contacts (at a rate of&#xD;
      one contact per second). The change in pain ratings for single versus multiple contacts&#xD;
      reflects temporal summation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated chair stands is a portion of the Short Performance Physical Battery. Participants&#xD;
      are asked to stand from a sitting position five times in a row as fast as possible with arms&#xD;
      crossed. The time to completion and number of successful stands is scored as the degree of&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed Up-and-Go is a common task for evaluating pain interference of everyday activities.&#xD;
      From a seated position, participants will be asked to get up, walk 10 feet, turn and return&#xD;
      to the chair. Time to complete the task will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed walk will be the final task included. As in the Short Performance Physical Battery, a&#xD;
      distance of 15 feet will be marked out on the floor. Participants will complete the distance&#xD;
      walking at normal gait speed twice and the time to complete each walk will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life and Emotional State. Quality of Life will be measured using the short form 36&#xD;
      (SF-36) every 3 weeks. The SF- 36 measures general health status and quality of life across&#xD;
      eight domains that are relevant for assessment of a diet intervention. The domains include&#xD;
      physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health&#xD;
      perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and&#xD;
      mental health. The SF-36 has demonstrated reliability and validity in older adult populations&#xD;
      and in diet intervention studies. Depression and mood will be assessed using the Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which assesses the DSM-IV criteria for depression and can&#xD;
      measure depression severity and response to intervention. Participants with PHQ-9 scores &gt;15&#xD;
      will be referred to University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Psychiatry Services for&#xD;
      evaluation, as will participants identifying suicidal ideation of any duration on question 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative Stress. At baseline and at the end of the intervention, 10 ml of blood will be&#xD;
      taken by a trained research nurse. Sera will be isolated, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C.&#xD;
      Serum samples will be analyzed for TBARS (oxidative stress) by ELISA using&#xD;
      commercially-available kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. Data analysis will begin with an Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis to&#xD;
      account for participant attrition through inclusion of all randomized participants, as&#xD;
      recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. This analysis will be followed by an&#xD;
      analysis of per-protocol completers (adherence) and will begin with calculation of measures&#xD;
      of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (variance, interquartile range) for all&#xD;
      study variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine the efficacy of the&#xD;
      diet across time for evoked and self-reported pain measures and oxidative stress.To assess&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention across races, this will be a cross-sectional analysis using&#xD;
      change from baseline to 12-weeks. Generalized linear models will be used to assess the main&#xD;
      effects of race on changes in daily pain and evoked pain, as well as depression and quality&#xD;
      of life and oxidative stress. Pearson correlations will be calculated to assess the&#xD;
      relationship between daily pain and oxidative stress within each group at baseline and after&#xD;
      12 weeks. For each outcome measure of interest, normality assumptions will be assessed,&#xD;
      distributions (e.g. normal, binary, Poisson) explored, and transformations employed when&#xD;
      appropriate. Based on our preliminary results showing significant changes in the LCD group&#xD;
      with 8 participants, the investigators feel that n=10/group is appropriate. Additionally,&#xD;
      with 90% power and alpha set to 0.05, a total sample of 20 will allow detection of an effect&#xD;
      size as low as 0.4 for our primary comparisons. With 80% power, the investigators will be&#xD;
      able to detect effect sizes as low as 0.34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically-Meaningful Differences. Group mean differences are not always reflective of&#xD;
      clinically-meaningful differences at the individual level. Therefore a post-hoc analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out using published clinically- meaningful differences in: (1) WOMAC pain, (2)&#xD;
      WOMAC disability, and baseline pain intensity score. Briefly, a reduction of ≥1.5 (pain) or&#xD;
      ≤6.0 (disability) is considered clinically-meaningful, as is a reduction of ≥1.7 on an&#xD;
      11-point rating scale. Conversely, an increase of ≥2.2 (pain) or ≥6.0 (disability) is&#xD;
      considered worsening, as is an increase of ≥2.2 on an 11-point scale. Generalized linear&#xD;
      mixed models will be used to estimate the odds of reporting improvement or worsening between&#xD;
      AA and NHW participants.&#xD;
