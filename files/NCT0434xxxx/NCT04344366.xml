  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the ECC experience in children aged from 12 to 36 month&#xD;
      with low birth weight children in comparison to normal birth weight.&#xD;

      Dental caries is on the top list of most widespread chronic diseases in addition to be a&#xD;
      major public health issue. Dental caries is the single most common chronic childhood disease;&#xD;
      it is 5 times more common than asthma, 7 times more common than hay fever and 14 times more&#xD;
      common than chronic bronchitis. Deciduous tooth decay was ranked as the 12th most prevalent&#xD;
      condition, affecting 560 million children in the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low birth weight and premature birth are highly related to infant mortality, perinatal&#xD;
      infections and the poor growth and development of children. Some risk groups have been&#xD;
      identified, and attention should be focused on them so that preventive and health promotion&#xD;
      measures are taken in an attempt to reverse this situation. One of these risk groups is&#xD;
      composed of children born prematurely. Prematurity may be a predisposing factor for the&#xD;
      development of caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong relationship between birth weight and infant mortality and morbidity and&#xD;
      chronic diseases later in life. Many studies discussed the association between birth weight&#xD;
      and dental caries however the results were conflicting. Knowledge of the association between&#xD;
      low birth weight and the risk factors of ECC and the associated nutritional risk factors will&#xD;
      improve the preventive and health promotion measures for this population.&#xD;
