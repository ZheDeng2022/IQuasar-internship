  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SUPERSURG RCT trial investigates the efficacy and safety of the endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      stenosis or restenosis in the common femoral artery (CFA) of patients presenting with&#xD;
      Rutherford classification 2,3 or 4 with a Supera Vascular Mimetic Implant of Abbott, compared&#xD;
      to classic surgical common femoral artery endarterectomy. The Supera Vascular Mimetic Implant&#xD;
      has an interwoven design and has a high crush resistance and is, when correctly implanted, an&#xD;
      ideal stent to treat eccentric calcified plaques in the CFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expected total of 143 patients will be treated with the Vascular Mimetic Implant of Abbott&#xD;
      and compared to a control group of another 143 patients that will be treated with classic&#xD;
      surgical endarterectomy of the common femoral artery. Assignment to the treatment groups will&#xD;
      be at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as follows: freedom from clinically-driven target&#xD;
      lesion revascularization and binary restenosis at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is&#xD;
      defined as follows: a composite of overall death, cardiac, pulmonary, renal complications,&#xD;
      sepsis, target lesion revascularisation and wound related complications through 30 days&#xD;
      post-index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are defined as technical success, primary patency in the deep femoral&#xD;
      artery, primary patency in the target lesion, target lesion revascularisation, target vessel&#xD;
      revascularisation, binary restenosis, duration of initial hospital stay, sustained clinical&#xD;
      improvement, change of walking impairment questionnaire score from baseline, change in target&#xD;
      limb Rutherford classification, change in target limb ABI/TBI from baseline, all cause death,&#xD;
      thrombosis at the target lesion through 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      Supera Vascular Mimetic Implant for the treatment of stenotic or restenotic lesions of the&#xD;
      common femoral artery. Furthermore, a non-inferiority hypothesis in terms of efficacy and a&#xD;
      superiority in terms of safety will be tested with the endovascular treatment with Supera&#xD;
      compared to surgical endarterectomy of the common femoral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be&#xD;
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the&#xD;
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should be geographically stable,&#xD;
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study, and remain available for long term&#xD;
      follow-up. The patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients&#xD;
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after&#xD;
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the index procedure the following will be collected: an informed consent for data&#xD;
      collection, demographics, medical history, medication record, physical examination, clinical&#xD;
      category of acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category), the resting ankle-brachial index (ABI)&#xD;
      or toe-brachial index (TBI), blood sample test (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic&#xD;
      panel and if applicable pregnancy test) and a walking impairment questionnaire. Randomization&#xD;
      will also occur prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure patients that are randomized within the endarterectomy group will be&#xD;
      treated according to the institutions standard of care. For patients that are randomized&#xD;
      within the Supera arm, the guidewire will cross the entire study lesion after which the&#xD;
      lesion will be assessed through angiography. Pre-dilatation of the target lesion with an&#xD;
      uncoated PTA-balloon is mandatory and will be followed by stenting with the Supera stent&#xD;
      according to the instructions for use. Postdilatation of the stent is allowed but not&#xD;
      mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the results of&#xD;
      the procedure. The patients will be invited for the following required follow-up visits at 1,&#xD;
      6, 12, 24 and 36 months. During these visit the following data will be collected: medication&#xD;
      record, physical exam, target limb ABI/TBI and Rutherford classification, duplex ultrasound&#xD;
      of target vessel, walking impairment questionnaire and possible adverse events.&#xD;
