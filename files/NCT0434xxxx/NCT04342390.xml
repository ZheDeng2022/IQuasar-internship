  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about how short-term exercise intervention affects adolescents with&#xD;
      a disease called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators want to learn more about the effect of a type of exercise on&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and on markers of health (for example, liver,&#xD;
      heart, and overall health) and how the body uses energy in teenagers. The exercise we are&#xD;
      studying is called high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. Some participants in this study&#xD;
      will receive a 4-week exercise program, and the others will not.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) percent (%) will be measured via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). IHTG percent can theoretically range between 0 and 100. By definition, an individual has Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) when the IHTG percent is at or above 5 percent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular fitness will be assessed via &quot;peak oxygen uptake&quot; (VO2 max). VO2 max is expressed as milliliters per body weight in kilograms per minutes. There is no established normative data for VO2 max in pediatric population; however, higher values indicate better cardiovascular fitness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HOMA-IR</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated using the fasting glucose and insulin levels. Higher HOMA-IR values indicate greater insulin resistance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alanine Aminotransferase</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level will be measured. Higher ALT levels suggest presence of hepatocellular damage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FibroScan - Controlled Attenuated Parameter</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Controlled Attenuated Parameter (CAP) score will be measured using FibroScan. CAP score is reported in decibel/second (dB/s) and ranges between 100-400. A score of 241 dB/s or greater is consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FibroScan - Transient Elastogram</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Transient Elastogram (TE) score will be measured using FibroScan. TE score is reported in kilopascals (kPa) and ranges between 0-75. A score of 8.5 kPa or greater is consistent with fibrotic liver disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition - Total Body Fat and Visceral Fat</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be measured using Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Normative data for total body fat and visceral fat are not established; however, larger visceral fat volume is linked to higher intrahepatic triglyceride content and insulin resistant state; similarly, larger total body fat volume is linked to higher intrahepatic triglyceride content and insulin resistant state.</description>
