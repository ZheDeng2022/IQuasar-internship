  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial examines the effectiveness of a multi-level smoking cessation program for&#xD;
      high-risk women in rural communities. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cervical&#xD;
      cancer in women. Rural primary care practices and providers often lack the electronic health&#xD;
      record support to pre-identify smokers for services, as well as lack the necessary counseling&#xD;
      training and access to comprehensive cessation programs. Implementing evidence-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation programs in rural Appalachia may decrease the rates of cigarette smoking and as a&#xD;
      result decrease the rates of cervical cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the effectiveness of a core component of an integrated cervical cancer&#xD;
      prevention program designed to help female smokers quit by standardizing clinical practice&#xD;
      supports and protocols. (Service outcomes) II. Determine satisfaction with the multilevel&#xD;
      intervention. (Client outcomes) III. Test the sustainability of the multilevel intervention&#xD;
      via training of providers and staff on counseling and billing for evidence-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation services. (Implementation outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLEMENTATION OF TOBACCO-USER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM: Clinics and systems develop and&#xD;
      implement minimally required electronic tracking and reporting systems for identification of&#xD;
      smokers during months 1-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP RANDOMIZED TRIAL: Providers and participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (EARLY ARM): Providers undergo training over 60 minutes to explain the Break Free&#xD;
      program and basics of quitting smoking during months 13-24. Female smokers interested in&#xD;
      quitting in the next 6 months will be referred to an in-person counseling session at the&#xD;
      clinic. Participants then receive 4 phone counseling over 15-20 minutes with a trained&#xD;
      tobacco treatment specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (DELAYED ARM): Female smokers receive usual care during months 13-24. Providers&#xD;
      undergo training over 60 minutes to explain the Break Free program and basics of quitting&#xD;
      smoking during months 25-36. Female smokers interested in quitting in the next 6 months will&#xD;
      be referred to an in-person counseling session at the clinic. Participants then receive 4&#xD;
      phone counseling over 15-20 minutes with a trained tobacco treatment specialist.&#xD;
