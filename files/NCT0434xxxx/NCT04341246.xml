  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate to provide evidence to establish tightly&#xD;
      defined cut-offs to identify patients for NASH clinical trial inclusion using cT1 and/or&#xD;
      PDFF. The study will be divided into 2 sub groups comprising of cases and controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, case-control, study designed to measure the mean difference in cT1 and&#xD;
      PDFF in patients who have undergone liver biopsy and have confirmed NASH and fibrosis or&#xD;
      'cases' (N=40) and N=20 patients with neither significant NASH nor significant fibrosis&#xD;
      'controls'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed cases will be patients who have met the criteria for active NASH with fibrosis&#xD;
      according to the NAS CRN scoring system (NAS≥4 &amp; F2-3), 'controls' will be those who did not&#xD;
      meet NASH diagnostic criteria and have evidence of fibrosis of ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in order to investigate the variability of the biomarker investigators will&#xD;
      assess the 'measurement' error in all participants by performing a repeat 'second' scan in&#xD;
      the same scanning session, and , in cases only, 'biological' variability by performing a&#xD;
      repeat scan in controls 2-4 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable patients based on trial inclusion criteria will be identified by the study PI and&#xD;
      clinical collaborator and invited to receive one or two MRI scans from which cT1 and PDFF&#xD;
      will be derived using Perspectum's LiverMultiScan software. Baseline scan will ideally be&#xD;
      performed between 3 days (to allow for recovery from the procedure and time for biopsy&#xD;
      results to become available) and 6 weeks following biopsy, to minimize the likelihood that&#xD;
      the patient is in a significantly different pathophysiologic state on the baseline scan day&#xD;
      than on the biopsy day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure that the investigators capture information on normal variability and not&#xD;
      related to intervention they will also capture and record basic information at both&#xD;
      measurement timepoints (e.g. body weight, waist circumference, details of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions).&#xD;
