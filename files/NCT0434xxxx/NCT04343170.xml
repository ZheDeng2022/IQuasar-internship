  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a condition in which there is curvature of the spine occurring in the lateral&#xD;
      plane. It occurs in structural forms, characterized by a fixed curve, and &quot;functional&quot; forms,&#xD;
      characterized by a flexible or correctable curve. By anatomic necessity, this lateral&#xD;
      deviation is associated with vertebral rotation, such that when this deformity occurs in the&#xD;
      thoracic spine, a chest wall deformity, or &quot;rib hump,&quot; develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often there is a primary structural curve with an adjacent secondary compensatory curve. Most&#xD;
      cases of structural scoliosis are idiopathic and have their onset in early adolescence.&#xD;
      Females are affected more often than males, and their curvature is more likely to worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar fusion surgery is usually associated with massive blood loss. In clinical practice the&#xD;
      surgeon might measure the visible peri-operative bleeding including intra- and post-operative&#xD;
      drainage, but ignore blood component penetration into the tissues, residual blood in&#xD;
      vertebral canal and loss due to haemolysis, which are also known as hidden blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), surgical treatment involves a&#xD;
      posterior approach with multi-segmental pedicle screw fixation. Although this procedure is&#xD;
      generally considered safe with few surgical complications, there are considerable variations&#xD;
      in fusion length, surgical time, and the extent of soft-tissue exposure. Consequently,&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss can be substantial, and the use of intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      RBC transfusions are frequently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient blood management (PBM) is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach developed&#xD;
      over the last 10 years focusing on improving patient outcomes as well as reducing the use of&#xD;
      RBC transfusions. PBM includes several preventive measures to manage bleeding risks, reduce&#xD;
      iatrogenic blood loss, and modify decision thresholds for the appropriate administration of&#xD;
      blood therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients for elective surgery in whom blood loss is expected to be &gt; 500 ml should have&#xD;
      their hemoglobin checked pre-operatively and be investigated if they are found to be anemic.&#xD;
      In the general population, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin less than 130 g. in men and less&#xD;
      than 120g. in women by the WHO. It was proposed that the cut-off value/trigger be changed to&#xD;
      hemoglobin more than 130 g for both men and women. Women with hemoglobin levels between 120&#xD;
      and 129 g. are not considered to be anemic according to the WHO definition, leaving them at a&#xD;
      potential disadvantage when undergoing major surgery&#xD;

      44 Patients will be randomly classified into two equal groups each of 22 patients Group I:&#xD;
      Patients of this group received Combination treatment consisted of a slow (30 min)&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg ferric carboxymaltose (maximum of 1000 mg), 40 000 U&#xD;
      subcutaneous α erythropoietin,1 mg subcutaneous vitamin B12(, and 5 mg oral folic acid&#xD;
      (acidum folicum) Group II: Patients of this group received placebo treatment consisted of two&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of 1 mL saline and an oral placebo. Either iron or placebo (0•9%&#xD;
      saline) were given intravenously via a black infusion set from behind a screen to assure&#xD;
      blinding of the patient by a person not involved in data capturing or data entering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's vital signs will be monitored during and at least 15 min after drug application.&#xD;
      Treatment will be given one day before the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of RBC transfusions during the first 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perioperative course of Hb, (reticulocyte count, reticulocyte Hb content).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The need of fresh frozen plasma units transfused in first 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The need of platelets units transfused in first 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Total leucocyte counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. International normalized ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. C-reactive protein,&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Calculated RBC loss (preoperative RBC mass minus RBC mass at postoperative fifth day&#xD;
           plus transfused RBC mass)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Length of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Incidence of acute kidney injury&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Infections requiring antibiotics&#xD;
