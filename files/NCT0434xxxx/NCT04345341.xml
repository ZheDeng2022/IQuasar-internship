  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Laparoscopic Transversus Abdominis&#xD;
      Plane (LA-TAP) performed intraoperatively compared with usual postoperative analgesia without&#xD;
      LA-TAP block. We hypothesise that there will be a decrease in postoperative opioid&#xD;
      utilization and in pain scores for patients randomized to receive the LA-TAP block verses&#xD;
      those who do not. We expect that patients will opt to take less break through opioid&#xD;
      medication in the LA-TAP block group versus the no TAP block group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to answer the above questions through the following primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes Is there a difference in pain scores reported by the patient at 24 hours&#xD;
      following LA-TAP versus no TAP block? Is there a clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      cumulative postoperative opioid consumption, expressed as milligram morphine equivalents&#xD;
      (MMEs) at 24 hours following LA-TAP blocks versus no TAP block? Secondary outcomes Is there a&#xD;
      difference between study groups in pain scores at 48 &amp; 72 hours? Is there a difference&#xD;
      between study groups in total opioid consumption (MMEs) by 48 &amp; 72 hours? Is there a&#xD;
      difference between the study groups for reported post-operative nausea and vomiting? Is there&#xD;
      a difference between the study groups in operating time? Is there a difference between the&#xD;
      study groups in the length of Hospital stay? Is there a difference between the study groups&#xD;
      in patient's satisfaction?&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in two arms , LA-TAP , NO-TAP block . Each patient would fill out&#xD;
      the pain score sheet and number of narcotic medications she used in first 24h, 48h and 72 h&#xD;
      post operatively .&#xD;
