  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to identify effective strategies to help patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer manage side effects and achieve optimal adherence to oral targeted therapies. To&#xD;
      achieve this objective, we will evaluate the effect of a novel, bidirectional conversational&#xD;
      agent, compared to usual care, on adherence to oral targeted therapies using a two-arm&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, and explore how multilevel factors impact the acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of this strategy by collecting qualitative and quantitative data from&#xD;
      clinicians and patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Drawing from insights in behavioral economics and implementation science, the goal of our&#xD;
      project is to identify effective strategies for improving lung cancer outcomes by helping&#xD;
      patients to better manage symptoms and adhere to oral therapies. Given the rapid increase in&#xD;
      FDA-approved targeted therapies, the need for such strategies will continue to grow. Our&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that conversational agent will improve adherence to oral therapies by&#xD;
      targeting patient-level determinants of behavior change. The specific aims are to: 1) Test&#xD;
      the effects of a patient-directed intervention (conversational agent) to improve adherence to&#xD;
      oral targeted therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.; and 2) Use&#xD;
      mixed-methods approaches with clinicians and patients to explore multilevel factors shaping&#xD;
      the acceptability, effectiveness, and future implementation of intervention into routine&#xD;
      cancer care. Primary trial outcomes (adherence and persistence) will be measured using&#xD;
      microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using&#xD;
      longitudinal surveys and medical record data.&#xD;

    <description>Via text messages, the bidirectional, conversation agent provides specific dosing instructions and motivational reminders to promote oral targeted therapy adherence and symptom management. Patients can report symptoms at any time via text message and are also prompted to report symptoms and medication adherence at periodic intervals. Reported symptoms are monitored and managed algorithmically according severity. High-grade symptoms are triaged directly to the patients' cancer care team. Patients in the intervention arm will use MEMS caps to enable capture of the primary outcome and asked to complete longitudinal surveys.</description>
