  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib placebo-controlled study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of SY-009 after Multiple Ascending Doses in patients with Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-increasing,&#xD;
      multiple oral administration clinical trial. The planned dose escalation levels were 1, 2, 3&#xD;
      and 4 mg daily (6 dose groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the test and safety evaluation of the initial dose of 1mg daily dose&#xD;
      in two groups (0.5mg bid and 1mg QD), the main researchers of the team leader and the sponsor&#xD;
      jointly determine whether to enter the 2mg daily dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the test and safety evaluation of two groups (1mg bid and 2mg QD) of&#xD;
      2mg daily dose, the main researchers of the group leader and the sponsor jointly determine&#xD;
      whether to enter the 4mg daily dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test and safety assessment of 4mg daily dose group (2mg bid) are completed and the&#xD;
      dose termination standard is not met, the test will be terminated; if the safety assessment&#xD;
      during or after the test reaches the dose termination standard, the study of 3mg daily dose&#xD;
      group (1.5mg bid) will be carried out, and then the test will be terminated.&#xD;
