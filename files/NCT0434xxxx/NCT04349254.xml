      The purpose of this study is to assess the vision improvement achieved by patients with late&#xD;
      stage dry age-related macular degeneration who received corneal treatments by a low vision&#xD;
      aid device. Patient records for patients with at least 12 months follow-up will be analyzed&#xD;
      to determine measures of vision improvement including best spectacle-corrected distance and&#xD;
      near visual acuity. Analyses will include descriptive statistics and correlation between&#xD;
      outcomes and baseline characteristics.&#xD;

    <description>Near infrared light is used to irradiate the cornea to change the modulus of small volumes of anterior stroma. The change of modulus produces a change of corneal stiffness and shape that modifies the distribution of light onto the retina. Light rays are redirected from dysfunctional areas of the retina that have been damaged by age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to functional areas of the retina, thereby improving patient vision.</description>
