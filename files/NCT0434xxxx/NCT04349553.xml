    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      single-centre study involving 45 healthy participants. The aim is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of Entervax, a combination vaccine against enteric fever comprising Typhi ZH9&#xD;
      (hereafter ZH9) plus an engineered derivative that will provide an immune response to the key&#xD;
      antigens (LPS 0:2 and H:a flagella) from S. Paratyphi A (hereafter ZH9PA). ZH9PA has not&#xD;
      previously been tested in humans therefore the first two cohorts comprise a dose escalation&#xD;
      of ZH9PA and the final cohort comprises a single dose level of the combination of ZH9PA and&#xD;
      ZH9.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be confirmed at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male and female participants 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female participant of childbearing potential willing to use 2 effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception, i.e., established method of contraception + condom, if applicable&#xD;
             (unless of non-childbearing potential or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is&#xD;
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) from the first dose&#xD;
             until 2 months after the last dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participant of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this study, this&#xD;
             is defined as the participant being amenorrhoeic for at least 12 consecutive months or&#xD;
             at least 4 months post-surgical sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube&#xD;
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female participant of childbearing potential or non-childbearing potential with a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participant of post-menopausal status confirmed by demonstrating at Screening&#xD;
             that the serum level of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) falls within the&#xD;
             respective pathology reference range. In the event a participant's menopausal status&#xD;
             has been clearly established (for example, the participant indicates she has been&#xD;
             amenorrhoeic for 10 years, confirmed by medical history, etc), but serum FSH levels&#xD;
             are not consistent with a postmenopausal status, determination of the participant's&#xD;
             eligibility to be included in the study will be at the Investigator's discretion&#xD;
             following consultation with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male participant willing to use an effective method of contraception or 2 effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception, i.e., established method of contraception + condom, if&#xD;
             applicable (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is&#xD;
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) from first dose&#xD;
             until a stool sample tested for presence of the vaccine strains is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 19 or ≤34 kg/m^2 (BMI = body weight (kg)&#xD;
             / [height (m)]^2).&#xD;

             sodium bicarbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No clinically significant history of anaphylactic shock following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No clinically significant history of hypersensitivity (e.g., hives/rash/swollen&#xD;
             lips/difficulty with breathing) to azithromycin, ampicillin,&#xD;
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results (in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator) for serum biochemistry, haematology and/or urine analyses within 28 days&#xD;
             before receiving the first dose administration of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participant with a negative urinary drugs of abuse (DOA) screen (including alcohol and&#xD;
             cotinine) test results, determined within 28 days before the first dose administration&#xD;
             of the IMP unless there is a documented medical explanation for the positive result&#xD;
             other than drugs of abuse (e.g., the participant has been prescribed opioids for&#xD;
             pain). (N.B.: A positive test result may be repeated at the Investigator's&#xD;
             discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participant with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg)) and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) test results at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. No clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or vital&#xD;
             signs determined within 28 days before first dose of IMP.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Participant with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (including alcohol and&#xD;
             cotinine) prior to dosing unless there is a documented medical explanation for the&#xD;
             positive result other than drugs of abuse (e.g., the participant has been prescribed&#xD;
             opioids for pain). (N.B.: A positive test result may be repeated at the Investigator's&#xD;
             discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participant of childbearing potential or non-childbearing potential with a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease or current infection) or psychiatric condition (see also exclusion criterion&#xD;
             number 21) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes participation in the&#xD;
             study. This will include any clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry&#xD;
             results and/or haematological results and/or urine analytical results.&#xD;

             immunocompromising conditions and any other chronic condition, which at the judgment&#xD;
             of the Investigator, may put the participant at higher risk of side effects from the&#xD;
             study vaccine. Conditions in the latter category might include unexplained anaemia,&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Participant with symptoms consistent with Typhoid fever concurrent with travel to&#xD;
             countries where typhoid infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within 2&#xD;
             years prior to first dose of IMP.&#xD;

             Investigator, may be at risk of disease if exposed to the vaccine strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Participant with a known impairment of immune function or receiving (or has received&#xD;
             in the 6 months prior to study entry) cytotoxic drugs or immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
