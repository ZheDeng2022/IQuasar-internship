          -  Male body weight ≥50 kg, female body weight ≥45 kg, body mass index (BMI) between&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to refrain from strenuous exercise (heavy lifting, weight training,&#xD;
             calisthenics, aerobics) within 7 days prior to dosing until after collection of the&#xD;
             final PK blood sample (Day 4);&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other major illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, substantially&#xD;
