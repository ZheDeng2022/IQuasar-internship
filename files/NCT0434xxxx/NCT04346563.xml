    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to study the effect of kinesio tapes with functional&#xD;
      correction technique in combination with exercise management to increase strength and&#xD;
      decrease pain, in people with rounded shoulders. The study would be evaluated with the&#xD;
      EvaltechTM machine, (functional capacity assessment).&#xD;

      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 25-50 years, male and female&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People who have a shoulder condition. (By measuring in the supine position, distance&#xD;
           from the posterior aspect of acromion to the bed&gt; 1 inch on both sides)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with moderate to severe neck and shoulder pain (VAS&gt; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People who have to use their arms for work Overall more than 3 hours per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      For attaching the tape, the researcher will prepare a replacement shirt in case the For the&#xD;
      convenience of tape, the experimental group, trained by Certified Kinesio tape, attached the&#xD;
      kinesio tape. Attaching the tape By using functional correction techniques, apply from the&#xD;
      front of the acromion process to the spinous process T10 on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The pressure of (average of peak force) of both arms (pounds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The pulling force (average of peak force) of both arms (pounds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time of overhead endurance test (TMT) (seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The distance from the posterior aspect of acromion to the bed (inches)&#xD;
&#xD;
      process of measuring the evaluation 3 times&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st after physical therapy treatment Before attaching the kinase tape&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd evaluation period was 48 hours apart before the next treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd evaluation period is 1 week apart.&#xD;
