  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every six minutes a mother dies from postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in low-resource countries,&#xD;
      in the prime of her life and often leaving behind a young family. In many settings, when a&#xD;
      mother dies in childbirth, her infant has less than a 20% chance of surviving past the first&#xD;
      month. PPH, defined as a blood loss of more than 500 ml, is the leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      death worldwide, accounting for 27% of maternal deaths. The WHO published &quot;Recommendations&#xD;
      for the Prevention and Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage&quot; in 2012 to provide&#xD;
      evidence-informed recommendations for managing PPH. However, adherence to these&#xD;
      recommendations is currently limited by a number of challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This primary aim of this multi-country, parallel cluster randomised trial with a baseline&#xD;
      control phase, along with mixed-methods and health economic evaluations, is to evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation of early detection and the use of the World Health Organisation (WHO) MOTIVE&#xD;
      'first response' treatment bundle for postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) on clinical,&#xD;
      implementation and resource use outcomes. The investigators will evaluate the implementation&#xD;
      through mixed-methods and carry out a health economic evaluation from the public healthcare&#xD;
      system perspective.&#xD;

      The aim of this trial is evaluate the implementation of early detection and the use of the&#xD;
      WHO MOTIVE 'first response' treatment bundle for PPH on clinical, implementation and resource&#xD;
      use outcomes. The investigators will evaluate the implementation through mixed-methods and&#xD;
      carry out a health economic evaluation from the public healthcare system perspective. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a multi-country, parallel cluster randomised trial design with a&#xD;
      baseline control phase, along with mixed-methods and health economic evaluations. The trial&#xD;
      is conducted in secondary level health facilities in five low- and middle- income countries.&#xD;
      For this trial, the health facility is the randomisation unit. Health facilities are eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion if they have 1000 to 5000 births a year and provide comprehensive obstetric&#xD;
      care with ability to perform surgery for PPH. Pre-existing implementation of early detection&#xD;
      or bundled approach are exclusion criteria. The research participants are all healthcare&#xD;
      providers attending vaginal births in the study facilities. The E-MOTIVE intervention&#xD;
      consists of three elements: 1) a strategy for early detection of PPH, which allows triggering&#xD;
      of the 'first response' treatment bundle; 2) a 'first response' bundle called &quot;MOTIVE&quot;, based&#xD;
      on the WHO guideline recommendations and consisting of uterine Massage, Oxytocic drugs,&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid, IV fluids and Examination &amp; Escalation; and 3) an implementation strategy,&#xD;
      focusing on simulation-based training, peer-assisted learning, local E-MOTIVE champions,&#xD;
      feedback of actionable data to providers, calibrated drape with action line, and MOTIVE&#xD;
      emergency kits. The control health facilities will deliver usual care with dissemination of&#xD;
      the current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a composite of the following three clinical outcomes: severe PPH&#xD;
      defined as blood loss ≥1000 ml or postpartum laparotomy for bleeding or postpartum maternal&#xD;
      death from bleeding. The two Key Secondary outcomes are postpartum haemorrhage detection rate&#xD;
      (defined as recording of diagnosis of PPH by birth attendant) and compliance with the MOTIVE&#xD;
      bundle. Secondary: blood transfusion, uterine tamponade, Intensive Care Unit admissions or&#xD;
      higher-level facility transfers, and new-born deaths along with implementation and resource&#xD;
      use outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty health facilities will take part in the study. Initially, all health facilities will&#xD;
      enter an 11-month baseline period in which they will be following usual care. After this, the&#xD;
      investigators will randomise 40 of the 80 health facilities (1:1 ratio) to the E-MOTIVE&#xD;
      intervention for 11 months, allowing two months for transition. The other 40 health&#xD;
      facilities will continue to follow usual care as per the baseline period for the entire trial&#xD;
      duration (2 years). To allow us to perform the randomisation sequentially, if necessary, a&#xD;
      minimisation algorithm will ensure a balance of the intervention and control facilities. The&#xD;
      total sample size for the study will be 337,920 women. This sample size is expected to have&#xD;
      over 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction in the primary outcome from 2% to 1.5%&#xD;
      after allowing for clustering. The number of clusters has been inflated by 10% to allow for&#xD;
      drop out of health facilities and for varying cluster sizes. Randomisation will use a&#xD;
      minimisation algorithm to balance health facilities by the number of vaginal births per&#xD;
      health facility, country and the health facility rate of the composite primary outcome during&#xD;
      the baseline phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 11-month baseline phase, the investigators will conduct mixed method work to&#xD;
      refine and optimise the E-MOTIVE implementation strategy by piloting it in three to four&#xD;
      facilities per country over up to two adaptive cycles for addressing barriers and enablers to&#xD;
      delivery and implementation, ahead of the intervention phase. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess the extent to which the E-MOTIVE intervention&#xD;
      has been implemented as intended. The implementation outcomes of interest are fidelity,&#xD;
      adoption, adaptation, acceptability, and sustainability, as well as contextual influences and&#xD;
      barriers and enablers to implementation. The investigators will also assess the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the E-MOTIVE intervention compared with usual care from a public&#xD;
      healthcare system perspective for each country, as measured by incremental cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      ratios for a) severe PPH prevented, b) laparotomy for PPH prevented, c) death from PPH&#xD;
      avoided, and (d) quality-adjusted life-years prevented.&#xD;
