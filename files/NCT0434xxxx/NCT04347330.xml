  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious public health problem because of its increasing&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence in the aging population. AF is associated with elevated risks of&#xD;
      death, stroke, coronary event, heart failure, cognitive decline, and chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      To identify preventive interventions for major cardiovascular events beyond effective&#xD;
      anticoagulation should be a major priority in the treatment of AF patients. The CRAFT study&#xD;
      is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether intensive blood&#xD;
      pressure control will reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in AF patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CRAFT trial will include approximately 6000 AF patients with home SBP 125-154 mmHg and at&#xD;
      least another cardiovascular risk factor. The trial aims to compare the effects of&#xD;
      randomization to a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal (target home SBP &lt;120mmHg) with&#xD;
      randomization to a treatment program of a standard goal (target home SBP &lt;135mmHg). The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that cardiovascular event rates will be lower in the intensive arm.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited over a 3-year period at approximately 100 to 150 clinical&#xD;
      centres and the first patient will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized into the Intensive BP Control arm will have a goal of home SBP &lt;120mmHg. For most participants in the Intensive Group, a two- or three-drug regimen should be initiated at randomization. Following the randomization visit, addition of another drug or medication dose titration is indicated if home SBP is ≥120 mmHg. Monthly visits will continue in the Intensive Group until home SBP &lt;120 mmHg or no more titration planned. If the home SBP is not &lt;120 mmHg at the every 6-month visit, then an antihypertensive drug from a class different from what is being taken should be added, rather than up-titration the dosage of previous drugs, unless there are compelling reasons against this practice.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants randomized into the Standard BP Control arm will have a goal of home SBP &lt;135mmHg. The Standard BP protocol is designed to achieve a home SBP of 130-134 mmHg in as many participants as possible. Following the randomization visit, medication dose titration or addition of another drug is indicated if home SBP ≥135 mmHg. Monthly visits will continue in the Standard Group when home SBP ≥155 mmHg. Down titration (a reduction of the dose or number of antihypertensive drugs) should be carried out if the home SBP is &lt;125 mmHg.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Intensive group have a goal of home SBP &lt;120 mm Hg. The CRAFT BP treatment protocol is flexible in terms of the choice and doses of antihypertensive medications, but there should be preferences among the drug classes, based on CVD outcome trials results and current guidelines. Use of once-daily antihypertensive agents will be encouraged unless alternative frequency is indicated/necessary. Combination of different classes of agents are encouraged to achieve the home SBP goal. Medications will not be provided by the CRAFT study.</description>

        Screening and Run-in Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with documented AF (paroxysmal, persistent) and standard office SBP 140-179&#xD;
        mmHg if not on BP-lowering drugs or 125-164 mmHg with BP-lowering drugs, will be screened&#xD;
        for inclusion into the run-in assessment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The run-in assessment is for 2 weeks. In the run-in phase, patients should be treated&#xD;
        according to guideline recommendation, with combined antihypertension agents. Patients&#xD;

        readings in the morning and 3 readings in the evening) are required to be uploaded every&#xD;
        day for a week before the end of run-in assessment. Patients with average home SBP 125-154&#xD;
        mmHg during the run-in assessment are considered eligible for study inclusion. If home SBP&#xD;
        ≥155 mmHg or &lt;125 mmHg at the time of run-in assessment, another 2 weeks run-in phase can&#xD;
        be extended, during which time antihypertensive drugs can be titrated according to the BP&#xD;
