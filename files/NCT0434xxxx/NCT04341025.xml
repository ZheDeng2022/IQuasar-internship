      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is among the most common sexual dysfunctions experienced by men,&#xD;
      affecting at least one third of men across the lifespan. Although pharmacological treatments&#xD;
      are available, adherence to these treatments is poor, suggesting the need for integration of&#xD;
      psychological interventions. This study will determine if a 6-session mindfulness-based&#xD;
      psychosexual therapy (MBPST) group will be effective and feasible for men with situational&#xD;
      ED. This study is adapted from a previously published 4-session MBPST protocol which was&#xD;
      found to be beneficial for men with situational ED. Outcomes are measured using self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires on sexual functioning/enjoyment, relationship satisfaction, and treatment&#xD;
      acceptability.&#xD;

      PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-session&#xD;
      mindfulness-based psychosexual therapy (MBPST) treatment protocol using self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires. The current protocol is adapted from a pre-existing 4-session&#xD;
      mindfulness-based psychosexual therapy (MBPST) protocol from a pilot study which has already&#xD;
      demonstrated benefits in the treatment of situational erectile dysfunction (ED). The six&#xD;
      sessions include elements of psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, mindfulness training, and&#xD;
      sex therapy techniques. The elements comprising the six sessions are evidence-based, as their&#xD;
      effectiveness has been demonstrated in female samples (e.g., Brotto et al., 2012; Paterson et&#xD;
      al., 2017), and more recently in the context of a four-session pilot in men with situational&#xD;
      ED (H15-03172; published in Bossio et al., 2018). The rationale for an increase from a 4 to&#xD;
      6-session approach came from qualitative analysis of participant perspectives in the pilot&#xD;
      study and from investigator experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Men who undergo MBPST treatment will show significant post-treatment improvements at&#xD;
           follow-up (immediately following treatment and at 1- and 4-months after treatment&#xD;
           completion), compared to baseline, to primary endpoints of: (i) erectile functioning;&#xD;
           (ii) sexual distress; (iii) sexual satisfaction and pleasure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Men who undergo MBPST treatment will show significant post-treatment improvements at&#xD;
           follow-up (immediately following treatment and at 1- and 4-months after treatment&#xD;
           completion), compared to baseline, to secondary endpoints of: (i) psychological&#xD;
           variables/mental status (i.e., anxiety); (ii) mindfulness-related variables; and (iii)&#xD;
           relationship satisfaction. The role of secondary endpoints as mediators to primary&#xD;
           endpoints of sexual functioning will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Men will report significantly less use of medications for ED (i.e., PDE5 inhibitors and&#xD;
           intracavernosal injections) at 4-month follow-up compared to pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION Sexual dysfunction affects at least one third of men across the lifespan&#xD;
      (Laumann, Paik, &amp; Rosen, 1999), and can have significant impact on quality of life and on&#xD;
      intimate relationships (Hatzimouratidis et al., 2010). Erectile dysfunction (ED), or the&#xD;
      inability to attain and/or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity&#xD;
      (NIH, 1993), is among the most common sexual dysfunctions experienced by men. The aetiology&#xD;
      of ED is complex and can result from a variety of physiological (e.g., age, cardiovascular&#xD;
      health, medication use), psychological (e.g., anxiety), and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking&#xD;
      status; Nicolosi, Moreira, Shirai, Tambi, &amp; Glasser, 2003). Situational ED refers to ED that&#xD;
      occurs in certain contexts (e.g., with a partner), but not others (e.g., masturbation,&#xD;
      nocturnal erections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pharmacological interventions (i.e., PDE5 inhibitors) have been available to treat&#xD;
      ED since the 1990's, adherence to these treatments is poor, with approximately 50% of men&#xD;
      failing to re-fill their first prescription (Carvalheira, Pereira, Maroco, &amp; Forjaz, 2012;&#xD;
      Hanash, 1997), despite the restoration of erections (Giannitsas, Konstantinopoulos,&#xD;
      Patsialas, &amp; Perimenis, 2008). This low adherence to pharmacological treatments suggests that&#xD;
      there are aspects of ED, beyond the rigidity of erections that are not being addressed by&#xD;
      medications. This may be particularly true in the case of situational ED, where psychogenic&#xD;
      factors are playing a major role (McCabe et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence documenting the benefits of MBCT for women with sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction (Brotto, Basson, &amp; Luria, 2008; Brotto et al., 2008; Brotto et al., 2012; Brotto,&#xD;
      Seal, &amp; Rellini, 2012; Brotto &amp; Basson, 2014; Paterson, Handy, &amp; Brotto, 2017). Further, the&#xD;
      investigators recently adapted a pre-existing 4-session MBPST protocol, which had already&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in the treatment of female sexual dysfunction, to fit the needs of&#xD;
      men with situational ED and pilot-tested it in group format (H15-03172). Our pilot data&#xD;
      suggest significant benefits for men with situational ED (Bossio, Basson, Driscoll, Correia,&#xD;
      &amp; Brotto, 2019). However, feedback from the pilot participants indicated a need for&#xD;
      additional sessions as they had only begun to establish a regular mindfulness practice.&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based interventions consisting of eight sessions are common and have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms (Sipe &amp; Eisendrath, 2012), depressive relapse&#xD;
      (Teasdale, Segal, Williams, Ridgeway, Soulsby, &amp; Lau, 2000), and anxiety (Evans, Ferrando,&#xD;
      Findler, Stowell, Smart, &amp; Haglin, 2008). However, the investigators were skeptical about the&#xD;
      willingness and ability of patients to commit to eight consecutive weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current project is a pilot study intended to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of a 6-session MBPST program for situational ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a&#xD;
      6-session MBPST protocol for men with situational ED. Specifically, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      find that men who undergo this treatment will experience improvements in primary (e.g.,&#xD;
      decreased erectile dysfunction and sexual distress), and secondary endpoints (e.g., increased&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction and mental well-being). Further, the investigators hope to find&#xD;
      that gains in the primary and secondary endpoints are maintained at 1- and 4-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN Participants (N=60) will take part in a 6-session MBPST group (n=6-10) for&#xD;
      treatment of situational ED, either in-person or in an online format. Each session will be 2&#xD;
      hours in length and will be spaced one week apart, for a total of 12 hours of treatment time.&#xD;
      Participants will also take part in supportive group follow-up sessions at 1- and 4-months&#xD;
      following group completion where participants are free to share their experiences with the&#xD;
      group, ask questions, and participate in troubleshooting. Treatment endpoints will be&#xD;
      assessed at four time-points (pre-treatment (Time 1), immediate post-treatment (Time 2),&#xD;
      1-month post-treatment (Time 3), and 4-months post-treatment (Time 4)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS One-way repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)&#xD;
      will be used to assess our primary hypothesis-that men will show improvements in primary&#xD;
      (i.e., sexual functioning) endpoints following treatment-with the primary endpoint measures&#xD;
      as the dependent variables (e.g., ED severity, sexual distress, sexual satisfaction,&#xD;
      pleasure), time-point (pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, and&#xD;
      4-months post-treatment) as the independent variable, and age as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary hypotheses-that men will show improvements secondary endpoints (i.e.,&#xD;
      mindfulness-related variables, mental status, and relationship factors) following&#xD;
      treatment-will also be examined using the same repeated-measures MANOVA strategy described&#xD;
      above. The hypothesis that secondary endpoints act as mediators of sexual functioning&#xD;
      following treatment will also be examined using repeated-measures ANOVAs with primary&#xD;
      endpoint measures as the dependent variable (i.e., sexual functioning), time-point&#xD;
      (pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, and 4-months&#xD;
      post-treatment) as the independent variable, and secondary endpoints (e.g., change in&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction) as mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our tertiary hypothesis-that men will report using medications for ED significantly less&#xD;
      4-months after treatment conclusion compared with pre-treatment use-will be assessed using&#xD;
      paired-sample t-tests comparing frequency of use and dose before treatment and 4-months after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The group treatment sessions will integrate empirically supported elements of psychoeduation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and mindfulness skills. Each of the six sessions will follow the well-defined manualized treatment protocol. The treatment is adapted from the study team's previous mindfulness-based treatment group (H15-03172), for situational ED which has been shown to be effective. Participants will be provided with handouts and asked to complete approximately 10-60 minutes/day of at-home practice/skills, which may include reading material, mindfulness exercises, and/or behavioural exercises between sessions. During the 2 follow-up sessions, participants will be invited to share their experience since the conclusion of group, ask questions, and participate in troubleshooting.</description>
