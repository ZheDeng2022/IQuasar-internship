  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global issue due to its alarming high and increasing prevalence&#xD;
      worldwide and the roles it plays in occurrence of many chronic diseases. In addition, obesity&#xD;
      is characterized as a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation and is associated with an&#xD;
      abnormal inflammatory response, low antioxidant capacity and reduced insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      which lead to the generation of inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in Malaysia, study by National Health and Morbidity Survey Malaysia (NHMS) in 2011 and&#xD;
      2015 showed a continuing increase of the problem. In response to the rise of obesity&#xD;
      prevalence, various efforts and strategies have been implemented in the past decade to combat&#xD;
      this problem. The use of natural products as therapeutic agents in preventing metabolic&#xD;
      disease has becoming popular. Cocoa and its products is a largely consumed food in the world.&#xD;
      It has a very rich sources of phenolic compound. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have&#xD;
      shown that polyphenols, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties, can&#xD;
      boost energy expenditure and thermogenesis, lessen oxidative stress and inflammation while&#xD;
      supporting weight loss management. Furthermore, the contribution of human studies especially&#xD;
      among obese relatively limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The popularity of chocolate and/or cocoa and its frequent consumption made it the target of&#xD;
      many research studies, due to its favourable effects, and to the significant role it may&#xD;
      exert on improving the obesity condition. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of flavanol-rich dark chocolate consumption on metabolic profiles of obese adults&#xD;
      using metabolomic approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle are the leading factors associated with the development&#xD;
      of obesity. Obese adults usually are advised to make lifestyle modifications which include&#xD;
      dietary restriction and physical activity recommendation. In addition, dietary supplements&#xD;
      and medication such as anti-hypertensive, lipid lowering drugs are used to achieved targeted&#xD;
      body weight of obese adult. Therefore, the confounding factors in this study namely dietary&#xD;
      intake, physical activity, medication, supplements were controlled throughout the study.&#xD;
      These factors including smoking were also controlled as it will affect the metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imbalance between energy intake and expenditure results in adipose tissue expansion due to&#xD;
      excessive lipogenesis in adipose tissues. Generally, it is well accepted that adipose tissue&#xD;
      expansion in an obese state is accompanied by elevated inflammation. Oxidative stress and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory processes are strongly related. Increased abdominal adipose tissue&#xD;
      accelerates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote increased generation&#xD;
      of ROS, both inflammation and oxidative stress play a significant role in the development of&#xD;
      insulin resistant thus further are associated with the degree of metabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hypothesized that cocoa flavanol with the properties of anti-inflammation,&#xD;
      anti-oxidative and antiobesity properties may reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation,&#xD;
      subsequently reduce the insulin resistance and thus improved the outcome measurements in&#xD;
      obese adult. In order to measures the altered metabolite in the urine and blood serum&#xD;
      following cocoa rich flavanol consumption in dark chocolate in obese adult, a metabolomics&#xD;
      based approach is used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, open-labelled, parallel controlled trial where the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive 20 grams of dark chocolate, daily for 12 weeks while the control group&#xD;
      will receive 20 grams of white chocolate daily for 12 weeks. Measurement will be taken&#xD;
      including sociodemographic, anthropometric measurement, diet and physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire, blood and urine samples at baseline and 12 weeks of intervention. Obese male&#xD;
      adult aged 18-45 years old will be recruited&#xD;
