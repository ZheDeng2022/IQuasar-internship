      To develop an intervention to train family carers to perform and document basic vital signs&#xD;
      whilst they provide personal care to their relatives after surgery in order to supplement&#xD;
      patient monitoring conducted by nursing staff. To evaluate the effect of this intervention on&#xD;
      the frequency of documented vital signs for patients in the first three days after surgery in&#xD;
      a stepped-wedge cluster trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quality improvement (QI) interventions can be seen has having a 'hard core', the clinical&#xD;
      processes or practices that are the focus of improvement, and a 'soft periphery', the&#xD;
      improvement methods that will enable change to occur. In the SMARTER trial, family carers&#xD;
      will be trained to perform basic vital signs monitoring and document the results. Nursing and&#xD;
      medical teams looking after patients on the wards will retain full responsibility for patient&#xD;
      care throughout all phases of the trial. The nursing team will be provided with an identical&#xD;
      observation chart for all their ward patients at the beginning of the trial and will be given&#xD;
      training on how to use them and how to respond to deteriorating vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, in addition to the nurses' vital signs monitoring, family&#xD;
      members will be asked to perform basic vital signs monitoring. Participants will be given&#xD;
      clear guidance on when to alert staff to potential danger signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The soft periphery is the training programme and resources designed to assist staff to&#xD;
      rapidly and effectively train these skills combined with ongoing maintenance strategies to&#xD;
      ensure the compliance with the intervention is maintained throughout the intervention period.&#xD;
      We will use the Medical Research Council (MRC) Complex Intervention framework to guide the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of our intervention. Previous empirical work on task-sharing and&#xD;
      relevant theory will be used to design the intervention and associated programme theory&#xD;
      (Phase 1 of the MRC framework), with an iterative co-design process used to further develop&#xD;
      these and test how the intervention works in practice (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention training sessions will last 30 minutes and will be held twice a day over a&#xD;
      period of six months. Carers will be welcome to attend as often as they wish. Carers will be&#xD;
      given practical training to assess the following vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      conscious level (AVPU scale) and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) in accordance with trial&#xD;
      standard operating procedures. An important component of the training package will be&#xD;
      ensuring carers know how to wash their hands before and after contact with their patients.&#xD;
      The study team will ensure that handwashing facilities are available on the ward for use by&#xD;
      carers. Carers will record vital signs on a basic observation chart every 4 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. They will compare results with colour posters displayed throughout each ward,&#xD;
      providing guidance on how and when to notify nursing staff of abnormal vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers will have access to the following equipment throughout the trial: pulse oximeter,&#xD;
      digital wall clock, colour coded guidelines on wall, observation charts, clipboard and pen.&#xD;
      Although poor numeracy and literacy are common in eastern Uganda, most patients will have a&#xD;
      carer who is able to read a digital clock and write numbers. The observation chart will be&#xD;
      designed to be very simple to use. Carers will be encouraged to attend the training sessions&#xD;
      each day to ensure their skills and knowledge are refreshed. After the third post-operative&#xD;
      day, the trial intervention will end although participants may choose to continue monitoring&#xD;
      vital signs and attending training sessions if they wish. It is acknowledged that carers may&#xD;
      have to change throughout the day due to conflicting family or work commitments. Carers will&#xD;
      be encouraged to remain available to monitor their patients for the duration of the study&#xD;
      period (72 hours). Medical and nursing staff on the wards will undergo training in how to&#xD;
      respond appropriately to abnormal vital signs.&#xD;
