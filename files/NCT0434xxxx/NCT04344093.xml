  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that this connected patch could be used in surgical departments to detect&#xD;
      early a cardiovascular or respiratory complication and therefore to treat it without delay.&#xD;
      However, it has not been validated in a hospital setting; that is the purpose of this&#xD;
      project. This step of validating the connected monitoring object is required in different&#xD;
      places: post-interventional surveillance room that approaches a conventional hospital room,&#xD;
      and operating room where artifacts are numerous. Validation will be done by comparing data&#xD;
      from General Electric's conventional monitors, with data from patches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients operated on outside intensive care or intensive care units are hospitalized,&#xD;
      vital signs are collected intermittently by various conventional devices. During the&#xD;
      follow-up period of these patients, it is possible that abnormal vital signs that may&#xD;
      identify clinical deterioration may appear a few minutes to a few hours before a serious&#xD;
      adverse event (infection etc.) occurs. These signals often go unnoticed due to infrequent&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of teams to ensure a rapid response would improve the safety of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients for whom the detection of abnormal vital signs predictive of clinical&#xD;
      deterioration would generate an alarm. This system is based on the identification of patients&#xD;
      at risk and the rapid intervention of the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the crucial issues is therefore the speed of the alarm and its reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of electronic technology offers the possibility of using inexpensive portable&#xD;
      devices (connected patches) that can provide information on vital signs in real time. Vital&#xD;
      signs collected by these devices could be analyzed to predict clinical deterioration prior to&#xD;
      hospital staff visits, especially at night and on weekends when staffing levels are generally&#xD;
      lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The connected patch used in this research is the Devinnova company's device &quot;myAngel&#xD;
      VitalSigns&quot;. The long-term objective would be to be able to use this connected patch in&#xD;
      surgical departments to detect early a complication, particularly of a cardiovascular or&#xD;
      respiratory nature, and therefore to treat it without wasting time. However, it has not been&#xD;
      validated in a hospital setting; that is the purpose of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is therefore to validate Devinnova's connected patch in&#xD;
      different locations: post-interventional surveillance room that approaches a conventional&#xD;
      hospital room, operating room where artifacts are numerous.&#xD;
