  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is an extension on a study already preregistered NCT04209283 and is&#xD;
      designed to investigate the use of a simple cognitive task (a memory cue followed by playing&#xD;
      the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) for decreasing the number of intrusive memories of trauma among&#xD;
      trauma-exposed women in Iceland. This is a single case series using a within subject multiple&#xD;
      baseline AB design. Participants will aim to complete a no-intervention phase ('A': baseline&#xD;
      phase) of one week followed by a one-week intervention phase ('B'), including a one-session&#xD;
      intervention with a researcher comprising the simple cognitive task, followed by instructions&#xD;
      to continue using the technique self-guided in subsequent weeks. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories of trauma in a daily diary. It is predicted&#xD;
      that participants will report fewer intrusive memories during the intervention phase than&#xD;
      during the preceding baseline phase and that the frequency of targeted intrusive memories is&#xD;
      going to decrease relative to non-targeted intrusive memories. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      will explore whether having fewer intrusive memories has an impact on function and/or PTSD,&#xD;
      depressive or anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will attend 3-8 sessions with researchers and sessions will be conducted&#xD;
      remotely via telephone or secure video platform (Kara Connect). In session one, the intrusive&#xD;
      memories will be logged for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary for the following&#xD;
      weeks. Baseline assessment questionnaires will also administered. In the second session, a&#xD;
      memory will be selected and targeted with the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25&#xD;
      min gameplay with mental rotation) followed by monitoring the frequency of both the targeted&#xD;
      and non-targeted intrusive memories. Participants will also complete self-rated questions&#xD;
      concerning the impact of their intrusive memories. The intervention session will be repeated&#xD;
      for other intrusive memories (maximum 6 intervention sessions). In the last intervention&#xD;
      session, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and self-rated questions&#xD;
      assessing the impact of their intrusive memories. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      measures at 1 month follow-up and at 3 month follow-up. In the 1 month follow-up and the 3&#xD;
      month follow-up, participants complete questionnaires and monitor the frequency of intrusive&#xD;
      memories for one week. The investigators note that the intended timeframes (e.g. one-week for&#xD;
      baseline and one-week for intervention phase) may differ slightly across participants&#xD;
      depending on availability and the practicalities of remote delivery.&#xD;
