  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India has the highest incidence of and mortality from multi-drug resistant tuberculosis&#xD;
      (MDR-TB) globally. Vitamin D status may be an important determinant of MDR-TB infection and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes; however, observational evidence is insufficient to support its use as an&#xD;
      adjunct therapy or prophylaxis. Using a case-control design, this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between vitamin D status and active MDR-TB disease among adult outpatient&#xD;
      pulmonary MDR-TB cases, household contact controls, and matched controls from the general&#xD;
      population (non-household controls) in Mumbai, India. This study will also evaluate the&#xD;
      cross-sectional association between vitamin D status and TB infection among household contact&#xD;
      controls and non-household controls, and collect formative data in preparation for future&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials of vitamin D in MDR-TB prevention and treatment in India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To combat the substantial global burdens of TB and MDR-TB, novel treatment strategies and&#xD;
      expanded prevention efforts are critical. Although vitamin D supplementation shows promise in&#xD;
      both of these areas, additional observational evidence is needed to support future randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials. This case-control study in Mumbai, India will clarify associations between&#xD;
      vitamin D status, active MDR-TB disease and TB infection to expand the evidence-base and&#xD;
      inform the design of future trials of vitamin D supplementation for use in MDR-TB infection.&#xD;
      This study will assess vitamin D status, diet, and anthropometry among adult outpatient&#xD;
      MDR-TB cases and controls in Mumbai, India and assess TB infection among controls. The&#xD;
      specific aims are: 1) evaluate the association between vitamin D status and active MDR-TB&#xD;
      infection; 2) evaluate the association between vitamin D status and TB infection among&#xD;
      controls; 3) collect formative data to inform the design of future randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      evaluating vitamin D supplementation and other interventions in MDR-TB treatment and&#xD;
      prevention. To fulfill the first aim, a case-control study will be conducted comparing&#xD;
      vitamin D status between pulmonary MDR-TB cases (including extensively drug-resistant (XDR)&#xD;
      and pre-XDR cases) and two sets of controls: 1) household controls (recruited from the cases'&#xD;
      household contacts) and 2) non-household controls (recruited from non-respiratory departments&#xD;
      of local hospitals). The second aim will involve a cross-sectional study among controls&#xD;
      assessing the association between vitamin D status and TB infection using QuantiFERON-TB&#xD;
      (QFT-TB) interferon-gamma release assays.&#xD;
