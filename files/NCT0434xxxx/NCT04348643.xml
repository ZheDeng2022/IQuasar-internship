    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells&#xD;
      therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CEA+ Cancer,and obtain the recommended dose and&#xD;
      infusion plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEA is a classic tumor marker, especially in more than 80% of colorectal cancer patients. In&#xD;
      normal tissue cells, only a small amount of CEA is expressed in the cell membrane of the&#xD;
      digestive tract cells, and the CEA is expressed toward the cell cavity under physiological&#xD;
      conditions to avoid recognition by CAR-T cells targeting CEA. This is a study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells therapy,and obtain the recommended dose and&#xD;
      infusion plan.&#xD;
