  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test if patient-reported outcomes with automated reporting to&#xD;
      clinicians for remote monitoring of postoperative symptoms is feasible and improves quality&#xD;
      of life, health outcomes, and service utilization in thoracic surgery patients. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic surgery will be asked to self-report symptoms for remote monitoring by&#xD;
      their care team.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized feasibility study. A total of 140 patients undergoing&#xD;
      thoracic surgery will be prospectively enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two&#xD;
      arms. All participants will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO) symptom monitoring. The&#xD;
      two arms are 1) active symptom monitoring and 2) passive symptom monitoring. The participants&#xD;
      randomized to active symptom monitoring will have alerts sent to their clinicians when their&#xD;
      PRO symptom scores exceed baseline postoperative scores (when discharge day scores are&#xD;
      available) by 2 points or more, or when 'severe' or 'very severe' symptoms are reported.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the passive PRO monitoring arm will complete the same PROs as&#xD;
      participants in the active monitoring arm, but will not have alerts sent to their clinician.&#xD;
      All participants will be administered survey instruments to assess quality of life,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and health history. In addition, a subset of 40 participants and their&#xD;
      caregivers will be chosen at 2 months postoperatively to complete a semi-structured interview&#xD;
      about their postoperative symptom reporting experience.&#xD;
