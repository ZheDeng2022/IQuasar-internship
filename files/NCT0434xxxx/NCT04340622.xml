  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test, for safety and efficacy, a novel treatment for opiate addiction that&#xD;
      applies a 4-minute treatment of intense near infra-red light to stimulate a side of the brain&#xD;
      that the investigators determine to be healthier, more mature, and less traumatized.&#xD;
      Investigators will compare an active and a sham treatment given twice weekly for 4-weeks.&#xD;
      Investigators hope this will lead to a significant weapon in the battle against the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic as well as lead to psychological and physiological insights into possible relations&#xD;
      among trauma, cerebral laterality, and addiction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is to demonstrate that a novel treatment for opiate addiction is safe and far&#xD;
      superior to a sham comparison treatment. The treatment is hoped to significantly aid in the&#xD;
      battle against the opioid epidemic that is ravaging much of the country and the world. The&#xD;
      treatment consists of using a 4-minute application of transcranial photobiomodulation, near&#xD;
      infra-red mode, through a supra-luminous LED, to one side of the forehead over the brain&#xD;
      hemisphere that we determine (through a proprietary test) to have a more positive emotional&#xD;
      valence. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate that the treatment will be very effective&#xD;
      in reducing drug cravings, anxiety, and depression as well as in reducing relapses. Aim I&#xD;
      will offer twice-weekly treatments to two groups, active and sham, for 4-weeks and will look&#xD;
      specifically for differences in opioid cravings, anxiety, depression, and opioid use. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate participants weekly for safety and efficacy for 3-weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment. In Aim II a highly-regarded product engineer will work with the company to&#xD;
      design a marketable product that may have patentable elements.&#xD;
