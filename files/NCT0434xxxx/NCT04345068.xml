  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer and cancer treatment often lead patients and survivors to experience a host of chronic&#xD;
      symptoms, of which sleep disturbances are a major concern. Smartphone-based meditation via an&#xD;
      already-developed app (i.e., Calm) is a unique and novel way of providing a potentially&#xD;
      helpful symptom-management strategy to cancer patients and survivors. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      cancer patients/survivors using the Calm smartphone app for eight weeks will see improved&#xD;
      sleep disturbance (primary outcome) as well as anxiety, depression, pain intensity, global&#xD;
      health, quality of life, emotional regulation, and mindfulness when compared to a time and&#xD;
      attention-matched health education podcast control group. Cancer patients/survivors (n=300)&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group for eight weeks, with study&#xD;
      outcome measurement occurring at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., week eight), and&#xD;
      follow-up (i.e., week 20).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients and survivors struggle with chronic symptom burden, including sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and anxiety, among others. Sleep disturbance is&#xD;
      one of the most common complaints among cancer patients and survivors (reported in as many as&#xD;
      85% of cancer patients and survivors, depending on the type of cancer), but is often not&#xD;
      fully addressed by pharmacologic intervention alone. Therefore, cancer patients and survivors&#xD;
      often turn to non-pharmacologic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most available,&#xD;
      evidence-based, non-pharmacologic treatment strategy to manage sleep disturbances in cancer&#xD;
      patients and survivors. However, this treatment modality is time-consuming and intensive,&#xD;
      requiring patients to frequently meet in-person with therapists and physicians at&#xD;
      sites/clinics. This approach may not be sustainable in the long term, as cancer patients&#xD;
      often report barriers to attending in-person interventions, including fatigue,&#xD;
      transportation, and scheduling difficulties. Although remote delivery of CBT-I has been&#xD;
      suggested as an alternative,1 only a single pilot study has investigated this possibility.&#xD;
      The pilot study delivered CBT-I via a mobile app, but was limited by the small sample size&#xD;
      (n=19) and no control group. Further research is needed testing the delivery of efficacious,&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic interventions remotely to cancer patients and survivors for the management&#xD;
      of sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphones, due to their increasing ubiquity among cancer patients and survivors, offer a&#xD;
      novel medium through which to deliver non-pharmacologic sleep-management interventions. In a&#xD;
      recent survey of 1,300 cancer patients, 71% reported owning a mobile smartphone. A 2018&#xD;
      survey of 631 cancer patients demonstrated that 74% regularly use a smartphone, and 39%&#xD;
      expressed an interest in supportive care information via mobile apps. Meditation is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic intervention that has a growing body of literature to document its benefits&#xD;
      for sleep in cancer patients, and it is a less time-consuming and resource-intensive strategy&#xD;
      when compared to CBT-I. Further research needs to examine the potential efficacy of&#xD;
      meditation as an efficacious non-pharmacologic strategy for the self-management of sleep&#xD;
      disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have successfully delivered meditation to hematological cancer patients&#xD;
      previously via the Calm app with moderate effects demonstrated on sleep disturbance. However,&#xD;
      more research is needed to test the preliminary effects of smartphone-based meditation among&#xD;
      cancer patients for sleep disturbance as compared to an active control group. In the proposed&#xD;
      study, the investigators will recruit a national sample of cancer patients and survivors&#xD;
      (N=300) within two years of cancer diagnosis, to pilot test an eight-week smartphone-based&#xD;
      meditation intervention (i.e., Calm; n=150) on sleep disturbance (primary outcome) as&#xD;
      compared to a smartphone-based health education podcast control group (n=150). The&#xD;
      investigators will aim to recruit 50% men into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Explore the preliminary effects of eight weeks of daily meditation delivered&#xD;
      using the Calm app on sleep disturbance in cancer patients and survivors within two years of&#xD;
      diagnosis as compared to a smartphone-based podcast control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this objective is that those in the Calm group will experience&#xD;
      improvements in sleep disturbance greater than those experienced by the podcast control group&#xD;
      at eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Explore the preliminary effects of eight weeks of daily meditation delivered&#xD;
      using the Calm app on cancer patients and survivors within two years of diagnosis on anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, pain intensity, global health, quality of life, emotional regulation, and&#xD;
      mindfulness as compared to a smartphone-based podcast control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this objective is that those in the Calm app group will experience&#xD;
      improvements in anxiety, depression, pain intensity, global health, quality of life,&#xD;
      emotional regulation, and mindfulness greater than those experienced by the podcast control&#xD;
      group at eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective 3: Explore the sustained effects of meditation delivered using the Calm&#xD;
      app on cancer patients and survivors (i.e., 12-week follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this objective is that those in the Calm app group will experience&#xD;
      improvements across outcomes compared to baseline that are sustained at 20 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be 8-weeks in duration and will consist of a series of pre-approved meditation classes. Patients will be asked to participate in at least 10 min/day of meditation (i.e., ~70 min/week). Week 1-4 will consist of the &quot;7 Days of Calm&quot; followed by the &quot;21 Days of Calm&quot;, which are introductory courses offered by Calm and provide basic, introductory meditation classes for beginners. Weeks 5-8 will consist of patients participating in the &quot;Daily Calm&quot; that Calm provides, consisting of 10-12 min meditation classes that have a unique focus each day. Patients will be instructed to participate in at least 10 min/day of meditation, but will be encouraged to do more if they can.</description>
