      This study is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized&#xD;
      post market clinical follow-up study. The objectives of this study are to confirm the&#xD;
      long-term safety, performance and clinical benefits the Exception Cementless femoral stem&#xD;
      (standard and varized) when used in primary total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

      Six surgeons have prospectively collected clinical data for patients operated consecutively&#xD;
      between January 2008 and September 2012. The patients have been operated based on the&#xD;
      indications and contraindications listed in the Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an extension of the surgeons' data collection as an attempt from Zimmer-Biomet&#xD;
      to fulfill its post-market surveillance obligations by recovering clinical data&#xD;
      retrospectively and prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Flowchart - retrospective data collection: most patients had clinical&#xD;
      follow-ups at pre-op, operative, immediate post-op, 3 Months, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7 years&#xD;
      post-surgery during which their surgeons collected clinical data. This data will therefore&#xD;
      only be collected by Zimmer-Biomet after the patients specifically consent to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Flowchart - prospective data collection: The informed consent signed by the&#xD;
      patient for this study also allow Zimmer Biomet to collect the data of the standard clinical&#xD;
      follow-up that will be conducted by the investigators at least 10 years post-surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common operative treatment where an arthritic, degenerative or fractured hip joint is replaced with a prosthetic device if conservative options are unable to relieve pain and debilitating symptoms. THA was traditionally performed on patients over 60 years old, but now includes young and active patients, as well as very old ones thanks to the continuous improvement in implant design. Major indications of THA include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis and hip fractures. The THA surgical procedure involves replacing the head of the femur and acetabulum or socket with an artificial prosthesis. This system is composed of a femoral stem that is inserted into the femoral canal, a ball that attaches to the femoral stem, and an acetabular component or shell that replaces the acetabulum.</description>

        indications and contraindications listed in the Instructions For Use (IFUs) of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For this retrospective and prospective study, only the patients who had consented to the&#xD;
        original data collection after their surgery will be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These the patients should be capable of understanding the surgeon's explanations and&#xD;
        following his instructions, should be able and willing to participate in the last follow-up&#xD;
        visit, and should give consent to take part in the study. The patients should meet all the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
