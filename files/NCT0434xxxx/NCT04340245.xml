  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to analyse MRI images and biological samples from 60 men diagnosed as having&#xD;
      intermediate risk prostate cancer at baseline and one year afterwards to compare the&#xD;
      molecular, genetic and transcriptomic differences between cancers that progress and cancers&#xD;
      which do not.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RECONCILE is a single centre, prospective, longitudinal observational cohort study. 60&#xD;
      consenting men with intermediate risk, gleason 3+4, prostate cancer under active surveillance&#xD;
      will be recruited to the study. They will undergo blinded, concurrent molecular and&#xD;
      radiological analysis of their cancer at baseline and at one year. Tests at baseline and one&#xD;
      year will include mpMRI, targeted prostate biopsy and further tissue sampling (semen, urine&#xD;
      and blood). There will be PSA monitoring at 3 monthly intervals throughout the study as per&#xD;
      standard of care active surveillance. Tissue will be analysed for biological and molecular&#xD;
      markers significantly associated with radiological progression events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting to taking part in the study a patient will come in for an MRI scan as&#xD;
      standard of care. This scan will be used at a subsequent visit to inform a guided&#xD;
      trans-perineal biopsy. At this biopsy visit patients will provide research blood samples, a&#xD;
      urine sample and have a confirmatory biopsy. After the standard of care diagnostic tissue&#xD;
      samples are taken, three research tissue samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has been identified through the ReIMAGINE study and consents to take part in&#xD;
      RECONCILE then these baseline visits are not needed, the data from ReIMAGINE will be used as&#xD;
      the baseline visit data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will come in as scheduled for their regular PSA visits in line with their active&#xD;
      surveillance protocol. If a PSA test shows signs of potential progression the patient will&#xD;
      have a standard of care diagnostic MRI, if this confirms progression then the imaging and&#xD;
      biopsy visits scheduled for one year will be triggered early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of any identified progression the patient will return after 12 months and have&#xD;
      both the imaging and biopsy visits repeated (again providing blood and urine). After this&#xD;
      visit the patient will be considered as having finished the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to take part in the study who have previously taken part in the PLiS&#xD;
      semen donation study will be asked to provide a semen sample before the one year biopsy visit&#xD;
      for comparison with the baseline sample that was provided for the PLiS study.&#xD;

Biomarker definition (NIH NCI dictionary) A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition. Also called molecular marker and signature molecule.</description>
