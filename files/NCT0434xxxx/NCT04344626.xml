    <textblock>
      Refractory epilepsy, meaning epilepsy that no longer responds to medication, is a common&#xD;
      neurosurgical indication in children. In such cases, surgery is the treatment of choice.&#xD;
      Complete resection of affected brain tissue is associated with highest probability of seizure&#xD;
      freedom. However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue,&#xD;
      complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods are of limited use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important subjective assessment during surgery is that affected brain tissue feels&#xD;
      stiffer, however there is presently no way to determine this without committing to resecting&#xD;
      the affected area. It is hypothesized that intra-operative use of a tonometer (Diaton) will&#xD;
      identify abnormal brain tissue stiffness in affected brain relative to normal brain. This&#xD;
      will help identify stiffer brain regions without having to resect them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue&#xD;
      stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying epileptogenic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants with refractory epilepsy, various locations on the cerebral cortex will be&#xD;
      identified using standard pre-operative investigations like magnetic resonance imagin (MRI)&#xD;
      and positron emission tomography (PET). These are areas of presumed normal and abnormal brain&#xD;
      where the tonometer will be used during surgery to measure brain tissue stiffness. Brain&#xD;
      tissue stiffness measurements will then be compared with results of routine pre-operative and&#xD;
      intra-operative tests. Such comparisons will help determine if and to what extent&#xD;
      intra-operative brain tissue stiffness measurements correlate with other tests and help&#xD;
      identify epileptogenic brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 participants have already undergone intra-operative brain tonometry. Results in these&#xD;
      participants are encouraging: abnormally high brain tissue stiffness measurements have&#xD;
      consistently been identified and significantly associated with abnormal brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tonometer adequately identifies epileptogenic brain tissue through brain tissue&#xD;
      stiffness measurements, it is possible that resection of identified tissue could lead to&#xD;
      better post-operative outcomes, lowering seizure recurrences and neurological deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Refractory epilepsy, meaning epilepsy that no longer responds to medication, is a&#xD;
      common neurosurgical indication in children. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is the most&#xD;
      common cause. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease causing epilepsy in&#xD;
      over 90% of affected patients. This epilepsy can also become refractory to medication. In&#xD;
      such cases of FCD or TSC, surgery is the treatment of choice. Complete resection of brain&#xD;
      tissue affected by FCD or TSC is associated with highest probability of seizure freedom.&#xD;
      However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue,&#xD;
      complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods such as magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), electro-encephalography (EEG) and positron emission tomography (PET), are of&#xD;
      limited use. Failure to achieve complete resection may lead to seizure recurrence, which is&#xD;
      costly and requires additional surgeries, increasing risks of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      compared to achieving remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in tissue stiffness due to an underlying pathology are common in medicine, especially&#xD;
      in neurological disorders. An important subjective assessment during epilepsy surgery,&#xD;
      particularly in FCD cases, is that affected brain tissue feels stiffer. However, there is&#xD;
      currently no way to determine stiffness without committing to resecting the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Epileptogenic brain tissue stiffness, as measured intra-operatively using a&#xD;
      digital tonometer (Diaton), will likely be increased relative to normal brain tissue. This&#xD;
      could allow identification of regions of higher stiffness without having to commit to&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tonometer is a widely-used and FDA-approved tool to measure intraocular pressure. It is a&#xD;
      simple and reliable tool to measure brain tissue stiffness without obstructing the operative&#xD;
      field. It requires only minimal contact in brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is multicentric and includes University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Mattel&#xD;
      Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and Sainte-Justine University Hospital in Montreal.&#xD;
      Results from 24 participants in a preliminary study from UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital were&#xD;
      encouraging, prompting expansion of the study to include both sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue&#xD;
      stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying affected epileptogenic brain tissue,&#xD;
      notably in FCD. This could also allow identification of resection margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Eventually, to investigate is epilepsy surgery guided by brain tissue&#xD;
      stiffness measurements can lead to better post-operative outcomes, especially regarding&#xD;
      seizure recurrences and neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants with refractory epilepsy and considered candidates for surgery&#xD;
      following a multidisciplinary meeting and consultation with a neurosurgeon, will undergo&#xD;
      standard pre-operative investigations such as MRI, EEG and PET, to identify regions of&#xD;
      presumed normal and abnormal brain. Precise locations in both presumed normal and abnormal&#xD;
      brain will be identified for intra-operative brain stiffness measurements using the&#xD;
      tonometer. Measurements will be taken on all lobes exposed during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, a craniotomy will be performed and the dura mater will be folded to maximize&#xD;
      brain exposition. Once the brain is exposed, a sterilized tonometer will be used to obtain&#xD;
      brain tissue stiffness measurements at all predetermined locations of the cortex. Precise&#xD;
      stereotactic coordinates for each measurement will be recorded in a neuronavigation software&#xD;
      to facilitate comparisons with results of other tests. Brain tissue stiffness measurements&#xD;
      will then be compared to results of aforementioned pre-operative tests, as well as results of&#xD;
      routine intra-operative tests, namely electro-corticography (ECoG) and histopathological&#xD;
      analysis of resected brain tissue (if brain tissue is ultimately resected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this method, it will be possible to determine if and to what extent intra-operative use&#xD;
      of the tonometer can identify epileptogenic brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks to the patient associated with intra-operative use of the tonometer.&#xD;
      Data collection adds approximately 10 minutes to surgery, which typically lasts around 7&#xD;
      hours (420 minutes). Therefore, time in surgery and general anesthesia is only lengthened by&#xD;
      2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, no surgical decision concerning resection of brain tissue is currently based on&#xD;
      brain tissue stiffness measurements obtained with the tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting: Participants suffering from refractory epilepsy and deemed candidates for&#xD;
      surgical treatment during a multidisciplinary meeting will consult with a neurosurgeon.&#xD;
      During this consultation, if surgery is adequate and participant is eligible, the present&#xD;
      study will be explained and discussed with the participant and his/her parent(s) or legal&#xD;
      tutor(s). They will receive the informed consent form. Their questions will be answered. Time&#xD;
      will be given to think about their participation to this study. If they consent, consent will&#xD;
      be obtained through signing the informed consent form. If they refuse to participate, medical&#xD;
      and surgical treatment will resume as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      File review: Medical files of patients prospectively recruited will be reviewed with the&#xD;
      participant's consent. Data relevant to the study includes: sex, ethnicity, age at onset of&#xD;
      epilepsy, age at surgery, number of antiepileptic medications, etiology, video-EEG results,&#xD;
      MRI results, PET results, digital pictures of the brain during surgery, individual brain&#xD;
      stiffness measurements taken with the tonometer along with co-recorded neuronavigation images&#xD;
      and coordinates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests: Before surgery, each participant will undergo routine pre-operative work-up including&#xD;
      video-EEG, MRI and PET. During surgery, ECoG will be performed. If brain tissue is resected,&#xD;
      in will be analyzed by pathologist to establish a histopathological diagnosis. These are&#xD;
      routine investigations in epilepsy surgery. They are not modified by the results of&#xD;
      tonometry. The only additional test is intra-operative brain tissue stiffness measurements&#xD;
      using the tonometer. As discussed previously, this is not associated with any risks to the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that 150 participants will be enrolled across both sites for this study.&#xD;
      Anonymized data for each patient will be shared between both sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, there are no possible controls for such a study. Post-mortem brain tissue&#xD;
      undergoes irreversible biomechanical changes and no healthy patient undergoes comparable&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedures. To overcome this issue, an experimental model involving intra- and&#xD;
      inter-participant comparisons is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Once data will be collected, statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
      Continuous data will be reported using means and standard-deviations. Dichotomic data will be&#xD;
      reported using frequencies and percentages. Mean and standard-deviations of brain tissue&#xD;
      stiffness measurements will be compared for each covariable category using a t-test or ANOVA.&#xD;
      Findings will be reported with a beta coefficient, 95 percent confidence intervals and&#xD;
      p-values. P-values under 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Further&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be determined during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe: This study is predicted to last 36 months. Recruiting and treatment of&#xD;
      participants, along with data collection will be performed initially. Following this, data&#xD;
      will be analyzed and results discussed. Article(s) related to this study will be written&#xD;
      afterwards.&#xD;

With this method, each brain tissue stiffness measurement can be compared to presence or absence of an underlying lesion on MRI; to presence or absence of epileptogenic foci on EEG; to presence of iso- or hypometabolism on PET; to presence or absence of epileptogenic foci on ECoG; to pathological diagnosis and severity of cortical disorganization on histopathological analysis.&#xD;
This will give insight into how well brain tissue stiffness measurements correlate with, and potentially identify, structural and functional epileptic brain anomalies.</description>
