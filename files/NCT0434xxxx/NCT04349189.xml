      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the abnormal clotting of blood in a deep vein of the&#xD;
      upper or lower limbs (deep vein thrombosis) that may travel to and block a blood vessel in&#xD;
      the lung (pulmonary embolism). Some people with sickle cell disease (SCD)-a red blood cell&#xD;
      disorder-seem to be at greater risk for developing these blood clots. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study the blood of people with SCD and VTE as well as healthy people to develop better&#xD;
      treatments to prevent blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study blood clotting in SCD because it is the most common cause of vascular death after a&#xD;
      heart attack or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-80 who have SCD (with or without a history of blood clots) or the trait for&#xD;
      SCD, and healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and medical records&#xD;
      review. They will give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have phone calls either every 3 months or once a year, for 2 years. They&#xD;
      will give updates on their health. They may give additional medical records. The phone calls&#xD;
      may last up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have a VTE or pain crisis episode, they may visit the Clinical Center. These&#xD;
      visits may last up to 4 hours. They will repeat the screening tests and give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may be invited to take part in blood studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 years, some participants will have a follow-up visit at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) the third most frequent cause of vascular mortality after&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and stroke, occurs more frequently among Americans of African descent&#xD;
      compared with other ethnic minorities in the US. VTEs are provoked by diverse risk factors&#xD;
      but can be unprovoked in individuals with a hypercoagulable state, in whom there is a&#xD;
      predisposition for thrombosis. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) have added risk of VTE&#xD;
      as the disease itself is a hypercoagulable state. VTE frequency is increased across the&#xD;
      entire spectrum of SCD severity, in those experiencing both mild (HbSC patients) and severe&#xD;
      sickling symptoms (HbSS/HbSbeta0 thalassemia patients). Studies show that up to 12% of&#xD;
      patients with SCD have VTE events [deep vein thrombus (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) or&#xD;
      both] early in life by age 40, most of which are unprovoked. Moreover, owing to a persistent&#xD;
      hypercoagulable state, SCD patients are at an unacceptably high risk for recurrence,&#xD;
      particularly those in whom VTE was unprovoked. SCD patients who develop a VTE have a 24.1%&#xD;
      risk of recurrence over 5 years. A history of a VTE in SCD is associated with greater&#xD;
      mortality risk (Odd Ratio, OR = 2.88; Confidence Interval, CI = 2.35 - 3.52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall hypothesis is that the proinflammatory state associated with SCD perturbs the&#xD;
      coagulation system and contributes to the thrombotic vascular pathobiology of SCD. Abnormal&#xD;
      intravascular tissue factor expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and circulating&#xD;
      tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles released by these cells drive coagulation&#xD;
      activation in SCD. Specifically, intravascular tissue factor forms the tenase complex&#xD;
      (TF:VIIa) which converts factor X to factor Xa, generating the initial thrombin burst that&#xD;
      possibly triggers intravascular thrombosis. Besides, heightened tissue factor exposure during&#xD;
      acute sickling crises, increased release of tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles and&#xD;
      inadequate clearance of the latter favors thrombin generation, fibrin deposition and&#xD;
      thrombosis in the venous vasculature. SCD patients with VTE and/or recurrent VTE are&#xD;
      therefore more likely to have more tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles and plasma&#xD;
      tissue factor procoagulant activity compared with SCD patients without VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort studies of extended duration/indefinite anticoagulation in non-SCD&#xD;
      patients with an underlying hypercoagulable state have effectively reduced recurrence rates.&#xD;
      However, similar studies of extended duration anticoagulation in SCD patients are lacking.&#xD;
      Besides, whether exposing SCD patients to extended/indefinite anticoagulation increases&#xD;
      bleeding risk to unacceptably high levels is unknown. Studying thrombogenic risk and&#xD;
      specifically identifying those SCD patients who are at greatest risk for VTE recurrence&#xD;
      therefore becomes a high priority. In addition, individuals with sickle cell trait are prone&#xD;
      to thrombosis but few studies evaluate markers of thrombotic risk in these individuals. Such&#xD;
      studies could provide a rationale for targeted primary or secondary VTE prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current proposal we will test the hypothesis that plasma tissue factor positive&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles and tissue factor activity are elevated among SCD patients with VTE&#xD;
      compared with SCD patients without VTE and in individuals with Sickle Cell Trait compared&#xD;
      with ethnically matched controls.&#xD;

        The natural history of SCD 04-H-0161 protocol (NCT00081523) will specifically be leveraged&#xD;
        to recruit participants with VTE. In this study we will assess feasibility of establishing&#xD;
        a prospective natural history study of thrombosis in SCD. Establishing feasibility could&#xD;
        lead to recruitment of SCD patients experiencing thrombosis, particularly those that are&#xD;
        understudied including patients with HbSC disease.&#xD;
