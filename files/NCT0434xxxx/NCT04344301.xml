  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a multi-site, two-arm, parallel-group, patient-randomized,&#xD;
      blocked, controlled, pilot trial with a 3-month follow up in older adults (≥65 years) with&#xD;
      diabetes and hypertension. Participants will be randomized to receive AUDIO recordings of&#xD;
      their clinic visits (AUDIO) in addition to After Visit Summary (AVS), or their AVS alone&#xD;
      (Usual Care (UC). The investigators will recruit 90 adults (30 per site) over the targeted&#xD;
      recruitment period of approximately 6 months. The primary outcome of interest is the&#xD;
      feasibility of the trial and acceptability of the AUDIO intervention. The investigators will&#xD;
      also explore the impact of AUDIO on patients' ability to self-manage care (as well as other&#xD;
      exploratory health-related outcomes and healthcare utilization) at regular intervals from&#xD;
      enrollment (T1 = 1 week, T2 = 3 months) compared to baseline (T0 = pre-visit) and usual care.&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit patients from consented clinicians at three sites:&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Primary Care (D-H; Manchester, NH), Vanderbilt University Medical Center&#xD;
      (VUMC; Nashville, TN), and University of Texas Medical Branch, (UTMB; Galveston, TX).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately&#xD;
      post-visit. This is a significant barrier to self-management, especially in older adults with&#xD;
      multimorbidity leading to poor health outcomes. After visit summaries (AVS) can improve&#xD;
      recall, yet concerns exist about their layout, accuracy and low patient uptake. Patients and&#xD;
      clinicians have begun audio recording clinic visits. When patients receive an audio recording&#xD;
      of the visit, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in greater recall.&#xD;
      Despite its growing use, to date, there is no research on the impact of recording and sharing&#xD;
      clinic visits of patient self-management ability, health-related outcomes or healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a multi-site pilot trial evaluating&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of routinely sharing audio recordings of clinic visits&#xD;
      (AUDIO) in older adults (≥65 years) with diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a multi-site, two-arm, parallel-group, patient-randomized, blocked, controlled, pilot&#xD;
      trial with 3-month follow up, to determine the feasibility and acceptability of sharing audio&#xD;
      recordings of clinic visits (AUDIO) on self-management in older adults with diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension, compared to the after visit written summary (AVS) alone (Usual Care).&#xD;
      Investigators will determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Feasibility of a larger trial by meeting recruitment targets at each site (n=30 per site;&#xD;
      total n=90) and determining the optimal strategy to achieve a high retention rate and&#xD;
      adherence to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Acceptability by assessing the proportion of patients and clinicians who agree to take&#xD;
      part in the project and the proportion of patients who listen to the recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Potential effectiveness by collecting data on the impact of audio recordings on&#xD;
      self-management, health-related outcomes, healthcare utilization, and clinician behavior.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that compared to those receiving UC, patients randomized to also&#xD;
      receive audio recordings (AUDIO) of clinic visits will report a greater self-management&#xD;
      activation (Patient Activation Measure - Short Form) at 3 months. Investigators will also&#xD;
      explore whether the effect of AUDIO on self-management activation compared to UC is greater&#xD;
      for patients with low health literacy than those with high health literacy.&#xD;
