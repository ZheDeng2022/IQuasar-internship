  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-phase protocol. Phase 1 will include the development of the peanut-based&#xD;
      school food, and a small formative research study on the acceptability and consumption of the&#xD;
      school food study intervention. This will occur at 1 of the 5 schools in the Mion district,&#xD;
      60 school aged children between 6-12 years old will be recruited to participate in a 3 week&#xD;
      consumption and acceptability study. An integral part of the food development process is&#xD;
      acceptability testing. A child must like and want to eat a new food if it is to be consumed&#xD;
      as prescribed and effective in potential improving linear growth and cognitive performance.&#xD;
      This study will confirm that food developed for the school feeding clinical trial will be&#xD;
      consumed as dosed and what additional snack food offerings may be useful in encouraging&#xD;
      consumption. Phase 2 will be a randomized, investigator blinded, controlled clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness trial of a peanut-based school meal with and without milk powder compared to a&#xD;
      control meal on linear growth and cognitive performance. Up to 1,000, 6 to 12 years old,&#xD;
      healthy, enrolled in P1 or KG2 level classes at 5 selected schools in the Mion district will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive one of three school foods, a peanut-based food with milk, the same&#xD;
      peanut-based food without milk and a control group composed of commonly available&#xD;
      tuber/cereal. The sample size accounts for 25% attrition for a final sample size of 750 with&#xD;
      a total 250 eligible children enrolled in each group. Enrolled children will receive the meal&#xD;
      daily during the school lunch period for an entire school year. At enrolment, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and body composition data will be collected and a tablet- based and language&#xD;
      independent cognitive test will be administered. Participants will receive a token of&#xD;
      appreciation at after their enrolment testing and at the completion of the study. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes will be change in height-for-age z score and change in cognitive performance on&#xD;
      tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated battery. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be change in body mass index, change in anthropometric measurements, and change in other&#xD;
      body compositions measurements measured by bioelectrical impedance.&#xD;
