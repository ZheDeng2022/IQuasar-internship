  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A revised ultrasound-guided approach to the lumbar plexus is investigated as for efficacy and&#xD;
      safety in elderly trauma patients undergoing operations of the lower extremeties.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A modified ultrasound-guided Shamrock approach combined to nerve stimulation of the lumbar&#xD;
      plexus is going to be investigated, in elderly trauma patients undergoing procedures of the&#xD;
      lower extremities. The technique is going to be assessed as for its safety and its accuracy&#xD;
      in localization of the plexus, by multiple measurements of the imaging time and needling&#xD;
      time, In addition, efficacy and complications will be recorded and assessed during the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period.&#xD;
