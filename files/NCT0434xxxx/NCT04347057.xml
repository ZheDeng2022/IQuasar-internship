  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired infections (HIs) are defined as an infection developed within 48-72 hours&#xD;
      of admission to hospital in whom the infection was not incubating at the time of admission to&#xD;
      the hospital or an infection acquired in the hospital but appearing 10 days after discharged.&#xD;
      Hospital infections threaten patient safety due to the complications they cause, even if they&#xD;
      are preventable problems. Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci which cause hospital&#xD;
      infections are among the important pathogens in terms of antibiotic resistance development&#xD;
      (MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, VRE: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing treatment in ICU are at a higher risk of infection than patients in other&#xD;
      units of the hospital because of the seriousness of their condition and their high exposure&#xD;
      to invasive procedures. MRSA and VRE are two important microorganism types that cause&#xD;
      infection in patients who are hospitalized in ICU and take long-term care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, international recommendations for prevention and control of hospital infections&#xD;
      include handwashing and individual hygiene practices with skin antisepsis. Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and bacteria killing agent that causes less&#xD;
      irritation to skin. In the literature, bathing with various concentrations of chlorhexidine&#xD;
      has been shown to significantly reduce the MRSA and VRE contamination risk and skin&#xD;
      colonization. These studies are mostly performed in medical, surgical or cardiology ICU but&#xD;
      there are very limited studies in the hematology-oncology patients who are more susceptible&#xD;
      for the hospital infections because of the their illnesses and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the crossover design; patients who meet the sampling inclusion criteria within&#xD;
      the first 24 hours of the ICU admission will be randomly separated two arm (n = 30 for each&#xD;
      arm) and bath applications will be performed. After the first swab sample will be taken; the&#xD;
      control and intervention bathing protocols will be applied to each group of patients. To&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the bath product another swab sample will be taken after 4-6&#xD;
      hours after the bathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that to study on this subject is very important because of the bath bathing&#xD;
      which is a personal hygiene practices is a basic nursing application and there is a limited&#xD;
      literature information about the effectiveness of these bathing on to prevent the infections&#xD;
      in our country and a limited world and national literature information with cancer patients.&#xD;
      The results obtained from the research will be contributing the literature and searching area&#xD;
      of the prevention and control of hospital infections and will be provide the guidance on the&#xD;
      development of patient care quality&#xD;

      The study was designed as an experimental, 2-arm, cross-over clinical trial, involving&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU of a university oncology hospital between September 2018 and July&#xD;
      2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted at one medical intensive care unit of an oncology hospital, which is&#xD;
      one of the four hospitals of a state university located at the capital city of Turkey. The&#xD;
      University is the first public institution in Turkey accredited by the Joint Commission&#xD;
      International (JCI) for its quality of health care services. The ICU of the oncology hospital&#xD;
      provides care for patients with a variety of medical conditions, but particularly specialized&#xD;
      for critical patients with oncological and haematological diseases. The ICU includes eight&#xD;
      beds and two isolation rooms each of which has one patient bed, and the average daily&#xD;
      admission of patients to ICU was 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the NCSS-PASS 2007 statistical package program (Blackwelder, 1998), the minimum sample&#xD;
      size with 80.0% power and type 1 error of 5.0% was calculated as 58 patients for an inclusion&#xD;
      period of 1 year; however 61 patients who met the inclusion criteria composed the study&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to the ICU were assessed for eligibility and included to the study&#xD;
      sample if they aged over 18 years, diagnosed with a hematologic-oncologic disease and&#xD;
      admitted within the first 24 hours to the ICU. Exclusion criteria for participation were; age&#xD;
      &lt; 18 years, burns to &gt;20% of the total skin surface, pregnancy, previous MRSA and/or VRE&#xD;
      infection history or antibiotic use for these infections, receiving radiation therapy,&#xD;
      admitted before 24 hours to ICU, re-admission to ICU, diagnosed with severe septic shock,&#xD;
      massive pulmonary thromboembolism, massive haemoptysis, and status epilepticus etc., general&#xD;
      condition disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 139 patients with a hematologic-oncologic disease were assessed for eligibility of&#xD;
      whom 61 excluded due to discharge (n=11) or death (n=6) before 24 hours of hospitalization,&#xD;
      admission to ICU before the eligibility assessment of researcher (n=8), repeated admission to&#xD;
      ICU (n=6), severely impaired medical condition (n=6), age under 18 years (n=2), massive&#xD;
      pulmonary thromboembolism (n=2), previous MRSA infection (n=2), and severe septic shock&#xD;
      (n=1). Seventeen patients did not provide consent for participation and their relatives were&#xD;
      not available. After eligibility assessment, 78 patients were randomised into two arms&#xD;
      according to the order of admission to the ICU. Arm 1 (39 patients) included first the&#xD;
      control period, followed by one-day wash-out, and then the intervention period. Arm 2 (39&#xD;
      patients) included first the intervention period, followed by one-day wash-out, and then the&#xD;
      control period. The first patient was assigned to the second arm after the draw, and the&#xD;
      patients continued to take the first arm and second arm respectively. Each period lasted&#xD;
      three consecutive days with a total of 7 days for each patient. During the period of the&#xD;
      study, 8 patients from Arm1 and 9 patients from Arm 2 could not complete the study due to&#xD;
      several reasons. Thus, the final sample consisted of 31 patients in Arm 1 and 30 patients in&#xD;
      Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the ethical approval of the study protocol, official permissions, and informed&#xD;
      consents, the researcher started to work at the ICU every day from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm to&#xD;
      collect data and perform the procedures. A patient information and evaluation form was used&#xD;
      to collect data on patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, including the Glasgow&#xD;
      coma scale, medications ordered for each patient, patient risk factors, skin reactions, and&#xD;
      bathing protocols. This form was filled out every morning for each patient except the&#xD;
      demographic characteristics. The MRSA and/or VRE colonization results of swab samples taken&#xD;
      before and after the bathing procedures were also recorded in this form. Medical conditions&#xD;
      and the APACHE II scores of patients were evaluated and recorded to patient electronic files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for control period included providing daily bed bathing with soap and water over&#xD;
      three consecutive days, while intervention period included daily bed bathing with 2% CHG&#xD;
      solution over three consecutive days. Patients were bathed from the neck down, avoiding&#xD;
      contact with face, mucous membranes and wounds by wiping with soap or CHG for each period.&#xD;
      The patient's skin bathed in the order of clean area to dirty area. Additionally, if patients&#xD;
      in both arms became soiled after the daily baths, contaminated body areas were wiped using&#xD;
      water and disposable washcloths. Patients were assessed daily for localised or body-wide skin&#xD;
      reactions. During control period, patients were washed with soap and then rinsed with water,&#xD;
      and dried with disposable towels. During intervention period, 4% CHG solution was diluted&#xD;
      with water. In order to dilute the 4% CHG solution, 120 ml (~4 ounce) of 4% CHG solution was&#xD;
      added to 120 ml (~4 ounce) of water in a disposable box each time (to a final concentration&#xD;
      of 2%) (Swan et al., 2016) and this solution was applied to the patient body directly. The&#xD;
      lowest concentration of the extract inhibited growth of bacteria was selected as minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Knapp, 2014; Vali, Dashti, El-Shazly, &amp; Jadaon, 2015) and&#xD;
      diluting CHG to a concentration as low as 0.4% does not affect CHG antiseptic efficacy&#xD;
      (Bajaj, Loh, &amp; Borgstrom, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swab samples were collected from nares, groins, and perirectal area of each patient&#xD;
      within 24 hours of admission to the ICU and on days 3, 5, and 7; immediately before and 4-6&#xD;
      hours after the bathing by the researcher. Totally, 24 swab samples (3 area x 2 times x 4&#xD;
      days) were taken from each patient at the end of the periods. In order to obtain the sample,&#xD;
      a sterile cotton swab was moistened with sterile buffered transport medium and each swap&#xD;
      specimen was placed in a vial containing transport media and transported to the clinical&#xD;
      microbiology laboratory of the study institution by the researcher (first author).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The swab samples were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar and incubated for 16-18 hours at 37⁰C.&#xD;
      Typical colonies were examined by Gram staining, catalase and plasma coagulase tests and were&#xD;
      identified as S. aureus .In order to determine the resistance to methicillin, disc diffusion&#xD;
      test was performed by using cefoxitin (30 μg, Oxoid, UK) disc on Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid,&#xD;
      UK) in accordance with EUCAST recommendations (Matuschek, Brown, &amp; Kahlmeter, 2014).&#xD;
      Resistance was confirmed after the determination of mecA gene by a commercially-available&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay; (BD MaxTM MRSA XT, Canada) (Baby et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect VRE colonization, chromID® VRE (bioMerieux, France) selective media was&#xD;
      used and typical colonies formed after 24 hours of incubation at 37⁰Cwere identified as&#xD;
      Enterococcus faecium by API-ID Strep (bioMerieux, France). Vancomycin resistance was&#xD;
      determined by vancomycin E-test (Oxoid, UK) and vanA and vanB, genes were examined by by PCR&#xD;
      method (BD GeneOhmTM, Ireland (He et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For detection of both bacteria, non-growth media were re-evaluated after incubating for&#xD;
      another 48 hours under the same conditions. The ICU physicians in the study unit were&#xD;
      informed for MRSA and/or VRE-positive patients by the researcher. and all identified MRSA and&#xD;
      / or VRE colonized patients were placed on contact precautions.&#xD;
