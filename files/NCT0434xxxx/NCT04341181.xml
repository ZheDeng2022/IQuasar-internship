      The ProTarget study is a phase II, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial with the&#xD;
      primary purpose of investigating the safety and efficacy of commercially available cancer&#xD;
      drugs that target specific changes in cancer cell DNA to treat patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is anti-tumor activity or stable disease documented after 16 weeks of&#xD;
      experimental drug treatment. The drugs used in the trial have been approved by EMA/FDA for&#xD;
      the treatment of certain cancers. Choice of drug is based on whether the patient's cancer&#xD;
      cells contain precisely the DNA change (i) targeted by the EMA/FDA-approved drug or (ii)&#xD;
      related to sensitivity to the EMA/FDA-approved drug. The trial drug is thus not approved by&#xD;
      the EMA/FDA or in Denmark for the treatment of the patient's cancer - it is so-called&#xD;
      &quot;off-label use&quot;. The secondary purposes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect side effects in patients treated with commercially available targeted cancer&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing biomarker analyzes, including (but not limited to) whole-genome analysis&#xD;
           (WGS) on a fresh tumor tissue sample (biopsy) at baseline and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate mechanisms of resistance using recurrent / serial fresh tumor biopsies&#xD;
           for WGS and so-called liquid biopsies, which are blood samples in which the cancer cell&#xD;
           DNA is analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include response duration, progression-free survival, and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

      The ProTarget study is a phase II, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to&#xD;
      describe the safety and efficacy of commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drugs&#xD;
      prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer having a potentially actionable&#xD;
      genomic variant revealed by a genomic test or immunohistochemistry test for protein&#xD;
      overexpression performed in a laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory&#xD;
      authority. The study also aims to catalogue the choice of genomic test by clinical&#xD;
      oncologists and learn about the utility of data collected through this study to develop&#xD;
      hypotheses for future clinical trials. Eligible patients will have an advanced malignant&#xD;
      disease with molecular aberrations for which standard treatment options are no longer&#xD;
      available or feasible and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic test or&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry test for protein overexpression must have been performed on a specimen&#xD;
      of the tumor selected by the investigator in a laboratory accredited by the competent local&#xD;
      regulatory authority and the test must identify at least one potentially actionable genomic&#xD;
      variant as defined in the protocol. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma or&#xD;
      other body fluids (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is&#xD;
      performed in a laboratory that meets the requirements described above. The investigator will&#xD;
      select an appropriate drug from among those available in the protocol that targets the&#xD;
      identified genomic variant and begin treatment once any drug-specific eligibility criteria&#xD;
      are confirmed. If an eligible drug-variant match is not listed in the protocol, the physician&#xD;
      may submit a proposal to treat with a drug available in the protocol, along with relevant&#xD;
      clinical information and the genomic test results, to the study Molecular Tumor Board for&#xD;
      review. The investigator may also choose to request options from the Molecular Tumor Board on&#xD;
      treatment selection. The Molecular Tumor Board will return to the physician a list of&#xD;
      potential treatment options. If the physician's choice of drug is among those available in&#xD;
      the protocol and also one of the options provided by the Molecular Tumor Board, the&#xD;
      protocol-specified treatment may be administered to the patient once any drug-specific&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are confirmed. The investigator may not enroll a patient on a ProTarget&#xD;
      study drug if it is not among the options listed in the protocol or provided by the Molecular&#xD;
      Tumor Board. In this case, the non-ProTarget treatment and follow-up will be at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the&#xD;
      protocol will be followed for standard toxicity and efficacy outcomes including tumor&#xD;
      response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment and high&#xD;
      grade or serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe in different types of population the anti-tumor activity (efficacy) and&#xD;
           toxicity (safety) of commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drugs used for&#xD;
           treatment of patients with advanced disease with a genomic variant known (i) to be a&#xD;
           target of an EMA-approved anti-cancer drug or (ii) to predict sensitivity to an&#xD;
           EMA-approved anti-cancer drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record the site investigator determination treatment-related adverse events&#xD;
           experienced by patients receiving treatment with commercially available, targeted&#xD;
           anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform refined biomarker analyses, including (but not limited to) whole genome&#xD;
           sequencing, on a fresh tumor biopsy specimen at baseline and at progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study mechanisms of resistance by the use of serial fresh tumor biopsies for WGS and&#xD;
           liquid biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Eligible patients will have an advanced malignant disease for which&#xD;
      standard treatment options are no longer available or feasible and acceptable performance&#xD;
      status and organ function. A genomic profiling test or immunohistochemistry test for protein&#xD;
      expression or overexpression must have been performed on a specimen of the tumor in a&#xD;
      laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory authority. The results must identify&#xD;
      at least one potentially actionable genomic variant that is targeted by a ProTarget Study&#xD;
      drug, as defined in the protocol. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma&#xD;
      (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a&#xD;
      laboratory that meets the requirements described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Treatment with a commercially available, targeted anti-cancer drug matched to a&#xD;
      genomic variant identified in a tumor biopsy specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: Objective tumor response (complete response - CR or partial response- PR) or&#xD;
      stable disease (SD) at 16 weeks or later after treatment initiation and safety are the&#xD;
      primary study endpoints; progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of treatment&#xD;
      on study and treatment-related high grade and serious adverse events will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA will be included in three similar though&#xD;
      independent protocols (ProTarget, DRUP and TAPUR, respectively), allowing data-exchange and&#xD;
      empowering of the trials.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient (age≥ 18 years) with a histologically-proven locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             malignant disease who is no longer benefitting from standard anti-cancer treatment or&#xD;
             for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, no such treatment is available or&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below. However, as noted&#xD;
             above, drug-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the appendix for each&#xD;
             agent will take precedence for this and all inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Platelets &gt; 75,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. AST (SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or &lt;&#xD;
                  5 x ULN in patients with known hepatic metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease (per RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor),&#xD;
             defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for&#xD;
             nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT&#xD;
             scan, MRI, or a subcutaneous or superficial lesion that can be measured with calipers&#xD;
             by clinical exam. For lymph nodes, the short axis must be ≥15 mm. Patients who have&#xD;
             assessable disease by physical or radiographic examination but do not meet these&#xD;
             definitions of measurable disease are eligible and will be considered to have&#xD;
             evaluable disease. Patient's whose disease cannot be objectively measured by physical&#xD;
             or radiographic examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are NOT eligible,&#xD;
             with the exception of CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Results must be available from a genomic test or immunohistochemistry (IHC) test for&#xD;
             protein expression performed in a laboratory accredited by the competent local&#xD;
             regulatory authority. The genomic or IHC test used to qualify a patient for&#xD;
             participation in ProTarget may have been performed on any specimen of the patient's&#xD;
             tumor obtained at any point during the patient's care at the discretion of the&#xD;
             patient's treating physician. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma&#xD;
             (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a&#xD;
             laboratory accredited by the competent local regulatory authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A new biopsy must be performed if possible, for central confirmation by WGS (the&#xD;
             result may be awaited and is not required before first dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Eligible genomic tests may include any of the following technologies:&#xD;
             fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR),&#xD;
             comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), next generation sequencing (NGS), whole exome&#xD;
             sequencing (WES). The test may have been performed on a fresh (frozen or in RNA-later)&#xD;
             or paraffin-embedded specimen of the primary tumor or a metastatic deposit or on cell&#xD;
             free DNA derived from plasma, as determined by the treating physician, and must reveal&#xD;
             a potentially actionable genomic variant as defined in Section 5.0, or protein&#xD;
             overexpression by IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent/assent&#xD;
             document&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a tumor genomic profile for which treatment with one of the approved targeted&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapies included in this study has potential clinical benefit based on&#xD;
             the criteria described in Section 7.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral&#xD;
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing fetus, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) in combination with inhibition of&#xD;
             ovulation (intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system ( IUS),&#xD;
             bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence) for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and for four to 24 months following completion of study&#xD;
             therapy (depending on SPC from individual drugs). Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or if she is the partner of&#xD;
             a male participant in this study and becomes pregnant while he is participating in&#xD;
             this study, she should inform her or her partner's treating physician immediately as&#xD;
             well as her obstetrician. Female study patients who become pregnant must immediately&#xD;
             discontinue treatment with any study therapy. Male patients should avoid impregnating&#xD;
             a female partner. Male study patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e.&#xD;
             post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier&#xD;
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 4 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ongoing toxicity &gt; CTCAE grade 2, other than peripheral neuropathy, related to&#xD;
             anti-tumor treatment that was completed within 4 weeks prior to registration. Patients&#xD;
             with ongoing peripheral neuropathy of ≥ CTCAE grade 3 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous treatment with the selected study drug for the same malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If the patient's tumor has a genomic variant known to confer resistance to an&#xD;
             anti-cancer agent available in this study, the patient will not be eligible to receive&#xD;
             that agent but will be eligible to receive other drugs available in this study if all&#xD;
             inclusion and exclusion criteria are met for that drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or&#xD;
             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for&#xD;
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol&#xD;
             acetate, bisphosphonates) or ongoing castration-intent therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
             These medications must have been started ≥ 1 month prior to enrollment on this study.&#xD;
             Patients may be on warfarin, low molecular weight heparin or direct factor Xa&#xD;
             inhibitors, unless such therapies are prohibited by drug-specific exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing. Male and female patients who refuse to&#xD;
             practice highly effective contraception methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known progressive brain metastases determined by serial imaging or&#xD;
             declining neurologic function in the opinion of the treating physician are not&#xD;
             eligible. Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible, provided&#xD;
             that the patient has not experienced a seizure or had a clinically significant change&#xD;
             in neurological status within the 3 months prior to registration. All patients with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases must be clinically stable for at least 1 month&#xD;
             after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment for one month prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Additional exclusion criteria specific for GBM patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients who require anti-convulsant therapy must be taking non-enzyme inducing&#xD;
                  antiepileptic drugs (non-EIAED). EIAED are prohibited. Patients previously on&#xD;
                  EIAED must be switched to non-EIAED at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No radiotherapy within the three months prior to the diagnosis of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No radiotherapy with a dose over 65 Gy, stereotactic radiosurgery or&#xD;
                  brachytherapy unless the recurrence is histologically proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including uncontrolled or symptomatic&#xD;
             angina, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) known to be &lt; 40% are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with stroke (including TIA) or acute myocardial infarction within 4 months&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding within 1 month of start of treatment are&#xD;
             not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with any other clinically significant medical condition which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study or which could jeopardize compliance with study requirements including, but not&#xD;
             limited to: ongoing or active infection, significant uncontrolled hypertension, severe&#xD;
             psychiatric illness situations, or anticipated or planned anti-cancer treatment or&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who do not meet drug-specific eligibility requirements for the drug selected&#xD;
             by the investigator, are not eligible to receive that drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients whose disease is not measurable or assessable by radiographic imaging or&#xD;
             physical examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with known allergy/hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or to&#xD;
             any of the excipients).&#xD;
