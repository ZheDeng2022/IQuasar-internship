  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endophthalmitis is also called vitreous inflammation. Broadly speaking, it refers to all&#xD;
      kinds of serious intraocular inflammation, such as vitreitis, anterior chamber empyema and&#xD;
      eye pain caused by intraocular infection, intraocular foreign body, tumor necrosis, severe&#xD;
      non infectious uveitis, lens cortex allergy, etc. Clinically, it generally refers to&#xD;
      infectious endophthalmitis caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites. According to the different&#xD;
      ways of infection, it can be divided into exogenous endophthalmitis and endogenous&#xD;
      endophthalmitis. Exogenous endophthalmitis is more common. When inflammation involves sclera&#xD;
      or extraocular orbital tissue, it is called &quot;panophthalmia&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endophthalmitis is a kind of serious intraocular inflammation which can lead to the loss of&#xD;
      visual function. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key. Studies have found that the&#xD;
      changes of cytokines in aqueous humor are helpful for the diagnosis of endophthalmitis.&#xD;
      Okhrvai et al. Also pointed out that the application of PCR can reduce the diagnosis time of&#xD;
      endophthalmitis. This study mainly verified the use of molecular biology technology to detect&#xD;
      the changes of VCAM, ICAM-1 and other cytokines, bacteria, viruses, fungi, Toxoplasma gondii&#xD;
      IgG in patients' intraocular fluid, including aqueous humor and vitreous humor, so as to&#xD;
      timely judge the etiology and progress of endophthalmitis, and provide reference for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

        According to the formula n = Z2 * (p * (1-p)) / E2, the confidence is 95%, the error is&#xD;
        10%, and the probability is 0.5. The sample size is calculated to be 96 cases. According to&#xD;
        some similar literatures, the sample size is set to be 100 cases.&#xD;
