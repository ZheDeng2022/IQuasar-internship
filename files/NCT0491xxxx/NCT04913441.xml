  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of Mulligan technique vs stretching techniques&#xD;
      and vs routine physical therapy on pain ,range of motion(ROM) and functional disability among&#xD;
      restaurant chefs with non-specific chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain (NP) is one of the basic musculoskeletal issues. Neck pain can be due to stress&#xD;
      about the musculoskeletal framework because of postural problems and may be related with&#xD;
      different causes, such as: - Intervertebral disc herniation, -nerve compression -fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonspecific neck pain is a pain located in the lateral and posterior neck that does not show&#xD;
      pathognomonic signs and symptoms. When the duration of symptoms is greater than 12 weeks of&#xD;
      evolution, it acquires the value of chronicity, being denominated non-specific chronic neck&#xD;
      pain (NCNP). It is a common disorder, which generates a great impact and socio-economic cost&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we evaluate the comparison of manual physical therapy vs routine physical&#xD;
      therapy vs stretching physical therapy effects among restaurants chefs having non-specific&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.&#xD;
The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain</description>

    <measure>Bubble inclinometer</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline's Bubble Inclinometer is a simple to use device for measuring range of motion in patients. The inclinometer can be used to measure range of motion in the neck, the hip, the elbow, the knee, the shoulder, the spine, the ankle, the wrist, and the MCP joint</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has been designed to give us information as to how your neck pain has affected your ability to manage in everyday life.The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Points summed to a total score.</description>
