  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the CellFX System in adults subjects with low-risk basal cell carcinoma for complete&#xD;
      histological clearance of the target lesion followed by surgical tumor excision 60 days&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy adult subjects with confirmed low-risk BCC lesion(s) by biopsy,&#xD;
      excluding BCCs located on the face, neck, scalp, axilla, hands, feet, and genitals not&#xD;
      exceeding 1.5 cm. Macrophotography of all study BCCs will be captured and clinically assessed&#xD;
      by the site investigator for characterization of healing and scar appearance prior to and&#xD;
      post-surgical excision. All subjects will be followed at 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60-days post-CellFX&#xD;
      procedure and at 14, 30 and 60-days post-excision. Adverse events will be documented.&#xD;
