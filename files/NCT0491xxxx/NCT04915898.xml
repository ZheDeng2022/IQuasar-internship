  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a universal, standardized oral&#xD;
      care protocol on prevention of non-ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) in the&#xD;
      acute care setting. In the course of the year-long study, the research team will provide&#xD;
      educational and materials support for oral hygiene on two interventional units (one medical;&#xD;
      one surgical) and two control units (one matched medical; one surgical). At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the research team will evaluate existing hospital data to determine the number of&#xD;
      NV-HAPs in the interventional and control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the study, the research team will have a lead-in period where education will be&#xD;
      provided to the interventional groups and demonstration of desired oral care practices for&#xD;
      patients (September 1-30, 2018) Design Previous research on the effectiveness of oral care&#xD;
      for NV-HAP prevention has primarily relied on pre/post intervention study designs. In order&#xD;
      to enhance compliance and avoid contamination of both the treatment and intervention groups,&#xD;
      the research proposed the use of cluster randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICD-10 codes and a standardized CDC definition of non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia&#xD;
      will be used to determine the baseline incidence on NV-HAP for the 12 months prior to study&#xD;
      implementation. The incidence will be expressed as both an overall incidence based on total&#xD;
      patient days, as well as a rate per 1000 patient days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will follow the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      research methods and reporting for pragmatic trials (2010). The research team will implement&#xD;
      the HAPPI protocol using Stetler's model of implementation science. Overall the&#xD;
      implementation process will be guided by Influencer Model ™ .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods There are no experimental procedures or medications use proposed in this study. The&#xD;
      study consists of implementing a standardized oral care protocol (Attachment A) which are&#xD;
      components of basic nursing care. Previous research has found that opportunities for oral&#xD;
      care were often missed as part of daily care. The research team proposed to set specific&#xD;
      standards and protocols for delivery of oral care on the intervention unit and to monitor the&#xD;
      amount of oral care provided on both the control and intervention units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence-based oral care protocol consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral care assessment by a RN to determine type and frequency oral care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  brushing the teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush and plaque removing toothpaste&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rinsing with a non-alcohol based mouth wash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  application of lip and mouth moisturizer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of 24-hour suction toothbrush kits for high aspiration-risk patients who meet&#xD;
           criteria, per oral care protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will provide educational information and support on the study units for&#xD;
      use of the oral care kit and implementation of oral care after meals and before bedtime on&#xD;
      the interventional units. As part of validation of oral care, the coordinator will make&#xD;
      rounds on patients on the study units and validate and audit oral care activities with the&#xD;
      patient/family and encourage their participation in oral care and with documentation checks.&#xD;
      On the control units, the coordinator will also make rounds and evaluate oral care frequency&#xD;
      in a non-conspicuous manner and through documentation.&#xD;
