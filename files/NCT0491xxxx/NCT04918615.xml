             pectoris, old myocardial infarction, or Stabled recent myocardial infarction (occurred&#xD;
             more than 7 days before enrollment, including non-ST-segment elevation and ST-segment&#xD;
             elevation myocardial infarction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are are eligible to undergo any type of coronary revascularization&#xD;
             surgery, such as balloon angioplasty, stenting, and coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
             (CABG);&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Thrombus in the target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion is completely occluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion side branch are severely calcified and fail to pre-dilated or need&#xD;
             kissing balloon dilatation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lesion is intracoronary stent restenosis&#xD;
