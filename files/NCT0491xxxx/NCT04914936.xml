      This is a 3-part study. Each part will be conducted as an open-label, 2-period,&#xD;
      fixed-sequence study. All the study parts will be conducted concurrently and the participants&#xD;
      will receive the study treatment in all the parts after an overnight fast. In each part, 24&#xD;
      healthy, non-tobacco using, men and women will be enrolled, to ensure 22 participants&#xD;
      complete each part. Each participant will participate in only one study part. In Part 1, a&#xD;
      single oral dose of ACP-196 100 mg capsule will be administered on Day 1 of Period 1&#xD;
      (Treatment A), and a single oral dose of calcium carbonate 1 g tablets will be coadministered&#xD;
      with a single oral dose of ACP-196 100 mg on Day 1 of Period 2 (Treatment B). In Part 2, a&#xD;
      single oral dose of ACP-196 100 mg capsule will be administered on Day 1 pf Period 1&#xD;
      (Treatment C) and oral doses of omeprazole 40 mg capsules once daily (QD) for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days with a single oral dose of ACP-196 100 mg capsule coadministered on Day 5 of Period 2&#xD;
      (Treatment D). In Part 3, a single oral dose of ACP-196 will be administered on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Period 1 (Treatment E) and oral dose of rifampin 600 mg capsule QD for 9 consecutive days&#xD;
      with a single oral dose of ACP-196 100 mg capsule coadministered on Day 1 and Day 9.&#xD;
      Participants will be screened within 28 days before the dose. There will be no washout&#xD;
      between the dose in Period 1 and the first dose in Period 2. Participants will be contacted&#xD;
      approximately 14 days after the last dose of study drug for adverse events.&#xD;
