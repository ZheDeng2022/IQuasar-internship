      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      IBI323(anti-LAG-3/PD-L1) or in combination with chemotherapy in participants with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies. Another purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics,pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of IBI323&#xD;

    <description>In phase Ia study, seven dose levels of IBI323 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20mg/kg) will be tested. The DLT observation period is 28 days. IBI323 is administered by iv infusion day 1 of every 14 days. After dose escalation stage completed, two dose levels (10mg/kg and 20mg/kg) will be expanded to 20 patients each. In Phase Ib study, IBI323 is administered RP2D by iv infusion day 1 of every 14 days. IBI323 and chemotherapy will be administrated in cohort C and cohort K</description>
