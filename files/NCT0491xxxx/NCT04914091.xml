  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T cells are a major therapeutic innovation in the management of patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 3rd line or more. Kymriah® and Yescarta®&#xD;
      are the first CAR-T with Marketing Authorization and coverage by the French Health Insurance.&#xD;
      Their clinical interest has been demonstrated in non-comparative phase 1-2 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-comparative design of the pivotal trials, the lack of data on patients' quality of&#xD;
      life and drug consumption, as well as the very high cost of CAR-T (about € 320,000 for one&#xD;
      treatment) warrant further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective non-comparative study aims to describe in real life the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients treated with CAR-T cells, real world drug use and patients' experience feedback.&#xD;

    <description>Interviews and questionnaires will be performed before administration of CAR-T cells, 3 month after and 6 month after, and will last 60 minutes each time. Semi-structured interview using pre-established questionnaires will be completed with a hospital pharmacist, concerning the patient's perception of his family, socio-professional environment, his knowledge of his illness and his treatment, the consumption of prescribed drugs outside the hospital, self-medication, complementary alternative therapies including herbal medicine. Seven self-administered questionnaires will be completed, concerning quality of life, Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Lymphoma, Beliefs about Medicines, Brief Illness Perception, satisfaction with medication, perceived social support scale, and on Health Literacy.</description>
