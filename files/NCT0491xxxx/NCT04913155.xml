  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HANSE study is primarily intended as a pilot to provide evidence that a holistic and&#xD;
      effective lung cancer screening program can be implemented in Germany and that such a&#xD;
      screening program can be integrated in the current infrastructure of certified lung cancer&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Germany has a long history of offering screening programs for cancers, such as breast,&#xD;
      colorectal, and, more recently, cervical and skin cancer. Screening for lung cancer, however,&#xD;
      which causes more deaths than any other cancer in men and is the second leading cancer death&#xD;
      in women (not far behind breast cancer), has not been implemented to date. Only very&#xD;
      recently, Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) in a preliminary&#xD;
      assessment of low-dose CT screening, concluded that the benefits from screening outweigh&#xD;
      potential risks. However, an implementation of a national lung cancer screening program,&#xD;
      which would be covered by the general health insurance, will likely not be implemented before&#xD;
      2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the IQWiG report also comments on important criteria for implementing lung&#xD;
      cancer screening in Germany using low-dose CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It would be necessary to determine criteria that define a high-risk population. Various&#xD;
           risk forecasting models are currently being propagated to enable a more precise&#xD;
           selection of high-risk individuals. Their reliability and repeatability needs to be&#xD;
           checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Integration of access to a smoking cessation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality assurance measures must be taken into account, including standardized protocols&#xD;
           for the evaluation of the CT images and the subsequent follow-up checks as well as the&#xD;
           invasive diagnostic tissue sampling procedures. The HANSE study is primarily intended as&#xD;
           a pilot to provide evidence that a holistic and effective lung cancer screening program&#xD;
           can be implemented in Germany and that such a screening program can be integrated in the&#xD;
           current infrastructure of certified lung cancer centers.&#xD;

             death from lung cancer (about n=7100 randomly selected from all 3 centers, low-risk&#xD;
             group). These subjects will be contacted via mail after a minimum of 5 year follow up&#xD;
             to inquire if they developed lung cancer in the time between their recruitment and&#xD;
             present. Non-responders will be followed by local registries and by phone. New lung&#xD;
             cancer cases will be verified using official hospital or cancer registry documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Comorbidity, which would unequivocally contraindicate either screening or treatment if&#xD;
             lung cancer is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of chest CT within the past year preceding the invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inability to undergo non-contrast CT (e.g. ≥ 200 kg body weight, inability to lie&#xD;
             flat).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Risk of non-compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unable to give written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient's inability to fill in the questionnaire self-dependent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Limited knowledge of the German language&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to travel, residents of care facilities, etc.&#xD;
