    <textblock>
      The clinical study with UMC119-06-05 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with&#xD;
      frailty syndrome. This will be a dose escalation, open label, single-center study in adult&#xD;
      with frailty syndrome. UMC119-06-05 is ex vivo cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells product which is intended for treatment of frailty syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty syndrome is the most problematic expression of population ageing and profound&#xD;
      implications for the planning and delivery of health and social care when population ageing&#xD;
      is accelerating rapidly worldwide, from 461 million people older than 65 years in 2004 to an&#xD;
      estimated 2 billion people by 2050 . Frailty syndrome characterized by a progressive decline&#xD;
      in health and clinical symptoms of exhaustion, weight loss, a feeling of slowing down, and a&#xD;
      decrease in functional capacity. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that&#xD;
      carries an increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability,&#xD;
      hospitalization, and mortality. Health study as meeting three out of five phenotypic&#xD;
      criteria: low grip strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed walking speed, low physical&#xD;
      activity, and unintentional weight loss. Frailty is a disorder of several inter-related&#xD;
      physiological systems, including genetic and environmental factors in combination with&#xD;
      epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate the differential expression of genes in cells and could&#xD;
      be especially important in ageing. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary&#xD;
      approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive&#xD;
      intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and&#xD;
      modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of frailty syndrome in&#xD;
      adult patients is of urgent need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are&#xD;
      currently being tested to treat aging. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies,&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are represents an attractive option that addresses the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the syndrome.&#xD;
