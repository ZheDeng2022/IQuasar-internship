  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important to make sure that women have access to effective methods of contraception to&#xD;
      prevent pregnancy so that they can make choices about when and if they will have their first&#xD;
      or next child. Some of the most effective methods of contraception are the long-acting,&#xD;
      reversible methods of contraception (LARCS), including the contraceptive implant and the&#xD;
      contraceptive injection. In areas of the world where there are high numbers of people living&#xD;
      with HIV, providing contraception to women is sometimes complicated, as there are known to be&#xD;
      interactions between some of the medications that treat HIV and some hormonal methods of&#xD;
      contraception. One medication to treat HIV, dolutegravir, is now one of the first-line&#xD;
      treatments for HIV in Botswana, and more and more women of childbearing age are taking&#xD;
      dolutegravir to treat HIV. At the moment, there is limited information on whether or not&#xD;
      there are interactions between dolutegravir (the HIV medication) and the contraceptive&#xD;
      implant or the contraceptive injection, two commonly used methods of contraception in&#xD;
      Botswana. The main purpose of this study is to find out if women using contraception and also&#xD;
      taking dolutegravir have lower levels of contraceptive hormone in their blood compared to&#xD;
      women taking no HIV treatment. The study hypothesis is that there is no interaction between&#xD;
      dolutegravir and the contraceptive implant or injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, levels of hormone from the injection or the implant will be measured in women&#xD;
      living with HIV who take dolutegravir and compared to hormone levels in women who do not have&#xD;
      HIV and who have never taken any medications to treat HIV. Women will be counselled about all&#xD;
      of the possible methods of contraception (including the pill, the injection, the implant and&#xD;
      the copper intrauterine device (or coil/loop)) that are available and will be empowered to&#xD;
      make their own decision about the method of contraception they feel will be best for them.&#xD;
      Women who choose the implant or the injection will be invited to enrol in the study; and will&#xD;
      be categorised into one of four groups, based on whether or not they are living with HIV and&#xD;
      taking dolutegravir. At several time points, women will have blood tests to check the level&#xD;
      of hormone from the implant or the injection, over a course of 12 weeks for women starting&#xD;
      the injection and 24 weeks for women starting the implant. Women will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete a short questionnaire about any side effects from the contraception including&#xD;
      changes to bleeding patterns. At the end of the 12 weeks (for women starting the injection)&#xD;
      or 24 weeks (for women starting the implant), the results from these blood samples will be&#xD;
      analysed to see how the levels of the hormone in their blood changed over time. The study&#xD;
      will also look at whether the levels of dolutegravir (the HIV medication) changed over time.&#xD;
      These results will be compared between women living with HIV taking dolutegravir and women&#xD;
      without HIV who have never taken dolutegravir to see whether there is any interaction between&#xD;
      dolutegravir and the hormonal contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate whether dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) given&#xD;
      with two widely used hormonal contraceptives avoid pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions&#xD;
      that lead to reduced levels of hormonal concentrations and could, thus, reduce contraceptive&#xD;
      effectiveness. Two highly effective and commonly used methods of hormonal contraception in&#xD;
      African settings will be studied: the levonorgestrel (LNG) sub-dermal contraceptive implant&#xD;
      and the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injectable contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the investigators hypothesise that the plasma concentrations of the studied hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptives in women living with HIV-1 and taking DTG-based ART will be equivalent to&#xD;
      concentrations in HIV-negative, ART naïve women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To compare plasma LNG concentrations among (a) levonorgestrel contraceptive&#xD;
      implant-users in Botswana receiving DTG-based ART and (b) HIV-negative, ART naïve&#xD;
      levonorgestrel contraceptive implant users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To compare plasma medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) concentrations among (a)&#xD;
      DMPA injectable-users in Botswana receiving DTG-based ART and (b) HIV-negative, ART naïve&#xD;
      DMPA injectable users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To compare the trough plasma concentrations of DTG before and after&#xD;
      contraceptive use to understand how LNG and DMPA may affect DTG exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine if the LNG implant and DMPA injectable inhibit ovulation in the&#xD;
      presence of DTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: To evaluate safety, tolerability, bleeding patterns and contraceptive method&#xD;
      continuation with concomitant LNG implant or DMPA injectable, compared to controls (HIV&#xD;
      negative, ART naïve women).&#xD;
