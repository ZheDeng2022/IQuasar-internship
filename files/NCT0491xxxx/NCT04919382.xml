    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of temozolomide and atezolizumab as second line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (metastatic) or has come back (recurrent). Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      temozolomide and atezolizumab as second line treatment may help prolong survival in patients&#xD;
      with small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy of atezolizumab and temozolomide in two dosing schedules for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who progress after first line&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination atezolizumab and temozolomide&#xD;
      in two dosing schedules as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version&#xD;
      (v) 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients&#xD;
      treated with combination atezolizumab and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the intracranial PFS rate at 6 months (icPFS6) of patients with SCLC treated&#xD;
      with atezolizumab and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore association of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) levels at baseline biomarker&#xD;
      status from tumor biopsy samples and peripheral blood and correlate these with clinical&#xD;
      parameters (including overall response rate [ORR], OS and toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate changes in MDSC induced by different dosing of temozolomide. III. To explore&#xD;
      post-translational modifications of PD-L1 by mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients also&#xD;
      receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-14 of cycle 1 and days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
