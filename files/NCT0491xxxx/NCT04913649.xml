  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative anemia is common in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Iron&#xD;
      deficiency delays the recovery from postoperative anemia and may negatively affect the&#xD;
      postoperative trajectory of cardiac surgery patients. The objective of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of treatment of postoperative iron deficiency anemia with intravenous&#xD;
      iron on disability 90 days after surgery. This will be evaluated in a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled double blind two-center trial in which 310 elective cardiac surgery&#xD;
      patients will be included.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Postoperative anemia is common in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
      Iron deficiency delays the recovery from postoperative anemia and may negatively affect the&#xD;
      postoperative trajectory of cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the effect of treatment of postoperative iron deficiency anemia (IDA)&#xD;
      with intravenous iron (IVI) on disability 90 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double blind two-center trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 310 elderly patients (≥70 years) with moderate postoperative IDA on&#xD;
      postoperative day (POD) 1 (hemoglobin (Hb) 85 - 110 g/L, ferritin concentration &lt; 100 µg/L or&#xD;
      iron saturation &lt;20%) after uncomplicated elective cardiac surgery (aortic valve repair (AVR)&#xD;
      and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Postoperative treatment with a single dose IVI (ferric derisomaltose, Monofer®,&#xD;
      N = 155) compared to postoperative treatment with sodium chloride (NaCL) 0.9% (placebo, N =&#xD;
      155).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints: Primary endpoint is disability as measured by the 12- item World Health&#xD;
      Organization Disability Assessment score 2.0 (WHODAS-12 at POD 90 after elective cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. Secondary endpoints are change in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) related&#xD;
      to dyspnea (assessed with the Rose Dyspnea Score (RDS)) and to health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQL) (assessed with The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers-Short Form (TOPICS-SF)&#xD;
      questionnaire) at POD 90, the number of postoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusions,&#xD;
      change in reticulocyte hemoglobin content (pg) from randomization to hospital discharge, Hb&#xD;
      levels at discharge, hospital complications and days alive and out of hospital at 90 days.&#xD;
      Lastly, the difference in functional outcomes (e.g. steep ramp or 6-minute walk test) and Hb&#xD;
      value at POD 90 will be assessed as an exploratory endpoint.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two center randomized controlled trial. Patients will either receive IVI (Monofer) or placebo. Via a computer generated randomization patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either a single dose of intravenous ferric derisomaltose (Monofer) 100 mg/mL solution for infusion (intervention group) or intravenous NaCl 0.9% (placebo group) (randomisation with block size 4). Stratification takes surgical intervention (AVR or CABG) and hospital location into account.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>PROMS related to dyspnea are assessed with the Rose Dyspnea Scale (RDS). Rose Dyspnea Scale scores range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating more dyspnea with common activities.</description>

    <description>As part of routine care, patients are offered a cardiac revalidation program supervised by a physical therapist after hospital discharge (POD 90). To assess whether patients can safely start exercising, a functional test is performed (e.g. steep ramp or 6-minute walk test). For this study, the results of these tests will be requested to assess functional capacity after surgery</description>
