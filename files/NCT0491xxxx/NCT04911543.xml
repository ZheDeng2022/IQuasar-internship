  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to measure the whole-body distribution and radiation dosimetry&#xD;
      of [18F]-JNJ-70099731 (Part A), to measure the uptake, distribution, and clearance (CL) of&#xD;
      [18F]-JNJ-70099731 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and to model tissue specific&#xD;
      kinetics of [18F]-JNJ-70099731 with the appropriate input function (IF) (Part B), and to&#xD;
      measure participant test-retest variability in the distribution of [18F]-JNJ-70099731 by&#xD;
      comparing PET scans obtained at least 1 week apart (Part C) in the brain of healthy male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical and neurological examination,&#xD;
             medical history, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign (VS), and 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Minor deviations in ECG (example,&#xD;
             first-degree atrioventricular block), which are not considered to be of clinical&#xD;
             significance to the investigator, are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he understands&#xD;
             the purpose of and procedures required for the study and is willing to participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part B &amp; Part C only: Participant is willing to allow the investigators to place an&#xD;
             arterial catheter in the radial artery. Suitability for arterial catheter placement&#xD;
             will be assessed via physical examination (modified Allen Test on both hands).&#xD;
             Participant should not be allergic to local anesthetics for catheter placement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for a minimum of 1&#xD;
             spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose&#xD;
             of study intervention. If a participant is sexually active with a woman, he should&#xD;
             agree to the following: a) If it concerns a woman of childbearing potential and the&#xD;
             participant has not had a vasectomy, the participant must agree to use a condom and&#xD;
             make sure his female partner is using a highly effective method of birth control&#xD;
             during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention; b) If it concerns a woman of nonchild bearing potential or who is&#xD;
             pregnant or has been sterilized and the participant has not had a vasectomy, the&#xD;
             participant must agree to use a condom for the given period; c) If the participant has&#xD;
             had a vasectomy, he should agree to use a condom when being sexually active with a&#xD;
             woman of childbearing potential. Contraceptive use by men or women should be&#xD;
             consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for&#xD;
             participants participating in clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation&#xD;
             or urinalysis at screening. It is expected that laboratory values will generally be&#xD;
             within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations, which are not&#xD;
             considered to be of clinical significance to the Principal Investigator, are&#xD;
             acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical and neurological examination, VS or 12-lead&#xD;
             ECG at screening or before study intervention administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, coagulation abnormalities, or other&#xD;
             conditions that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant and preclude&#xD;
             their ability to participate in study procedures. Participants with a history&#xD;
             significant liver or renal disease, or difficulty in urination, which could affect the&#xD;
             metabolism and elimination of the radiotracer or radiometabolites should be excluded.&#xD;
             Participants with a history of epilepsy or seizures of significance or unexplained&#xD;
             black-outs or loss of consciousness should also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposed to greater than (&gt;)1 millisievert (mSv) of ionizing radiation participating as&#xD;
             a participant in research studies and/or at work in the 12 months before the start of&#xD;
             this study, to the participant's knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
             antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies&#xD;
