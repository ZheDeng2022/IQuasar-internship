  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim for this graduate student research project is to determine if cervical spinal&#xD;
      mobilization releases similar neuropeptides and endogenous hormones as compared to cervical&#xD;
      spinal manipulation and a control group. We hypothesized that application of cervical&#xD;
      manipulations would result in a neuroendocrine response (SNS- HPA axis). By measuring&#xD;
      salivary cortisol, oxytocin and DHEA, it may be possible to provide important information&#xD;
      regarding the mechanisms and associations of pain modulation, anti-inflammatory and tissue&#xD;
      healing after a biomechanical event.&#xD;

      -  Participants will be completing three standardized questionnaires: The Neck Disability&#xD;
           Index (NDI), Numeric Pain Rate Scale (NPRS), and the Global Ration of Change (GROC).&#xD;
           These self-rated questionnaires will be used to capture the patient's level of pain,&#xD;
           assess disability, and to quantify patient's improvement or deterioration over time,&#xD;
           usually to either determine the effect of an intervention or to chart the clinical&#xD;
           course of a condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be providing four saliva samples: Collecting biomarkers in saliva&#xD;
           requires reliable, accurate methods for proper storage and handling techniques with&#xD;
           high-quality assays and validated testing protocols. For this study, salivary oxytocin,&#xD;
           cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) will be collected in the morning (between 8&#xD;
           am and 11 am) for each participant at preintervention (baseline), and 15, 30 and 60&#xD;
           minutes after intervention by using self-collection kits in accordance with the&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions for each biomarker (Salimetrics Inc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be receiving skilled interventions: Participants will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned by using a computer-generated randomized table of numbers created prior to the&#xD;
           start of data collection to one of the following three groups: cervical manipulation&#xD;
           group, cervical mobilization group, no-touch group which will be receiving postural&#xD;
           education. Cervical Spinal Manipulation (CSM) and Cervical Spinal Mobilizations (CSMob)&#xD;
           are common techniques utilized by healthcare professionals to treat neck pain, low back&#xD;
           pain and its effectiveness to treat musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;

    <description>The cervical spinal manipulation will consist of one session of a standard technique that will be performed by an experienced (&gt;10 years) doctor of physical therapy practitioner. The technique is described by Gibbons and Tehan as a high-velocity, mid-range, low amplitude force at the segment of pain and/or segmental restrcition. The participant will lay comfortably in a supine position, the practitioner will then use his clinical discretion to select the most appropriate or symptomatic cervical motion segments and attempt to localize the manual thrust at those levels. A maximum of 2 attempts for each side of the cervical spine will be allowed regardless of the having achieved joint cavitation. This type of cervical manipulation procedure is described by Gibbons and Tehan as &quot;Minimal Leverage Thrust&quot; and it results in optimal patient comfort while receiving the treatment thus reducing post-treatment soreness/pain.</description>

    <description>The cervical spinal mobilization treatment will also consist of one session of a standard technique that will be performed by an experienced (&gt;10 years) doctor of physical therapy practitioner. For this procedure, the participant will lay comfortably in a prone position, the practitioner will then use his clinical discretion to select the most appropriate or symptomatic cervical motion segments and attempt to localize the manual forces at those segments. The magnitude of a mobilization-or how hard the therapist pushes on the spine-is usually reported as the magnitude of force. For an oscillatory posterior-anterior (PA) mobilization technique, the maximum magnitude of applied force is usually reported as the mean of the force peaks that occur during a specified period.34 The cervical mobilization will consist of oscillations of 1Hz and magnitude forces of 30 Newtons (N) for 30 seconds, 90N for 120 seconds and 30N for 30 seconds at the localized segment.</description>
