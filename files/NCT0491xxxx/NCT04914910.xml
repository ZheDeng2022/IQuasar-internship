  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with insulin pumps and sensor-based glucose monitoring has proven superior to other&#xD;
      treatment methods in type 1 diabetes. Still, the majority of people treated with insulin&#xD;
      pumps and glucose sensors still does not meet the recommended sensor-based glycaemic targets.&#xD;
      Automated insulin delivery systems, also known as closed-loop systems, have shown to improve&#xD;
      TIR, TAR, and TBR compared with insulin pump and CGM systems that cannot automatically dose&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Steno 780G study is to test the effects of the MiniMed 780G&#xD;
      system in persons with T1D treated with insulin pump and CGM/isCGM who are not meeting&#xD;
      glycaemic targets.&#xD;

    <description>This will be a 14-week, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, controlled trial comparing the efficacy of an AHCL system (MiniMed 780G, Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA) with usual care (i.e., a person's usual insulin pump and CGM/isCGM system). After the 14-week trial period, the control group switches to treatment with the MiniMed 780G system. The intervention group continues with the MiniMed 780G system. Both groups are monitored for another 14 weeks.</description>
