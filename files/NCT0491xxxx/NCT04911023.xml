  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is sometimes necessary to relieve patients with chronic anal fissure. It consists of&#xD;
      resecting the edges of the fissure to make a wound larger than the initial fissure, in order&#xD;
      to obtain healing. Thus, the edges of the wound do not stick together and the healing is done&#xD;
      from the bottom of the wound. This procedure is widely performed in France with results that&#xD;
      seem satisfactory. In addition to resection of the fissure, a partial closure of the wound&#xD;
      can be associated with a small flap of rectal mucosa which is sutured with a few absorbable&#xD;
      stitches: this is anoplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is some debate as to whether to perform a fissurectomy alone or to complement it with&#xD;
      an anoplasty to accelerate healing. The choice of technique performed depends on the training&#xD;
      and habits of the operators but the results of fissurectomy alone and fissurectomy with&#xD;
      anoplasty have never been compared. In the medical-surgical proctology department of the&#xD;
      Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ), both procedures are performed. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore decided to compare the after-effects of fissurectomies alone with&#xD;
      those of fissurectomies with anoplasty that were performed in the department in 2019. The&#xD;
      choice between the 2 procedures is left exclusively to the discretion of the operator. The&#xD;
      criteria for choice between the two patient populations are not different.&#xD;

        Patients will be selected based on procedure coding:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HKFA004 = Excision of an anal fissure [Anal fissurectomy]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HKFA005 = Excision of a fissure and/or anal stenosis, with mucosal anoplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HKFA002 = Resection of an infected anal fissure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HKFA006 = Excision of an anal fissure, with mucosal anoplasty and resection of an&#xD;
             isolated hemorrhoidal pack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The follow-up of the patients corresponds to the usual follow-up of the patients within the&#xD;
        proctology unit (consultation at Day 15, Day 30 post-operative and then every month until&#xD;
        complete healing).&#xD;
