      If subjects voluntarily consent to participation in the study, those who are finally&#xD;
      determined to be eligible for the study after whether all of the inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria are met is checked will receive the study drug. Efficacy and safety&#xD;
      will be evaluated at baseline, baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 38&#xD;

      This study, which is designed as a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 3b clinical&#xD;
      trial, is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in biologic-naïve&#xD;
      Korean patients with moderate-to-severe bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted with a single arm, and the subjects to be recruited consist of 30&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease and 30 patients with ulcerative colitis (considering dropout&#xD;
      rate of 20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total period after the subject enrollment is 54 weeks, and a total of 10 visits are made&#xD;
      with screening, baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 22 weeks, 30 weeks, 38 weeks, 46 weeks,&#xD;
      and 54 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crohn's disease (CD): If a subject does not respond to vedolizumab 300mg iv 0, 2, and 6&#xD;
           weeks for induction, an additional dose of vedolizumab 300 mg will be given at week 10.&#xD;
           On the other hand, Maintenance therapy should be continued every 8 weeks from week 14 in&#xD;
           responding patients, and for some patients who have experienced a decrease in their&#xD;
           response, it can be given every 4 weeks.The maximum dosing period is 54 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcerative colitis (UC): If a subject responds to vedolizumab 300mg iv 0, 2, and 6 weeks&#xD;
           for induction, maintenance therapy should be continued every 8 weeks from week 14, and&#xD;
           for some patients who have experienced a decrease in their response, it can be given&#xD;
           every 4 weeks.The maximum dosing period is 54 weeks.&#xD;
