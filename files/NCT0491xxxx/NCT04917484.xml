  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we want to randomize patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) who are&#xD;
      eligible for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), to either standard PRRT consisting&#xD;
      of 4 treatments with 7.4 GBq Lu-177-DOTATOC (standard arm) or 4 treatments with&#xD;
      individualized doses of Lu-177-DOTATOC (dosimetry arm). In the dosimetry arm, the first dose&#xD;
      depends on the patients' kidney function and thereafter the absorbed dose to the kidneys at&#xD;
      the previous treatment. A max of 20GBq will be administered at the first treatment and 25GBq&#xD;
      at treatment 2-4. We aim to reach an accumulated kidney dose of 24Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first treatment all patients will go through three SPECT/CT scans 24 hours, 4 days,&#xD;
      and 7 days, after treatment to calculate absorbed kidney dose. The patients in the standard&#xD;
      dose treatment arm will have one SPECT/CT scan after each of the last three treatments; all&#xD;
      performed 24 hours after treatment, used to approximate the kidney dose assuming the&#xD;
      clearance of the Lu-177 DOTATOC is the same after all treatments. The patients in the&#xD;
      dosimetry based treatment arm will go through three SPECT/CT scans after all four treatments&#xD;
      for dosimetry calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow dosimetry is calculated after all treatments in the dosimetry based treatment arm&#xD;
      and after the first treatment in the standard treatment arm. For bone marrow dosimetry, blood&#xD;
      samples are drawn right before administration of Lu-177 DOTATOC (time 0) and 3 minutes, 45&#xD;
      minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 7-8 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, and 7 days after administration of&#xD;
      Lu-177 DOTATOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard blood samples are routinely drawn every 2nd week after every treatment in all&#xD;
      included patients and analysed regarding liver, kidney and bone marrow function. Kidney&#xD;
      clearance is evaluated with Tc-DTPA clearance at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urinary samples will be collected at baseline and 3 months after the last treatment&#xD;
      for kidney fibrosis analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, blood and urine samples are collected for a biobank. All included patients fill&#xD;
      in validated quality of life questionaires at all treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the treatment, all patients will be evaluated with standard CT&#xD;
      scans prior to treatment and 3 and 9 months after the 4th treatment. Ga-68 DOTATOC PET will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and 6 and 12 months after the last treatment.&#xD;
