  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a prostate cancer marker in the blood (mGSTP1) can be&#xD;
      used to guide chemotherapy treatment. Based on the level of this blood marker, some men may&#xD;
      be able to have breaks in treatment rather than having chemotherapy continuously which is the&#xD;
      current standard of care. This study will tell us if having these treatment breaks guided by&#xD;
      mGSTP1 can improve how men feel during treatment while still treating the prostate cancer&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that is approved to treat prostate cancer and has been used&#xD;
      for many years to treat prostate cancer like yours. Your doctor has already discussed this&#xD;
      with you and you have both agreed that docetaxel is the best treatment for you to have at&#xD;
      this time. You will have already started this chemotherapeutic treatment with docetaxel.&#xD;
