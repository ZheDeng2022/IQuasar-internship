      Protocol 239-11651-101 is a planned Phase 1 study entitled &quot;A Randomized, Double-Blind,&#xD;
      Vehicle-Controlled, Parallel Group, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety,&#xD;
      Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of TDM-105795 Following a Fixed-Volume Topical Single&#xD;
      Administration in Healthy Male Subjects with Androgenetic Alopecia&quot;. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be assigned to a sequential treatment cohort and will receive either one of the TDM-105795&#xD;
      solutions or the Placebo. The assigned test article will be applied once onto the scalp in&#xD;
      the hair loss area (e.g., top of head and temple areas). All subjects will be treated with 1&#xD;
      mL of test article with application to the scalp focusing on the regions that are bald and&#xD;
      thinning.&#xD;

          8. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 32 kg/m2 inclusive and body weight not&#xD;
             less than 50 kg at Visit 1/Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject agrees to continue his other general hair care products and regimen for at&#xD;

             (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to treatment) must agree to refrain from&#xD;

             their female sexual partner to use a highly effective form of birth control as&#xD;
             described in the informed consent form. For females, highly effective forms of birth&#xD;
             control include 1) intrauterine device (IUD; copper or hormonal); 2) implantable&#xD;
             hormonal contraception; 3) surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, tubal ligation,&#xD;

             entry; 4) total abstinence; or 5) using one of each of the following a) hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives [other than IUD or implantable, e.g., oral, transdermal, injectable, or&#xD;

             have a female partner who agrees to use a highly effective form of birth control for&#xD;
             the duration of the subject's participation in the trial. Female partner taking&#xD;
             hormonal therapy must be on treatment prior to the subject's entry into the study,&#xD;
             continued per label, and must not change their dosing regimen during the trial; highly&#xD;
             effective birth control forms must be for (1) oral: at least 1 complete cycle (e.g., 4&#xD;
             to 8 weeks); (2) transdermal, injectable (e.g., Depo-Provera), implantable, vaginal&#xD;
             ring (e.g., NuvaRing), IUD: at least 1 week; or (3) total abstinence: at least 1&#xD;
