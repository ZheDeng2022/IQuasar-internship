  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial is to find out the best dose and side effects of all-trans retinoic acid&#xD;
      (ATRA) and atezolizumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has come&#xD;
      back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). All-trans retinoic&#xD;
      acid (ATRA) is made in the body from vitamin A and helps cells to grow and develop.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and atezolizumab may help treat patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of tretinoin (ATRA) and&#xD;
      atezolizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon the&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of ATRA and atezolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC, including progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the effect of ATRA on the levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in&#xD;
      peripheral blood of study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tretinoin orally (PO) on days 1-3 of cycles 1-3. Patients also receive&#xD;
      atezolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Safety will be measured by the occurrence of dose-limited toxicities (DLTs) as well as any other adverse events as defined in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5. Frequency and severity of AEs and tolerability of the regimen will be collected and summarized by descriptive statistics. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. All patients who have received at least one dose of the therapeutic agents will be evaluable for toxicity and tolerability.</description>

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
