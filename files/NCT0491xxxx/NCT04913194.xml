  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      two-session, virtual parent-training exposure protocol for children ages 5-12 who experience&#xD;
      picky eating consistent with an Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects aged 5 to 12 years with picky eating symptoms consistent with an ARFID&#xD;
      diagnosis, as determined by the Pica, ARFID, Rumination Disorder Interview, a semi-structured&#xD;
      diagnostic interview, will be recruited via social media and local doctor's offices. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will complete informed consent and an intake session. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized to an immediate treatment group, in which they will begin treatment the following&#xD;
      week, or a 4-week waitlist condition, in which they will wait four weeks to begin treatment.&#xD;
      All participants will have the opportunity to receive the treatment, ARFID Parent Training&#xD;
      Program or &quot;ARFID-PTP.&quot; ARFID-PTP was adapted from a seven-session parent-training for&#xD;
      extremely picky eating behaviors to examine the efficacy of a two-session, virtual protocol&#xD;
      on increasing food intake and decreasing selective eating. The two virtual treatment sessions&#xD;
      will include psychoeducation, parent-training skills, and exposure protocol. There will be 5&#xD;
      major assessment time points: intake, end of treatment, 4-weeks post-treatment, 3-months&#xD;
      post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment.&#xD;
