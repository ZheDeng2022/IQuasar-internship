  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of&#xD;
      OPD5 before Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in patients with RRMM. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      increasing doses of OPD5 to find the best dose and to assess any side effects. Each patient&#xD;
      will be assigned to a dose cohort of 3-6 patients to receive one single dose of OPD5. Each&#xD;
      patient will be hospitalized for about 14 days from the OPD5 infusion and then have monthly&#xD;
      visits to the clinic for 3 months and then every third month until disease progression or&#xD;
      starting new myeloma treatment, maximum up to 2 years.&#xD;
