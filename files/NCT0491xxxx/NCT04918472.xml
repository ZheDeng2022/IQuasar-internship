  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined diagnostic accuracy of MCCE and UBT in Hong Kong patients with uninvestigated&#xD;
      dyspepsia between age 35 to 60 years for structural pathology and HP infection is comparable&#xD;
      to that of conventional UGI endoscopy with histological examination for HP&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspepsia affects about 20% of the population globally and represents one of the commonest&#xD;
      reasons for patients to seek medical consultation.1-3 The definition of dyspepsia has evolved&#xD;
      over time and generally encompasses a variety of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms that&#xD;
      can be of anatomical or functional origin such as epigastric pain or burning, bloating,&#xD;
      postprandial fullness, belching, early satiety and nausea.2, 4 While diagnostic criteria (eg,&#xD;
      Rome IV criteria) have been proposed to better characterize and standardize symptoms of&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia for research purpose, there is considerable overlap of clinical&#xD;
      presentation between functional dyspepsia and organic / anatomical causes of dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptoms such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), UGI&#xD;
      malignancies, or pancreatobiliary diseases.2, 3, 5, 6 Therefore, it is of clinical importance&#xD;
      to differentiate clinically significant anatomical pathologies from functional disorders&#xD;
      during the initial evaluation of patients with dyspeptic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Society guidelines based on Western population data with a relatively lower prevalence of&#xD;
      helicobacter pylori (HP) and UGI cancers (eg, cancer of stomach, esophagus) generally&#xD;
      recommend an initial noninvasive management approach (eg, &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy for HP&#xD;
      and empiric trial of acid suppressive therapy) in dyspeptic patients without alarming&#xD;
      symptoms or age &lt; 50 - 60, and reserve upfront endoscopy for high-risk patients with alarming&#xD;
      symptoms (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia, unintended weight&#xD;
      loss, etc) or age â‰¥ 50 - 60.2, 3 However, in Asian populations with a relatively higher&#xD;
      prevalence of HP and UGI cancers, an initial noninvasive management approach to dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptoms based on alarming symptoms and age cutoff at 50 - 60 years may not be entirely&#xD;
      appropriate since up to 25% of patients with UGI cancers may not have alarming symptoms.7 In&#xD;
      a recent systematic review with meta-analysis of dyspepsia management in Asian countries,&#xD;
      alarming symptoms and age were found to be poor predictors of UGI cancers and 17.8% of&#xD;
      dyspeptic patients who were eventually diagnosed with UGI cancers were younger than age 45.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study of 5066 UGI endoscopies performed in Asian patients with dyspepsia, clinically&#xD;
      significant structural pathologies (PUD, cancers of stomach / esophagus, esophagitis) were&#xD;
      found in 19.5% of patients.8 Although UGI endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of&#xD;
      clinically significant structural pathologies and HP infection by histology, it is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure with a small but finite risk of complication.3 When compared to the&#xD;
      invasive nature of conventional UGI endoscopy, an initial minimally invasive diagnostic&#xD;
      approach that can evaluate for both UGI structural pathology and HP infection would be highly&#xD;
      desirable and clinically relevant in Asian patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia between 35&#xD;
      to 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) (commonly known to the general public as the &quot;pill camera&quot;)&#xD;
      represents a minimally invasive diagnostic modality for visualization of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tract and is well tolerated by patients.9 While conventional CE has been shown to&#xD;
      provide adequate visualization of luminal pathologies in the small bowel, colon and&#xD;
      esophagus, visualization of the different parts of stomach by conventional CE remains&#xD;
      challenging due to its passive propulsion through the GI tract by peristalsis or gravity and&#xD;
      the large cavity size of the stomach. Recently, magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      (MCCE) systems comprised of small capsule endoscope, guidance magnet robot, data recorder,&#xD;
      and computer workstation for real-time viewing and control of CE have become available and&#xD;
      can provide a more controlled visualization of different anatomical parts of the stomach by&#xD;
      CE.10, 11 In a study of 350 patients with UGI symptoms requiring conventional UGI endoscopy&#xD;
      for evaluation, MCCE was shown to be safe and was able to provide adequate visualization of&#xD;
      the stomach with a high sensitivity (90.4%) and specificity (94.7%) for focal gastric lesions&#xD;
      when compared with conventional UGI endoscopy.11 However, despite its promising role as a&#xD;
      minimally invasive diagnostic modality for structural pathologies of stomach, MCCE does not&#xD;
      allow tissue acquisition and thus cannot provide information on HP infection status by rapid&#xD;
      urease test (RUT) or histological examination. On the other hand, noninvasive test for HP by&#xD;
      urea breath test (UBT) has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for HP infection&#xD;
      and can supplement MCCE to provide important information on the status of HP infection.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been no dedicated study on the use of combined MCCE and UBT for minimally&#xD;
      invasive evaluation of dyspepsia in Asian population. In order to address the gap in&#xD;
      knowledge, we would like to propose a pilot prospective cohort study to investigate the&#xD;
      clinical utility of combined MCCE and UBT as the initial minimally invasive evaluation of&#xD;
      uninvestigated dyspepsia in Hong Kong patients between 35 to 60 years of age.&#xD;
