  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. Bariatric surgery has proved to be the&#xD;
      most effective treatment of morbid obesity in terms of weight reduction and remission of&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions during long-term follow-up. Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) has become the most&#xD;
      performed intervention either worldwide or in France, where SG represents more than 60% of&#xD;
      bariatric interventions and 114,817 patients operated between 2013 and 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum Excess weight loss (%EWL) after SG is obtained at one-year post surgery. Then it has&#xD;
      been largely reported in the literature that patients could present mild, moderate or&#xD;
      important (notably in the super obese patients) weight regain associated with comorbidity&#xD;
      relapse motivating redo surgery. Like in revisional surgery, operating super-obese patient&#xD;
      (BMI ≥50 kg/m2) is a challenge. It has been shown that achieving significant weight loss was&#xD;
      more difficult in patients with a BMI ≥ 50 compared to lower BMIs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In these 2 populations of patients, more malabsorptive procedures like long limb One&#xD;
      Anastomosis Gastric Bypass or Bilio-Pancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch could be more&#xD;
      efficient but induce technical difficulties (high complication rate) and can be responsible&#xD;
      for malnutrition (vitamin deficiencies, hypoalbuminemia…). That's why, in case of revisional&#xD;
      surgery or for high BMI patients,laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is still&#xD;
      considered as the gold standard and is the most performed intervention. To obtain better&#xD;
      weight loss safely,Santoro et al. promoted the sleeve gastrectomy with transit bipartition&#xD;
      (SG+TB), a new intervention coupling a SG without interrupting pathway through the duodenum&#xD;
      and preserving the pylorus and a long biliary limb RYGBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Because there is no duodenal and jejunal exclusion, malnutrition is expected to&#xD;
      be less frequent after SG+TB compared to BPD/DS. Its anastomosis on the antrum makes SG+TB&#xD;
      easier to perform in super-obese patient than standard RYGB but more efficient in term of&#xD;
      weight loss. Compared to BPD/DS or SADI which involves dissection of the duodenum and the&#xD;
      confection of a duodenojejunostomy, SG+TB is also expected to be easier then safer.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of food choices and preferences assessed by the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire provides measures of different components of food preference and food reward. Participants are presented with an array of pictures of individual food items common in the diet. Foods in the array are chosen by the experimenter from a validated database to be either predominantly high (&gt;50% energy) or low (&lt;20% energy) in fat but similar in familiarity, protein content, sweet or non-sweet taste and palatability. Outcome measured are explicit Liking, explicit wanting, implicit wanting and food choice.&#xD;
Scores for explicit liking and explicit wanting range from 0-100 with a typical mean (±S.D.) of 60±18 Scores for Food Choice range from 0-48 and have a typical mean of 24±10 or for the appeal bias range from -48-48 with a typical mean of -5±15.&#xD;
Scores for Implicit Wanting typically range from -100-100 (due to RT there is no fixed min-max value) and have a typical mean of ±10±25 or for the appeal bias a typical mean of -10±30.</description>

    <description>In case of a first intention procedure, a typical sleeve gastrectomy is performed, calibrated on a 36 French bougie, stapling starting 4 to 6 cm from the pylorus. Antecolic gastroileal anastomosis is performed 250 cm from the ileocecal transition, on the antrum using a linear stapler (45-mm gold cartridge) or hand-sewn (at least 3 cm wide on the stomach). Laterolateral enteroanastomosis is performed 120 cm from the ileocecal junction. Thus, alimentary limb is 130cm and common limb 120cm.</description>
