  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate whether organised, concomitant HPV vaccination and HPV screening&#xD;
      offered to all resident women aged 22-27 will result in a more rapid elimination of HPV&#xD;
      infection in Sweden. This objective will be examined at the population level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Sweden, 150 women die of and 550 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. The&#xD;
      average age at diagnosis is about 55 years and every third woman is under 40 years of age.&#xD;
      World-wide, there half a million new cases of cervical cancer each year. The underlying cause&#xD;
      of cervical cancer is a human papillomavirus (HPV), an infection that can be prevented by&#xD;
      vaccination. The first-generation vaccine protects against HPV infection of the two types (16&#xD;
      and 18) that cause to about 70% of all cervical cancer. Since 2015, a second-generation&#xD;
      vaccine (Gardasil 9, Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC) has been available that provides protection&#xD;
      against 9 HPV types of which 7 types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and 58) cause 90% of all&#xD;
      cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the countries of the world to&#xD;
      eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. On 17 November 2020, all 194 WHO member&#xD;
      states adopted a global strategy to increase the rate of elimination of cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      strategy involves three main actions: vaccination, screening, and treatment. In Sweden, girls&#xD;
      have been offered school-based vaccination against HPV with Gardasil 4 since 2012. Starting&#xD;
      in the autumn of 2020, schoolboys have also been offered vaccination. Since 2019, the&#xD;
      second-generation vaccine has been used in the school-based vaccination program. Sweden's&#xD;
      vaccination strategy means that the virus will be eliminated among individuals born in 2007&#xD;
      and beyond. It will thus take another 20 years before Sweden can stop the infection in&#xD;
      Sweden. Today, the infection continues to spread only among young adults. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that vaccination up to age 26 can be effective and within the European Union, 10 out of 29&#xD;
      countries have a so-called catch-up on vaccination program targeting women over the age of 20&#xD;
      but such a catch-up has not been formally introduced in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to investigate whether offering women ages 22-26 years vaccination with&#xD;
      Gardasil 9 in connection with screening may involve a faster eradication of cervical cancer&#xD;
      as a public health problem in Sweden. A regional pilot study will be conducted in 2021&#xD;
      followed by a subsequent scale-up to other regions.&#xD;
