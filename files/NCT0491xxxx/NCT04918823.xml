  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective observational pilot study is to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of RESTASIS (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.05%) when added to the PROSE&#xD;
      (Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem) lens reservoir in patients with&#xD;
      ocular surface disease (OSD). Secondary endpoints include early (1-month) efficacy data for&#xD;
      ocular signs and symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, all subjects will receive Restasis (Cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05%).&#xD;
      One drop of the dispensed study drop will be instilled in the PROSE lens reservoir twice a&#xD;
      day and the remainder of the reservoir will be filled with normal saline (0.9% sodium&#xD;
      chloride solution). In order to standardize solutions used in the PROSE reservoir, all&#xD;
      patients recruited will be either currently using or will be switched to buffered&#xD;
      preservative-free normal saline (Purilens, Lifestyle Inc., pH 7.46 ) to better match the&#xD;
      reported pH of RESTASIS (pH 6.5-8.05 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will include subjective responses regarding the subject's symptoms and visual&#xD;
      function in addition to the objective assessments of the health of the ocular surface seen on&#xD;
      clinical examination. Results will be measured at baseline, after 1 week, and after 1 month&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
