      The REACH-B study establishes an observational cohort study of people living with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B from a national network, including a diverse range of services, to characterise&#xD;
      and monitor hepatitis B linkage to care and treatment requirements amongst this population.&#xD;

      Participants presenting to participating clinics for HBV care within the previous 12 months&#xD;
      will be identified and enrolment data will be collected including demographics, laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, liver disease assessment, treatment history and clinical management. Follow-up&#xD;
      data on HBV treatment and clinical management, liver disease stage and laboratory parameters&#xD;
      will be collected at each subsequent visit or at minimum every 12 months.&#xD;
