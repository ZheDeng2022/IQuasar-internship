    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin, an inhibitor of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose levels in adults with both type 2 and type 1 diabetes and importantly&#xD;
      reduces both cardiovascular and renal complications in type 2 diabetes. In adults with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes empagliflozin improves endothelial function and vascular stiffness when used in&#xD;
      conjunction with insulin. There is clear evidence that complications in type 1 diabetes have&#xD;
      their origins during adolescents thus to reduce diabetic complications with adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy, this age group must be studied. These studies will need to focus on the effects of&#xD;
      these adjunctive agents on functional biomarkers for development of complications. This study&#xD;
      is designed to develop pilot and feasibility data for a large scale trial of low dose&#xD;
      empagliflozin, 2.5 mg daily, on biomarkers for the development of cardiovascular and renal&#xD;
      complications in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. The investigators will&#xD;
      specifically study the effects of 8 weeks of empagliflozin on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-and post-prandial inflammatory markers using high carbohydrate and high fat meals.&#xD;
           Inflammatory markers to be measured include interleukin-6 (IL-6), tissue necrosing&#xD;
           factor α (TNF-α), complement component C3 concentrations and skin advanced glycosylation&#xD;
           endproducts (AGE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-and post-prandial vascular function including forearm vascular resistance,&#xD;
           endothelial function and pulse wave velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microalbuminuria and pre- and post-prandial glomerular hyperfiltration, tubular injury&#xD;
           and renal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will, also, measure more traditional risk markers including blood pressure,&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c, and lipids. Eligible participants will have had diabetes for at least 1 year&#xD;
      and not have other chronic medical illnesses or diabetes complications. Because of the risk&#xD;
      of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) subjects must have a hemoglobin A1c level less than 9% and&#xD;
      have no history of recurrent DKA or known insulin omission. This will be the first pilot&#xD;
      study designed to explore primary endpoints regarding cardiovascular and renal disease rather&#xD;
      than glucose control with empagliflozin therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an 8 week single arm trial on the effects of empagliflozin 2.5 mg in adolescents with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year. Subjects will be studied in the Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      of the Wexner Medical Center at the Ohio State University 3 times. Visit 0 will be the&#xD;
      initial study visit and will involve obtaining informed consent and assent, taking a medical&#xD;
      history and performing a physical examination. Over the next 2 weeks the subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by the investigators to adjust insulin doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will be the baseline visit. It will occur at 8AM after an overnight fast. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected to measure inflammatory markers will be collected and vascular&#xD;
      function will be tested. Subjects will then be given premeal insulin and a breakfast.&#xD;
      Following this, additional blood samples and vascular function measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the tests home insulin doses will be reduced and the subjects will be&#xD;
      given empagliflozin 2.5 mg daily to take at home for the next 8 weeks. They will be&#xD;
      instructed regarding potential side effects including diabetic ketoacidosis and genital&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted regularly by the investigators during these 8 weeks to review home&#xD;
      glucose monitoring and potential side effects. After completion of the 8 weeks Visit 2 will&#xD;
      occur which will be identical Visit 1.&#xD;
