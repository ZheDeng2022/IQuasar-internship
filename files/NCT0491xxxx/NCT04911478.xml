  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess long-term side effects from subjects who receive an&#xD;
      Adicet Bio gamma delta T cell product. Subjects who previously took part in an Adicet Bio&#xD;
      study and received gamma delta T cell therapy will take part in this long-term follow-up&#xD;
      study. Subjects will join this study once they complete the parent interventional study. No&#xD;
      additional study drug will be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their&#xD;
      cancer while they are being followed for long term safety in this study. For a period of 15&#xD;
      years from the last administration of Adicet Bio allogeneic gamma delta T cell product,&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for long-term safety and survival through collection of data that&#xD;
      include safety, efficacy , pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who&#xD;
      received an Adicet Bio allogeneic gamma delta T cell product that has been genetically&#xD;
      engineered to express the anti-CD20 CAR by transduction with a self-inactivating, replication&#xD;
      incompetent gamma retroviral vector. The period of follow-up is 15 years after the&#xD;
      administration of the gamma delta T cell product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed&#xD;
      to a genetically engineered CAR in Adicet Bio clinical studies. Upon withdrawal or completion&#xD;
      of the parent interventional study, the subjects. Collection of these data will further&#xD;
      define the risk-benefit profile of ADI-001 or any other Adicet Bio allogeneic gamma delta T&#xD;
      cell investigational product added to this rollover protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, and the elements of the study design are per published&#xD;
      guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilize integrating viral vectors such as&#xD;
      gamma retrovirus and it is important to evaluate any delayed adverse events after infusion&#xD;
      with such products.&#xD;
