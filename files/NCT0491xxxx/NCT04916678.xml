  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Promising results of an early EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)&#xD;
      intervention on PCLS (PostConcussion-Like Syndrome) at three months have been shown,&#xD;
      suggesting that the availability of psychological care in emergency departments will be&#xD;
      useful. The real impact of such a care service remains to be measured. Several factors may&#xD;
      modulate the impact of such a measure, leaving the extent of its public health benefit&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SOFTER III trial, the results suggest that high levels of self-rated stress at&#xD;
      admission probably play a key role in the development of CPSP and psychological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most appropriate study design for such an objective is to follow a cohort of patients in&#xD;
      the Emergency Department and to assess the main risk factors for CPSD 3 months later. To this&#xD;
      end, all consecutive patients should be asked to participate in a study and complete a risk&#xD;
      factor questionnaire, regardless of their level of risk for CPSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFTER IV offers the opportunity to evaluate the impact of a psychological intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of chronic pain. By acting on the emotions experienced in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department, a reduction in acute pain and perhaps in the longer term in chronic pain can be&#xD;
      expected. Its psychological aspects, and more specifically the emotional dimension, are known&#xD;
      to be related to acute pain. As for the relationship with chronic pain, it exists, but its&#xD;
      meaning is not clear because the emotional state is assessed when the pain has already become&#xD;
      chronic. It is proposed to integrate the assessment of emotions at inclusion in the project,&#xD;
      and to follow up patients 12 months after inclusion to assess the incidence of chronic pain&#xD;
      and identify the factors that modulate it. Early intervention in the emergency department,&#xD;
      including an early short one-hour EMDR intervention R-TEP (Recent Traumatic Episode&#xD;
      Protocol), could thus reduce the incidence of chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site cluster randomized cross-over trial with two comparative groups. In&#xD;
      each site, the recruitment period span over a period of 10 days (5 days for control and 5&#xD;
      days for intervention), The control period is a period during which no psychologist is&#xD;
      available. ER cares will be provided as usual. The intervention period is a period during&#xD;
      which trained psychologists are available in the ER and will provide a short early 1-hour&#xD;
      R-TEP EMDR intervention for patients selected with high risk of PCLS. Patient's selection&#xD;
      will be conducted using a score developed in previous studies. When no high-risk patient is&#xD;
      identified, psychologist could assess other patients and treat them if judged necessary. In&#xD;
      this context, they could provide either a R-TEP EMDR or short intervention such as&#xD;
      reassurance according to therapist assessment. Otherwise, ER cares will be provided as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In either intervention or control period, all consecutive patients will be proposed to&#xD;
      participate in the study that consists in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) completing an inclusion questionnaire to describe reasons for ER attendance, current&#xD;
      stress level and preexisting health and symptoms and, in the intervention group, to assess&#xD;
      PCLS risk level; (ii) being contacted 3 months later to assess PTSD (using the PCL-5&#xD;
      checklist) and PCLS (using Rivermead criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national health insurance ID will be collected in the inclusion questionnaire and&#xD;
      conserve until it can be used, namely after a specific authorization from Commission&#xD;
      Nationale Informatique et Liberté (CNIL). This will allow to compare health care consumption&#xD;
      levels in the two groups, as recorded in the national insurance system database (SNIIR-AM).&#xD;
