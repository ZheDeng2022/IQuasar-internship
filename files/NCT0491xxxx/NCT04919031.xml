      Inspiratory muscle training considered as safe and valid method to improve respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and functional capacity among uncountable conditions which could improve post&#xD;
      COVID-19 persistent symptoms including but not limited to respiratory muscle strength,&#xD;
      diminishing dyspnea, enhance blood oxygenation, and patient's functional capacity and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic will place enormous pressure on healthcare systems around the&#xD;
      world. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to dominate our daily lives with large numbers of&#xD;
      people are predicted to become critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome and&#xD;
      will require management in intensive care units. Unfortunately, it is expected that COVID-19&#xD;
      will persist as a major challenge for the delivery of medical care for a long while to go.&#xD;
      High levels of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial impairments can be anticipated and&#xD;
      persist after discharging from hospitals. Growing data shows a higher risk of COVID-19&#xD;
      infections and complications in people with high blood pressure affecting between 30% to 50%&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care unit- acquired weakness is very common after ARDS (COVID 19) which confers a&#xD;
      major determinant of poor long-term functional, respiratory and psychological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are described as exhibiting oxygen levels&#xD;
      incompatible with life with dyspnea. Pulse oximeter is valid device used to assess oxygen&#xD;
      level in the blood as well as the pulse rate. As case numbers grow, neurological symptoms&#xD;
      have been reported with increasing the frequency of corona virus infection, including those&#xD;
      of autonomic dysfunction. It was reported that many patients developed postural tachycardia&#xD;
      syndrome (POTS) several months after confirmed SARSCoV- 2 infection especially those with&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. Based on knowledge from the multiple systemic complications&#xD;
      associated with Covid-19, it is reasonable to suggest that most patients, especially those&#xD;
      who underwent prolonged hospitalization with one or more cardiovascular risk factor, will&#xD;
      need a multi professional rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rehabilitation aims to improve quality of life by managing dyspnea, improving&#xD;
      exercise tolerance and increasing functional capacity. After initial recovery from Covid-19,&#xD;
      especially for those who required hospitalization in ICU, it is possible that some patients&#xD;
      may experience respiratory muscle dysfunction, as well as pulmonary restriction or&#xD;
      obstruction to varying extents, affecting peripheral muscle function and respiratory&#xD;
      conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies explained that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a feasible and&#xD;
      safe modality in patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction which approve its efficacy in&#xD;
      enhancing respiratory muscle strength, improving aerobic capacity, and diminishing dyspnea&#xD;
      among patients suffering from COVID 19.&#xD;

At RV, a valve or shutter is closed, and the patient is coached to inhale as forcefully as possible. Maximum pull should be maintained for 1-2 seconds.</description>

    <measure>fatigue severity scale (0-63)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method of evaluating the impact of fatigue on patients. The FSS is a short questionnaire that requires the patient to rate his level of fatigue.&#xD;
The FSS questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of the fatigue symptoms from 1 to 7, based on how accurately it reflects patient condition during the past week and the extent to which agree or disagree that statement&#xD;
A low value (e.g., 1) indicates strong disagreement with the statement, whereas a high value (e.g., 7) indicates strong agreement.&#xD;
A total score of less than 36 suggests suffering from fatigue. A total score of 36 or more suggests needing further evaluation by a physician</description>

    <measure>sleeping quality scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consisting of 28 items, the SQS evaluates six domains of sleep quality: daytime symptoms, restoration after sleep, problems initiating and maintaining sleep, difficulty waking, and sleep satisfaction. Using a four-point, respondents indicate how frequently they exhibit certain sleep behaviors (0 = &quot;few,&quot; 1 = &quot;sometimes,&quot; 2 = &quot;often,&quot; and 3 = &quot;almost always&quot;).&#xD;
Scores on items belong to factors 2 and 5 (restoration after sleep and satisfaction with sleep) and are reversed before being tallied. Total scores can range from 0 to 84, with higher scores demoting more acute sleep problems.</description>
