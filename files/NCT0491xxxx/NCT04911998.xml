      1. Background The purpose of this study is to describe the profile of patients with&#xD;
           BRAF-mutated melanoma treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors combination and using the Tavie&#xD;
           Skin application.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TavieSkin app, a digital solution developped by Pierre Fabre, is dedicated to all&#xD;
           BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients who are treated with &quot;any&quot;&#xD;
           targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study objectives The primary objective of the survey is to describe the demographics and&#xD;
           clinical characteristics of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutated&#xD;
           melanoma treated with targeted therapy (BRAFi/MEKi) and using the TavieSkin application&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the use of TavieSkin app in patients with unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
                BRAF-mutated melanoma treated with BRAFi/MEKi combination;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the treatment adherence of patients using TavieSkin app including&#xD;
                treatment interruption or permanent discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the health-related quality of life of patients using TavieSkin app&#xD;
                (FACT-M);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess work productivity and activity impairment over the treatment duration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the patient satisfaction toward the TavieSkin application;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the patient satisfaction toward the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study design This prospective, longitudinal, survey will be conducted in Europe to&#xD;
      characterize BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients using TavieSkin app&#xD;
      designed for accompanying patients treated with targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are three combinations of BRAFi/MEKi available in routine practice for the&#xD;
      treatment of BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The survey does not provide or&#xD;
      recommend any treatment or procedure; all decisions regarding treatment are made at the sole&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physicians in accordance with their usual practices. The patients&#xD;
      initiating any BRAFi/MEKi combination will be invited to use the TavieSkin app by their&#xD;
      healthcare provider (HCP) (i.e. oncologist, dermatologist, nurse…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has installed and started to use the application, an e-survey will be&#xD;
      proposed to the patient via the app. A detailed information letter about the data collection,&#xD;
      data privacy and analysis will be displayed to the patient via the app along with an&#xD;
      e-consent for data collection. The patient will be able then to provide an e-signature, if&#xD;
      he/she accepts to take part of this survey. The survey will collect anonymized data about&#xD;
      health status, QoL data and satisfaction. These data will be collected by the patient only.&#xD;
      The physician will not be involved in this e-survey (including e-consent), nor in data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients having given consent (e-consent) to data collection and analysis will be&#xD;
      included. Data will be collected at baseline and at different subsequent timepoints during&#xD;
      the BRAFi/MEKi treatment duration only. Only data reported by the patients in the application&#xD;
      will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will discontinue the study in case of definitive withdrawal of BRAFi/MEKi&#xD;
      treatment, or if he/she decides to withdraw the study and to stop data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target countries for patient enrollment will include Germany, Belgium, Portugal, France,&#xD;
      Spain, Italy and Sweden with the additional possibility of including patients from other EU&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least, 400 adult patients (≥18 years) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Population (see section: Eligibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Study outcomes (see section: Outcome measures)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Statistical considerations Statistical analyses will be fully described in a written&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan (SAP). The study endpoints will be analysed overall and by country.&#xD;
      Analyses will be descriptive in nature, as no hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment patterns of patients, baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, and&#xD;
      reasons for treatment discontinuation will be described using summary statistics. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      summarized by descriptive statistics (mean, and standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th&#xD;
      percentiles, minimum and maximum). The number of missing observations for each variable will&#xD;
      also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in health-related quality-of-life scores (i.e. (FACT-M) will be summarised at baseline&#xD;
      and at each timepoints. The change from baseline will be assessed using a mixed model for&#xD;
      repeated measures (MMRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to event data (i.e. time to treatment discontinuation, time QoL deterioration) will be&#xD;
      evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Median survival estimates will be reported&#xD;
      along with the 25th and 75th percentiles and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&#xD;
      Cox regression analysis may be performed to adjust for predefined (baseline) covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the sample size is adequate, subgroup analyses using variables at baseline might be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Melanoma: overview of disease and management options Melanoma is one of the most&#xD;
           aggressive cancers and is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths (Miller,&#xD;
           2006; Potrony, 2015; Ryu, 2017), with the presence of metastases prognostic for poor&#xD;
           survival. In Europe, BRAF V600-positive mutations are present in 40%-60% of cases of&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma (Moreau, 2012; Rutkowsi, 2014; Arance Fernández, 2015; Picard, 2014;&#xD;
           Colombino, 2013), with the V600E variant being the most common (in up to 90% of BRAF&#xD;
           V600 mutation-positive melanomas). BRAF mutations are associated with a younger age at&#xD;
           onset, higher number of melanocytic nevi, melanoma location in the trunk region and&#xD;
           intermittently UV-exposed skin (Rutkowski, 2014; Colombino, 2013; Carlino, 2014;&#xD;
           Ekedahl, 2013; Long, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although mortality from melanoma has decreased over last decades, survival rate varies&#xD;
           considerably based on the disease stage at diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate is above&#xD;
           90% for patients diagnosed localised tumours, 24 to 88% for stage III, and 10-25% for&#xD;
           stage IV (Svedman, 2016; Schoffer, 2016; Jochems, 1990; Gershenwald, 2017). This&#xD;
           together with a growing incidence of the disease and a substantial decline in patient&#xD;
           health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (Hinz, 2014) as disease advances, make the&#xD;
           management of metastatic melanoma a critical public health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Europe, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines are the most&#xD;
           important international treatment guidelines that guide the clinical management of&#xD;
           melanoma patients. They also form the basis for the development of local/&#xD;
           country-specific guidelines and treatment protocols. These guidelines have been updated&#xD;
           recently (Michielin, 2019). New therapeutic strategies, such as immunotherapy (cytotoxic&#xD;
           T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA-4] inhibitors and programmed cell death 1 [PD-1]&#xD;
           inhibitors) and selective BRAF inhibitors are deemed the backbone of systemic therapy in&#xD;
           melanoma. For BRAFV600 mutation-positive tumours, depending on patient characteristics,&#xD;
           immunotherapies or combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors are recommended. In second-line,&#xD;
           selection depends on the strategy used for the first-line. BRAFis/MEKis is the main&#xD;
           option if not used in the first-line setting. There are no specific recommendations on&#xD;
           the use of one BRAF or MEK inhibitor over another.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile health apps in cancer Complications of melanoma and its treatments are common.&#xD;
           Many patients will experience side effects following immunotherapies or targeted&#xD;
           therapies. These lead to morbidity and mortality as well as increased resource&#xD;
           utilization in the community or hospital setting. Complications of melanoma and its&#xD;
           treatments are often predictable (fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions and&#xD;
           drug-specific effects). Education of patients might help to increase compliance with&#xD;
           care pathways especially if tailored to an individual's needs (Osborn, 2019). In the&#xD;
           context of an increasingly digital healthcare system, it is therefore worth considering&#xD;
           the role of mobile health applications (mHealth) for clinical care, patient education&#xD;
           and safety of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mobile health (mHealth) is actually part of the wider &quot;eHealth&quot; movement, which is using&#xD;
           technology such as computers, mobile phones, mobile health apps and patient monitors for&#xD;
           health services and information. Both mobile health and eHealth help providers get the&#xD;
           information they need to improve health care outcomes and lower costs. Research on&#xD;
           interventions based on mHealth applications suggests that they can be used to alter&#xD;
           health related behaviors (McKay, 2018), such as medication adherence (Haase, 2017), but&#xD;
           economic evidence for their usage is limited (Iribarren, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 STUDY RATIONAL&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to support the patients with metastatic melanoma in their daily-life, Pierre&#xD;
           Fabre has developed a digital solution, called TavieSkin, which is dedicated to all&#xD;
           BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients who are treated with &quot;any&quot;&#xD;
           targeted therapies. This application is expected to be extended to other therapies&#xD;
           including immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the TavieSkin app is (i) to deliver the necessary information and education&#xD;
           support to the patient in regards with their disease and medications, through virtual&#xD;
           nurse coaching, (ii) to keep track of the medications taken throughout the days through&#xD;
           push notification, with the aim to improve compliance, (iii) to assist patients in&#xD;
           identifying side effects using the virtual nurse coaching and side effects library, and&#xD;
           (iv) to engage them towards sustainable healthy behaviors thanks to lifestyle&#xD;
           interventions, health trackers and real time coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The TavieSkin app allows for the provision of a report for the healthcare provider (HCP)&#xD;
           summarizing clinical and lifestyle data collected in the app and generated prior to the&#xD;
           medical visit, if needed. The objective being to optimize the time spent at the clinic&#xD;
           by facilitating the patient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As per the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance, this&#xD;
           mobile application could not be considered as a medical device. Health mobile apps&#xD;
           classified as medical device are defined as softwares that gather data from the person&#xD;
           or a diagnostic device, such as diet, heartbeat, or blood glucose levels and then&#xD;
           analyze and interpret the data to make a diagnosis, prescribe a medicine, or recommend&#xD;
           treatment. This is in any case the objective of TavieSkin app. The treating physician or&#xD;
           the HCP remains the only eligible person to manage the patient and its disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, a patient survey will be incorporated into the TavieSkin app to assess the&#xD;
           health-related quality of life (HRQoL) under treatment and the patients' satisfaction&#xD;
           toward their medications prescribed for melanoma and toward the application. The&#xD;
           objective of this survey is to describe the profile of the users of TavieSkin app, their&#xD;
           quality of life and daily activity impairment under targeted therapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this survey is to describe the demographics and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma&#xD;
           treated with targeted therapy (BRAFi/MEKi) and using the TavieSkin application.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  To assess the patient satisfaction toward the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RESEARCH METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 STUDY DESIGN This prospective, longitudinal, survey will be conducted in Europe to&#xD;
           characterize BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients using TavieSkin&#xD;
           app designed for accompanying patients treated with targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To date, there are three combinations of BRAFi/MEKi available in routine practice for&#xD;
           the treatment of BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The survey does not&#xD;
           provide or recommend any treatment or procedure; all decisions regarding treatment are&#xD;
           made at the sole discretion of the treating physicians in accordance with their usual&#xD;
           practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to the TavieSkin app The patients initiating any BRAFi/MEKi combination will be&#xD;
           invited to use the TavieSkin app by their healthcare provider (HCP) (i.e. oncologist,&#xD;
           dermatologist, nurse…). The HCP will give the patient an activation code printed on a&#xD;
           flyer. The flyer will provide detailed information about the application and&#xD;
           installation procedure. The patient will be able then to install the app and to activate&#xD;
           it using the activation code provided on the flyer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to the e-survey Once the patient has installed and started to use the&#xD;
           application, an e-survey will be proposed to the patient via the app. A detailed&#xD;
           information letter about the data collection, data privacy and analysis will be&#xD;
           displayed to the patient via the app along with an e-consent for data collection. The&#xD;
           patient will be able then to provide an e-signature, if he/she accepts to take part of&#xD;
           this survey. The survey will collect anonymized data about health status, QoL data and&#xD;
           satisfaction. These data will be collected by the patient only. The physician will not&#xD;
           be involved in this e-survey (including e-consent), nor in data collection. If the&#xD;
           patient declined the data collection, thus he/she will not take part of the survey,&#xD;
           however he/she still can have access to the TavieSkin app modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only patients having given consent (e-consent) to data collection and analysis will be&#xD;
           included. The number of patients refusing to consent to data collection will be&#xD;
           collected along with the reason, in order to assess the representativeness of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected at baseline and at different subsequent timepoints during the&#xD;
           treatment. Only data reported by the patients in the application will be collected and&#xD;
           analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected only during the BRAFi/MEKi treatment duration. The patient will&#xD;
           discontinue the study in case of definitive withdrawal of BRAFi/MEKi treatment, or if&#xD;
           he/she decides to withdraw the study and to stop data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The target countries for patient enrollment will include Germany, Belgium, Portugal,&#xD;
           France, Spain, Italy and Sweden with the additional possibility of including patients&#xD;
           from other EU countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At least, 400 adult patients (≥18 years) will be enrolled. A descriptive interim&#xD;
           analysis may be performed when the number of patients reaches the 200 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.1 Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           (See section: Eligibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.2 Participants recruitment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           As mentioned above in section 3.1, the access to the app will be provided by the HCP&#xD;
           through a flyer and an activation code. Patients with BRAF-mutant unresectable or&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma will be invited by its healthcare provider (i.e. oncologist,&#xD;
           dermatologist, nurse…) to use TavieSkin app during a routine visit. The physician will&#xD;
           communicate orally to the patients, all necessary information about the application. In&#xD;
           addition, a written letter of information (a flyer) and the procedure to access the&#xD;
           application will be provided to the patient at this visit. The treatment decision with&#xD;
           regard to BRAFi/MEKi must have been made prior to this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.2.1 Participant recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           The access to the e-survey will be provided through the application for patients having&#xD;
           read and signed the e-consent for data collection and analysis. No involvement from the&#xD;
           HCP is required for this step. The patient will be the sole actor involved in signing&#xD;
           the e-consent and in reporting data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Of note, the patients will have the choice to use the TavieSkin app, without&#xD;
           participating to the e-survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.2.2 Participant follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be managed and followed as per routine clinical practice. No additional&#xD;
           visit or any follow-up is required for the sake of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2.2.3 Study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected after Apps installation and informed consent provided and at&#xD;
           different subsequent timepoints during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be collected only during the BRAFi/MEKi treatment duration. The patient will&#xD;
           discontinue the study in case of definitive withdrawal of BRAFi/MEKi treatment, or if&#xD;
           he/she decides to withdraw the study and to stop data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 STUDY OUTCOMES (see section: Outcome measures)&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4 DATA SOURCES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will assess only self-reported measures. All the data will be completed and&#xD;
           collected by the patient itself through the application. No other data will be&#xD;
           abstracted using other existing sources such as medical records or hospital discharge&#xD;
           files.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collection schedule is presented in the section: Outcome measures (Time Frame).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.5 DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will enter manually their clinical data in the TAVIE application through an&#xD;
           application programming interface (API). MedClinik, the service provider responsible for&#xD;
           data managing will ensure that data are anonymized, encrypted and secured, and then&#xD;
           transferred from the TAVIE API to two databases: an Structured Query Language (SQL)&#xD;
           database and a no SQL database (MongoDB) located on dedicated servers, themselves&#xD;
           located in the region where data subjects are.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These anonymous databases will be transferred every 3 months to Pierre Fabre via a&#xD;
           secured channel for processing and analytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6.1 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           This survey is purely descriptive. The primary objective is to describe the patient&#xD;
           profile at inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since there is no hypothesis to test, we calculate the sample size for the worst-case&#xD;
           estimate being 50% with a precision/accuracy of 5%. A sample size of at least 384&#xD;
           patients will be able to describe the patient profile with a precision of &lt; 5%. This was&#xD;
           considered adequate to meet the descriptive objectives of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6.2 General considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analyses will be fully described in a written statistical analysis plan&#xD;
           (SAP). The study endpoints will be analysed overall and by country. Analyses will be&#xD;
           descriptive in nature, as no hypothesis will be tested. In general, missing data will&#xD;
           not be imputed (except for dates) and the data will be analysed according to the&#xD;
           complete case approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment patterns of patients, baseline demographics and clinical characteristics,&#xD;
           and reasons for treatment discontinuation will be described using summary statistics.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Continuous&#xD;
           variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (mean, and standard deviation,&#xD;
           median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum). The number of missing&#xD;
           observations for each variable will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Change in health-related quality-of-life scores (i.e. (FACT-M) will be summarised at&#xD;
           baseline and at each timepoints. The change from baseline will be assessed using a mixed&#xD;
           model for repeated measures (MMRM). Baseline covariates will be described in the SAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time to event data (i.e. time to treatment discontinuation, time QoL deterioration) will&#xD;
           be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Median survival estimates will be&#xD;
           reported along with the 25th and 75th percentiles and corresponding 95% CIs. Cox&#xD;
           regression analysis may be performed to adjust for predefined (baseline) covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the sample size is adequate, subgroup analyses using variables at baseline might be&#xD;
           conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6.3 Missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the nature of the study, missing data (i.e., data that are not reported by the&#xD;
           patient) may be observed for some variables. In general, missing data will not be&#xD;
           imputed (except for dates) and the data will be analysed according to the complete case&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.7 QUALITY CONTROL The data are self-reported and therefore is no way to describe the&#xD;
           extent of source data verification or data monitoring. However, the quality of data will&#xD;
           be ensured using auto-queries, i.e. a patient who enters an invalid data or an out of&#xD;
           range value, a pop-up or a will automatically append warning message to the invalid&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.8 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main limitation of this study is the response bias. It occurs when individuals offer&#xD;
           self-assessed measures of some phenomenon. There are many reasons individuals might&#xD;
           offer biased estimates of self-assessed behavior, ranging from a misunderstanding of&#xD;
           what a proper measurement is to social-desirability bias, where the respondent wants to&#xD;
           'look good' in the survey, even if the survey is anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second limitation is the selection bias. Only patients having access to the TavieSkin&#xD;
           App could be included in the survey. Patients with no access to mobile or tablet could&#xD;
           not take part of this survey. The demographics and health status of patients having&#xD;
           access to the app may differ from those who do not have access or do not want to use the&#xD;
           TavieSkin App.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other limitations include also the number of missing data or non-completed&#xD;
           questionnaires. Since the survey does not involve the HCP, the only possible reminders&#xD;
           for missing data could be handled via the application; however, reminders or&#xD;
           notifications must be sent in a respectful manner and might be deactivated at any time&#xD;
           by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.9 STUDY MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.9.1 Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pierre Fabre Médicament will serve as the Sponsor of this study. It is the&#xD;
           responsibility of Pierre Fabre (as a data controller) to ensure proper oversight of the&#xD;
           company MedClinik (data processor) in conducting data management and compliance with all&#xD;
           applicable regulatory guidelines and laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is the responsibility of Pierre Fabre to conduct the statistical analysis according&#xD;
           to the observational plan and to the SAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.9.2 Service Provider responsible for data management&#xD;
&#xD;
           MedClinik is the digital solution provider that develops and maintains the TavieSkin&#xD;
           Service. As part of the service, Medclinik will collect through the TAVIE Platform the&#xD;
           necessary data for this survey. It is the responsibility of MedClinik to securely&#xD;
           collect and host the data according to the requested data by Pierre Fabre. MedClinik&#xD;
           will extract and send to Pierre Fabre anonymized data for analysis. Only data collected&#xD;
           in the patient questionnaire will be sent to Pierre Fabre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS AND LOCAL REGULATORY ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be conducted under the guidelines of good pharmacoepidemiology practices&#xD;
           (GPPs) issued by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE), the&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, the European Union General Data Protection&#xD;
           Regulation (EU GDPR) and any applicable national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE OR INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IEC/IRB)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consistent with local regulations and prior to enrollment of patients at a given site,&#xD;
           the observational plan will be submitted together with its associated documents (e.g.,&#xD;
           informed consent form [ICF]) to the responsible IRB/IEC for its review. Before&#xD;
           implementation of any substantial changes to the observational plan, and amendments will&#xD;
           also be submitted to the relevant IRB/IEC in a manner consistent with local regulations.&#xD;
           Pertinent safety information will be submitted to the relevant IECs during the course of&#xD;
           the study in accordance with local regulations and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be undertaken only after the IRB/IEC have given full approval of the&#xD;
           final observational plan, the ICF, and the Sponsor had received a copy of this approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An ICF (e-consent) must be signed by the patient before his or her participation to the&#xD;
           survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 PRIVACY OF PERSONAL DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confidentiality of patient records will be maintained at all times. All study reports&#xD;
           will contain aggregate data only and will not identify individual patients. At no time&#xD;
           during the study the Sponsor will receive patients identifying information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to maintain patient confidentiality, each patient will be assigned a unique&#xD;
           patient identifier upon study enrollment. This patient identifier will be used in place&#xD;
           of the patient name for the purpose of data analysis and reporting. All parties will&#xD;
           ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names or other&#xD;
           identifiers (i.e. initials, full date of birth, address etc.) on any study forms,&#xD;
           reports, publications or in any other disclosures, except where required by law. In&#xD;
           accordance with local regulations in each of the countries, patients will be informed&#xD;
           about data handling procedures and asked for their consent. Data protection and privacy&#xD;
           regulations will be observed in capturing, forwarding, processing, and storing patient&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pierre Fabre Medicament (PFM) as Sponsor of the study and data controller is responsible&#xD;
           for the processing of personal data in accordance with the provisions of Regulation&#xD;
           2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the&#xD;
           protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the&#xD;
           free movement of such data (GDPR), the data collected being for research purposes in the&#xD;
           field of health, the legal basis of the processing being the legitimate interest of the&#xD;
           data controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Within the context of this research, we may collect and process personal data. MedClinik&#xD;
           will comply with all regulations regarding personal data - including European General&#xD;
           Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           MedClinik will only collect personal data strictly needed for the research, will&#xD;
           implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of&#xD;
           personal data against unauthorized disclosure or access, will only retain personal data&#xD;
           for a limited and fixed period after the end of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant's rights towards personal data are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the right of access to their personal data;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the right to rectify their personal data in case of mistakes;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the right of limitation to the processing;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the right to object processing with their personal data;&#xD;
&#xD;
           The personal information collected will be saved in a computerized file kept by&#xD;
           MedClinik for the survey. This information will be stored for 15years and is reserved&#xD;
           for use by PF for the purpose of conducting the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For any enquiry regarding the process of personal data, or to exercise rights,&#xD;
           participants can contact MedClinik by email: tavieskin@tavierx.net or the Data&#xD;
           Protection Officer of Pierre Fabre by email: dpofr@pierre-fabre.com&#xD;
&#xD;
           This survey is run via a secure server; all information held on this server is protected&#xD;
           from external sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE REACTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To note, this study has no objective of analysing the safety profile of the products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey is based on secondary use of data collected from consumers via the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The submission of suspected adverse reactions in the form of individual case safety reports&#xD;
      to competent authorities is therefore not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS (IF APPLICABLE)&#xD;

      A final study report will be prepared within 12 months from end of data collection. Pierre&#xD;
      Fabre is responsible for any presentation and/or publication arising from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any publication of the results from this study must be consistent with the Pierre Fabre's&#xD;
      publication policy and guided by the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to&#xD;
      Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication of the International&#xD;
      Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), updated April 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reporting will be consistent with the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of&#xD;
      OBservational studies in Epidemiology) Initiative checklist.&#xD;
