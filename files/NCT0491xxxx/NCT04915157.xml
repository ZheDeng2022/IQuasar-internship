  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a growing number of patients with refractory angina pectoris (RAP). RAP is defined&#xD;
      as a 'chronic condition (&gt; three months) characterized by diffuse coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      the presence of proven ischemia, which is not amendable to a combination of medical therapy,&#xD;
      angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery'. These patients are severely restricted in performing&#xD;
      daily activities due to debilitating angina complaints, leading to a decreased quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a last resort treatment option for patients with RAP. SCS is&#xD;
      a device with a lead located in the thoracic epidural space and an Implantable Pulse&#xD;
      Generator (IPG) in the abdomen or buttock that provides neurostimulation. Four possible&#xD;
      mechanisms explaining the beneficial effects of SCS on RAP have been described: reduction of&#xD;
      pain perception, decreased sympathetic tone, reduced myocardial oxygen demand, and improved&#xD;
      coronary microcirculatory blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research into the effect of SCS on RAP up to date have mainly been observational studies,&#xD;
      with only four placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials. All studies confirm that&#xD;
      treatment with SCS leads to a reduction in the number of angina pectoris attacks. What is&#xD;
      currently not clear, is whether there is a placebo effect as results vary between the&#xD;
      studies. One study looked at the effect of SCS in patients with RAP on the reduction of&#xD;
      ischemia (using MIBI-SPECT) with no control arm. After 12 months myocardial ischemia was&#xD;
      reduced, but not after three months of treatment. Leading to the conclusion that the&#xD;
      reduction is myocardial ischemia was not a direct effect of SCS, but rather due to better&#xD;
      coronary collateralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2020 ESC guideline 'chronic coronary syndromes' mentions non-existing to promising levels&#xD;
      of evidence with regard to treatment options in patients with RAP and concludes that SCS may&#xD;
      be considered (Class IIB; level of evidence B). It concludes that 'larger RCTs are required&#xD;
      to define the role of each treatment modality for specific subgroups, to decrease&#xD;
      non-responder rates and ascertain benefit beyond potential placebo effects'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current randomized controlled trial (double-blind, cross-over,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single center) is to determine if high density spinal cord stimulation, a&#xD;
      paresthesia free form of stimulation, leads to a significant reduction in myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      (using PET with Flupiridaz as tracer) in patients with refractory angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this study will receive an implanted spinal cord stimulator after a&#xD;
      positive TENS treadmill outcome and proven ischemia using the imaging modality PET with&#xD;
      Flurpiridaz as tracer. Using a cross-over design all patients will have a 6 month period with&#xD;
      high density stimulation and 6 month period of no stimulation. Randomization will determine&#xD;
      in which order the patient receives these treatments. Both the patient and the treating&#xD;
      physicians are blinded for this randomization process. At baseline a 6-minute walking test,&#xD;
      the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the RAND-36 questionnaire, the NRS scale and the CCS class&#xD;
      will be performed/filled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over takes place at 6 months (switch from high density stimulation to no stimulation or&#xD;
      vice versa) prior to which the PET scan is repeated, as well as the 6-minute walking test,&#xD;
      the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the RAND-36 questionnaire, the NRS-scale and the CCS-class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study period (12 months) the PET scan is repeated, as well as the 6-minute&#xD;
      walking test, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the RAND-36 questionnaire, the NRS-scale and&#xD;
      the CCS-class.&#xD;
