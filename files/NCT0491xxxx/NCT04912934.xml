      The aim was to determine the coronavirus anxiety levels and emotional eating status of cases&#xD;
      with diagnosis of MetS according to diagnostic criteria published by the International&#xD;
      Diabetic Federation (IDF) in 2005 and healthy individuals with similar BMI to MetS subjects.&#xD;

      The aim was to determine the coronavirus anxiety levels and emotional eating status of cases&#xD;
      with diagnosis of MetS according to diagnostic criteria published by the International&#xD;
      Diabetic Federation (IDF) in 2005 and healthy individuals with similar BMI to MetS subjects.&#xD;
      This study was completed with the descriptive, cross-sectional and relational screening&#xD;
      model. The full sampling method was used in the study. The study was completed with 105&#xD;
      individuals with metabolic syndrome attending the diet clinic and 109 healthy individuals&#xD;
      without MetS diagnosis also attending the diet clinic. Collection of data used anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and biochemical findings, blood pressure and a survey form, the Coronavirus&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Emotional Eating Scale (EES).&#xD;

        Power analysis was performed using the G*Power (v3.1.9) program to determine the number of&#xD;
        samples. According to Jacob Cohen's effect size coefficients, it was calculated that there&#xD;
        should be at least 105 people in the groups for α=0.05 and 1-β=0.95 (95% power) levels,&#xD;
        assuming that the evaluations between the two independent groups would have a medium effect&#xD;
        size (d=0.5).&#xD;
