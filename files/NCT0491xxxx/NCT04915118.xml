  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart failure (HF), a condition in which&#xD;
      the heart does not pump blood as well as it should.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that the levels of a hormone called N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in the&#xD;
      body can be used for differential diagnosing of HF. NT-proBNP is released by the heart when&#xD;
      there is an increase in heart pressure. The levels of NT-proBNP can indicate whether medical&#xD;
      problems are likely to happen due to HF. These medical problems are called &quot;decompensation&#xD;
      events.&quot; The higher a person's NT-proBNP levels is expected, the higher their risk of&#xD;
      developing HF and having decompensation events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the researchers in this study want to learn about NT-proBNP levels and decompensation&#xD;
      events in German patients with a common type of HF called heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF). In patients with HFrEF, the muscle on the left chamber of the heart does&#xD;
      not pump blood as well as it should. The researchers will collect information from patients&#xD;
      and their health records for about 300 adult patients in Germany with HFrEF who have been&#xD;
      receiving standard of care treatment for their condition. Standard of care treatments are&#xD;
      treatments that doctors commonly use to treat patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will study and record the levels of NT-proBNP levels and any changes in the&#xD;
      health of the patients at time of NT-proBNP measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect this information between May 2021 and September 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have had any HF-decompensation event since January 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have had at least 1 NT-proBNP measurement done before the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect the following information about the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the results of NT-proBNP measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the date of the NT-proBNP measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number and type of decompensation events&#xD;
