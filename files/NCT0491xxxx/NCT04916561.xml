      Background The presence of the Covid-19 virus has been detected in tissues of various&#xD;
      origins: nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, blood, stool and anal swabs.&#xD;
      However, it does not appear that the virus is excreted in the urine. The REACTing group&#xD;
      (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious Diseases) has demonstrated the presence of the virus&#xD;
      in the conjunctiva and pleural fluid. This detection was made possible by carrying out&#xD;
      quantitative, real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of the viral genes, which are currently the&#xD;
      benchmark for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it is not known at this time whether the&#xD;
      Covid-19 virus is present in joint fluid or in bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some viruses have a particular bone tropism (Parvovirus B19, HHV6); others have&#xD;
      joint tropism (parvovirus B19, HBV, HCV, rubella, HIV, HTLV-1). The presence in &quot;orthopedic&quot;&#xD;
      tissues of the various coronaviruses (MERS, SARS, etc.) has never been evaluated in the past.&#xD;
      However, cases of pulmonary contamination by coronavirus after bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
      have been reported in the literature. A potential location at these levels could cause&#xD;
      problems of different kinds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale First, and concretely, a possible direct transmission by these tissues. The current&#xD;
      English and Spanish national recommendations in orthopedics show a controversy as to the risk&#xD;
      of intraoperative contamination during medical procedures generating aerosols, in particular&#xD;
      those involving instruments at high speed (saw blade, reamer, drill). This transmission could&#xD;
      also be a problem during bone marrow transplants, from the iliac crests, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, but hypothetically, Covid-19 could become quiescent at the level of the&#xD;
      myelo-hematopoietic niches and reactivate at a distance, which could then explain the current&#xD;
      interrogation on &quot;absence of immunity&quot; and cases of early revival in patients considered&#xD;
      cured. This hypothesis is all the more likely since, always by analogy with Parvovirus B19 or&#xD;
      HHV6, a recent alert on cases of myocarditis in children has been issued in Parisian&#xD;
      pediatric hospitals and that treatment with tocilizumab, which blocks the action Interleukin&#xD;
      6 receptors, and initially used for joint manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, appear&#xD;
      promising.&#xD;

      -  Objective: The objective is to determine if Covid-19 is present in bone and joint tissue&#xD;
           from operative parts, extracted during routine procedures, in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
           Covid + before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods: Sample form orthopedics procedure that is usually collected will be analysed&#xD;
           for the detection of Covid-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The presence of the virus in the blood suggests a variable amount of&#xD;
           presence in the bone tissues, and to a lesser extent articular, of the weakness of their&#xD;
           poor vascularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, if this is confirmed, understanding of the natural history of the disease would&#xD;
      be greatly improved.In the absence of a virus, this would end the controversy about the&#xD;
      possibility of contamination by accident from exposure to the block and modify the national&#xD;
      recommendations for good orthopedic practices.&#xD;
