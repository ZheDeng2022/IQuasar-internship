  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a telemedicine program for older adults in cancer&#xD;
      treatment is a practical way to understand and meet these participants' unique needs.&#xD;
      Telemedicine is the use of secure video technology on a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone,&#xD;
      or tablet to provide and receive healthcare from a distance. The telemedicine program used in&#xD;
      this study is called a tele-geriatric oncology program. It involves the participant and a&#xD;
      study nurse meeting by videoconferencing during 2-6 telemedicine visits. As part of the&#xD;
      program, the participant and the study nurse will discuss the participant's symptoms and&#xD;
      aging-related needs.&#xD;

    <description>We will report the proportion (and CI) of optional telemedicine visits attended by enrolled participants out of the total number of scheduled optional telemedicine encounters. As participants could have multiple scheduled optional appointments and these appointments for the same participant would be correlated, the confidence interval will be calculated based on bootstrapping our original sample.</description>

    <description>Participants will be scheduled to meet with a Geriatric Nurse Practitioner (GNP) or Geriatric Registered Nurse (GRN) via the program's telemedicine platform. The telemedicine encounters with the GNP/GRN may occur every 2 weeks over 3 months, for a total of 6 visits. Visits 1 and 6 are mandatory, and visits 2-5 are on an as needed basis.</description>

        The medical oncology team (medical oncologists, nurse practitioners or registered nurses),&#xD;
        who have an established medical relationship with potential participants, will identify&#xD;
        potentially eligible participants for the proposed study. Participants of all genders and&#xD;
        ethnicities will be considered for participation. Participant eligibility will be&#xD;
        determined by the clinical research staff. A consenting professional will comprehensively&#xD;
        go through the details of the study with participants and provide participants with time to&#xD;
        ask questions and have them answered fully.&#xD;
