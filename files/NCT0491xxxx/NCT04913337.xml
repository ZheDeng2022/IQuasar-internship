    <description>A DLT is defined as an AE that meets at least one of the criteria listed in protocol, according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for AE (CTCAE) version 5.0, and is considered by the investigator to be clinically relevant and attributed to the study treatment during the first 28 days after the first dose of study treatment.</description>
