  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of a 16&#xD;
      wk individualized aerobic exercise program, using heart rate variability to guide the&#xD;
      exercise prescription, for increasing aerobic capacity of individuals with type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      compared to a traditional exercise training paradigm and usual care. To accomplish this aim&#xD;
      the investigators plan to test for greater improvements in: 1) fitness (primary outcome); as&#xD;
      well as secondary variables of 2) cardiovascular autonomic function via baroreflex function;&#xD;
      3) glucose control (HbA1c); and 4) psychosocial factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will examine participant's fitness levels before and after a 16 week intervention&#xD;
      period. There are two study visits prior to starting the intervention period. During Baseline&#xD;
      Study Visit #1, the investigators will take a health history, determine the height and weight&#xD;
      of the participants, and have participants complete a physical activity questionnaire and a&#xD;
      3-day diet log, as well as determine muscle and fat mass, followed by tests that examine how&#xD;
      blood vessels function, and lastly a treadmill test to determine aerobic fitness. During&#xD;
      Baseline Study Visit #2, which takes place 5-7 days later, the investigators will measure&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose control through a glucose challenge test. The glucose&#xD;
      challenge tests requires taking ~3 Tablespoons of blood to be assessed for glucose, insulin&#xD;
      and hemoglobin A1c. Lastly, participants will complete 3 questionnaires regarding quality of&#xD;
      life, fatigue, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the two pre-training data collection visits, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1) HRV-guided exercise group (HRV); 2) traditional exercise&#xD;
      training group (TRAD); or 3) usual care group. There will be approximately 30 subjects in&#xD;
      each group, providing an equal chance of being assigned to either group. Both the HRV and&#xD;
      TRAD groups will participate in a combined lab-supervised and home-based exercise program&#xD;
      (with 1 day1 per week supervised in the laboratory and 3 days per week at home) over the&#xD;
      course of 16 weeks. Furthermore, both exercise groups will participate in online/phone&#xD;
      counseling in order to provide support. Specifically, participants will be provided with a&#xD;
      phone number to the lab to call study personnel for assistance if needed. Weekly internet&#xD;
      video chats through Zoom or phone calls, if Zoom is unavailable, will be conducted by a&#xD;
      trained exercise-behavior change coach to help participants focus on self-efficacy, outcome&#xD;
      expectations, impediments (barriers), and goal setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training testing Visits #3 and #4 Visits #3 and #4 will be identical to visits #1 and 2,&#xD;
      with the exception that the demographic questionnaire will not be administered again. This&#xD;
      will mean there is a total of 100 mL of blood taken over the course of the entire study,&#xD;
      between Visits 2 and 4 combined, which will total ~6 total Tablespoons.&#xD;

    <measure>Peak aerobic capacity (fitness)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic capacity (e.g. fitness) will be measured during a treadmill test that assess how much oxygen the muscles need during exercise. Aerobic capacity (VO2peak) will be reported as mL/min/kg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glucose control</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) will be the marker of glucose control in this study. HbA1c will be reported as a percentage (%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Baroreflex sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome will be our assessment of autonomic function, whereby blood pressure and heart rate are assessed in relation to each other to create a variable called baroreflex sensitivity and reported as ms/mm Hg. Baroreflex sensitivity is defined as the change in interbeat interval (IBI) in milliseconds per unit change in BP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Short-Form (SF)-36 Health Survey questionnaire. Scores range between 0-100. A higher score indicates a better health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue severity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will assess perceived fatigue via a questionnaire that contains 9 questions. The minimum score is 9, with the maximum score being 63. The higher the score the greater the fatigue severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assess via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a questionnaire. There are 14 questions, and the scores can range between 0 to 21 for depression, and 0 to 21 for anxiety. A lower score means less depressive symptoms and/or anxieity.</description>
