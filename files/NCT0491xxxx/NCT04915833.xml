    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the colonic mucosa with a high definition colonoscope (EPKi7010 video&#xD;
      processor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopy images will be seen on a 27inch, flat-panel, high-definition LCD monitor&#xD;
      (Radiance™ ultraSC-WU27-G1520 model) only by one expert endoscopist, randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number, location, and polyps' features (Paris classification) will be recorded by the&#xD;
      operator. If a polyp is detected, the endoscopist will remove the polyp endoscopically with a&#xD;
      cold snare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same patient will be submitted to a second, the same session, computed aided real-time&#xD;
      colonoscopy using the DISCOVERY, AI-assisted polyp detector. Colonoscopy will be performed by&#xD;
      a same-level-of-expertise operator in comparison to the initial procedure. Any polyp or&#xD;
      lesion detected with the AI system will be recorded and endoscopically removed and considered&#xD;
      as a missed lesion from standard colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening colonoscopy has decreased the incidence of colorectal carcinoma in the previous&#xD;
      decades. However, there are reports of missed polyps and interval CRC following screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Several factors may affect the ADR, PDR, and missed lesions rates, such as bowel&#xD;
      preparation, percentage of mucosal surface evaluation, and the training levels of operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence using deep-learning algorithms has been implemented in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy, mainly for the detection and diagnosis of GI tract lesions such&#xD;
      as colonic polyps and adenomas. The implementation of automated polyp detection software&#xD;
      during screening colonoscopy may prevent the missing of polyp and adenoma during screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Therefore, improving the ADR and PDR during colonoscopies. All of this, with the&#xD;
      aim of decrease the incidence of interval colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and CRC-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Discovery Artificial Intelligence assisted polyp detector (Pentax Medical, Hoya Group)&#xD;
      was recently launched for clinical practice. This AI software was trained with 120,000 files&#xD;
      from approximately 300 clinical cases. The visual aided detection (bounding box locating a&#xD;
      polyp on the monitor) will alert the endoscopist if a polyp/adenoma was missed during the&#xD;
      standard, screening procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study evaluating the Discovery&#xD;
      AI-assisted polyp detector on clinical practice in the western hemisphere. We aim to evaluate&#xD;
      the real-world effectiveness of AI-assisted colonoscopy in clinical practice. We will also&#xD;
      evaluate the role of endoscopists' levels of training in the ADR, PDR, and missed lesion&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
