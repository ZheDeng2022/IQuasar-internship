  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock and the underlying dysregulated inflammatory host-response remain a major&#xD;
      contributor to mortality in critically ill patients. Cytokine adsorption represents an&#xD;
      attractive approach to the treatment of septic shock. Nevertheless, its effect on circulating&#xD;
      cytokine levels, as well as on the course of disease remains largely unassessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytokine-release plays an important role in the physiology of immune response to pathologic&#xD;
      influences by recruiting immune cells to the pathogenic loci, be they of infectious or of&#xD;
      non-infectious nature. Once at the focus, the activated immune cells can in turn release more&#xD;
      cytokines if a more extensive immune response is needed. This extremely important mechanism&#xD;
      for the organism, can however become pathological if the positive feedback loop between&#xD;
      immune cells and cytokines, for any reason, overshoots in form of a so called cytokine storm&#xD;
      and substantial amounts of released cytokines gain a systemic influence. The acute&#xD;
      complication of this immune over-reaction is a SIRS, which can critically escalate into a&#xD;
      potentially lethal multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, thus requiring immediate intensive&#xD;
      care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is, having this framework in mind, the reason why the CytoSorb-Adsorber has been developed&#xD;
      as a new therapeutic milestone. Essentially a haemoperfusion-filter, which through its&#xD;
      layering with polymer beads (Divinylbenzene/ Polyvinylpyrrolidone) can adsorb cytokines as&#xD;
      well as multiple inflammatory mediators and thus effectively remove them from the&#xD;
      bloodstream, reducing their possible systemic influence and hence improving the outcome for&#xD;
      patients being treated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CytoSorb-Adsorber is an already CE-approved product, which has demonstrated its capacity&#xD;
      to significantly reduce cytokine-levels such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, HMGB-1, IL-1ra in a&#xD;
      variety of pre-clinical studies. As well as in a clinical randomised multicentre study, which&#xD;
      tested the CytoSorb-Adsorber on a cohort of ALI/ ARDS and severely septic/ septically shocked&#xD;
      patients. The results of the later study can be very positively assessed, first of all and&#xD;
      most importantly showing, that no security concerns had to be had in regard to the&#xD;
      haemoperfusion-filter, as no adverse-effects attributable to the device were found. And&#xD;
      further, by proving an effect on systemic cytokine-levels in form of a significant reduction&#xD;
      in IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-1ra, as well as a reduction in mortality of those patients with&#xD;
      high initial cytokine levels, effectively reducing the 60 day mortality rate from 60% to 17%&#xD;
      in a pool of 14 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the intention to further elucidate the usefulness and clinical importance of this device&#xD;
      this study proposes a prospective recruitment of patients in severe refractory septic shock&#xD;
      to test the efficiency of this device.&#xD;
