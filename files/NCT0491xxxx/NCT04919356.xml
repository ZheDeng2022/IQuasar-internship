    <textblock>
      This program is intended to increase awareness of genetic Parkinson's, in particular the&#xD;
      G2019S LRRK2 mutation, and provide no cost genetic testing to determine if they carry the&#xD;
      G2019S LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;

        Participants include those with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's, in particular those&#xD;
        who have a first- or second-degree relative with Parkinson's, or who have young onset&#xD;
        Parkinson's (age less than 50 at diagnosis) or are of Ashkenazi Jewish or North African&#xD;
        Berber descent, or have a relative with a known genetic mutation in the LRRK2 gene, or who&#xD;
        have a genetic mutation in the LRRK2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant eligible for enrollment in the program must meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be a person diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who is 18 years or&#xD;
             older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant is under the care of a physician for their Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant is able to read, write and understand English, and reside in a country&#xD;
             where the shipment of biological samples is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is able to grant informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the case of participants, willing to participate in a free genetic testing program&#xD;
             to determine if they carry the G2019S LRRK2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to be notified of eligibility for clinical studies (if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Particpants who already believe they have tested positive for the mutation will be&#xD;
             allowed to be retested through this program and be notified of potential eligibility&#xD;
             for studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to meet any of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
