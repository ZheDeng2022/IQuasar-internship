  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for evidence-based interventions to reduce risk of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders (MSDs) and improve health and safety behaviors for low-income workers. Upstream&#xD;
      interventions addressing these organizational characteristics and work experiences may be&#xD;
      especially effective in preventing adverse health outcomes because they address underlying&#xD;
      sources of elevated risk particularly important for low-wage workers. Low-wage workers have&#xD;
      less schedule control, more irregular working hours, and shortened breaks due to time&#xD;
      pressure to complete work tasks. The objective is to develop and test feasible intervention&#xD;
      methods to modify the work organization and contribute to reductions in MSD risk, and&#xD;
      improvements work-related well-being and job satisfaction. First, this study will identify&#xD;
      characteristics of the work organization that can be feasibly modified through changes in&#xD;
      management practices, based on interviews with food service managers and focus groups with&#xD;
      workers. Second, the investigators will determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      an integrated TWH intervention in improving workers' ergonomic practices, MSD symptom, as&#xD;
      well as in changing the work organization and environment related to work-related well-being&#xD;
      and job satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of this study will be significant because it is expected to contribute to&#xD;
      reducing disparities in these health outcomes by directly intervening on an underlying source&#xD;
      of these disparities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The food service industry employs 9.5 million workers in the U.S, many of whom are at&#xD;
      elevated risk for a range of poor health outcomes. NIOSH's Total Worker Healthâ„¢ (TWH) Program&#xD;
      provides an innovative approach for addressing the shared pathways in the work organization&#xD;
      and environment that impact both MSD risk and health and safety behaviors. This study takes&#xD;
      advantage of an unusual opportunity to demonstrate the impact of changes in the work&#xD;
      organization in collaboration with an industry partner that has committed to making such&#xD;
      changes in concert with this study. Our central hypothesis is that an intervention targeting&#xD;
      the work organization, as well as the work environment will show promising improvements in&#xD;
      MSD outcomes and improvements in work-related well-being and job satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify factors in the work organization, expected to be associated with MSD risk and&#xD;
           work-related well-being and job satisfaction, which can be feasibly modified through&#xD;
           changes in management practices. The investigators will conduct formative research using&#xD;
           qualitative data from workers and managers to explore two overarching issues to inform&#xD;
           intervention development specific to this setting: (a) What work organizational factors&#xD;
           do workers perceive as priorities for their safety and health? (b) What factors in the&#xD;
           work organization do worksite and district managers believe can be feasibly modified&#xD;
           through changes in policies and practices? The investigators will additionally explore&#xD;
           barriers and facilitators to these changes, and factors contributing to sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of an integrated TWH intervention&#xD;
           designed to improve the work organization and environment, workers' MSD symptoms,&#xD;
           ergonomic practices, and work-related well-being and job satisfaction. To provide the&#xD;
           next level of evidence and prepare for a full-scale randomized control trial (RCT), the&#xD;
           investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept (PoC) trial to evaluate an integrated TWH&#xD;
           intervention in ten food service worksites randomly assigned to intervention and control&#xD;
           conditions, to: (a) assess the feasibility of intervention delivery and the&#xD;
           acceptability of the intervention; and (b) provide preliminary estimates of baseline&#xD;
           levels, change from baseline to final, and intra-class correlation. The investigators&#xD;
           will explore the working hypothesis that between pre- and post-intervention, compared to&#xD;
           workers in control worksites, workers in intervention sites will report greater&#xD;
           improvements in the primary outcomes, including ergonomic practices and MSD symptoms,&#xD;
           work-related well-being and job satisfaction; and secondary outcomes, including&#xD;
           improvements in the work organization and environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PoC intervention will be tested in10 food service worksites randomly assigned to&#xD;
      intervention and control. The 13-month intervention will target changes in the organizational&#xD;
      and physical work environment and management practices, and supporting safe ergonomic&#xD;
      practices and factors related to work-related wellbeing and job satisfaction. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare differences between intervention and control sites in changes&#xD;
      between pre- and post-intervention in worker health and safety behaviors and MSD symptoms&#xD;
      through surveys of workers, and in the work organization and environment through manager&#xD;
      surveys and on-site walk-through's. A rigorous process evaluation will be used to assess&#xD;
      intervention feasibility. The contribution of this study will be significant because it is&#xD;
      expected to contribute to reducing disparities in these health outcomes by directly&#xD;
      intervening on an underlying source of these disparities.&#xD;
