  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and objectives of this study is to investigate whether reducing the existing arm&#xD;
      restrictions on patients who receive Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) will&#xD;
      result in an improved patient experience post operatively and reduce complication rates.&#xD;
      There are multiple and varied arm restriction instructions given to patients receiving CIED's&#xD;
      with limited universally accepted protocols or advice on restrictions for patients following&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions such as arm immobilization, showering and weight lifting, in addition to&#xD;
      contradictory advice between various hospitals and physicians, can negatively affect patient&#xD;
      quality of life and increase patient anxiety with no current evidence for benefit. A cluster&#xD;
      cross over randomized trial has been designed to test the comparative effectiveness of&#xD;
      lenient vs strict arm restrictions for all patients receiving implantable devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions within both arms of this study are considered within reasonable practice in&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All arm restriction instructions and parameters will be embedded within EPIC, nurses will&#xD;
      teach the restriction in addition they will be provide to the patients via printed EPIC&#xD;
      discharge summaries. Further links will be embedded in the After Visit Summary (AFS)&#xD;
      printouts and my Chart for patients in EPIC. These instructions will be changed every 7&#xD;
      months, as per the crossover design of the trial. Additionally, both arms will utilize&#xD;
      interactive voice recognition (IVR) to provide patients with further reminders and&#xD;
      instruction on arm restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are given standard of care instructions for follow up and complication&#xD;
      assessment through our device clinic and 24/7 on call nursing program.&#xD;

      The purpose and objectives of this study is to investigate whether reducing the existing&#xD;
      restrictions on patients post CIED will result in an improved patient experience post&#xD;
      operatively and reduce complication rates. Results from this study will create standardized,&#xD;
      postoperative arm restriction recommendations more uniform between various hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that outcomes of the post CIED implanted patients&#xD;
      given lenient arm restriction will be non-inferior to those with prolonged arm restriction at&#xD;
      reducing a combined primary endpoint of lead dislodgement, device infection, clinically&#xD;
      significant pocket hematoma, upper limb DVT and frozen shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance: The investigators anticipate that patients with minimal (lenient) arm&#xD;
      restriction will have similar postoperative complication rates compared to the prolonged arm&#xD;
      restriction. Should this hypothesis be proven, this will greatly improve patient quality of&#xD;
      life post CIED with less stringent restrictions.&#xD;

    <description>Definitions of each component of primary outcome:&#xD;
Lead dislodgement; dislodgment requiring surgical repair&#xD;
Frozen shoulder in this study is defined as Nursing or physician note mention of chronologically related (to index surgery) patient complaint of new or markedly worsened shoulder pain and/or restricted and stiffness of active and passive range of motion&#xD;
Upper arm venous thrombosis&#xD;
Clinically significant hematoma is defined as done in BRUISE CONTROL 2 trial: a hematoma that required re-operation and/or resulted in prolongation of hospitalization and/or required interruption of oral anticoagulation&#xD;
Infection will be categorized into three categories pocket infection, blood stream infection and endocarditis</description>

    <description>The strict arm group will be given the following restrictions. These restrictions are the current institutional protocol at the study site and falls within common practice pattern across Canada:&#xD;
No arm or shoulder movement x 24 hours&#xD;
No movement of affected arm overhead x 8 weeks&#xD;
No lifting anything heavier than 5 lbs (2.5kg) and avoid any kind of sports or other vigorous activities including golf, tennis, swimming or sweeping x 8 weeks&#xD;
Avoid any kind of shovelling x 8 weeks</description>

    <description>The lenient arm restriction group will be given the following restrictions. The justification for the selected lenient restriction is based on the current recommendations at a Canadian center as identified by the national survey:&#xD;
No shoveling 7 days,&#xD;
No golfing/swimming/tennis 14 days&#xD;
No other restrictions (overhead activity and weight lifting no limitation)</description>
