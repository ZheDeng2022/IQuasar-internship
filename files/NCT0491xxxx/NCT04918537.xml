  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shift workers are a growing population. It is well established that these workers face an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing chronic diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain debated.&#xD;
      Various factors such as internal circadian desynchronization, unhealthy lifestyle behaviours,&#xD;
      and lack of sleep interact in complex ways. Recently, it has been suggested that the gut&#xD;
      microbiota (GM) may play an important role in this increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to describe the variations of the GM composition in shift workers&#xD;
      across three different rotating weekly shifts (morning, afternoon, night) and to measure the&#xD;
      impact of a 3- week walnuts supplementation intervention consisting in a controlled&#xD;
      experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose a 6-weeks study including an observational and an experimental part.&#xD;
      First, in the observational part, we will compare the gut microbiota of shift workers across&#xD;
      three shifts (morning, afternoon and night). In the second part of the study, participants&#xD;
      will add to their usual intakes a daily serving of nuts (30g). Again, we will compare the gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition across the three types of shifts. During the study, participants will&#xD;
      record their food intake, sleep and defecation time. We will also monitor their blood glucose&#xD;
      levels continuously during the 4 first weeks of the study.&#xD;
