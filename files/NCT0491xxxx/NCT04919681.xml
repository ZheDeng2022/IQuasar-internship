  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the immediate efficiency of a six weeks&#xD;
      regular stretching protocol on regional and distant pain sensitivity. It is hypothesised that&#xD;
      regional and distant pain sensitivity will significantly decrease following six weeks of&#xD;
      regular stretching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to determine the effect after four-week cessation of&#xD;
      the stretching protocol on regional and distant pain sensitivity. If regional and distant&#xD;
      pain sensitivity decrease following regular stretching, it is hypothesised that the analgesic&#xD;
      effect will abate following four-week cessation.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention comprises of six weeks daily bi-lateral static stretching of the knee flexors. Stretches are performed seated on the ground. The participant sits upright on the floor with one leg straight. The sole of the other foot should be placed on the inside of the outstretched leg. The participant leans slightly forward, trying to touch their toes while maintaining full knee extension. Stretching is performed to the point of discomfort, and each stretch is held for 30-seconds for three repetitions.</description>

             Participants are included if they have no known medical conditions such as&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cognitive impairments,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  neurological,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  orthopaedic,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or neuromuscular problems that might affect the somatosensory system or preclude&#xD;
             stretching exercises or range of motion testing at the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who regularly engage in flexibility training (e.g., stretching, tai chi,&#xD;
             pilates or yoga)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or use any medication that might affect the somatosensory system, such as pain&#xD;
             medication, are excluded.&#xD;
