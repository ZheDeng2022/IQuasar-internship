      Rashakaty (Fitness for Me) study aimed to design a new technologies-based intervention using&#xD;
      a website and smart phone applications and to test the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention using these technologies for overweight and obese university students.&#xD;
      The intervention was implemented in two universities in the United Arab Emirates&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle are common among young adults and increase risk&#xD;
      for chronic diseases in subsequent years of life. Rashakaty (Fitness for Me) study aimed to&#xD;
      design a new technologies-based intervention using a website and smart phone applications and&#xD;
      to test the feasibility of implementing a lifestyle intervention using these technologies for&#xD;
      overweight and obese university students. The study intervention was guided by Social&#xD;
      Cognitive Theory. The study involved the development of a website, integrating educational&#xD;
      material and mobile applications for monitoring diet and physical activity and a16-week&#xD;
      feasibility trial to promote weight loss, improve food choices and increase physical activity&#xD;
      levels. The trial consisted of two arms: Rashakaty Basic (R-Basic) and Rashakaty Enhanced&#xD;
      (R-Enhanced).&#xD;

    <description>The General Nutrition Awareness Questionnaire (GNKQ) validated by Parmenter and Wardle in the UK. was used after local adaptation. Four main categories containing a total of 58 items were assessed:1) Awareness of dietary recommendations (11 items); 2) Knowledge of sources of nutrients (37 items); (3) Using the information to make dietary choices (5 items); and 4) Awareness of diet-disease relationships (5 items).</description>

    <description>Perceived social support for healthier foods and physical activity scale of Health Beliefs Questionnaire which was originally developed by Anderson, E. and colleagues was used after adaptation for university students in the UAE. The social support subscale (16 items for healthy eating and 7 items for physical activity) measures social influences on participants by their family members and closest friends. Each question is scored 1-5 (1 - Strongly disagree, 5 - Strongly agree).</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived self-efficacy scale of Health Beliefs Questionnaire which was originally developed by Anderson, E. and colleagues after local adaptation was used. It consists of 33 items for healthy eating and 24 items for physical activity. The healthy food efficacy measure assesses the respondent's confidence in reducing fat, reducing sugar consumption and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. The physical activity measure consists of two subscales: overcoming barriers to engaging in physical activity and integrating physical activity into the daily routine. Each question is scored 0 to 100 (certain I cannot) to 100) all or most of the time.</description>

    <description>The R-Enhanced intervention was guided by the Social Cognitive Theory and employed a variety of behavior modification strategies, including self-monitoring, goal setting, self-efficacy, and social support to facilitate changes in diet and physical activity. In addition, participants in the R-Enhanced intervention had online access to a nutritionist. The R-Enhanced intervention was implemented in the United Arab Emirates University.</description>
