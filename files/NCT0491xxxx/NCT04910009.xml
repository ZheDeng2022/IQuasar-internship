      This study was conducted in a pre-test-post-test, factorial group randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental design to determine the effect of privacy education on nursing students' privacy&#xD;
      consciousness and attitudes towards patient privacy. The universe of the study consisted of&#xD;
      the third-grade students (n = 239) registered in Gazi University Faculty of Health Sciences&#xD;
      Nursing Department in the Fall Semester of the 2020-2021 Academic Year. All students (n =&#xD;
      239) were evaluated according to the exclusion criteria from the study. The students who met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria (n = 116) were informed about the research. A pre-test was applied to&#xD;
      the students (n = 116) who volunteered to participate in the study. According to gender, 116&#xD;
      students were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 38), study group I (n = 40), and&#xD;
      study group II (n = 38) by a statistician by computer technique. Data were collected November&#xD;
      2020 and February 2021 using the Informative Features Form, the Privacy Consciousness Scale,&#xD;
      The Patient Privacy Scale, and Students' Views on Education Form.&#xD;

      Implementation All students participated to the theoretical classes of the privacy&#xD;
      education.Theoretical lessons consisted of 2 sessions of 40 minutes each. Privacy Concept and&#xD;
      Patient Privacy Specific to Nursing Profession in the first session; In the second session,&#xD;
      Ethical Problem Clusters Regarding Patient Privacy in Nursing Practices and Ethical Analysis&#xD;
      of Measures to be Taken were explained. In the theoretical sessions, Microsoft PowerPoint&#xD;
      presentation, lecture and question-answer methods were used. Then study group I and study&#xD;
      group II are divided into four groups. The groups, under the consultancy of the researcher,&#xD;
      separately wrote cases involving ethical problems related to physical, informational,&#xD;
      decisional, and relational privacy. Both groups made the ethical analysis of these cases into&#xD;
      a presentation. The study group I prepared digital storytelling for each case as I extra. The&#xD;
      counseling given to the study groups consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each. Then, each&#xD;
      study groups presented their cases and case studies to their group friends. The study group I&#xD;
      shared their digital stories in addition to the case study. Two sessions of 60 minutes each&#xD;
      were held for each study group. Two groups made their presentations at each session.&#xD;
      Question-answer and discussion methods were used.&#xD;
