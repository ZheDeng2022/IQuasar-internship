  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world is currently facing a crisis because of this potentially fatal situation of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 epidemic without proven efficacy for any drug treatment, while the vaccination is&#xD;
      not yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This epidemic is caused by a new betacorona virus, now called SARS-CoV-2. The most common&#xD;
      symptoms reported are fever, cough or chest tightness, and dyspnea. Most cases have a mild&#xD;
      course&#xD;

      In the absence of proven antiviral therapy or specific vaccination against COVID-19, Nigella&#xD;
      seed oil is suggested as a potential supplement due to its known immunostimulatory and&#xD;
      antiviral activities in previous published studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nigella (known as black seed) in the Latin language or &quot;Habatulbarakah&quot; in the Arabic&#xD;
      language, is a food supplement and a medicinal plant well known in Arab and Islamic culture.&#xD;
      It is used as a food spice and it has a lot of medical claims that come from different&#xD;
      historical backgrounds. Nigella seeds contain several active compounds that have been&#xD;
      isolated, identified and reported, the most important being thymoquinone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, black seed has shown several pharmacological activities, including&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunostimulatory activities.&#xD;
