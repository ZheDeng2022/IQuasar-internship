  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized trial of 60 patients to test feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      efficacy of PRISM to improve resilience and facilitate improved patient-clinician&#xD;
      communication in racially minorities patients with serious illness.&#xD;

      Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM): PRISM is based on stress and coping theory&#xD;
      and prior research. It is designed to improve resilience for patients with serious illness&#xD;
      and, for this study, has been modified for patients who have experienced healthcare&#xD;
      discrimination. The development of this novel resilience resource intervention is based off&#xD;
      of a conceptual framework of resilience and affirmed relationships between resilience&#xD;
      resources and outcomes. PRISM consists of five, one-on-one sessions lasting 30-50 minutes&#xD;
      targeting specific teachable resilience skills: stress management, problem solving, goal&#xD;
      setting, benefit finding, and meaning making. Biobehavioral models suggest that these&#xD;
      resources are related to health-related quality of life, health behaviors, and self-advocacy.&#xD;
      PRISM was refined with expert opinion and interviews with patients, psychologists, and social&#xD;
      workers. Initially designed for and successfully tested in seriously ill adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults (AYAs) with advanced cancer, PRISM has been successfully deployed in AYAs with&#xD;
      diabetes and parents of seriously ill AYAs. It is undergoing testing in patients with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis, chronic renal failure, craniofacial surgery, and adult congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and approached, study goals explained, and consent obtained prior&#xD;
      to enrollment. Participants will complete three surveys: enrollment, 1- and 3- months post&#xD;
      randomization. At enrollment, they will complete demographic information, and the&#xD;
      Discrimination in Medical Setting (DMS), Microaggressions in Health Care (MHCS), and Group&#xD;
      Based Medial Mistrust (GBMM) scales. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either PRISM or usual&#xD;
      care. Retention will be optimized via monthly contacts with all patients. A calendar of&#xD;
      appointments and study procedures will be created at randomization. Strategies used during&#xD;
      the collection of preliminary data for this proposal are described and utilized in Aim 1 to&#xD;
      help facilitate survey completion will be employed. Patients will receive reminder&#xD;
      phone-calls and emails 1 week before each survey, and in-person check-ins during clinic&#xD;
      visits during a 2-week window around each survey. If surveys are not completed within 1 week,&#xD;
      participants will receive a phone call and email to assess willingness to participate and&#xD;
      remind them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRISM is designed to be delivered by trained research associates to optimize dissemination.&#xD;
      Interventionists in prior trials have not held advanced degrees and there are no detectable&#xD;
      differences in fidelity or patient-engagement based on professional background. For this&#xD;
      pilot, I will conduct the intervention to facilitate feasibility and gain experience to train&#xD;
      future interventionalists. Sessions will occur at a time convenient to the patient with the&#xD;
      first session to occur within 1 week of enrollment. If the patient is discharged, the&#xD;
      intervention can continue in the outpatient setting in-person or by HIPPA-compliant Zoom.&#xD;
      After completion, participants will receive weekly &quot;booster&quot; contacts (invitations to&#xD;
      practice reviewing certain skills) until the occurrence of a planned patient-clinician&#xD;
      conversation, facilitated and arranged by study staff during the 5th session. All&#xD;
      participants will receive paper worksheets to practice skills between sessions, plus access&#xD;
      to a free, digital PRISM app (available only for patients enrolled in PRISM). The app was&#xD;
      designed and programed by two Seattle-based companies [Artefact (artefactgroup.com) and&#xD;
      General UI (generalui.com)], 3 prior PRISM recipients, a family-advisory team, and the&#xD;
      Seattle Children's Hospital Digital Health team. It is available on both iOS and Android&#xD;
      platforms and includes the same exercises as the worksheets. The app includes links to social&#xD;
      media and resources with options to enable push notifications and reminders. A digital&#xD;
      interface allows study staff to track user frequency, length spent on each practice page, and&#xD;
      use over time.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) is is composed of 10 items from an original 25-item CD-RISC scale. Scores correlate with the full 25-item scale. Respondents rate their agreement with the survey items on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (nearly true all the time). It is scored by the sum of all items with a range between 0-40 with higher scores indicating higher patient-reported resilience.</description>
