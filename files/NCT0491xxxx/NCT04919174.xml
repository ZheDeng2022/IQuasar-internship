  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, bronchoscopy technology has developed rapidly and has become an&#xD;
      important part of the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. Bronchoscopy are&#xD;
      usually carried out under monitored anesthesia care (MAC), which can relieve the anxiety of&#xD;
      the patient, make the operation easier, and improve the completion rate of bronchoscopy. At&#xD;
      present, bronchoscopy has widely used midazolam, propofol, short-acting opioids, and newer&#xD;
      sedatives such as dexmedetomidine, but each drug has its limitations. Dexmedetomidine is&#xD;
      widely used in non-intubation general anesthesia and sedation during short outpatient&#xD;
      surgery. However, rapid and high-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine leads to dose-dependent&#xD;
      hypotension, temporary hypertension, bradycardia, and excessive sedation, causing hemodynamic&#xD;
      fluctuations. At the same time, it has slow onset and metabolism. This may be a potential&#xD;
      risk for some elderly patients with many underlying diseases and unstable hemodynamics.&#xD;
      Remimazolam is an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine. It has the advantages of short action&#xD;
      time, low accumulation, low risk of respiratory depression, and reversibility. We believe&#xD;
      that remimazolam can improve the onset time and resuscitation time, to achieve sufficient&#xD;
      sedation, improve the success rate of bronchoscopy, while reducing the patient's oxygen&#xD;
      saturation drop during the operation, postoperative opioid-related nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      postoperative delirium and other related adverse events. This study is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to confirm the above hypothesis.&#xD;

      All patients undergoing bronchoscopy under general anesthesia will be recruited and should&#xD;
      complete relevant preoperative examinations. The patient fasted for 6-8 hours before the&#xD;
      operation, and an indwelling trocar was placed in the vein. After entering the room, the&#xD;
      patient will be monitored with electrocardiogram(ECG), pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, and underwent oxygen inhalation (5L/min) through a nasal cannula. All patients used&#xD;
      2% lidocaine glue to moisten the nasal cavity for local anesthesia before the operation, the&#xD;
      bronchoscope was inserted through the nose. The subjects take a supine position. When the&#xD;
      bronchoscope passes through the vocal cords and carina, 5 ml of 2% lidocaine is delivered&#xD;
      through the channel to suppress the cough reflex. Then the patients were randomly divided&#xD;
      into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. one group use dexmedetomidine-remifentanil for anesthesia: the initial dose of&#xD;
           dexmedetomidine is 0.1ml/kg, infused for 5 minutes, and then adjusted to 0.1-0.5ml/kg/h;&#xD;
           the initial dose of remifentanil is 0.05ml/kg, infused for 5 minutes, and then adjusted&#xD;
           to 0.1- 0.5 ml/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the other group use remimazolam-remifentanil for anesthesia: the initial dose of&#xD;
           remimazolam is 0.1ml/kg, infused for 5 minutes, and then adjusted to 0.1-0.5ml/kg/h; the&#xD;
           initial dose of remifentanil is 0.05ml/kg, infused for 5 minutes, and then adjusted to&#xD;
           0.1- 0.5 ml/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients started bronchoscopy when they reached TE sedation (modified observer's&#xD;
      assessment of sedation,MOAA/S score 3 points). If the assessment of sedation after&#xD;
      administration suggests that the sedation is insufficient, propofol 0.4-0.6 mg/kg is&#xD;
      repeatedly administered every 5 minutes, with the maximum dose not exceeding 200 mg to&#xD;
      maintain sedation. In the maintenance phase of sedation, appropriate sedation is pre-defined&#xD;
      as a MOAA/S score of 4 or less. The drug was continuously infused until the end of the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, and all patients were transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) for&#xD;
      further observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the DoCare Clinic electronic anesthesia recording system was used in this&#xD;
      experiment. Bronchoscopy was performed by the same bronchologist with more than 10 years of&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
