  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic presents a great&#xD;
      challenge to global health. The first case was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China&#xD;
      and since has infected nearly 100 million people and claimed almost 2 million lives&#xD;
      worldwide. In response, the medical community and scientists have worked hard to develop&#xD;
      effective therapies and guidelines to treat a wide range of symptoms including the use of the&#xD;
      antiviral drug remdesivir, convalescent plasma, antibiotics, steroids, and anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy. To prevent the spread of the disease, multiple vaccines based on mRNA and DNA&#xD;
      technologies that include inactivated viral components have been developed and millions of&#xD;
      doses are currently being administered worldwide. Early analysis of data from the phase III&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine trials suggested the vaccine was more than 90% effective&#xD;
      in preventing the illness with a good safety profile (Polack et al., 2020). However, there&#xD;
      are still many unknowns regarding the long-term safety of these newer vaccine technologies&#xD;
      and the level and duration of immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection results in seroconversion and production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
      The antibodies may suppress viral replication through neutralization but might also&#xD;
      participate in COVID-19 pathogenesis through a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement&#xD;
      (Lu et al., 2020). Rapid progress has been made in the research of antibody response and&#xD;
      therapy in COVID-19 patients, including characterization of the clinical features of antibody&#xD;
      responses in different populations infected by SARS-CoV-2, treatment of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      with convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobin products, isolation and&#xD;
      characterization of a large panel of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies and early clinical&#xD;
      testing, as well as clinical results from several COVID-19 vaccine candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to assess the effic of both vaccines on the healthcare workers. As&#xD;
      healthcare workers begin to receive their first vaccination dosage, we will start looking for&#xD;
      traces of antibodies within the blood and saliva. The data provided will help us determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of the vaccine over a period of 1 year, identify any difference in efficacy&#xD;
      amongst different populations (gender, age, and ethnicities) differences among vaccine types,&#xD;
      demographics and follow-up on any potential side effects. We will collaborate with Nirmidas&#xD;
      Biotech Inc. based in Palto Alto, California, a Stanford University spinoff on this project.&#xD;
      Nirmidas Biotech. Inc is a young diagnostic company that have received several FDA EUA tests&#xD;
      for COVID-19. We will perform IgG/IgM antibody detection by the NIRMIDAS MidaSpot™ COVID-19&#xD;
      Antibody Combo Detection Kit approved by FDA EUA for POC testing in our hospital site for&#xD;
      qualitative antibody testing. We will then send dry blood spot and saliva to Nirmidas for the&#xD;
      pGOLD™ COVID-19 High Accuracy IgG/IgM Assay to quantify antibody levels and avidity, both of&#xD;
      which are important to immunity. The pGOLD assay is a novel nanotechnology assay platform&#xD;
      capable of quantifying antibody levels and binding affinity to viruses. We collaborated&#xD;
      recently with Nirmidas on this platform and published a joint paper in Nature Biomedical&#xD;
      Engineering on COVID-19 Ab pGOLD assay (Liu et al., 2020). It is also capable of detecting&#xD;
      antibodies in saliva samples and could offer a non-invasive approach to assessing antibody&#xD;
      response for vaccination.&#xD;
