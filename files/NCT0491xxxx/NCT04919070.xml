      Connect for Caregivers is a intervention feasibility pilot study. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to pilot test a newly developed single session behavioral intervention to help caregivers of&#xD;
      individuals with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias gain understanding of the&#xD;
      importance of increasing social connectedness, awareness of their personal barriers to&#xD;
      connectedness, and knowledge of local resources for promoting connectedness.&#xD;

      Connect for Caregivers is a intervention feasibility pilot study. We use a mixed methods&#xD;
      approach to initiate the development and testing process for a single session behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to help caregivers gain understanding of the importance of increasing&#xD;
      connectedness, awareness of their personal barriers to connectedness, and knowledge of local&#xD;
      resources for promoting connectedness. The intervention-&quot;Connect 4 Caregivers&quot;-has three&#xD;
      components: 1) psychoeducational materials on the importance of connectedness for health and&#xD;
      wellbeing; 2) a card sort-based 'discussion prioritization tool' that systematizes and&#xD;
      routinizes the process of identifying and prioritizing barriers to connectedness; 3)&#xD;
      personalized resources to address the identified barriers/targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 is to investigate whether Connect for Caregivers is associated with a signal for&#xD;
      efficacy for changing connectedness by having n=5 caregivers complete the single session&#xD;
      intervention and provide quantitative and qualitative data on their experience with the&#xD;
      intervention and motivation to work on increasing their social connectedness (a signal for&#xD;
      potential efficacy).&#xD;

    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure that assesses a mechanism posited by Self-Determination Theory to increase motivation for healthy behaviors. It has 6 items, a range from 6-30, and higher scores indicate greater perceived autonomy.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Competence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure that assesses a mechanism posited by Self-Determination Theory to increase motivation for healthy behaviors. It has 7 items, a range from 7-35, and higher scores indicate greater perceived competence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of Social Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure that assesses a subject's knowledge of the importance of social connections. It has 4 items, a range from 4-20, and higher scores indicate greater knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, which assesses self-reported loneliness. 20 items, rated as to how often the participant has felt a certain way in the prior month (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel alone?&quot;) -- &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;rarely&quot; (2), &quot;sometimes&quot; (3), or &quot;often&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater loneliness. However, some individual items must be reverse-coded so that higher total scores reflect greater loneliness (i.e., 1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1). These items (e.g., &quot;How often do you feel there are people you can turn to?&quot;) are items 1,5,6,9,10,15,16,19,20. Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing a worse outcome (i.e., greater loneliness).</description>
