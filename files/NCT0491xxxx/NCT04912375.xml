  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Experimental and cross-sectional evidence suggests that poor executive function&#xD;
      can lead to heightened reactivity to food cues and perceived greater reward of unhealthy but&#xD;
      palatable foods and subsequently lead to overeating or clinical eating disorders. This may be&#xD;
      an important reason for the increasing trend of obesity in our society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This study will investigate the interrelationships among executive function, reactivity&#xD;
      to food-related cues and eating style in young adults. In addition, this study will examine&#xD;
      the influence of food environment and stress on reactivity to food-related cues and executive&#xD;
      function and how executive function and reactivity to food-related cues would influence&#xD;
      health risky behaviours in young adults. We will also conduct a pilot randomized control&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to develop the culturally specific goal priming intervention for the Chinese&#xD;
      adults and test its effect on decision-making for food choice among adults with low executive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: This will be a three-wave cohort study in young adults who are recruited&#xD;
      in their final-year of first post-secondary education and follow-up at six months and 12&#xD;
      months after their graduation. For the pilot RCT, a 2 (low vs. high executive function) x 2&#xD;
      (with vs. without goal priming intervention) will be used to test the effect of goal priming&#xD;
      intervention on food choice. The goal priming intervention will be 5-min word-searching task&#xD;
      to prime goals of healthy eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Participants will be invited to complete a series on computerized&#xD;
      tasks and other assessments online in each wave to assess their executive function, risk&#xD;
      taking propensity, reactivity to food-related cues, perceived stress, exposure to&#xD;
      food-related cues, eating style and other health-related behaviours. Structural equation&#xD;
      modelling will be used to test the interrelationships among executive function, reactivity to&#xD;
      food-related cues and eating style, among exposure to food-related cues, perceived stress and&#xD;
      reactivity to food-related cues, and among executive function, reactivity to food-related&#xD;
      cues, risk taking and adoption of health-related behaviours. For the pilot RCT, the effect of&#xD;
      intervention on tendency of choosing healthy and low-calorie foods will be evaluated using&#xD;
      logistic regression model with level of executive function and goal-priming intervention as&#xD;
      the main between-group factors.&#xD;

    <description>The name of measure: participants' tendency to choose different categories of foods&#xD;
Measurement tool: the force food choice task&#xD;
The force food choice task evaluates participants' 'wanting' of foods with tempting cues. (&quot;if you had to make a choice, which food would you most want to eat now?&quot;)&#xD;
Software: Survey responses and test data were recorded in Inquisit via the web or lab-based service.&#xD;
Unit of measure: the frequency of food selections</description>
