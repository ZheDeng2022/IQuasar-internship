      This is a Phase III, international, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ADT +/- darolutamide in&#xD;
      castration-naïve de novo metastatic prostate cancer patients with vulnerable functional&#xD;
      ability who have not elected for docetaxel or other androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. The&#xD;
      study plans to enroll 300 patients who will be randomized (1:1) to receive either: (i)&#xD;
      Experimental arm: ADT + darolutamide 600 mg po bid, or (ii) Control arm: ADT + placebo po&#xD;
      bid. Response to treatment will be assessed according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria (Scher, 2016). Treatment will be continued until&#xD;
      radiographic disease progression. Treatment may also be terminated at the initiative of&#xD;
      either the patient or the investigator for any reason that would be beneficial to the&#xD;
      patient, including: unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent conditions that preclude continuation&#xD;
      of treatment, or patient request. Following treatment discontinuation patients will enter the&#xD;
      follow-up period and will be monitored for up to 10 years with regards to survival status,&#xD;
      subsequent antineoplastic treatments and the status of ongoing adverse events (AEs) and/or&#xD;
      new investigational product related AEs.&#xD;

    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

The tools/items proposed in G-CODE are:&#xD;
(i) Social assessment: living alone or support requested to stay at home; (ii) Functional autonomy: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaire and short instrumental ADL questionnaire (4-IADL); (iii) Mobility: Timed Up and Go test; (iv) Nutrition: weight loss during the past 6 months and body mass index; (v) Cognition: Mini-Cog test; (vi) Mood: mini-Geriatric Depression Scale; (vii) Comorbidity: updated Charlson Comorbidity Index.</description>
