  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of CH505 TF chTrimer&#xD;
      and adjuvants 3M-052-AF (imidazoquinoline) + Alum (Aluminum hydroxide suspension) in healthy&#xD;
      adults. Adjuvants may make vaccines work better.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that the CH505 TF chTrimer vaccine will expand B cell precursor&#xD;
      lineages capable of ultimately producing autologous and heterologous Tier 2 broadly&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Participants will receive CH505 TF chTrimer plus adjuvants&#xD;
      via two intramuscular injections administered five times throughout the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated for safety and immune responses through blood collection at specified&#xD;
      timepoints throughout the study. Each participant will have up to 18 months of scheduled&#xD;
      clinic visits and will have a follow-up safety assessment 12 months after their final&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
