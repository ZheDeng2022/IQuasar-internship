      If deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected among patients who have symptoms such as pain or&#xD;
      swelling of the lower extremities, duplex ultrasound of the lower limb is the first-line&#xD;
      imaging modality to diagnose DVT. However, duplex ultrasound is time consuming, requires&#xD;
      patient transport to a diagnostic imaging facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, abbereviated bedside ultrasound technique has been accepted by emergency&#xD;
      physician to diagnose the presence of DVT. Several studies have proven that the accuracy of&#xD;
      this abbreviated bedsude ultrasound for assessing the presence of deep vein thrombosis is not&#xD;
      inferior to experts, but how much ultrasound experience is required to obtain the accuracy&#xD;
      that does not inferior to experts has yet to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify how much learning by emergency physicians is needed to&#xD;
      obtain the accuracy of the lower extremity ultrasound examination comparable to that of&#xD;
      experts.&#xD;

      If deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected among patients who have symptoms such as pain or&#xD;
      swelling of the lower extremities, duplex ultrasound of the lower limb is the first-line&#xD;
      imaging modality to diagnose DVT. However, duplex ultrasound is time consuming, requires&#xD;
      patient transport to a diagnostic imaging facility, and the immediate availability of a&#xD;
      trained radiologist or other vascular physician to provide a result since most physicians are&#xD;
      unable to interpret such imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, abbereviated bedside ultrasound technique has been accepted by emergency&#xD;
      physician to diagnose the presence of DVT. Compression is applied to assess the presence of&#xD;
      thrombus and collapsibility only in three regions - iliofemoral junction, superficial femoral&#xD;
      vein, popliteal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have proven that the accuracy of this abbreviated bedsude ultrasound for&#xD;
      assessing the presence of deep vein thrombosis is not inferior to experts, but how much&#xD;
      ultrasound experience is required to obtain the accuracy that does not inferior to experts&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Among patients who visited the emergency department with symptoms related to lower&#xD;
             extremities (e.g. lower extremity pain, swelling of the lower extremities, numbness of&#xD;
             the lower extremities, redness of the lower extremities), the clinician judges that an&#xD;
             ultrasonography of the lower extremity is necessary based on the medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, and blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (or) Patients who need additional ultrasound of the lower extremity vein to check for&#xD;
             deep vein thrombosis due to the detection of a pulmonary thromboembolism in an&#xD;
             emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not agree to participate in the study&#xD;

             radiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already performed an ultrasound of the lower extremities at another&#xD;
             hospital and have been diagnosed with DVT&#xD;
