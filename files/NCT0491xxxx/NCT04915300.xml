  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the past twenty years, numerous specific pharmacologic agents targeting the&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction associated with PAH have emerged. Short term placebo-controlled&#xD;
      randomized trials assessing PAH-specific monotherapy with these molecules have reported&#xD;
      improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics and exercise capacity. A recent meta-analysis also&#xD;
      documented a reduction in short-term mortality of about ≈40% with such therapies. Several&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials evaluating PAH-specific combination therapy have been conducted.&#xD;
      Our recent meta-analysis showed that combination therapy was associated with a 35% risk&#xD;
      reduction for the occurrence of clinical worsening compared to monotherapy. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      investigators also showed 17% of PAH patients receiving combination therapy still experienced&#xD;
      clinical worsening over a median exposure of 16 weeks. Moreover, long-term survival on&#xD;
      PAH-specific also therapy remains poor in the modern era, with a yearly mortality rate of 15&#xD;
      % in incident idiopathic PAH. The identification of innovative therapeutic targets and&#xD;
      validation of these complementary therapeutic interventions are thus urgently needed in PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators and others (K. Stenmark, University of Colorado and H. Bogaard, VU&#xD;
      University Medical Center, Amsterdam, personal communications), have published strong&#xD;
      evidence that BRD4 plays a key role in the pathological phenotype in PAH accounting for&#xD;
      disease progression and showed that BRD4 inhibition can reverse PAH in several animal models.&#xD;
      Intriguingly, coronary artery disease (CAD) and metabolic syndrome are more prevalent in PAH&#xD;
      compared with the global population, suggesting a link between these diseases. Interestingly,&#xD;
      BRD4 is also a trigger for calcification and remodeling processes and regulates transcription&#xD;
      of lipoprotein and inflammatory factors, all of which are important in PAH and CAD.&#xD;
      Apabetalone, an orally available BRD4 inhibitor, is now in a clinical development stage with&#xD;
      a good safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of apabetalone as an&#xD;
      add-on therapy for adult PAH patients and to inform the conduct and the design of a Phase 3&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of apabetalone as evaluated by&#xD;
      the change in PVR over a period of 24 weeks compared to placebo in adult subjects with PAH on&#xD;
      stable background therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include changes at week 24 in 6MWD, plasma NT-proBNP concentration, WHO&#xD;
      functional class, ESC/ERS risk stratification score, health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      additional hemodynamic data from right heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are to evaluate the effects of apabetalone compared to placebo in&#xD;
      adult subjects with PAH on mortality and clinically relevant morbidity events, and on&#xD;
      circulating levels and transcription changes in whole blood markers of metabolism, vascular&#xD;
      calcification, inflammation, DNA damage and leucocyte expression of BMPR2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a standard-design, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 72 well-characterized PAH patients, 36 subjects in each treatment group (apabetalone&#xD;
      100 mg BID or matching placebo), that have been stable for &gt;4 months on standard&#xD;
      PAH-therapies, as per guidelines (Galie, Humbert et al. 2015) will be recruited in 8-15&#xD;
      participating centres (site selection currently ongoing). The participating centres will be&#xD;
      recruited if they have the same approach to PAH patients in terms of choice and timing of&#xD;
      treatments, and have expertise in performing trials in PAH. The initial Health Canada&#xD;
      approval will be obtained. Apabetalone will be provided by Resverlogix Corp. Canada, but&#xD;
      Resverlogix had no input into the trial design and will not be involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
      trial, analysis, interpretation of the results or the final manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-week pre-treatment phase will allow ensuring that patients are on stable doses of PAH&#xD;
      medication. Patients will be given apabetalone 100mg BID or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be regularly followed to assess whether side effects. At baseline and week 24,&#xD;
      a cardiac catheterization will assess changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end-of-study visit is planned at week 28.&#xD;

    <description>There are four functional classes that are used to rate how ill PH patients are. Class I: No symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension with exercise or at rest. Class II: No symptoms at rest but uncomfortable and short of breath with normal activity such as climbing a flight of stairs, grocery shopping, or making the bed. Class III: May not have symptoms at rest but activities greatly limited by shortness of breath, fatigue, or near fainting. Class IV: Symptoms at rest and severe symptoms with any activity.</description>

    <description>The ERS/ESC risk stratification strategy will be used to categorize patients as low, intermediate or high risk. The cut-off values proposed in the guidelines will be graded 1-3 (1: low-, 2: intermediate- and 3: high-risk). For each patient, the sum of all grades will be divided by the number of variables and rounded to the next integer to define the risk group. The number of low-risk criteria per patients will also be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change in clinical worsening events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Win ratio methodology will be used to evaluate the effects of apabetalone compared to placebo on mortality and clinically relevant morbidity events. The pairwise comparison proceeds in hierarchical fashion, using 1) all-cause mortality, followed by 2) frequency of PAH-related hospitalization; 3) a placebo-corrected change from baseline 6-minute walk distance &gt;35 meters and; 4) a &gt;20% relative placebo-corrected change in NTproBNP levels from baseline using the win ratio methodology. This method is based on the principle that each patient is compared with every other patient in a pairwise manner. This method gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of PAH-related hospitalization, exercise capacity and natriuretic peptide when patients cannot be differentiated on the basis of mortality, hospitalizations and functional status, respectively.</description>
