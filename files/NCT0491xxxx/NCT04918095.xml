  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to demonstrate early validation of objective home-monitoring of Chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients by combining accurate and relevant patient data&#xD;
      of medication and lung function (lung impedance) through patient-facing devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study goals are to demonstrate early validation of objective home-monitoring of COPD&#xD;
      patients using CareCOPD mature devices, paving way for follow-up work of care integration and&#xD;
      larger studies. The data will consist of time-series airway obstruction parameters,&#xD;
      medication quality, and symptoms data to detect correlations with exacerbation events. 50&#xD;
      COPD patients (diagnosed GOLD 2- 3, C- D for moderate-severe, poorly controlled) will be&#xD;
      monitored for 6 months. A successful outcome will be improved acute exacerbation of COPD or&#xD;
      AECOPD detection of at least one day earlier than patient-reported assessment (COPD&#xD;
      Assessment Test or CAT, modified Medical Research Council or mMRC questionnaires) and false&#xD;
      positives of &lt;20%.&#xD;

        COPD primarily affects and has adverse events for adults over the age of 40 based on prior&#xD;
        COPD literature. Further, this study is observational, to study correlations between&#xD;
        CareCOPD platform collected data and AECOPD. AECOPD is more frequent in older adults and&#xD;
        will provide more data for the limited pilot study. Therefore, subjects in the study will&#xD;
        exclusively be 40 years of age and older. There is no upper limit on age. As the pilot&#xD;
        study expands to include interventions from the CareCOPD platform, the age range may be&#xD;
        modified to include all subjects having COPD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Speak, read, and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand study requirements and comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to operate a smartphone or tablet (for questionnaire and symptoms input).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study&#xD;
        participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically disabled such that they are incapable of performing forced oscillometry&#xD;
             test (for airway impedance measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically disabled such that they are incapable of using metered-dose inhalers.&#xD;

             enough to operate the CareCOPD devices properly. Mild/moderate vision loss and mild&#xD;
             hearing loss may be included with appropriate corrective measures that do not affect&#xD;
             the device usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffering from serious uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with study&#xD;
             conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuous home Oxygen use for greater than 16 hours/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of the participant to give written informed consent.&#xD;
