  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is an unprecedented global&#xD;
      emergency. COVID-19 appears to be a disease with an early phase where the virus replicates,&#xD;
      coinciding with first presentation of symptoms, followed by a later 'inflammatory' phase&#xD;
      which results in severe disease in some individuals. It is known from other rapidly&#xD;
      progressive infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials&#xD;
      is associated with better outcome. The hypothesis is that this holds for COVID-19 and that&#xD;
      early antiviral treatment may prevent progression to the later phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to conduct a proof-of-principle placebo-controlled clinical trial of favipiravir&#xD;
      plus or minus nitazoxanide in health workers, their household members and IMSS beneficiaries.&#xD;
      Participants with or without symptomatic COVID-19 or tested positive will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive favipiravir plus nitazoxanide or favipiravir plus nitazoxanide placebo. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the difference in the amount of virus ('viral load') in the upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract after 5 days of therapy. Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization, major&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, pharmacokinetics, and impact of antiviral therapy on viral genetic&#xD;
      mutation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If favipiravir with nitazoxanide demonstrates important antiviral effects without significant&#xD;
      toxicity, there will be a strong case for a larger trial in people at high risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization or intensive care admission, for example older patients and/or those with&#xD;
      comorbidities and with early disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      FANTAZE is a Phase IIA randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional&#xD;
      trial.Participants will be adults who have developed the early symptoms of COVID-19 within&#xD;
      the first 5 days, or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset,&#xD;
      or not presenting symptoms but tested positive within the last 48 hours (date/time of test&#xD;
      must be within 48 hours of enrolment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive one of the following combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favipiravir + Nitazoxanide (both active); Favipiravir active + Nitazoxanide placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be enrolled and followed up for 28 days. A saliva sample for&#xD;
      virological analysis and safety blood samples will be collected at baseline, as well as a&#xD;
      diagnostic nose and throat swab, if the participant hasn't been tested for COVID-19 yet.&#xD;
      Following randomisation, participants will take trial medication for 7 days and during this&#xD;
      period will take a daily saliva sample and complete a symptoms diary including four daily&#xD;
      temperature measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have two follow-up visits at Day 7 and Day 14 where they will be assessed&#xD;
      and undergo blood tests for toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment (on Day 7 only) and&#xD;
      provide stool samples. Participants will have a telephone follow up three (3) weeks after&#xD;
      their last day of treatment (Day 7) and further information will be collected through a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

         10. Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or vaccine trial (co-enrolment&#xD;
             in observational studies is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Considering the importance of early treatment of COVID-19 to impact viral load,&#xD;
                  the absence of chronic liver/ kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the&#xD;
                  participant during pre- screening and Screening/Baseline visit. Safety blood&#xD;
                  samples will be collected at Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1) and test results&#xD;
                  will be examined as soon as they become available within 24 hours.&#xD;
