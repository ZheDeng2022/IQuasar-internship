  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective and observational clinical study for seeking out a better way to&#xD;
      predict the pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC)&#xD;
      based on the post-neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT data. This&#xD;
      study will help the surgeons to better formulate treatment regimens for gastric cancer in the&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the gradual development of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy in the clinic,&#xD;
      the pCR has become more and more accessible in the AGC. Preoperative accurate prediction of&#xD;
      pCR is of great clinical significance. The contrast-enhanced CT and 3.0T MRI were carried out&#xD;
      in patients within 1 week prior to commencing neoadjuvant treatment, as well as 1 week within&#xD;
      surgery after the completion of neoadjuvant treatment, respectively. Based on the information&#xD;
      extracted from the CT/MRI, the clinical completed response (cCR) and the clinical T staging&#xD;
      were compared with pCR, pathologic T staging. The pathologic results were considered as the&#xD;
      golden standard. With the ROC curve analysis, the diagnosis coincidence rate, sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity were assessed. The AI prediction model would be constructed and trained. The&#xD;
      depth convolution neural network based on contrast-enhanced CT and multi-modal MR&#xD;
      quantitative images which can automatically mine key images characterization, combined with&#xD;
      imaging features and histopathologic response, could further help to improve the prediction&#xD;
      of response of gastric cancer treated with systematic therapy. The abdominal&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT will focus on parameters: Local T Staging, nodal status, diameter,&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1. MRI T2 (1-3mm slice as per NS Radiology protocol and ESGAR&#xD;
      guideline) will focus on parameters: DWI &amp; ADC value (preferably on a single camera with&#xD;
      reproducible ADC value), Local T Staging, MRF involvement, EMVI, nodal status, MR volumetry,&#xD;
      and desmoplastic reaction.&#xD;
