  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the few most severe adverse effects&#xD;
      of chemotherapy, which often panic patients undergoing cancer treatment. Though acute&#xD;
      episodes of CINV are well controlled with pharmacologic agents, delayed CINV continues to&#xD;
      present a treatment challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant progress has been made over the past many years in discovering the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CINV. Primarily, three areas in the brain including central pattern&#xD;
      generator (CPG), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and area postrema (AP) are implicated in&#xD;
      generating emetic reflex in all types of CINV (anticipatory, acute and delayed). The latter&#xD;
      two areas NTS and AP are located at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle of brain which&#xD;
      lies outside of the blood brain barrier and hence are stimulated by agents present in either&#xD;
      blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, NTS and AP are rich in muscarinic,&#xD;
      dopamine, serotonin, neurokinin (NK1) and histamine receptors which are particularly&#xD;
      important in delayed CINV. Clinical trials of antimuscarinic, antidopaminergic,&#xD;
      antihistaminic drugs to prevent CINV have yielded inconclusive results except for olanzapine&#xD;
      which is known to act on multiple receptors in NTS/AP. Only NK1 antagonists (e.g. aprepitant)&#xD;
      which prevent substance P (SP) from binding to NK1 receptors have shown promising results and&#xD;
      are clinically used to prevent delayed CINV. SP is a tachykinin peptide encoded by TAC1&#xD;
      (tachykinin precursor 1) gene and is found abundant in both peripheral and CNS. NK1 receptors&#xD;
      in NTS/AP upon binding with SP will generate emetic reflex which will trigger delayed CINV.&#xD;
      Though the topical analgesic drug capsaicin is reported to interfere with endogenous SP, its&#xD;
      antiemetic potential in CINV has not been studied. This study intend to explore the&#xD;
      antiemetic potential of capsaicin which is known to interfere with SP release in the GIT and&#xD;
      CNS.&#xD;
