  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-traumatic abdominal pain is one of the most frequent complaints in Emergency Medicine.&#xD;
      Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has good performance in these situations. It is performed at&#xD;
      the patient's bedside with immediate results. It has been demonstrated that a&#xD;
      clinician-performed ultrasound was able to increase the diagnosis accuracy in patients with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain. However, the level of evidence of its diagnostic efficacy remains&#xD;
      controversial in particular in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigators thus aimed to investigate the efficacy of early POCUS on&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy in the context of of non-traumatic abdominal pain by a randomized control&#xD;
      study conducted in two emergency departments (ED). Secondary objectives will be comparison&#xD;
      between the two groups for time spent in the ED before diagnosis and disposition (discharged&#xD;
      home or hospitalization), prescription of complementary examinations and in particular,&#xD;
      radiologic exams.&#xD;

      The principal investigators thus aimed to investigate the efficacy of early POCUS on&#xD;

      study conducted in two ED. Secondary objectives will be comparison between the two groups for&#xD;
      time spent in the ED before diagnosis and disposition (discharged home or hospitalization),&#xD;
      prescription of complementary examinations and in particular, radiologic exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a randomized, controlled, open and interventional study. In the control group, the&#xD;
      diagnosis will be established after clinical examination and reception of biological analysis&#xD;
      results. In the interventional group, a POCUS performed in the ED by a local investigator&#xD;
      will be added and the diagnosis will be established after clinical exam, biological analysis&#xD;
      reception and POCUS. POCUS will only be performed by physicians who have completed a&#xD;
      validated training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, before study initiation, refresh sessions focused on acquisition techniques and&#xD;
      pathological findings will be organized in the two participating ED. Such refresher courses&#xD;
      were efficient to increase the overall confidence of operators&#xD;
