  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin aging is an irreversible, slow and progressive process, mainly influenced by age, but&#xD;
      also by external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, smoking, and alcohol, among others.&#xD;
      It is increasingly common to look for procedures that slow down this process by limiting or&#xD;
      hiding its effects on the skin and its appearance. Studies have shown benefits of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation for the skin, especially with the use of the red LED. However, there is a&#xD;
      high level of variability in the treatment parameters and frequency of application of the&#xD;
      photobiomodulation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the effects of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation with an LED mask (660nm, 6.4 mW / cm², 2.67 J / cm², 5.02 mW, 20 min) on&#xD;
      facial rejuvenation using two application frequencies: one group will receive LED application&#xD;
      on the face, through a mask, twice a week for 4 weeks and another group will receive&#xD;
      application 3 times a week for 4 weeks. A group with simulated photobiomodulation applied&#xD;
      twice a week for 4 weeks will be used as a control. After 1 and 3 months, the depth and&#xD;
      length of the wrinkles (evaluation of facial impressions by optical coherence tomography);&#xD;
      viscoelasticity of the skin; the evaluations of photographic images by experts (Wrinkle&#xD;
      Assessment Scale) and the level of satisfaction of the participants (FACE-Q) will be compared&#xD;
      with the data collected before the beginning of the study. All data will be analyzed&#xD;
      statistically according to their distribution, seeking a level of statistical significance of&#xD;
      0,05.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Pre and post treatment assessments will be made by three examiners (three plastic surgeons) who will not be aware of the group in which each patient will be allocated. Participants will not be aware of whether or not they have received the application of the FBM, as they will be using ocular sales. The person responsible for the application will position the equipment in the irradiation locations in all participants and will only activate the light when provided for in the specific experimental group. The characteristic sound of the device will be triggered by recording in the placebos groups for the PBM.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the scale of evaluation of wrinkles</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one month and 3 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of wrinkles will be carried out in a standardized way using the Wrinkle Assessment Scale. In a specific and reserved room, digitalized photographs of the face will be taken in the positions: front, 45 degrees right and left; right and left side with Canon digital camera model SX510 HS 12.1 MP, using white LED lighting, turquoise blue background, 50cm face distance, manual macro mode, standard that will be followed in the photographs of the 3rd month after treatment. The images will be distributed to the three plastic surgeons who will classify them according to the scale of wrinkles and photographic models pre-defined. Each evaluator will receive the same image of wrinkles, all at the end of the experiment. Each image should receive a score from 0 (no wrinkles) to 5 (very deep wrinkles) using the Wrinkle Assessment Scale. The data obtained will be grouped and the evolutionary comparison will be made according to the group of the patient under study.</description>

    <description>Before the treatments and after 1 and 3 months, molds of the frontal lines, right and left periorbital lines and of the right and left nasolabial groove with light condensation silicone (Zhermack, Badia Polesine, Italy) will be obtained. The material will be packed in acrylic plates and forwarded for analysis of optical coherence tomography. The negative silicone molds of the frontal wrinkles, bilateral periorbitals and nasogenian groove will be analyzed before treatment and after 3 months. Average surface roughness (RZ) will be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the cutaneous viscoelasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one month and 3 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the cutaneous viscoelasticity of the malar and periocular region, the Cutometer MPA 580 (CK Eletronic) equipment will be used. The equipment calculates non-invasive negative pressure to cutaneous viscoelasticity (the skin's ability to return to its normal state after stretching). The participant must be in the supine position and measurements will be taken at 4 points on the face: right and left periocular, right and left cheekbones.</description>

    <measure>Changes in satisfaction with facial appearance through FACE-Q</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one month and 3 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will answer the FACE-Q questionnaire (satisfaction with facial appearance, adapted for the Portuguese language). FACE-Q is a tool developed to measure the impact and effectiveness of facial aesthetic procedures from the patients' perspective.The results will be tabulated and evaluated according to the sum of the scores obtained in the 10 questions. The higher the score, the more satisfied.</description>
