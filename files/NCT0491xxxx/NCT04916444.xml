  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will apply 16 sessions of rTMS over 4 consecutive days for adult patients suffering from&#xD;
      cervical dystonia who receive botox on a regular basis. The TMS protocol will take place 9&#xD;
      weeks following their last botox injection. The primary outcome measure will be improvement&#xD;
      in cervical dystonia as measured by the TWSTRS scale. The secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      mood, cognition, gait, TMS measures, and high-density EEG measures.&#xD;

      This is a crossover study design in which patients will be randomized to active or sham&#xD;
      stimulation during session 1 (S1) and then crossover to the condition they were not&#xD;
      randomized to at first during session 2 (S1). Patients who are receiving botox for cervical&#xD;
      dystonia on a regular basis but having benefit from botox for 9 weeks or less will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. The total study protocol will take place over 24 weeks. During week&#xD;
      1, patients will have their regularly scheduled botox injections. During week 9, patients&#xD;
      will undergo either active or sham rTMS, as detailed below. They will have outcome measures&#xD;
      obtained at week 9 (S1:T0; baseline/pre-TMS), week 10 (S1:T1; post-TMS), and week 12 (S1:T2;&#xD;
      2 weeks post-TMS). At week 12, they will undrgo their regularly scheduled botox injections.&#xD;
      During week 21, patients will undergo either active or sham rTMS, whichever condition they&#xD;
      were not randomized into during the first session. They will have outcome measures obtained&#xD;
      at week 21 (S2:T0; baseline/pre-TMS), week 22 (S2:T1; post-TMS), and week 24 (S2:T2; 2 weeks&#xD;
      post-TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurostimulation protocol will be as follows: The dPMC target will be defined as 1 cm&#xD;
      medial and 2 cm anterior to the site of RMT acquisition. The rTMS protocol will be as&#xD;
      follows: each session will consist of 1-Hz rTMS over the dPMC for 30 minutes (1800 pulses) at&#xD;
      90% of the RMT. Patients will receive 4 sessions per day for 4 consecutive days with a&#xD;
      10-minute break between each session. Daily duration of the rTMS protocol, including breaks,&#xD;
      will last approximately 160 minutes&#xD;

    <masking_description>A sham coil will be used for sham rTMS. Both conditions will undergo the exact same study procedures except the sham coil will not deliver pulses; it will deliver a sound and tapping sensation meant to mimic the real rTMS coil, but no real stimulation will be provided in this condition. Patients and outcomes assessors will not be made aware of the condition that the participant is currently partaking in.</masking_description>
