      The aims of this study is to analyze the efficacy and safety of a passive immunotherapy&#xD;
      strategy using hyperimmune equine serum known as Anti-SARS-CoV-2 elaborated by the National&#xD;
      Institute for the Production of Biologicals (ANLIS-Malbrán) as an addition to the standard&#xD;
      therapeutic approach for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, in patients with severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection aged 18 to 80 years.&#xD;

      This is an adaptive phase II/III study that aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of a&#xD;
      immunobiological drug (Anti SARS-CoV-2) in the treatment of CoViD-19. This treatment is a&#xD;
      passive immunotherapy strategy developed as a purified F(ab')2 fraction of equine hyperimmune&#xD;
      serum (Anti-SARS-CoV-2). The equine serum was generated from antigenic stimulation with the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) purified protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of product (equine hyperimmune serum F(ab')2) has been widely used in our country&#xD;
      in the last 100 years with satisfactory results and an acceptable safety profile in the&#xD;
      treatment of accidents with poisonous animals such as anti-loxosceles, anti -latrodectus,&#xD;
      anti-scorpionic, and anti-phoneutria, anti-bothropic, anti-micrurus, and anti-crotalic sera,&#xD;
      all developed by the National Institute of Biological Production (ANLIS-Malbrán) and&#xD;
      distributed free of charge in public hospitals in the country .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, evaluates the effect and safety of this immunobiological treatment in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 that require hospitalization.&#xD;
