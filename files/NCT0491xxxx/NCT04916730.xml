  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators intend to measure the health impact of&#xD;
      time-restricted eating (TRE) in obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2), who&#xD;
      habitually eat for more than 14 hours every day. Patients will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      control group of behavioral nutritional counseling (standard of care) or the intervention&#xD;
      group of behavioral nutrition counseling with the addition of adopting a 10-hour eating&#xD;
      window for 12 weeks (TRE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current worldwide epidemic of obesity puts millions of people at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and while insulin&#xD;
      resistance has been a traditional focus of treatment, resistance to catecholamines in obesity&#xD;
      is likely a key factor hampering weight loss efforts. Catecholamines are key drivers of&#xD;
      lipolysis in adipose tissue and bind to beta-3 adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) on the surface of&#xD;
      adipocytes. Chronic inflammation is characteristic of obesity and suppresses the expression&#xD;
      of adipocyte ADRB3, increasing fat storage. This leaves adipose tissue metabolically&#xD;
      inflexible and in a state of energy preservation instead of burning fat to promote and&#xD;
      maintain weight loss. Thus, catecholamine resistance of adipose tissue is an important target&#xD;
      for lifestyle and therapeutic intervention. Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention that promotes weight loss and healthier metabolism by aligning dietary intake&#xD;
      with circadian rhythms. In this RCT, individuals with obesity will be enrolled in a 14-week&#xD;
      study of TRE and behavioral nutritional counseling vs behavioral nutritional counseling&#xD;
      alone. In the TRE group, dietary intake will be limited to a self-selected 10-hour window.&#xD;
      Information will be collected about adipose tissue catabolism (lipolysis) using samples&#xD;
      collected by adipose tissue biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.&#xD;
