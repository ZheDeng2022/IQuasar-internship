  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TT00420 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced/metastatic and surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with&#xD;
      1) FGFR 2 fusions who failed prior FGFR inhibitor treatment, 2) FGFR2 fusions who responded&#xD;
      on prior FGFR inhibitor treatment, 3) with other FGFR alterations, or 4) whose tumors do not&#xD;
      contain a detectable FGFR alteration.&#xD;
