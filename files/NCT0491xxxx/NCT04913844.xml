    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of ski sport on physical performance, pain,&#xD;
      and quality of life compared to sedentary individuals of similar age groups and to examine&#xD;
      the existence of gender-specific differences.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of skiing on physical performance, pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, and gender-specific differences. In this context, aerobic/anaerobic&#xD;
      performance, body balance, hand-grip strength, and back-leg-chest strength were evaluated in&#xD;
      male and female ski athletes and age- and sex-matched sedentary controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pain experiences, low back pain-related disability level, and quality of life of&#xD;
      all participants were questioned using SF 36, McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Oswestry Low&#xD;
      Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OLBPDQ), and VAS scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data thus collected were used to determine whether skiing had any effect on physical&#xD;
      performance and quality of life, as well as the possible impact of skiing on gender-specific&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the short form of which consists of 7 questions, is a self-reported scale that is widely used to measure physical activity level.Based on the guidelines, the IPAQ score is calculated as metabolic equivalents (METs) per minutes per week, and the IPAQ score below 3000 METs-min / week indicates a low-moderate physical activity level. Total IPAQ score &lt;3000 METs min / week was used to determine the sedentary control group as the inclusion criteria.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) step test is a test that can be used in athletes and non-athletes and correlates heart rate with cardiovascular fitness level. For this test, participants are asked to climb up and down a 12-inch step for 3 minutes (metronome set at 96 beats per minute). The heart rate measurement, which is continued for 1 minute immediately after the end of the test, is recorded as beats / min. The low heart rate measured in the step tests indicates a high level of cardiovascular fitness.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Jump Test (VJT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Vertical Jump Test (VJT) is an effective test used to indirectly evaluate the anaerobic performance of participants. In this test, the difference in centimeters is recorded between the maximum height attainable with the arm of the participant whose dominant side stands at the edge of the wall and the maximum height attained by jumping. The measurement is repeated 3 times with rest periods and the maximum value is recorded in cm</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flamingo Balance Test (FBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Flamingo Balance Test (FBT) is used to measure coordination of full body equilibrium. In the FBT, the number of errors that the participants made within 60 seconds on the flamingo balance board is recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand-Grip Strength (HGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Hand-grip strength (HGS) measurement is made with a hydraulic hand-grip dynamometer. HGS measurement is performed for the dominant hand when the elbow is close to the body, 90 degrees of flexion, and the wrist is in a neutral position. The measurement is repeated 3 times and the maximum value is recorded in kg. The dominant hand is determined by asking the participants with which hand they write.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Back-Leg-Chest Strength (BLCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BLC dynamometer is used to measure back-leg-chest strength (BLCS) in a single measurement. BLCS measurements are used as a suitable measure to characterize overall body strength. The measurement is repeated 3 times with rest periods and the maximum value is recorded in kg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a widely used and reliable scale for evaluating pain intensity. With VAS, the severity of pain experienced in various situations such as 1) rest, 2) activity, and 3) most severe pain experienced (MSPE) can be evaluated. In addition to this study, VAS-skiing was added only to the skiers group. Participants are asked to mark the level of pain they feel on a 10 cm straight line marked as &quot;no pain (0)&quot; at one end and &quot;unbearable pain (10)&quot; at the other end. The distance between the marked point and the starting point is measured and recorded in cm.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36) Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a valid and reliable self reported scale. SF-36 is generally used to evaluate health-related quality of life of individuals aged 14 and over. SF-36 has eight sub-dimensions such as physical functioning, role limitation by physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation by emotional problems, and mental health. Separate scores are calculated for each sub-dimension. The scores of the sub-dimensions range from 0 to 100. High scores on the scale indicate an increase in quality of life, and a low score indicates a decrease in quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OLBPDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>OLBPDQ is a valid and reliable self reported scale. OLBPDQ consists of 10 items that assess different aspects of the function, such as pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, traveling, and changing degree of pain. In the 6-point Likert type scale, the first expression is scored as '0' and the sixth expression as '5'. The total score is multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage. The increase in the ODI score (Range 0--100%) indicates the increase in the level of disability and the disability level is classified as follows: 0-20% (minimal disability), 21-40% (moderate disability), 41-60% (severe disability), 61 -80% (crippled), 81-100% (patients who are either bed-ridden or exaggerate their symptoms).</description>

        The sample of the study consists of a total of 68 participants between the ages of 18-25.&#xD;
        Licensed ski athletes in Turkey (17 male, 17 female), who have been active in sports for at&#xD;
        least the last 2 years, were included in the skiers group, and an age-matched non-athletic&#xD;
        person (17 male, 17 female) with no skiing experience was included in the control group.&#xD;
        The evaluations of the Skiers group were made at Erciyes Ski Center, and those of the&#xD;
