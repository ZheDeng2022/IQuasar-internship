      The goal of this study is to figure out the best doses for two oral antibiotics (called&#xD;
      amoxicillin and cephalexin) when they are used to treat infections in newborns and young&#xD;
      infants. In order to do this, the study plans to enroll two groups of young infants who are&#xD;
      admitted to the Children's Hospital Colorado. In the first group, infants already receiving&#xD;
      one of these two antibiotics will be enrolled. Over a few days in the hospital, up to 5 blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from each infant to measure how much of the drug is in their body&#xD;
      at different points in time after a dose. In the second group, infants who are already&#xD;
      receiving an IV antibiotic and who are eating normally or receiving oral medications will be&#xD;
      enrolled. These infants will receive one dose by mouth of either amoxicillin or cephalexin,&#xD;
      in addition to the IV antibiotic already being used to treat their infection. After the oral&#xD;
      antibiotic dose,blood will be drawn every few hours to measure how much of the drug is still&#xD;
      in their body. Blood levels of the antibiotics will be used to calculate how much and how&#xD;
      often both antibiotics would need to be given to treat a variety of infections that are&#xD;
      common in infants. The study will calculate if using a single blood level can predict whether&#xD;
      or not an infant might be at risk of the antibiotic not working well enough for them.&#xD;

      This proposal's objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of&#xD;
      enteral amoxicillin and cephalexin in neonates and young infants admitted to the hospital,&#xD;
      characterize age-stratified PK/PD parameters, and use these data to improve neonatal&#xD;
      antibiotic dosing strategies. This will involve developing and validating small-volume&#xD;
      sampling assays using dried blood spots. The study hypothesizes that there will be&#xD;
      significant inter-individual variation in amoxicillin and cephalexin PK/PD parameters in&#xD;
      neonates and that delayed absorption and elimination will lead to longer times to maximal&#xD;
      concentrations (Tmax) and prolonged half-lives (T1/2), most prominently in younger ages. In&#xD;
      addition, the study hypothesizes that high inter-individual variability will lead to&#xD;
      unacceptably low attainment of PK/PD efficacy targets using standard dosing regimens. To&#xD;
      address this low target attainment, the study will aim to incorporate therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring (TDM), using a serum trough concentration, into this PD model to create a method&#xD;
      that more accurately identifies patients likely to succeed with oral (PO) dosing. Preliminary&#xD;
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and intestinal transporter genotyping&#xD;
      will also provide a foundation for future studies on the most important factors that lead to&#xD;
      interpatient variability in PK parameters. The neonatal population has much to gain from an&#xD;
      improved understanding of age-specific PK/PD, as well as more frequent, and earlier,&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) to PO transition of antibiotics. The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Use a population PK approach to define PK parameters of enteral amoxicillin&#xD;
      and cephalexin in infants aged 0-60 days, stratified by age group. This will include building&#xD;
      preliminary physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for each drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate amoxicillin and cephalexin dried-blood spot assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Perform PD modeling 3A: Perform PD modeling (including Monte Carlo&#xD;
      simulation) to evaluate the expected PK/PD target attainment of amoxicillin and cephalexin by&#xD;
      age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3B: Identify a minimum trough threshold needed to establish 95% target attainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Correlate patient genotype for H(+)/peptide transporters (PEPT) 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      the organic-anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) family of transporters with&#xD;
      patient-specific PK parameters.&#xD;
