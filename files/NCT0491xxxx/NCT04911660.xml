      The aim of this study is to test the effect of a new drug on the composition of the urine in&#xD;
      kidney stone patients. This new drug (JardianceÂ®, substance: empagliflozin) is currently&#xD;
      approved in Switzerland for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Data from previous&#xD;
      studies with and without diabetes suggest that it may have a beneficial effect on the&#xD;
      composition of the urine and thereby reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.&#xD;

      Kidney stones - a global epidemic associated with obesity and diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney stones are a worldwide healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of ~18.8 % in&#xD;
      men and ~9.4 % in women in Western civilizations. Recurrence rates are high, up to 40 % and&#xD;
      75 % at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Hospitalizations, surgery and lost work time associated&#xD;
      with kidney stones cause enormous healthcare-related expenditures. Although kidney stone&#xD;
      disease is traditionally considered an isolated renal disorder, there is overwhelming&#xD;
      evidence that it is in fact a systemic disease. Arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, gouty diathesis, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
      low bone mass are much more prevalent in kidney stone formers than in non-stone formers. It&#xD;
      is currently unknown if stone disease is a cause of this co-morbidity per se or if it is a&#xD;
      consequence of the same underlying conditions that lead to these disorders and kidney stones.&#xD;
      Clearly, however, these co-morbidities contribute significantly to stone-related morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong, positive and independent association of Body Mass Index (BMI) with kidney stone&#xD;
      disease is well established. The magnitude of the increased risk is larger in women than in&#xD;
      men. In addition to BMI, significant weight gain is also associated with a greater risk of&#xD;
      developing symptomatic kidney stone disease in the future. In recent decades, the prevalence&#xD;
      of both kidney stone disease and obesity increased significantly, irrespective of age, sex&#xD;
      and race. In large cross-sectional analyses, the prevalence of both symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic kidney stones increased proportionally with the number of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      features present. Both calcium and uric acid stones are associated with obesity, but the&#xD;
      ratio of calcium stones to uric acid stones is lower in obese compared to non-obese stone&#xD;
      formers, suggesting a disproportionate increase of uric acid stone disease in obesity.&#xD;
      Absolute urinary excretion rates of stone formation promoters (calcium, phosphate, oxalate&#xD;
      and uric acid) as well as urinary supersaturation ratios for calcium oxalate and uric acid&#xD;
      are increased in obese individuals. In addition, there is a well documented negative&#xD;
      association of BMI with urinary pH in both stone formers and non-stone formers, and low&#xD;
      urinary pH is the main driver of uric acid stone formation. The latter may be explained by&#xD;
      insulin resistance which affects the generation of renal ammonium by direct and indirect&#xD;
      mechanisms. In contrast to urinary pH, urinary calcium excretion (the main driver for calcium&#xD;
      stone formation) is not independently associated with BMI but rather due to other factors&#xD;
      known to affect urinary calcium excretion (e.g. secondary to increased sodium and animal&#xD;
      protein intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supersaturation - driver of kidney stone formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supersaturation, the presence of a material in solution at a concentration above its own&#xD;
      solubility, is the driving force for crystallization and therefore kidney stone formation.&#xD;
      Relevant supersaturations for kidney stones disease in humans include calcium oxalate,&#xD;
      brushite (calcium phosphate) and uric acid. At a supersaturation &lt;1, crystals dissolve, at a&#xD;
      supersaturation &gt;1, crystals form. Urinary supersaturations calculated from ambulatory 24 h&#xD;
      urine collections accurately reflect the long-term average supersaturation values in the&#xD;
      urine and are highly correlated with the kidney stone composition encountered in the&#xD;
      individual kidney stone former. Treatments that reduced stone events in Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trials (RCTs) are highly correlated with reductions in urinary supersaturations. A recent&#xD;
      analysis of a large 5-year kidney stone RCT revealed that as early as 1 week after&#xD;
      randomization, every 10 % reduction of urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation from baseline&#xD;
      was associated with an 8 % reduction in the risk of stone recurrence during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors - a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitors of the sodium/glucose co-transporter isoform 2 (SLC5A2 or SGLT2) belong to a new&#xD;
      class of oral hypoglycemic drugs. SGLT2 resides in the brush border membrane of proximal&#xD;
      tubular cells in the kidney and reabsorbs ~90 % of glucose filtered at the glomerulus. SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors block the physiological glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule from the&#xD;
      glomerular filtrate, thereby inducing significant glucosuria accompanied by a reduction of&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin, the clinically best characterized SGLT2 inhibitor to&#xD;
      date, decreases cardiovascular mortality, death from any cause, hospitalizations for heart&#xD;
      failure, decline of GFR and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Some of these findings were also observed with two other SGLT2 inhibitors&#xD;
      canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in large outcome trials. Due to their unique mode of action,&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors induce weight loss, decrease blood pressure and increase urinary volume, the&#xD;
      latter being a very effective measure to reduce stone recurrence. Driven by promising results&#xD;
      in RCTs, SGLT2 inhibitors are currently widely tested in non-diabetics e.g. for the treatment&#xD;
      of heart failure, non-diabetic kidney disease, arterial hypertension or obesity&#xD;
      (www.clinicaltrials.gov). The pleiotropic beneficial effects make SGLT2 inhibitors also a&#xD;
      very attractive class of drugs for kidney stone formers, which often suffer concomitantly&#xD;
      from arterial hypertension, CKD, obesity and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone fractures, mineral metabolism and kidney stone events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy or add-on therapy to various glucose-lowering&#xD;
      agents is generally well tolerated. An increased incidence of genital infections and&#xD;
      (although rare) euglycemic ketoacidosis are known side effects of this new class of&#xD;
      medications. The latter is mainly observed in type I diabetics and less frequently in type II&#xD;
      diabetics. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in individuals&#xD;
      without diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the large canagliflozin outcome study CANVAS, an increased incidence of lower extremity&#xD;
      amputations was noted. This adverse effect has not been reported with other SGLT2 inhibitors.&#xD;
      In addition, both canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of bone fractures compared to placebo. In a short term study in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      canagliflozin increased serum phosphate, plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and&#xD;
      plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreased the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Similar&#xD;
      results were obtained in individuals with diabetes treated with dapagliflozin. In contrast,&#xD;
      pooled analyses of phase I, II and III trials of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with&#xD;
      empagliflozin encompassing &gt; 15'000 patient-years of exposure did not reveal an increased&#xD;
      rate of bone fractures, alterations of blood electrolytes, PTH, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D or bone&#xD;
      turnover markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While blood electrolyte and mineral metabolism parameters in patients treated with SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors have been well studied in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes, there is&#xD;
      a lack of data on the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on urinary parameters, especially on&#xD;
      parameters that influence the kidney stone formation rate. Also, to our knowledge, no studies&#xD;
      have been conducted thus far with SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney stone formers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, in pooled analyses of phase I, II and III trials, the rate of kidney stone&#xD;
      events tended to be 30-50 % lower in patients treated with 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin versus&#xD;
      placebo. However, detailed analyses for kidney stone events in empagliflozin outcome trials&#xD;
      have not been reported. Reported stone event rates in these pooled empagliflozin trials (0.5&#xD;
      - 1/100 person years) are similar to what has been observed in individuals with diabetes in&#xD;
      three large prospective US cohorts (Nurses' Health Study I, the Nurses' Health Study II and&#xD;
      the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. In contrast, stone event rates are considerably (10&#xD;
      - 100-fold) higher in patients with a history of kidney stone disease. RCTs testing dietary&#xD;
      or pharmacologic measures for recurrence prevention typically included patients with stone&#xD;
      event rates between 20 and 200 events/100 person-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers.&#xD;
      Kidney stone formers are likely to profit from the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibition. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease the stone formation rate. Based&#xD;
      on the overall experience thus far, empagliflozin seems to have by far the most favorable&#xD;
      side effect profile. Clearly, there is a dire need for clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors&#xD;
      in kidney stone formers.&#xD;
