  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates cost and effect of inpatient versus outpatient treatment of dysthymia, as&#xD;
      well as investigates the processes through which psychotherapy works in treating dysthymia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inpatient treatment allows a more intensive treatment and allows the patient to be in a&#xD;
      context where it is possible to focus on the processes in therapy with minimal interruption.&#xD;
      Outpatient treatment is much less intensive but allows the treatment process to unfold in the&#xD;
      context where the patient is experiencing the problems that brought them to therapy. It is&#xD;
      not clear which of the contexts will be more effective in alleviating symptoms of dysthymia.&#xD;
      Further, as dysthymia is a very costly disease for society it is of interest to know if the&#xD;
      two treatments are cost-effective, and which one is the most cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great paucity on dysthymia research ha left the psychotherapy field without an&#xD;
      understanding of the processes through which dysthymia is changed. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the change process through frequent assessments of common factors, psychological&#xD;
      processes, symptoms, heart rate variability and cognitive attention bias.&#xD;
