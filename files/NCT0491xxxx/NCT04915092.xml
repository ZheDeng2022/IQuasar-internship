    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the app in terms of changing&#xD;
      lifestyles both related to nutrition and physical activity. The study is also aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the usability and the degree of acceptance of the app among parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be assessed in terms of the change in the consumption of sugary&#xD;
      drinks and high-calorie food and in terms of time spent in front of a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the evaluation of BMI (percentile and z-score) and waist&#xD;
      circumference and the evaluation of the usability of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a randomized control trial. Both parents and children are&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family paediatricians during the health balance of 3 or 5 years old (children between 3&#xD;
           and 6.5 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sport medicine during the visits for sport ability (children between 7 and 11 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology of the Santa Maria Hospital during routine&#xD;
           visits (children between 5 and 11 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study is presented to families, few clinical information are collected on the&#xD;
      electronic platform designed for enrollment and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child weight and height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
      More information about children and parents are collected (through questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The families (both treatment and control ) are contacted after 12 month and after 24 months&#xD;
      from the recruitment to answer to a questionnaire on lifestyle habits (food and physical&#xD;
      activity) of the child and app utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit also child weight, height and waist circumference will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group The app is explained and installed during the recruitment to the family in&#xD;
      the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some families in this group will be selected to take part to the qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Every months during the first year of study a newsletter is sent only to the&#xD;
      members of the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a highly prevalent condition and together with the behaviours associated&#xD;
      with it, such as improper diet and physical inactivity, it generates a high burden of disease&#xD;
      in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, it is increasing the use of mobile devices in support of health prevention&#xD;
      and promotion strategies. In a primary care setting these new technologies offer the&#xD;
      opportunity to open a two-way communication channel between parents and institutions and can&#xD;
      help by adapting the intervention and framing the message according to the needs of each&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2010, the Reggio Emilia AUSL has started a research and interventions program aimed at&#xD;
      preventing childhood obesity. The program has adopted a multilevel and multi-setting strategy&#xD;
      for primary prevention (BMInforma Program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2017, together with the University of Bologna and the regional company Lepida2000, the&#xD;
      Local Health Authority is part of the Co-creation of Service Innovation in Europe project&#xD;
      (CoSIE Project), a project funded by the European Union with a Horizon 2020 call coordinated&#xD;
      by the University of Turku, Finland. The CoSIE project promotes the co-creation of public&#xD;
      services through the involvement of citizens and other interested parties in the definition&#xD;
      of objectives and delivery methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is divided into nine pilot projects and the Italian pilot project, carried out in&#xD;
      the province of Reggio Emilia, is part of the AUSL program for the prevention of childhood&#xD;
      obesity. The aim of the pilot project is to create a network between the services involved in&#xD;
      the prevention and treatment of obesity and, at the same time, it aims to create an app that&#xD;
      can help promote a healthy lifestyle. The app was designed and created with a co-creation&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the app in terms of changing&#xD;
      lifestyles both related to nutrition and physical activity. Furthermore,an aim of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the usability and the degree of acceptance of the app among parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be assessed in terms of the change in the consumption of sugary&#xD;
      drinks and high-calorie food and in terms of time spent in front of a screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the evaluation of BMI (percentile and z-score) and waist&#xD;
      circumference and the evaluation of the usability of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both parents and children are recruited. The recruitment is done by some members of the CoSIE&#xD;
      project Consulting Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family paediatricians during the health balance of 3 or 5 years old (children between 3&#xD;
           and 6.5 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sport medicine during the visits for sport ability (children between 7 and 11 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology of the Santa Maria Hospital during routine&#xD;
           visits (children between 5 and 11 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study is presented to families, few clinical information are collected on the&#xD;
      electronic platform designed for enrollment and randomization:&#xD;
