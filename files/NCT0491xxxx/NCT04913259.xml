    <textblock>
      Monocentric, prospective cohort pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a online remote&#xD;
      monitoring tool during the care of patients over 65 years of age being medically treated for&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will have to answer the remote monitoring questionnaires on a mobile phone,&#xD;
      tablet or computer via the Internet. Responses will be sent to the referring oncologist and&#xD;
      team (Coordinating Nurse). For each question, predetermined response thresholds have been&#xD;
      established, triggering &quot;orange&quot; (to watch) or &quot;red&quot; alerts (intervention by the healthcare&#xD;
      team required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, patient will continue standard follow-up with their referring oncologist and, if&#xD;
      necessary (age ≥ 70 years and G8 score ≤ 14), will benefit from an onco-geriatric evaluation&#xD;
      at inclusion then at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 6 months of remote monitoring, the Coordinating Nurse will inform the patient&#xD;
      of the end of study participation. Within one month of the end of the remote monitoring, the&#xD;
      nurse will also remove the installation of the application and will organize the return of&#xD;
      the equipment (tablet and/or 4G LTE key (4th Generation Long Term Evaluation)) if these were&#xD;
      lent for the study.&#xD;

    <description>Toxicities and symptoms will be assessed weekly using 20 questions selected and adapted from the French version of the CTCAE PRO (Basch et al., 2014; National Cancer Institute, 2017). For each question, predetermined response thresholds have been established, triggering &quot;orange&quot; (to watch) or &quot;red&quot; alerts (intervention by the healthcare team required). The number of red alerts will be collected for each patient.</description>

    <description>Patient compliance with oral treatment will be assessed on a monthly basis during the treatment from the self-questionnaire MMAS-4 (Morisky et al., 1986) which has a range from 0 to 4. A high compliant score is defined by a score of 0, a medium compliance score (score=1 or 2) and a low compliance score (score=3 or 4).</description>
