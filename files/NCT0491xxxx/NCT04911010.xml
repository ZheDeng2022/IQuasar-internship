      Effectiveness of trauma therapy using prolonged exposure for the treatment of post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with comorbid psychotic disorder&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and goals: Patients with psychotic disorders often report traumatizing experiences&#xD;
      in their biography and show symptoms of a trauma-related disorder. It is assumed that around&#xD;
      30 percent of patients with a psychotic disorder also meet the criteria for PTSD. For the&#xD;
      vast majority of patients, psychosis is the focus of mostly pharmacological treatment, while&#xD;
      PTSD is not part of the therapy. In a first randomized controlled study, van den Berg's Dutch&#xD;
      working group was able to show that psychosis patients with comorbid PTSD who were given a&#xD;
      classic trauma exposure procedure showed a high response to PTSD symptoms (van den Berg et&#xD;
      al., 2015). It is also important that in this study the trauma exposure did not lead to an&#xD;
      increase in psychotic symptoms or undesirable side effects (e.g. suicidality). In order to&#xD;
      examine the question of the generalizability of the effects, a randomized controlled study in&#xD;
      the German-speaking health care system is necessary. In the following efficacy study in which&#xD;
      psychosis patients with PTSD are treated using prolonged exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: It is&#xD;
      a multicenter, controlled, prospective, randomized study (RCT). It is investigated whether&#xD;
      trauma therapy reduces PTSD and psychosis symptoms compared to the Treatment-As-Usual Waiting&#xD;
      Group (TAU). The primary endpoint is the severity of the PTSD symptoms between the baseline&#xD;
      measurement and the 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints are subjective PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      paranoia, hallucinations, and wellbeing.&#xD;

    <description>The severity of the PTSD symptoms associated distress. The distress factor score of the CAPS is the primary outcome as this is what has been prioritized by patients and is relevant to functioning. Confirmatory analysis will be conducted based on the intent-to-treat population (ITT), defined on the basis of the ITT principle. The aim is to show that the intervention group is superior to the control meaning that the mean score at 6 months adjusted for the baseline value is lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Lower scores indicate less distress.</description>

    <description>In the intervention condition, patients are treated with prolonged exposure in 16 hours of individual therapy immediately after the baseline measurement. The 16 individual therapeutic sessions take place 1 to 2 sessions per week over a period of 7 to 16 weeks. The individual therapeutic sessions are recorded on video with camera focus on the therapist. Parts of the prolonged exposure procedure (reliving the traumatic memory) are recorded on tape (via the patient's personal smartphone) so that the patient can listen to the recording as homework at home. The patients then take part in a post-treatment study diagnosis (T1).</description>
