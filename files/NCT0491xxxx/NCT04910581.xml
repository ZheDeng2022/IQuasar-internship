  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wilson disease is a hereditary hepatic and neurological disease associated with copper&#xD;
      accumulation. Neurological symptoms are of extra-pyramidal, cerebellar and dystonic origin.&#xD;
      Dysarthria is one of the debilitating symptoms of Wilson disease poorly responsive to&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment. The most common form is a dystonic hyperkinetic Dysarthria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of dystonia is still not elucidated. Motor cortex hyperexcitability has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in various forms of dystonia. Furthermore, rTMS inhibitory applied over motor&#xD;
      cortex has been shown to transitory reduce dystonic symptoms in various forms of dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we investigate the effect of a single 1Hz 20-minutes inhibitory rTMS&#xD;
      session applied over the motor laryngeal cortex on dyasarthria is the main kinetic dysarthria&#xD;
      has been shown to be associated with inhibition of laryngeal motor cortex in Parkinson&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A consecutive series of Wilson disease patients with dystonic hyperkinetic dysarthria will be&#xD;
      prospectively recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 3 days apart to two rTMS sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS procedures will be performed with a figure of eight coiled. A single 20-minutes 1 Hz&#xD;
      biphasic stimulation (1200 pulses) session will be applied over the laryngeal motor cortex. A&#xD;
      brain imaging positioning device will be used during all the procedure A second stimulation&#xD;
      session will be performed 3 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be centrally randomized to receive first either the active stimulation (80% of&#xD;
      the resting motor threshold) or the sham stimulation (using a visually identical coil to&#xD;
      reproduce the click sound and the scalp sensation of the active coil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A TMS evaluation of cortical silent period over the left motor cortex will be performed&#xD;
      before the first rTMS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and immediately after each stimulation (active or sham) patient will received an&#xD;
      clinical evaluation including Clinical Assessment Battery for Dysarthria intelligibility&#xD;
      score, &quot;A&quot; phonation time, diadococinesia , bucco-linguo-facial motricity score and UWDRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard 20-minutes EEG will be performed before the first rTMS session and immediately&#xD;
      after the second rTMS session.&#xD;
