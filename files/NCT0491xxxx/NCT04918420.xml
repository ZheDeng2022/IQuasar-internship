    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess the effectiveness and safety of the flow&#xD;
      diverter(Ton-bridgeMT) by collecting data obtained by subjects who receive endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm designed trail carried out in 7 research&#xD;
      centers over China. The products used by 141 subjects are The Flow Diverter designed by&#xD;
      Ton-bridgeMT, an intracranial implant designed to be placed in a parent artery so as to&#xD;
      divert blood flow away from an aneurysm.&#xD;
