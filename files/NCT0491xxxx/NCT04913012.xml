      This study wants to investigate whether exercise booster sessions applied in the follow-up&#xD;
      period after an exercise intervention can increase the sustainability of exercise induced&#xD;
      effects in persons with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, multi-site, controlled trial. Participants will from the&#xD;
      beginning be allocated to either aerobic training group, resistance training group or control&#xD;
      group. After a 12 week exercise intervention, the exercise groups will be additionally&#xD;
      randomized to receive either exercise booster sessions + standard care or just standard care&#xD;
      in the 40 week follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that exercise booster sessions can increase the sustainability of exercise&#xD;
      induced effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is a chronic, autoimmune, and inflammatory disease of the central nervous system,&#xD;
      exemplified through marked demyelination and axonal loss. As a result, symptoms such as&#xD;
      fatigue, numbness, weakness, depression, walking difficulties and spasticity frequently&#xD;
      appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no cure for MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. These&#xD;
      can potentially slow the progression of disabilities and reduce the overall disease burden.&#xD;
      This is of great interest from both an individual perspective, where increased disability is&#xD;
      associated with a lowered health-related quality of life, and from a societal perspective,&#xD;
      where increased disability is associated with larger costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decades exercise has been shown to be safe, tolerable and beneficial in persons&#xD;
      with MS (PwMS). Hence, it is known to be an effective way of treating symptoms such as&#xD;
      fatigue7, muscle weakness, walking impairments and depression. As with other chronic&#xD;
      diseases, exercise for PwMS has been proposed as &quot;medicine&quot;. However, in order to benefit&#xD;
      from the positive effects of any kind of treatment (i.e. most medical drugs or exercise) one&#xD;
      has to adhere to the prescriptions of the treatment (i.e. dose and timing). Despite all the&#xD;
      potential benefits of exercise therapy for PwMS, one of the major challenges relate to&#xD;
      long-term maintenance of exercise efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emerging concept that may hold the potential to increase the sustainability of exercise&#xD;
      therapy is supervised &quot;exercise booster sessions&quot; (i.e. training sessions provided regularly&#xD;
      throughout the follow-up period, to sustain effects of the preceding exercise intervention).&#xD;
      These can be placed regularly during the follow-up period, where patients attend a number of&#xD;
      supervised high-intensity exercise sessions, hereby trying to boost the effects of the&#xD;
      preceding exercise intervention. Furthermore, exercise booster sessions can potentially&#xD;
      motivate the patient to keep exercising throughout the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal way of utilizing this concept is still not fully understood, and has not&#xD;
      yet been tried in neurological patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main purpose of the present study is to investigate how exercise booster&#xD;
      sessions combined with usual care performed over a period of 40 weeks affects the&#xD;
      sustainability of effects on functional capacity induced by a 12-week exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants receiving exercise booster sessions + usual care during&#xD;
      follow up will have a better functional capacity at follow up, than the participants&#xD;
      receiving usual care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, multi-site, controlled trial. Participants will from the&#xD;
      beginning be allocated to either aerobic training group, resistance training group or control&#xD;
      group. After a 12 week exercise intervention, the exercise groups will be additionally&#xD;
      randomized to receive either exercise booster sessions + standard care or just standard care&#xD;
      in the 40 week follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12 week exercise intervention will consist of 2-3 weekly supervised exercise sessions.&#xD;
      The training will be planned by exercise physiologists and performed in a progressive manner.&#xD;
      To allow handling of a large number of participants, who is also geographically spread, the&#xD;
      exercise intervention will be locally anchored, but at the same time supervised by student&#xD;
      employees and controlled by internet- and telephonic communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to exercise booster sessions will receive two sessions every fifth&#xD;
      week during the follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on the primary purpose of the study which is to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of frequently applied exercise booster sessions. To set the estimated number of&#xD;
      participants, a two-sample two-sided power calculation has been conducted. Based on previous&#xD;
      studies, a mean difference on functional capacity between the group receiving usual care and&#xD;
      the group receiving exercise booster sessions + usual care, regardless of exercise&#xD;
      intervention, is expected to be 6% with a standard deviation (SD) of ±10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance was set as 5% and a statistical power of 80%. According to the&#xD;
      power calculation each group shall contain 60 participants (expected drop-out rate of 30 % is&#xD;
      included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these studies can have great clinical implications in many ways. If we find&#xD;
      that by adding exercise booster sessions in a follow up period, one can maintain, or maybe&#xD;
      even improve, functional capacity over a long period, this would be a novel finding making&#xD;
      ground for new rehabilitation opportunities&#xD;
