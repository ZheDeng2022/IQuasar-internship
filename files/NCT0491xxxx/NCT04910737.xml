  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was to evaluate the indications, efficiency and safety of the extended posterior&#xD;
      circumferential decompression technique for the treatment of thoracic ossification of&#xD;
      posterior longitudinal ligament (TOPLL) with dura adhesions or ossification.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical characteristics of patients with TOPLL combined with dura adhesions who&#xD;
      underwent extended circumferential decompression in our hospital were retrospectively&#xD;
      investigated. TOPLL adhered with dura matter or dura ossification were detected&#xD;
      intraoperatively in all the cases. Imaging evaluation included the ossification-kyphosis&#xD;
      angle and the fixed-segment kyphosis angle. A modified Japanese Orthopedic Association Score&#xD;
      (JOA score) was applied for the evaluation of clinical outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>extended posterior circumferential decompressive surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>After the pedicle screws were implanted, laminectomy was performed. Kyphotic correction was done through a temporary rod to reduce the tension of spinal cord. The posterior 1/3 of the vertebral body was resected using a high-speed drill, preserving the anterior wall of the spinal canal to protect the cord from disturbance. The dissection of adhesion at the anterior side of spinal cord was to be done through a posterolateral direction. The region of posterior resection was expanded, including bilateral residual articular processes, transverse processes and pedicles. Slightly press down the ossified lesion, and detach it from the dura mater (perform a sharp dissection if necessary) followed by completely removal. If cerebrospinal fluid leakage was encountered during the process, autologous fat, fascia or gelatin sponge can be applied locally for packaging.</description>
