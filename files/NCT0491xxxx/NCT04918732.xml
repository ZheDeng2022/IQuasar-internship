  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is with 25% the most prevalent liver disorder in&#xD;
      Western society and is associated with overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and increased risk of cancer&#xD;
      development. NAFLD is defined by a hepatic fat accumulation of more than 5% in the absence of&#xD;
      classical causes of steatogenesis (e.g. alcohol and steatogenic drugs). It represents a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of clinical entities from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to advanced liver disease&#xD;
      with hepatic failure. Most of the patients have simple steatosis, however in about 15-30%&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) develops, which leads to an overall increase in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to the progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). Patients with NAFLD have no or few, mainly aspecific symptoms; and generally&#xD;
      there is a silent progression of simple steatosis to NASH and in the end liver-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Despite the clinical importance and the potential impact on&#xD;
      healthcare resources, there is a striking lack of awareness on all levels of NAFLD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, little to know data are available concerning the quality of life of NAFLD&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, the majority of NAFLD patients are currently not detected due to the&#xD;
      lack of non-invasive methods to diagnose NAFLD. Most of these patients, as a first contact in&#xD;
      the healthcare system, will be found in the outpatient clinic of the general practitioner&#xD;
      (GP). To date, it is not clear what the burden is of NAFLD and related diseases in at risk&#xD;
      subjects in primary care. Therefore, identification of NAFLD patients in this cohort will&#xD;
      give information on the prevalence in the group of uncomplicated overweight and obesity and&#xD;
      those with concomitant cardiometabolic diseases. By early detecting these patients at risk to&#xD;
      develop progressive liver diseases and extrahepatic manifestations, it will be possible to&#xD;
      intervene and improve health.&#xD;
