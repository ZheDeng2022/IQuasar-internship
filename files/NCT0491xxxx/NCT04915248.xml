      It is an open-label, multicenter, phase II, single arm trial to Evaluate Activity and Safety&#xD;
      of Daratumumab in combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients about 28 patients&#xD;
      with Relapsed or Refractory Plasmablastic lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II, single arm trial. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      over 18 months in 19 FIL centers and it is expected that a total of 28 patients will start&#xD;
      treatment. Analysis of the primary endpoint of the study is planned approximately after 12&#xD;
      months from the enrollment of the last patient, regardless of the response to protocol&#xD;
      treatment of this patient. The total duration of the study is 30 months (~2.5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled based on the local diagnosis and the local assessment of CD38&#xD;
      expression ≥ 5%. The screening phase of the study includes baseline assessments according to&#xD;
      local practice and those required by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples coming from the most recent biopsy, and if available also those used for the first&#xD;
      diagnosis, are to be collected and sent afterwards, upon request of the FIL Offices, to one&#xD;
      of the three FIL designed central laboratories. Central diagnosis review and CD38 assessment&#xD;
      will be performed during or at the end of the study conductance; there's no need to wait for&#xD;
      central results to start protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol treatment consists of an induction phase planning one course (cycle 1) of&#xD;
      daratumumab sc as single agent followed by 8 courses (cycles 2-9) of daratumumab sc in&#xD;
      combination with bortezomib sc and dexamethasone (DVd regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving at least a SD after induction will be addressed to the maintenance phase,&#xD;
      planning a maximum of 6 cycles (cycles 10-15) of daratumumab sc as single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction cycles will be administered every 21 days, while maintenance cycles will be&#xD;
      administered every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with DVd or daratumumab single agent will be discontinued before completion of&#xD;
      planned cycles in case of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent&#xD;
      and/or the investigator determines that further therapy is not in the patient best interest&#xD;
      (e.g., due to non-compliance, toxicity, etc.). Adverse events according to CTCAE will be&#xD;
      monitored from the first dose of induction treatment, throughout maintenance phase and for 30&#xD;
      days after the last dose of protocol treatment with the study drug or 30 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of drug in case of early discontinuation from any cause.&#xD;

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use effective&#xD;
             contraception if sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of&#xD;
             the informed consent form and 7 months (for women) o 4 months (for men) after last&#xD;
             administration of bortezomib or 6 months after last daratumumab dose, regardless of&#xD;
             sex. A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e., fertile, following&#xD;

             salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no&#xD;
             menses for continuous 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement&#xD;
             therapy. The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise the patient&#xD;
             how to achieve highly effective birth control method (failure rate of less than 1%)&#xD;
             e.g., intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),&#xD;
             bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, and sexual abstinence. The use of&#xD;
             condoms by male patients is required unless the female partner is permanently sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
             WOCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the study doctor prior to&#xD;
             starting study therapy and must agree to undergo monthly pregnancy testing during the&#xD;
             course of the study and after end of study therapy if clinically indicated. This&#xD;
             applies even if the subject practices complete abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject understands and voluntarily signs and dates an informed consent form approved&#xD;
