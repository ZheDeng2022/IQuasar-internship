    <description>The first arm uses mindful walking through a 2km forest trail in Singapore. All Interventional and Control arms will conduct their walk between 8 am to 11 am for five occasions weekly. At the T1, participants will attend a Zoom orientation session to familiarize themselves with the route. During this session, participants will need to answer the self-report questionnaire and provide the first saliva sample for the baseline measurement. In T2, a pre-intervention and post-intervention saliva sample will be taken before the walk. This will follow by T3 the following week. At T4, participants will attend a 60 mins reflection session and answer the self-report questionnaire. On T5 and T6, the participants will continue with the therapeutic rainforest mindfulness walk. On T7, a pre-intervention and post-intervention saliva sample will be taken. On T8, participants will attend a 60 mins reflection session and answer the self-report questionnaire.</description>
