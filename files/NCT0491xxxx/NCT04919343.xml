  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to assess whether video materials from the BBC Tiny Happy People&#xD;
      (THP) campaign are effective in terms of improving the language skills of socioeconomically&#xD;
      disadvantaged children before they start school. This project will also look at how useable&#xD;
      the service is for parents in terms of acceptability, effects on self-efficacy and&#xD;
      implementation of advice.&#xD;

      The current study will evaluate BBC Education's Tiny Happy People initiative&#xD;
      (https://www.bbc.co.uk/tiny-happy-people) which seeks to reduce the impact of social and&#xD;
      economic disadvantage on children's language skills before they arrive at primary school. BBC&#xD;
      Education have created videos for parents and other caregivers with information about child&#xD;
      development, tips and activities as well as other content of interest. The aim of the&#xD;
      evaluation is to find out how parents feel about the materials and whether the videos promote&#xD;
      a) caregiver confidence at 12, 18 and 24 months, b) caregiver-infant interaction at 12, 18&#xD;
      and 24 months and c) child language at 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome is expressive&#xD;
      vocabulary size at 18 months. Families with 4- to 9-month-old infants who would like to take&#xD;
      part will be randomly allocated either to a language support group or a physical health&#xD;
      active control group and sent short, age-appropriate advice videos by text message three&#xD;
      times a month until their children are 18 months old (with follow up videos for children&#xD;
      until the age of 2 years where possible given study time limits).&#xD;

    <description>Families will be invited to join a live, online recording session during a mealtime, where a research assistant will live code parent-child interactions for ~10 minutes. Parents willing and able to upload their own video of a meal time will have the option to do so. All video coding will be conducted using the PaRRis rating scale. Only families who are willing and able to share videos or take parent in a live online recording will take part in this part of the evaluation.</description>

    <time_frame>Measures will be collected within 2 months of the child turning 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will be sent a self-efficacy questionnaire to complete in the format of a google form, via SMS text message at each time point. Questions will focus on how parents feel about their parenting in general and supporting their child's language development and physical health.</description>

    <description>Parents will be sent regular text messages with links to videos with information about supporting child language or physical health. We will take % of links clicked as a fidelity measure. We will check whether parents were more likely to click though to these links in one condition or the other and run a Complier Average Causal Effect analysis.</description>

    <description>Parents will be sent links each month directing them to BBC Tiny Happy People content via SMS text message using the secure service FireText. This content will be aimed at supporting language development. Parents will be asked to watch the video content and incorporate it into their parenting practices. The intervention will start when infants are aged 4-9 months and conclude when they are 18 months with a follow up to 24 months where time permits.</description>
