  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a complex and inevitable biological process that is associated with numerous chronic&#xD;
      health conditions and the development and progression of diseases. It is manifested partly by&#xD;
      a progressive decline in fitness and an increase in death. The key to healthy aging is a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle, including eating a variety of healthy foods and frequently participating&#xD;
      in physical activities. Supplements made from widely consumed plant products have the&#xD;
      potential for promoting healthy aging. However, more human data is required to substantiate&#xD;
      this potential. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine examining whether older&#xD;
      adults taking a fruit/vegetable supplement for 6 weeks will have biochemical values of stool,&#xD;
      blood, and urine similar to those of younger adults. The fruit/vegetable supplement contains&#xD;
      a variety of vitamins and minerals and other nutrients that have been known to be beneficial&#xD;
      to human health and many Americans may consume inadequate amounts in their daily diet. In&#xD;
      order for us to understand how these nutrients may benefit health, we are interested in&#xD;
      determining whether they can modify biochemical values of blood that occur in the body after&#xD;
      taking the supplement for 6 weeks. We aim to have 40 older subjects and 20 younger subjects&#xD;
      complete the trial. The enrolled subjects will consume prepackaged study meals for&#xD;
      approximately 8 weeks and provide blood samples. The study meals will comprise foods most&#xD;
      Americans eat every day. The older subjects, but not younger subjects, will take the assigned&#xD;
      supplement. The younger subjects will consume the study meals for 2 weeks and provide one&#xD;
      blood sample during the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advanced age is associated with reduced mitochondrial capacity and altered metabolomic&#xD;
      signatures relative to those at younger ages. We hypothesize that supplemental fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable phytochemicals will slow or reverse signs of metabolic aging by enhancing&#xD;
      mitochondrial capacity in older, overweight/obese adults as well as shift their metabolomic&#xD;
      signature toward those of younger, leaner adults. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the&#xD;
      following specific aims in a controlled feeding trial to diminish the confounding effect of&#xD;
      concurrent and confounding dietary factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the extent to which supplemental fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      concentrates will shift the mitochondrial capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in&#xD;
      older, overweight older adults toward that of young, lean adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the extent to which supplemental fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      concentrates will shift the plasma metabolomic signature of older, overweight adults toward&#xD;
      that of young, lean adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design,&#xD;
      controlled feeding trial. This trial will enroll 40 older adults, as well as 20 younger&#xD;
      adults to serve as a reference, to complete the study. They will be generally healthy. The&#xD;
      older adults will be ≥55 y and have BMI &gt;27.0 and &lt;35 kg/m2, and the younger adults will be&#xD;
      18-30 y and have BMI &gt;18.5 and &lt;27 kg/m2. The older subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either placebo (PLA) or fruit/vegetable supplement (FVS) for 6 weeks after a 2-wk run-in&#xD;
      period. The younger adults serving as the reference group for the older subjects will only&#xD;
      participate in the run-in period and will not receive any dietary supplements. During the&#xD;
      whole study, including the run-in period, all subjects will consume provided meals. The total&#xD;
      duration of the trial will be ~10 weeks for the older subjects, including screening, 2-wk&#xD;
      run-in, and 6 wk of intervention, as well as ~4 weeks for the younger subjects including&#xD;
      screening and 2-wk run-in. In addition to consuming the provided meals for 6 weeks, the older&#xD;
      volunteers will take an assigned supplement daily. Blood samples of the older volunteers will&#xD;
      be collected at the end of the run-in and the end of the 6-wk intervention. These same&#xD;
      samples will only be collected from the younger volunteers at the end of the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the supplements (PLA vs. FVS)&#xD;
      after their eligibility is confirmed. A randomization scheme will be prepared by a&#xD;
      biostatistician using a standardized computer program for two treatment groups using a&#xD;
      parallel design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study supplements will be generously provided by Juice PLUS (Collierville, TN). A&#xD;
      matching placebo product will be manufactured by the Juice PLUS under the FDA GMP guidelines.&#xD;
      The main ingredient of the placebo will be microcrystalline cellulose-containing 0.5%&#xD;
      magnesium stearate. The Juice PLUS products that will be used in this intervention have been&#xD;
      marketed in the US. Microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate have a GRAS status&#xD;
      under FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) title 21. FVS in a capsule form will be the&#xD;
      combination of Juice Plus+ Garden Blend, Juice Plus+ Orchard Blend, and Juice Plus+ Berry&#xD;
      Blend. All Juice Plus+ supplements contain a fine, granular powder, mainly from botanical&#xD;
      ingredients. This powder is encapsulated in a size 00 gelatin capsule. These three formulas&#xD;
      will be blended to produce a uniform brown powder and packaged into study opaque capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juice Plus+ Garden Blend consists of vegetable juice powder and pulp from carrot, parsley,&#xD;
      beet, kale, broccoli, cabbage, spinach, oat, rice, and tomato; gelatin, glucomannan, calcium&#xD;
      ascorbate, mixed tocopherols, calcium carbonate, garlic powder, Spirulina Pacifica, natural&#xD;
      mixed carotenoids, natural enzyme blend, Lactobacillus acidophilus, folic acid. The powder&#xD;
      looks pale green in color and smells like cabbage. Juice Plus+ Orchard Blend consists of&#xD;
      fruit juice powder and pulp from apple, orange, pineapple, cranberry, peach, acerola cherry,&#xD;
      beet, prune, date, and papaya; gelatin, calcium ascorbate, citrus pectin, citrus&#xD;
      bioflavonoids, glucomannan, natural mixed carotenoids, natural enzyme blend, bromelain,&#xD;
      papain, mixed tocopherols, Lactobacillus acidophilus, folic acid. The powder looks pink in&#xD;
      color and smells like apple/cranberry. Juice Plus+ Berry Blend consists of fruit juice and&#xD;
      pulp powder of Concord grape, blueberry, cranberry, blackberry, bilberry, raspberry, black&#xD;
      currant, elderberry, cocoa powder, pomegranate powder, green tea, ginger root, grape seed,&#xD;
      and artichoke leaf powder, gelatin, mixed tocopherols, calcium ascorbate, natural enzyme&#xD;
      blend, silicon dioxide, vegetable-derived magnesium stearate, citrus bioflavonoids from&#xD;
      tangerine, folic acid. The powder looks purple in color and smells faintly of berry and&#xD;
      cocoa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, older subjects will be required to attend 1 screening visit and 3 study&#xD;
      visits over 10 weeks, and younger subjects will be required to attend 1 screening visit and 2&#xD;
      study visits over 4 weeks. An initial screening visit (Visit 1) is employed to obtain&#xD;
      informed consent and determine each subject's eligibility. A blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      only if the subject is fasting &gt;12 hours. At Visit 2, subjects will begin to consume the&#xD;
      provided meals for 2 weeks during the run-in period. At Visit 3, all subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to arrive at the study site after fasting for &gt;12 h, blood will be collected. For younger&#xD;
      subjects, the study will complete at end of Visit 3. Older subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of 2 supplements, starting on the next day of Visit 3 for 6 weeks. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to take 3 capsules each with breakfast and dinner. At Visit 4 (final visit), older&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to arrive at the study site after fasting for &gt;12 h, blood will be&#xD;
      collected for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Younger and older subjects will consume provided meals for 2 and 8 weeks. The study meals&#xD;
      will be designed to be comparable to a diet that most average Americans are consuming.&#xD;
      Subjects may consume the study meals longer than 2 or 8 weeks because of a visit scheduling&#xD;
      conflict or other unexpected events.&#xD;
