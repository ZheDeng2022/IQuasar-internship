  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since late December 2019, the novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first reported in China,&#xD;
      has spread worldwide. Vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections have been developed in record&#xD;
      time and several candidate vaccines have completed Phase 2a/b and Phase 3 clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are spherical, enveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA&#xD;
      genomes. One fourth of their genome is responsible for coding structural proteins, such as&#xD;
      the Spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Envelope,&#xD;
      membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins are mainly responsible for virion assembly whilst the S&#xD;
      protein is involved in receptor binding, mediating virus entry into host cells during CoVs&#xD;
      infection via different receptors. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the phylogenetic lineage B of the&#xD;
      genus Betacoronavirus and it recognizes the ACE2 as the entry receptor. It is the seventh CoV&#xD;
      known to cause human infections and the third known to cause severe disease after SARS-CoV&#xD;
      and MERS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD1222 is a recombinant replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine expressing the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 S surface glycoprotein. Development of AZD1222, previously referred to as ChAdOx1&#xD;
      nCoV-19, was initiated by the University of Oxford, UK, with subsequent transfer of&#xD;
      development activities to AstraZeneca. The ChAdOx1 platform has been used in 14 clinical&#xD;
      studies sponsored by the University of Oxford with immunogens from multiple pathogens such as&#xD;
      influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, chikungunya, Zika, MERS-CoV, and Meningitis B. Over 360&#xD;
      healthy adult participants have received ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines in these studies. These&#xD;
      vaccines demonstrated robust immunogenicity after a single dose and favourable safety&#xD;
      profiles, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;

      This will be open-label, single-arm implementation study in Eswatini. All individuals who&#xD;
      register on the National Vaccination Registry will be eligible for enrolment. Participants&#xD;
      will receive appointments for vaccination using the registry. Vaccination will be overseen by&#xD;
      trained personnel. At enrolment participants will receive an intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      AZ1222, a second dose will be given 10 weeks after the first injection. Surveillance for&#xD;
      vaccine effectiveness will be performed at designated hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective hospital-based, case-control study with test-negative controls (test-negative&#xD;
      case-control design) and optionally other hospital controls (standard case-control design)&#xD;
      will be conducted in parallel with the implementation study. Data will be collected through a&#xD;
      network of hospitals located in Eswatini. A hospital-based case control study is an efficient&#xD;
      design well suited to study for effectiveness against severe disease, and potentially allows&#xD;
      for detailed medical information and additional data collection directly from the patient or&#xD;
      healthcare provider. In addition, the study aims to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE)&#xD;
      of AZ1222 against severe disease due to the B.1.351 variant circulating in Southern Africa&#xD;
      and other new variants that might evolve.&#xD;
