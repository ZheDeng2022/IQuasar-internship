  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical decision-making after kidney transplantation is mainly driven by patient&#xD;
      individual assessment. However, this task remains difficult and uncertain due to the&#xD;
      integration of complex and numerous parameters. We aim to evaluate and compare the ability of&#xD;
      transplant physicians to predict long term allograft survival compared with a computer-based&#xD;
      survival prediction algorithm (iBox system).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      400 kidney transplant recipients among the cohort of 4,000 patients from the Paris Transplant&#xD;
      Group prospective kidney transplant cohort (NCT03474003) were randomly selected. We generated&#xD;
      an anonymized electronic health record for each included patient including a total of 60&#xD;
      classical kidney transplant prognostic parameters comprising baseline transplant and&#xD;
      recipient characteristics, together with post-transplant parameters including allograft&#xD;
      function, proteinuria, histology, diagnoses, and immunological profile collected during the&#xD;
      first-year post-transplant. The time of risk evaluation for the human and the iBox system&#xD;
      were at 1-year post transplant and the death censored allograft survival predictions made at&#xD;
      7 years after risk assessment. We enrolled transplant physicians at various stages of their&#xD;
      careers (residents, fellows and seniors) to assign death censored graft survival&#xD;
      probabilities at 7 years post risk assessment. The physicians were blinded to the actual&#xD;
      patient outcome (allograft failure) and the iBox predictions. The physicians-based&#xD;
      predictions will then be compared with the iBox system, a validated computer-based kidney&#xD;
      survival prediction system.&#xD;
