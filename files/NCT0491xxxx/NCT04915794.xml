  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of simulation training in nurses and midwives&#xD;
      on knowledge and self-efficacy regarding preeclamptic pregnancy care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an important step in providing safe care to patients, as a learning environment is&#xD;
      provided in which environmental risks are minimized with simulation applications.&#xD;
      Simulation-based trainings are environments that allow each student to learn, equitable,&#xD;
      based on adult learning principles, and open to different learning styles. The interests and&#xD;
      needs in these environments are defined together by the learner and the educator. By keeping&#xD;
      the experiences of the learner at the forefront, the opportunity is given to learn by doing&#xD;
      and supported with feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is clinically defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or above after the 20th&#xD;
      week of pregnancy and the addition of proteinuria (300mg / 24 hours). It can develop in about&#xD;
      5-10% of all pregnancies. It is defined as a nulliparous disease since it is seen in&#xD;
      approximately 85% of women during their first pregnancy. Preeclampsia constitutes 15% of the&#xD;
      causes of maternal mortality in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies evaluating the effectiveness of simulation training in planning the follow-up and&#xD;
      care of preeclampsia, it was determined that this method increases the knowledge and&#xD;
      self-confidence of nurses. For example; Christian and Krumwiede's study they found that the&#xD;
      self-efficacy rates were significantly higher in the post-simulation test. In his study,&#xD;
      Olubumno investigated the importance of simulation in increasing the critical thinking of&#xD;
      perinatology nurses in the care of preeclamptic pregnant women, he found that the pre-test&#xD;
      and post-test scores increased by 0.75 points, and this difference between the scores is&#xD;
      statistically significant. Tabatabaeian et al., In their study comparing the effects of&#xD;
      simulation-based education, coeducation and theoretical education on the performance of&#xD;
      midwives in preeclampsia and eclampsia, found that the mean of the simulation group was&#xD;
      higher than the other two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is an important obstetric emergency in women's health and disease nursing. Thus,&#xD;
      when they start working in the clinic, it is aimed to be able to suspect preeclampsia with&#xD;
      the anamnesis they received from the pregnant who applied to them, and to gain them with the&#xD;
      simulation method what they should pay attention to and how to do in the follow-up of the&#xD;
      pregnant woman hospitalized with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Studies conducted in our&#xD;
      country did not include studies involving students and healthcare professionals in the&#xD;
      management of preeclampsia with simulation methods. Therefore, it is aimed to contribute to&#xD;
      the literature with this study.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Self-efficacy for preeclamptic pregnancy care&quot; scale was developed and used in the follow-up and care of preeclamptic pregnant women in order to evaluate the perception of self-efficacy towards nursing care in critical obstetric conditions related to preeclampsia in nurses and midwives. It's a 20-item instrument using a five-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Educational Practices Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>One week after theoretical training</time_frame>
    <description>The Educational Practices in Simulation Scale (EPSS), a 16-item instrument using a five-point scale, was designed to measure whether four educational practices (active learning, collaboration, diverse ways of learning, and high expectations) are present in the instructor-developed simulation, and the importance of each practice to the learner.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One week after theoretical training</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 13 items assess the attitudes toward satisfaction with instruction and self-confidence in learning in simulation. A &quot;satisfaction with instruction&quot; subscale contains five items measuring satisfaction with teaching methods, diversity of learning materials, facilitation, motivation, and overall suitability of simulation. A &quot;self-confidence with learning&quot; subscale contains eight items measuring self-confidence in content mastery, content necessity, skills development, available resources, and knowledge of how to obtain help to solve clinical problems in simulation.</description>
