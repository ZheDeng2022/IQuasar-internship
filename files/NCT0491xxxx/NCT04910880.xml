  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies in the literature that evaluate the attitude, behavior and comfort level of&#xD;
      students who do internships in different disciplines (medicine, pharmacy) towards the use of&#xD;
      protective equipment. However, no study evaluating physiotherapy and rehabilitation students&#xD;
      was found. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the behaviors and attitudes&#xD;
      regarding the use of personal protective equipment of physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      department students who are interning in the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;

      A total of 250 participants, who are physiotherapy and rehabilitation intern students in&#xD;
      Turkey, will be included in the present study. Data collection will be carried out using an&#xD;
      online survey. The online survey link will be shared via social media accounts and via mail.&#xD;
      The questionnaire created through Google forms will be delivered to the participants via the&#xD;
      link. The link will be active in the data collection process. Before the participants start&#xD;
      the questionnaire, they will be asked whether they were willing to participate. The&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, weight, height) and health status (presence&#xD;
      of chronic disease and drugs used) will be questioned. In addition, the information about the&#xD;
      institution where the internship was held and the duration of the internship, internship&#xD;
      hours, time spent at the internship will be collected. Personal Protective Equipment Comfort&#xD;
      and User Attitude Evaluation Form will be used to evaluate participant's thoughts, attitudes&#xD;
      and behaviors towards the use of personal equipment also physical complaints, comfort level&#xD;
      due to personal protective equipment.&#xD;

    <description>There is no valid and reliable questionnaire evaluating behaviors and attitudes towards the use of personal protective equipment in the literature. Therefore, in our study, the attitudes and behaviors of the participants towards personal protective equipment will be evaluated using the questions developed in the article published by Çiriş et al. Required permissions have been obtained from the corresponding author of the article. &quot;The Attitude Inventory Regarding the Use of Personal Protective Equipment&quot; is composed of 5 likert scale type statements such as &quot;1 - Strongly disagree,&quot; &quot;2 - Disagree,&quot; &quot;3 - Not sure,&quot; &quot;4 - Agree,&quot; and &quot;5 - Strongly agree.&quot; Answers to questions are between 1 and 5 points, so the total score varies between 5 and 100 points. As the score from each of the subgroups increases, the positive attitude toward the use of personal protective equipment increases.</description>
