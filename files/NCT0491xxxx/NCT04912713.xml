  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In motor learning, it is essential to consider that movements are produced by the cooperation&#xD;
      and combination of many brain structures and are influenced by the emotions to which&#xD;
      individuals are subjected. Several neural circuits have been identified that closely link the&#xD;
      emotional system and the motion control system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress is a physiological or psychological response to internal or external stressors. In&#xD;
      principle, it has an adaptive role. However, the neuroendocrine and autonomic response&#xD;
      generated by stress can affect cognitive processes such as memory. In addition, it has been&#xD;
      shown to influence motor learning, especially the execution of skills in the early stages of&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how movement, emotions and interactions are regulated is significant because of&#xD;
      the large number of movements humans perform. Of these, manual tasks represent precise&#xD;
      movements that require the integration of many elements by the nervous system to perform&#xD;
      these tasks successfully. It is still unknown how acute stress influence the way manual tasks&#xD;
      are learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, motor imagery (MI) is a cognitive process that is an important contributor&#xD;
      to how movements are planned and executed. Its use has been recommended to improve movement&#xD;
      learning and task execution. For an MI program to be effective and individualized, it is&#xD;
      imperative to know this capacity. However, it is also still unknown how acute stress can&#xD;
      affect our motor imagery ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine and quantify the effects of acute stress in&#xD;
      the learning of a precise manual task not previously trained on four parameters of fine motor&#xD;
      control: time, error, speed, and accuracy. On the other hand, the aim is to determine if the&#xD;
      ability of internal visual, external visual, and kinaesthetic imagery varies when we are&#xD;
      subjected to acute stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that non-anxious, non-stressed participants who are not induced with acute&#xD;
      stress will show better motor performance on the fine motor task and better motor imagery&#xD;
      ability. In contrast, it is expected that participants without anxiety and stress who are&#xD;
      induced with acute stress will show poorer motor performance on the fine motor task and&#xD;
      poorer motor imagery ability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to meet the study objectives of determining and quantifying the effects of acute&#xD;
      stress on learning a precise manual task and on motor imagery ability, this study will be&#xD;
      conducted. The development of the study will take place in a conditioned room belonging to&#xD;
      the University of Alcalá, the Complutense University of Madrid, the European University of&#xD;
      Madrid, or Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. The study may also be carried out in other&#xD;
      Spanish and international university centers, subject to the consent and permission of the&#xD;
      respective centres. The study will be carried out by all national and international laws,&#xD;
      regulations, and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be longitudinal, experimental, randomized, and double-blind, as&#xD;
      specified in the present registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be composed of participants who are undergraduate and postgraduate&#xD;
      students at the university centers where the study will be carried out, from which they will&#xD;
      be recruited. All participants included in the study must meet the study selection criteria&#xD;
      and participate voluntarily after reading the information sheet and signing the informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two intervention groups, in which the Maastricht Acute Stress Test&#xD;
      (MAST) protocol will be performed: one group will perform the acute stress induction protocol&#xD;
      (MAST stress) and the other group will perform the no stress induction control protocol (MAST&#xD;
      control). Each group will consist of a minimum number of 30 subjects to be able to study the&#xD;
      desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each participant freely chooses to participate in the study, an initial questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to ensure that they meet the criteria for inclusion in the study. At&#xD;
      this point, they will be coded by assigning them a number, which will serve to identify each&#xD;
      participant throughout the study. Participants will take the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI), one of the most widely used instruments for the self-reported assessment of anxiety&#xD;
      and equivalent to a measure of stress, as it considers the amount of stressful stimulus.&#xD;
      Thus, the two components of anxiety will be assessed: state anxiety and trait anxiety.&#xD;
      Participants with scores indicative of state or trait anxiety will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study, and those with scores indicating neither trait anxiety nor state anxiety will be&#xD;
      included. Included participants will be randomized through sealed envelopes stratified by&#xD;
      gender to one of two experimental groups: MAST stress, or MAST control. They will also take&#xD;
      the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3) to measure internal visual, external visual,&#xD;
      kinaesthetic imagery ability, and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) to determine the&#xD;
      participant's laterality. Depending on the group to which they have been assigned, they will&#xD;
      perform the corresponding MAST protocol (stress or control). MAST stress is a non-invasive&#xD;
      protocol to induce acute stress in the laboratory that combines components of psychological&#xD;
      stress (evaluative social threat, uncontrollability, and unpredictability) and physical&#xD;
      stress (sensation of pain through intense cold). The MAST control is a homologous protocol to&#xD;
      the stress protocol but has no psychological or physical stressor components. After MAST&#xD;
      protocol, participants will learn a precise manual task with the non-dominant hand. The task&#xD;
      will consist of going over a 127 mm circumference on a graphics tablet at a rate of 2 seconds&#xD;
      per lap, which will be set by a metronome using a wireless pen that will leave no trace of&#xD;
      ink but will store the data in the MATLAB program via the graphics tablet. Thus, data from&#xD;
      the learning process and short-term memory of the task will be recorded. Afterward, there&#xD;
      will be a 20-minute break during which participants will perform the MIQ-3 again. Finally,&#xD;
      the task data will be collected to record the long-term memory of the manual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during all experiments, electrodermal activity and heart rate variability will&#xD;
      be recorded using the Empatica E4 physiological variable measurement wristband. This&#xD;
      measurement of physiological variables will serve to confirm that a significant emotional&#xD;
      effect has been generated and to test motor imagery processes since both acute stress and&#xD;
      motor imagery produce activation of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis and processing of data from MATLAB version R2020b, and the Empatica E4 wristband&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS 25.0 statistical software and Kubios HRV software (for HRV&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to see if the data are distributed&#xD;
      according to a standard curve through the Shapiro-Wilk test and to assess the influence of&#xD;
      sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the descriptive analysis of the relative and absolute frequencies for the&#xD;
      qualitative variables of gender and age will be carried out, and their homogeneity will be&#xD;
      tested using the Chi-square test. The descriptive analysis of the quantitative variables of&#xD;
      time, error, speed, accuracy, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and&#xD;
      kinaesthetic, internal visual, and external visual imagery will also be carried out. If the&#xD;
      variable conforms to the normal, the mean, range, and standard deviation shall be calculated.&#xD;
      If it does not conform to the normal, non-parametric tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis will be performed using mixed ANOVA to see the differences in the mean&#xD;
      values respective to motor control (time, error, speed, and accuracy), and the differences&#xD;
      between the first and last lap and between consecutive laps of the task in the same four&#xD;
      parameters, both in the task performed in the short term and the long term. A further ANOVA&#xD;
      analysis will take place for imagery ability, comparing the results obtained at the two&#xD;
      respective points during the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of learning between laps will be analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA comparing&#xD;
      each motor control measurement parameter with respect to the lapping factor. Electrodermal&#xD;
      activity, and heart rate variability during the measurement of imagery ability, emotional&#xD;
      state induction, manual task learning, and its maintenance in the short and long term will&#xD;
      also be studied by repeated-measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hypothesis testing, a significance level of 0.05 will be set.&#xD;
