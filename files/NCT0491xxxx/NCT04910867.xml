  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage&#xD;
      kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African&#xD;
      American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation.&#xD;
      Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this&#xD;
      greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD&#xD;
      candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic&#xD;
      counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling&#xD;
      about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates' decisional&#xD;
      conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of&#xD;
      ESRD post-donation, and AAs' widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is&#xD;
      ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates' safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally&#xD;
      competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally&#xD;
      competent manner. Clinical &quot;chatbots,&quot; mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to&#xD;
      provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians' time, can&#xD;
      improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot &quot;Gia,&quot;&#xD;
      created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot&#xD;
      on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for&#xD;
      nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner.&#xD;
      Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists' genetic literacy is&#xD;
      critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1&#xD;
      testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations&#xD;
      (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates' decisional&#xD;
      conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness,&#xD;
           and willingness to donate in a pre-post design&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the&#xD;
           RE-AIM framework to longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs'&#xD;
           satisfaction with informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which&#xD;
      can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as&#xD;
      a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other&#xD;
      practices to improve patient informed consent.&#xD;

      This project, &quot;Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living&#xD;
      donor evaluation,&quot; will integrate APOL1 testing into the evaluation of living kidney donor&#xD;
      candidates of African ancestry. The study aims to reduce decisional conflict, improve&#xD;
      preparedness for decision making, and increase satisfaction with informed consent for living&#xD;
      donation for donor candidates at elevated risk of post-donation kidney failure. The APOL1&#xD;
      testing program will entail adapting established artificial intelligence conversational&#xD;
      agents or &quot;chatbots&quot; to provide APOL1-specific information in preparation for donor&#xD;
      candidates to undergo APOL1 testing, and adapting established genetic counseling discussions&#xD;
      for transplant nephrologists to counsel donor candidates about APOL1 test results and engage&#xD;
      in shared decision making to improve donor candidates' informed consent for living donation.&#xD;
      APOL1 test results will be integrated into the electronic health record to provide clinical&#xD;
      decision support to transplant nephrologists. The study will involve community engagement to&#xD;
      ensure that testing and counseling is delivered in a culturally competent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, this study will simultaneously evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness and implementation of the APOL1 testing program to more efficiently&#xD;
      translate evidence into practice, as service delivery system factors for adoption and scale&#xD;
      up are considered while effectiveness is tested. The study will be conducted at two&#xD;
      geographically distinct transplant programs: Northwestern University in Chicago, IL, and&#xD;
      Georgetown University in Washington, DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include live kidney donor candidates of African ancestry undergoing donor&#xD;
      evaluation. The investigators will recruit potential participants consecutively; with&#xD;
      participants recruited in year 1 serving as the control group, and participants recruited in&#xD;
      years 2-5 serving as the intervention group. Participants will be eligible for participation&#xD;
      if they respond positively to one of three questions assessing African ancestry. Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group will use the chatbot for 5-7 minutes. Immediately thereafter,&#xD;
      research staff will ask for participants' informed consent to undergo APOL1 genetic testing;&#xD;
      those who agree will provide a saliva sample for testing. APOL1 test results will be&#xD;
      integrated into the respective transplant program's electronic health records. Thereafter,&#xD;
      transplant nephrologists will engage in a counseling discussion with donor candidates about&#xD;
      APOL1 and living donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distributional assumptions will be assessed to evaluate appropriateness of model&#xD;
      specifications. For primary analyses, the mixed model framework will allow for incorporation&#xD;
      of a random center effect to separate within- and between-center variance estimates. As&#xD;
      participants will not be randomized to intervention arms, the proposed statistical analysis&#xD;
      plan will also incorporate a multivariable modeling approach, with inclusion of potential&#xD;
      confounders, to reduce bias in intervention effect estimates. Effect estimates will be&#xD;
      reported with confidence intervals to convey variability in estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for sample size estimates were based on a simplified comparisons of means between the&#xD;
      two arms (pre-post implementation periods). Necessary sample sizes were then inflated to&#xD;
      account for multivariable model and to account for loss-to-follow-up, to ensure adequate&#xD;
      power. The proposed sample size of 74 participants in the control period and 316 in the&#xD;
      intervention period will provide at least 80-90% power to detect meaningful differences in&#xD;
      mean Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) score ranging from 5.0 to 7.7 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for integrating genetic testing into&#xD;
      clinical practice that shows how to scale up genetic counseling services through the use of&#xD;
      chatbots to deliver foundational information, and training nephrologists to deliver&#xD;
      components of genetic counseling. Specifically, this model will demonstrate how to deliver&#xD;
      APOL1 testing of live donor candidates, which can then be implemented across the country via&#xD;
      implementation science approaches. The proposed study will prepare transplant programs to&#xD;
      deliver culturally competent counseling coterminous with the completion of the NIH APOLLO&#xD;
      study in ~5 years. The findings generated from this research have the potential to protect&#xD;
      donor candidates' safety by improving their informed consent. As such, this proposal is&#xD;
      timely and responsive to the NIDDK Program Announcement (PA-18-330) &quot;Investigator-Initiated&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK.&quot;&#xD;

    <description>The APOL1 testing program is designed to help living donor candidates to reduce their decisional conflict and enhance their informed consent regarding living donation. This intervention component entails: (1) an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent &quot;chatbot&quot; providing foundational information about the relationship between APOL1 and kidney disease and living donor outcomes, and APOL1 testing. The chatbot helps to relieve the workload on clinicians and scale up information giving. (2) The transplant nephrologist counseling component includes discussion about the APOL1 test results and shared decision making about donation, in a culturally competent manner, so as to enhance donor candidates' informed consent for living donation.</description>
