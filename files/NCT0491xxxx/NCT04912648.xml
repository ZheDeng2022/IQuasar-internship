  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen excess is the cardinal biochemical feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a&#xD;
      lifelong metabolic disorder affecting 10% of women. Serum testosterone correlates with&#xD;
      insulin resistance in women, however, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of&#xD;
      the association between androgens and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Recently, a new subclass&#xD;
      of androgenic steroids known as 11-oxygenated androgens has been identified. Utilising highly&#xD;
      sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques, our group has&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that 11-oxygenated steroids are the predominant androgens in both&#xD;
      health controls and women with PCOS, and that these correlate closely with markers of insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The bioactive 11-oxygenated androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) binds and&#xD;
      activates the androgen receptor with equal affinity to testosterone, yet nothing is known&#xD;
      about its impact on metabolism or glucose homeostasis. Intriguingly, unlike testosterone,&#xD;
      11-oxygenated androgens do not decline with age in women, and, therefore, may mediate an&#xD;
      increased risk of T2DM in women across their life course. Therefore, this previously ignored&#xD;
      androgen class is likely of major importance in female metabolic health, and may represent a&#xD;
      novel metabolic risk factor and biomarker. However, 11-oxygenated androgens are not currently&#xD;
      measured in routine clinical practice. To date, no population-based or human in vivo&#xD;
      physiology studies have examined the association between 11-oxygenated androgens, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism and diabetes risk in women, despite the high prevalence of PCOS in the female&#xD;
      population. There is emerging evidence, even in women without a confirmed history of PCOS,&#xD;
      that the levels of androgens over time correlate with their likelihood of developing&#xD;
      metabolic and cardiovascular disease. This has not been studied to date in a prospective&#xD;
      manner in healthy women in the background population using long term follow up data.&#xD;

      Clinical questionnaire and baseline anthropometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will complete a standardised case record form, with information obtained&#xD;
      on relevant medical history, medications and anthropometric assessment (height, weight, body&#xD;
      mass index, blood pressure, weight circumference). Body composition will be assessed using a&#xD;
      portable bioimpedance machine (Tanita MC-780MA-S Portable). We will also obtain information&#xD;
      on education level and household income. Participants will complete a standardised QOL&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum, urine and saliva sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting bloods will be drawn for assessment of metabolic phenotype including glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, lipid profile, full blood count, renal and liver biochemistry and HbA1C. Serum&#xD;
      samples will also be obtained for measured of the steroid and non-targeted metabolome. Urine&#xD;
      and saliva samples will be obtained for assessment of steroid metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted steroid metabolome profiling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum, urinary and salivary multi-steroid profiling including classic and 11-oxygenated&#xD;
      androgens will be performed using highly sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, we will analyse the 24-h urine steroid metabolome,&#xD;
      allowing for determination of 24-h net androgen output from classic and 11-oxygenated&#xD;
      pathways (26). Analysis will be carried out by LC-MS/MS multi-steroid profiling.&#xD;
      Multi-steroid profiling approaches have been developed and optimised at the University of&#xD;
      Birmingham Steroid Metabolome Analysis Core (SMAC), where samples will be measured under the&#xD;
      supervision of Professor Wiebke Arlt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-targeted serum metabolomics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global non-targeted serum metabolome will be profiled at the Phenome Centre Birmingham&#xD;
      under the supervision of Professor Warwick Dunn (co-applicant). Samples will be analysed&#xD;
      applying Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (Ultimate3000RS; Thermo Scientific, Hemel&#xD;
      Hempstead, UK) interfaced to an electrospray mass spectrometry (Q Exactive, Thermo&#xD;
      Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under local anaesthetic and without using scalpel incision, muscle biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      from the vastus lateralis muscle of the leg in each participant. These will be performed&#xD;
      using a Bard biopsy needle gun, with suction applied to increase tissue yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited via local advertising in Beaumont Hospital and RCSI Medical&#xD;
      School.&#xD;
