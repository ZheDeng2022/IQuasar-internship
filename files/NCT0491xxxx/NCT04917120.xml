  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Virtual Reality induced Hypnosis on&#xD;
      patients' pain scores, anxiety and the use of analgesics during a vaso-occlusive crisis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality hypnosis could probably reduce vaso-occlusive crisis-related (vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crisis) anxiety and pain and provide the patient with means of optimizing the ability to cope&#xD;
      with the painful and anxiety-provoking situations encountered in general pediatric unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this non-pharmacological analgesic technique is little used in the context of&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis in children and adolescents in French pediatric services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the average pain scores of children and adolescents hospitalized for&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis after treatment in the emergency department is 6 out of 10 on a simple&#xD;
      numerical scale (according to a preliminary study conducted on 30 files of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease patients over 6 years of age hospitalized in general pediatrics, Trousseau AP-HP&#xD;
      hospital over a period of 6 months in 2018), despite the implementation of optimal&#xD;
      pharmacological means with regard to the HAS analgesia recommendations. The pain score stays&#xD;
      high despite a well-conducted analgesic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that virtual reality hypnosis could potentiate the effects of virtual&#xD;
      reality by hypnotic suggestions specific to the pain of patients with vaso-occlusive crisis .&#xD;
      This is a pain and anxiety reduction strategy that has, to our knowledge, never been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this is innovative by the method but also of the pediatric target population suffering&#xD;
      from recurrent and severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A session of hypnoanalgesia suggestions associated with a virtual reality program will allow&#xD;
      the patient to acquire the necessary competence to manage with his or her pain and thus be&#xD;
      more autonomous in its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiopathological hypothesis of the research is that the immersion of the patient with&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crises related pain during a hypnotic experience induced by virtual reality&#xD;
      allows to saturate his sensoriality, thus reducing nociceptive perceptions and vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crisis -related anxiety. We hypothesize that this experiment is feasible and that it can&#xD;
      produce decrease in pain and anxiety scores for children benefiting from a virtual reality&#xD;
      hypnosis session during vaso-occlusive crisis within one hour of session.&#xD;
