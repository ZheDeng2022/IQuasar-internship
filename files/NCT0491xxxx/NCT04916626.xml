  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OPUS YOUNG (OY) study investigates the efficacy of early intervention service versus&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) for adolescents aged 12-17 years with a first-episode psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, the yearly incidence of schizophrenia in youth below the age of 18 years has&#xD;
      increased from 137 in 2000 to 477 in 2016. Outcomes in people with schizophrenia spectrum&#xD;
      disorders are suboptimal with low quality of life, low rates of recovery, substance misuse,&#xD;
      higher rates of suicide, violence and legal problems, low educational and vocational&#xD;
      attainment, and a significantly reduced life-expectancy of 15-20 year. Schizophrenia imply a&#xD;
      large burden of disease with severe impact on patients, their families, the service system&#xD;
      and a large economic societal burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 284 participants age 12-17 years with an early onset psychosis&#xD;
      within the following diagnostic classes: schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic depression or&#xD;
      drug-induced psychosis. The design is an independent, investigator initiated, pragmatic,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, with blinded outcome assessment. Participants are randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to OY or TAU. Participants in OY are offered 2 years of specialized intervention (OY)&#xD;
      regardless of age, while participants in TAU are switched to adult psychiatry at the age of&#xD;
      18 years. OY builds on the Danish evidenced based intervention for young adults, OPUS,&#xD;
      adjusted to meet the specific needs of adolescents: intensified support for caretakers and&#xD;
      relatives including siblings; social cognition and interaction treatment; and individual&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral case management. OY addresses the specific challenges of&#xD;
      psychopharmacologic treatment in youth; supported transition to adult care after OY; school&#xD;
      or educational support; and prevention and treatment of substance misuse. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is improved functioning in daily and social life after 24 months. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are psychopathology, quality of life, family stress, and retention in treatment and&#xD;
      school/employment, and healthcare consumption. The clinical and societal perspective of a&#xD;
      large scale implementation is improved prevention of the negative consequences of early-onset&#xD;
      psychosis and a reduced burden of severe mental illness.&#xD;

    <measure>Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Last month at baseline (from enrollment), at month 12, at month 24 and at month 30</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the global score of social function, measured with Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). PSP provides a global score on a scale from 1-100, with lower scores indicating lower social functioning. The global score is based on scores on four subdomains (1. Socially useful activities, 2. Personal and social relationships, 3. Self-care, and 4. Disturbing and aggressive behaviour), rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1=absent to 6=very severe). The scoring of PSP is based on all available information and concerns the patient's daily level of functioning in the family, in school, and during leisure time during the past month. Higher global values mean better social function. Researchers will interview the participants prior to the scoring of PSP using a semi structured interview guide suitable for children and adolescents, developed by the OPUS YOUNG research team.</description>

    <measure>Severity of psychotic symptom dimension, SAPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Last month at baseline (from enrollment), at month 12, at month 24 and at month 30</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for Assessing Psychotic Symptoms in Schizophrenia (SAPS), used to assess the phenomenological presentation of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, is a rating scale to measure positive symptoms in schizophrenia. The SAPS- scale is split into 4 sub-scales (hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior and formal thought disorder) each of which are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe) and for each domain is also given a global symptom severity score by the rater. The Psychotic symptom dimension is the sum of global scores, divided by the number of global scores (range 0-5). The psychotic dimension is composed of scores of hallucination and delusions. Higher score indicates worse level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia (SANS), used to assess the phenomenological presentation of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, is a rating scale to measure negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The SANS scale is divided into five sub-scales (affective flattening, alogia, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, attention), each of which are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe) and for each domain is also given a global symptom severity score by the rater (global ratings). The Negative symptoms dimension is calculated as the sum of the global scores, divided by the number of global scores (range 0-5). The negative symptom dimension is composed of scores of anhedonia, avolition, affective flattening and alogia. Higher score indicates worse level of symptoms.</description>

Patients respond to those question-items using a 4-point Likert scale. Their responses are scored from 1 to 4, and thus the possible total scores range from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. Self-rapport</description>

Answer categories item 1 and 9: not at all-slightly-moderately-very-extremely; all other items: never-seldom-quite often-very often-always. Responses are coded so that higher values indicate better QoL. A low score indicates a poor QOL, and a high score is indicative of a better QOL.</description>
