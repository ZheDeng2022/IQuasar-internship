  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 study comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of BLU-263 + best supportive care (BSC) with placebo + BSC in patients&#xD;
      with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by&#xD;
      BSC. The study will be conducted in 4 parts. Parts 1 and 2 will enroll patients with ISM.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 will roll over onto Part 3 to receive treatment with&#xD;
      BLU-263 in an open-label fashion following completion of the earlier Part. Part M will enroll&#xD;
      patients with monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (mMCAS). The study also includes&#xD;
      optional PK groups that may enroll patients with ISM.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In Part 1 of the study, patients with ISM will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 doses of BLU-263 + BSC or to placebo + BSC. Once the recommended dose (RD) of BLU-263 is identified in Part 1, patients with ISM in Part 2 will be randomly assigned to receive BLU-263 at the RD + BSC or matching placebo + BSC. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to BLU-263:placebo. In Part 3, patients who have completed treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study (including those initially randomized to placebo) will participate in a long-term open-label extension, receiving BLU-263 at the RD + BSC. In Part M of the study patients with monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome will receive BLU-263 + BSC at the RD in an open-label fashion. The study also includes optional PK groups that may enroll patients with ISM</intervention_model_description>
