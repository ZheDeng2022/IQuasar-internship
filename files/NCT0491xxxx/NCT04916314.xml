  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess adiposity is a key causal factor in developing type 2 diabetes and weight loss&#xD;
      improves glycaemia and can put diabetes in to remission. There is evidence that low&#xD;
      carbohydrate diets also reduce glycaemia. The aim of this trial is to test a behavioural&#xD;
      support programme delivered remotely to reduce energy intake and carbohydrate intake in&#xD;
      particular to improve glycaemic control in people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We&#xD;
      will recruit participants from general practice diabetes registers who were diagnosed within&#xD;
      the past six years and who want to and are able to follow an app-based behavioural support&#xD;
      programme to change their diet and have a BMI of at least 27kg/m2 (â‰¥30kg/m2 if of white&#xD;
      European ethnicity). They will be individually randomised 1:1 using simple randomisation to&#xD;
      either intervention or a no-intervention control. Blinding of participants or their&#xD;
      clinicians is impossible. The intervention comprises a 12-week behavioural support programme&#xD;
      delivered by app or web, which provides group-based peer support, recipes for food providing&#xD;
      low energy meals that are low in carbohydrate. The programme is delivered by a commercial&#xD;
      company, Second Nature. Clinicians will adjust medication for hypertension and diabetes as&#xD;
      needed. The co-primary outcomes are change in participants' HbA1c from baseline to 3 months&#xD;
      and baseline to 1 year, with p-value adjustment to reflect multiple testing. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are remission from diabetes, weight change, change in cardiovascular risk factors,&#xD;
      and change in quality of life at 3 months and 1 year. The trial will assess whether this&#xD;
      app-based programme improves outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes relative to usual care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an individually randomised controlled trial. Participants, recruited via GP&#xD;
      practices, will be randomised 1:1 with simple randomisation and no stratification to either&#xD;
      the intervention group or control (usual care). They will be enrolled in the study for 1&#xD;
      year, of which the intervention (dietary support via the app) will run for 3 months. Most&#xD;
      study procedures will be conducted online or remotely (by telephone) including: screening,&#xD;
      eligibility assessment, informed consent, randomisation, engagement with the app-based&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will be asked to attend 3 face to face appointments for the&#xD;
      research study at their local GP practice for measurements to be taken (weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure) and blood tests, at baseline, 3 months and 1 year, and will have 1 additional&#xD;
      telephone contact with their GP or practice nurse before starting the intervention. Face to&#xD;
      face appointments will be incorporated with routine clinical appointments when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 100 participants via their GP practices. Based on a&#xD;
      conservative response rate of 10% from similar previous studies, the investigators will&#xD;
      approach approximately 1000 eligible individuals from approximately 10 GP practices in&#xD;
      England. The primary care provider will search their electronic registers for eligible&#xD;
      individuals and GPs will screen out those to whom it would be inappropriate to send a letter&#xD;
      inviting them to enrol and referring them to a website to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent has been given, participants will click on a link to the electronic data capture&#xD;
      system database which will be activated following their consent, to complete the baseline&#xD;
      assessment. All participants will complete a 2 part baseline assessment, firstly online and&#xD;
      then at their GP practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Online:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire requesting demographic&#xD;
           information and their current medication, and the standard questionnaires that will be&#xD;
           used in the study (the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) score, the EQ5D (quality of life&#xD;
           assessment), and a 24 hour dietary recall questionnaire (&quot;Intake24 dietary assessment&#xD;
           tool&quot;, where participants are asked to record all food and drink intake in the last 24&#xD;
           hours). This will also further assess whether people are sufficiently able to complete&#xD;
           online trial procedures, and only those who complete the questionnaire will be&#xD;
           randomised. Participants will be informed in the Participant Information Sheet that they&#xD;
           will only be able to enter the study after completing the questionnaire fully in one&#xD;
           attempt as the system will not allow them to go back into the questionnaire to answer&#xD;
           the remaining questions later. This should take less than 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the GP practice (visit 1) Having completed the online assessment, participants will&#xD;
           be asked (via message on their screen on completing the assessment, and followed up via&#xD;
           email) to book the in-person portions of their baseline assessment at their GP practice&#xD;
           for measures which cannot be conducted online. At this appointment, their height, weight&#xD;
           and blood pressure will be measured and recorded, and a blood sample taken for baseline&#xD;
           values (HbA1c, lipid profile, liver function tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will randomise the participant at the baseline appointment. This is an&#xD;
      individually randomised 1:1 to 2 arms: Intervention (12 week, app-based dietary support), or&#xD;
      control (usual care; no active additional intervention). The randomisation will be conducted&#xD;
      using the in-built randomisation software. This ensures full allocation concealment as&#xD;
      information on future allocations is not accessible to the person randomising. Due to the&#xD;
      nature of the intervention it will not be possible to blind members of the study team or&#xD;
      participants to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive an email giving 12 weeks of&#xD;
      access to the app/website. The intervention, provided by Second Nature, involves diet,&#xD;
      activity and behaviour change components. It comprises a three-month remote behavioural&#xD;
      change programme with mentoring from a registered dietitian or nutritionist (health coach),&#xD;
      peer group support, structured education articles and activity tracking technology. These&#xD;
      elements are accessed via a smartphone or web-based application. Each participant will also&#xD;
      receive a hard copy of an instructional handbook and a recipe book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the intervention group will consult their GP to adjust medication&#xD;
      as appropriate to avoid hypotension or hypoglycaemia following a guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control group will receive no additional intervention, and&#xD;
      will continue to receive their usual NHS diabetes care from their general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants will be followed up after 3 months (visit 2) and at 12 months (visit 3). At&#xD;
      this appointment they will have the same procedures as at their baseline assessment repeated:&#xD;
      their weight and blood pressure will be recorded, and blood tests taken (3 sample tubes - for&#xD;
      HbA1c, lipid profile and liver function). Participants will be asked to complete the same&#xD;
      online questionnaires (PAID score, EQ5D, and 24 hour dietary recall) as they completed at&#xD;
      baseline, and serious adverse events and events of concern (serious hypoglycaemia) will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A purposively sampled proportion of participants from the intervention group (aiming to&#xD;
      achieve diversity of age, race, and success and engagement with the programme measured by&#xD;
      weight/HbA1c outcomes and engagement metrics respectively) will be contacted via telephone&#xD;
      for a semi-structured interview to discuss their experience of the intervention, after they&#xD;
      complete the 3 month intervention period. Interviews will last approximately 30 minutes. With&#xD;
      participants consent this will be audio-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the SAE recording period for each participant lasts from their enrolment on&#xD;
      to the study, to their completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials) 2010 statements. A full analysis plan will be prepared and finalised before&#xD;
      any data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis of efficacy outcomes will be carried out on the basis of&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT). This is, after randomisation, participants will be analysed&#xD;
      according to their allocated intervention group irrespective of what intervention they&#xD;
      actually receive. The investigators will endeavour to obtain full follow-up data on every&#xD;
      participant to allow full ITT analysis, but the investigators will inevitably experience the&#xD;
      problem of missing data due to withdrawal, loss to follow up, or non-response to&#xD;
      questionnaire items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyse the primary continuous outcome with a linear model adjusting&#xD;
      for baseline value of the relevant variable where relevant. For exploratory analyses, the&#xD;
      investigators will use analogous models, but interpret the data in an exploratory manner&#xD;
      rather than confirmatory. For binary outcomes (e.g. remission), the investigators will test&#xD;
      for a difference in proportions using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies of this intervention(5) and studies in similar populations(3), an&#xD;
      8-10mmol/mol change in HbA1c at 12 months in the intervention group in those who engage with&#xD;
      the programme (SD 8.6mmol/mol), with a 1-2mmol/mol (SD 6mmol/mol) change in the control group&#xD;
      is estimated. With Î± and Î² set at 0.05 this would require approximately 48 participants;&#xD;
      however to power for a co-primary outcome would require 72 to 88 participants in total&#xD;
      (allowing for variability in estimated effect size). In similar trials of behavioural&#xD;
      interventions an expected retention to follow up of &gt;80%; allowing for the online nature of&#xD;
      this trial, and the retention rates of observational studies of this intervention the&#xD;
      investigators will aim to recruit 100 participants to allow for cumulative attrition at the&#xD;
      intervention sign-up, engagement, and follow up stages. The results from the trial will be&#xD;
      prepared as comparative summary statistics (difference in proportions or means) with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. All the tests will be done at a 5% two-sided significance level.&#xD;
