  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate how HIV affects ageing process, especially in Asian populations&#xD;
      in various organ system, including brain, kidney, liver and etc. There are some articles that&#xD;
      describing the ageing process in PWHIV, but there has been a limited number of articles that&#xD;
      comparing ageing process by ethnicities. And the endpoints of those limited number of&#xD;
      articles are including more general variables like all-cause mortality, detectable viral load&#xD;
      and days to regimen changes. There is no extensive study of ageing by function of each organ&#xD;
      system in Asia. This proposal contains more specific observation points on function/dysfxn of&#xD;
      each organ system, especially for brain function as an MRI sub-study. The MRI sub-study has a&#xD;
      large portion of this proposal as analysis of the neurocognitive function in HIV ageing,&#xD;
      which has not been extensively studied in Asia, nor it hasn't been compared to other ethnic&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this proposal, we can see if there are differences by ethnicities compared to&#xD;
      POPPY/COBRA results, and even if there are no differences, we can increase the number and&#xD;
      diversify of cohort subjects and strengthen the level of evidence of cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, by enrolling both younger and older HIV-positive individuals with a matched&#xD;
      HIV-negative control group, will be in the unique position to determine the effects of ageing&#xD;
      and HIV status on chronic HIV-infection. In addition, results from this study will be well&#xD;
      placed to assist in informing future HIV treatment guidelines on the monitoring of chronic&#xD;
      HIV infection in older subjects and assisting in the design of future interventional studies&#xD;
      for the treatment of age associated co-morbidities.&#xD;

      Study Design: Multicentre, prospective, observational study over 3 years. Our study will&#xD;
      describe the impact of advancing age on the experience of living with HIV in South Korea. To&#xD;
      address this we will establish cohorts of HIV-positive people aged &gt;50 and &lt;50 years as well&#xD;
      as demographically matched HIV-negative people aged &gt;50 years. Although 2 years of follow up&#xD;
      duration is short period to evaluate the effect of aging, this period could give us an&#xD;
      insights for necessity of longer follow up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from three clinics: Severance Hospital; Seoul Medical Center;&#xD;
      National Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: Older HIV-positive cohort (n=500); Younger HIV-positive cohort (n=250);&#xD;
      HIV-negative cohort (n=250). We arbitrarily decided these numbers of subjects considering the&#xD;
      numbers of subjects of POPPY-UK study (1000, 500, and 500 subjects, respectively),&#xD;
      feasibility of recruitment, and possible budget. Our choice of sample size is largely&#xD;
      pragmatic, reflecting the number of older patients receiving care and the proportion that are&#xD;
      expected to participate. Detailed sample size calculations are difficult given the wide range&#xD;
      of topics and methodological approaches proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was chosen pragmatically based on&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) the number of HIV pts of three participating hospitals (NMC≒1200, severance≒700, SMC≒300)&#xD;
      2) feasibility of recruitment 3) and possible budget&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each subject must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to the conduct of any screening&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of the screening visit is to evaluate that the subject meets study&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria. HIV antibody testing will be undertaken for subjects&#xD;
           undergoing screening for the HIV-negative cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit 1 (Baseline visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline visit will perform evaluations as per schedule of visits.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <gender_description>Subjects with primary HIV infection are eligible and investigators are encouraged to recruit such subjects. Our target population (those infected with HIV via sexual routes of men who have sex with men) has been chosen as this group represent the vast majority of older HIV-positive individuals attending for care in Korea; analyses of other groups (e.g. injection drug users, those infected through blood/blood products and transgender individuals), who may have very different needs and outcomes, would likely be under-powered.</gender_description>
