&#xD;
          -  Use of contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are heterosexually active must be&#xD;
                  using two highly effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout&#xD;
                  the study and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug to minimize&#xD;
                  the risk of pregnancy as Tazemetostat might counteract the effects of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraceptives. Birth control methods that can be used while in this study&#xD;
                  include: established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal birth control or&#xD;
                  placement of an intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine system [IUS]. They or&#xD;
                  their partner must also use a second method, (e.g., condom with spermicidal&#xD;
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
                  caps] with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. If their male partner is&#xD;
                  vasectomized, they do not need to use any of the birth control methods listed&#xD;
                  above. The type of birth control they use must be discussed with the study doctor&#xD;
                  before beginning the study. The study doctor must approve the method you use&#xD;
                  before they can enter the study. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial&#xD;
                  participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
                  physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms,vasectomy)&#xD;
                  throughout the study and should avoid donating sperm, for 90 days following the&#xD;
                  last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are currently taking the following concomitant medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-cancer Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents&#xD;
                  are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CYP3A4 Agents: Subjects who are currently receiving drugs that are strong&#xD;
                  inducers or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are not eligible. Strong inducers or&#xD;
                  inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited from 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
                  Tazemetostat to the end of the study. Note: Dexamethasone for CNS tumors or&#xD;
                  metastases, on a stable dose, is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are acutely ill with an uncontrolled active infection on systemic&#xD;
             anti-infective agents are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a prior history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/T-cell acute&#xD;
             lymphoblastic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Known QTc prolongation or documentation on screening ECG (QTcF interval on&#xD;
                  screening ECG ≥ 480 milliseconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart&#xD;
                  failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina within 6 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator may be high risk for treatment&#xD;
             complications or unable to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heterosexually active males or females of reproductive potential may not participate&#xD;
             unless they have agreed to use two highly effective contraceptive methods for the&#xD;
             duration of study treatment as Tazemetostat might counteract the effects of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives. Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain&#xD;
             abstinent or use adequate contraceptive methods for 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             Tazemetostat. Male subjects should agree to remain abstinent or use adequate&#xD;
             contraceptive methods, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, and for 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of Tazemetostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding will not be entered on this study because&#xD;
             there is currently no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic&#xD;
             toxicities. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a vaccine containing live virus within 30 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of trial treatment. Note: Most flu vaccines are killed viruses, with the&#xD;
             exception of the intra-nasal vainer (Flu-Mist) which is an attenuated live virus and&#xD;
             therefore prohibited for 30 days prior to first dose. Non-live versions of the&#xD;
             COVID-19 vaccine are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated, or subjects who are&#xD;
             compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness.&#xD;
