  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality contraceptive counseling can strengthen global efforts to reduce the unmet need&#xD;
      for and suboptimal use of modern contraceptives. This study aims to identify a package of&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling interventions designed to strengthen existing contraceptive services&#xD;
      and determine its effectiveness in increasing clients' level of decision-making autonomy and&#xD;
      meeting their contraceptive needs.&#xD;

      Methods The five-phase complex intervention design starts with a pre-formative phase aimed at&#xD;
      mapping potential study sites to establish the sampling frame. The two-part formative phase&#xD;
      first uses participatory approaches to identify the perspectives of clients, including young&#xD;
      people and providers, to ensure research contextualization and address each interest group's&#xD;
      needs and priorities; clinical observations of client-provider encounters to document routine&#xD;
      care form the second part. The design workshop of the third phase will result in the&#xD;
      development of a package of contraceptive counseling interventions. In the fourth and&#xD;
      experimental phase, a multi-intervention, three-arm, single-blinded, parallel cluster&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial will compare routine care (arm 1) with the contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling package (arm 2) and the same package combined with wider method availability (arm&#xD;
      3). The fifth and reflective phase aims to analyze the package's cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      identify implementation barriers and enablers. The primary outcomes are clients' level of&#xD;
      decision-making autonomy and met need for modern contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Applying participatory action research principles in designing, testing, and&#xD;
      scaling up effective, affordable, and sustainable counseling interventions could help&#xD;
      optimize clients' decision-making autonomy and meet their needs for modern contraceptives in&#xD;
      low-resource settings. Recognizing the socio-cultural and health service complexities&#xD;
      surrounding contraception, including client-provider power dynamics, the study assumes that&#xD;
      engaging key stakeholders, including adolescents, women, men, service providers, and&#xD;
      policymakers would be more effective. A set of low-technology interventions will likely&#xD;
      affect, at the individual level and in a sustainable way, the knowledge, attitudes, and&#xD;
      behaviors of women and couples toward contraceptive counseling and provision. At the health&#xD;
      service delivery level, the trial implementation would necessitate a shift in providers'&#xD;
      attitudes and accountability toward a systematic integration into their clinical practice of&#xD;
      must-have and person-centered counseling components, as well as improved health service&#xD;
      organization to ensure the availability of competent staff and diversity of contraceptive&#xD;
      choices.&#xD;
