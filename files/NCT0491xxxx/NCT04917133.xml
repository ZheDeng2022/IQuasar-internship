      Intro:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the brain, inducing a&#xD;
      dysfunction and death of the middle spiny striatal projection neurons and a progressive&#xD;
      alteration of cognitive and motor functions, and psycho-behavioral problems. There is&#xD;
      currently no curative treatment but we know hat a multidisciplinary care can optimize the&#xD;
      functioning and the quality of life of the patients with Huntington's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis of 18studies indicates that exercise and physical activity can improve motor&#xD;
      function, gait speed and balance, and would also improve self-confidence, independence,&#xD;
      well-being, reduced apathy and better socialization with family and friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objective The hypothesis is that the inclusion of a 4 week-program with Adapted&#xD;
      Physical Activity (APA) during a rehabilitation stay will improve some motor, cognitive and&#xD;
      psycho-behavioral abilities, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized into two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will have the &quot;classic&quot; program performed in the standard of care with:&#xD;
      kinesitherapy, soft gym, medico-social workshop, cognitive workshop, creative workshop,&#xD;
      individual care (rehabilitation, rest, and creation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental APA group will have in addition of the classic program, 6 APA workshops per&#xD;
      week with collective support : Adapted Physical workshops, adapted cycling, therapeutic&#xD;
      (horseback/equestrian) riding, cultural or leisure outings, situation tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two groups, at the start of the 4 weeks of rehabilitation program an initial visit&#xD;
      will be performed with, as part of this research, a clinical examination, a neurological&#xD;
      examination, a dietary consultation, as well as a biological assessment as part of habitual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examination, the neurological examination and the dietary consultation will be&#xD;
      performed each week, during the 4 weeks of the program,&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, one month after the rehabilitation of the patient, a visit by&#xD;
      phone-call will be performed for the patient and his caregiver.&#xD;
