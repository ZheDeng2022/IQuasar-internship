  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral suppression among children and adolescents in Kenya is currently sub-optimal at 60% and&#xD;
      63% respectively. Under the current Kenya Ministry of Health Guidelines, clients with viral&#xD;
      load of &gt;1000 copies/ml, should receive a minimum of three enhanced adherence counselling&#xD;
      (EAC) sessions offered every two weeks and have a repeat viral load conducted 3 months after&#xD;
      EAC completion. However, delivery of the EAC is not standardized and there is limited data&#xD;
      available to evaluate the effectiveness of the three counselling sessions. Observational data&#xD;
      from Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF)-supported sites in Homa Bay and&#xD;
      Turkana counties indicate that among children and adolescents with a viral load &gt; 1000&#xD;
      copies/ml, approximately 40% received the recommended three minimum EAC sessions and, after&#xD;
      receiving EAC sessions, viral suppression was 33% in children aged below 9 years, 27% in&#xD;
      adolescents aged between 10-14 years, 38% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and 53% in&#xD;
      adults. The investigators propose to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and&#xD;
      acceptability of a standardized EAC package implemented at EGPAF-supported sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will use mixed methods to evaluate specific clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (viral suppression) adherence, retention) among children and adolescents who receive the EAC&#xD;
      package after suspected treatment failure, and if applicable, after switch to second and&#xD;
      third line. The investigators will use a pre/post intervention assessment to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the EAC package, and qualitative methods (in-depth individual interviews&#xD;
      (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD)) to identify facilitators and barriers to accessing&#xD;
      EAC. A process evaluation will be conducted to determine whether the standardized EAC package&#xD;
      has been implemented as intended across sites. The study population is defined as children&#xD;
      aged 0-19 years receiving Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in selected EGPAF supported sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Policy Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of findings will be done through: internal evaluation report shared with&#xD;
      stakeholders, donors, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) and abstracts presented at local and&#xD;
      international conferences; and, manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
      Findings are expected to inform the continuous review and improvement of HIV Program delivery&#xD;
      in Kenya, as the ministry of health and partners strive to meet international standards.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Viral suppression is a proxy for successful anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and is&#xD;
      the &quot;3rd 90&quot; of the (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 strategy.&#xD;
      In Kenya, viral suppression among children and adolescents is sub-optimal at 60% and 63%&#xD;
      respectively. Potential barriers to viral suppression can be individual (knowledge deficit,&#xD;
      side effects, forgetting, substance abuse, depression, and pill burden), social (stigma, food&#xD;
      insecurity, and family relationships) and structural (clinic frequency, school, relationship&#xD;
      with health worker, long waiting times and lack of dose adjustment). Enhanced adherence&#xD;
      counselling (EAC) aims to identify and address barriers to adherence to enable viral&#xD;
      suppression. Following a client viral load of &gt;1000 copies/ml, the Kenyan 2016 antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy guidelines recommend a minimum of three EAC sessions offered two weeks apart. Changes&#xD;
      in viral load are detected through a repeat test conducted 3 months after EAC. Clients with&#xD;
      repeat VL &lt; 1000 are considered to be virally suppressed and are, therefore, maintained on&#xD;
      the same Antiretroviral(ARV)drug regimen. Clients with persistent viral load above 1000&#xD;
      copies/ml are deemed to have failed first-line treatment, and are thereafter, switched to the&#xD;
      appropriate second line or third line ARV drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the EAC is not standardized and there is limited data available to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the three counselling sessions. Observational data from EGPAF-supported&#xD;
      sites in Homa Bay and Turkana counties indicates that for children and adolescents with a&#xD;
      viral load &gt; 1000 copies/ml, approximately only 40 percent received the recommended three&#xD;
      minimum EAC sessions. Following EAC, viral suppression was 33% in children aged below 9&#xD;
      years, 27% in adolescents aged between 10-14 years, 38% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years&#xD;
      and 53% in adults. The investigators propose to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness&#xD;
      and acceptability of a standardized EAC package implemented at EGPAF-supported sites in Homa&#xD;
      Bay County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to ART among Children with HIV in Kenya An estimated 98,000 children aged between&#xD;
      0-14 years are infected with HIV in Kenya. HIV/AIDS accounts for 15% of mortality among&#xD;
      children less than 5 years of age, while 50-60% of children infected with HIV at birth die&#xD;
      before their second birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to ART, retention in care and achieving viral suppression are substantial&#xD;
      challenges in the management of infants and children on ART. Infants and children rely on&#xD;
      others to administer their medications and to ensure clinic attendance. Caregivers may face&#xD;
      barriers that can reduce medication adherence and clinic attendance. Some caregivers place&#xD;
      too much responsibility for managing medications on older children and adolescents before&#xD;
      they are developmentally able to undertake such tasks. Adherence may also be jeopardized by&#xD;
      social and health issues within a family (e.g. substance abuse, poor physical or mental&#xD;
      health, unstable family relations, and poverty). To improve outcomes for infants and children&#xD;
      on ART, Kenya guidelines recommend provision of caregiver education to all parents/guardians&#xD;
      of children receiving ART. To this end, a caregiver-specific treatment literacy curriculum&#xD;
      has been developed by the MOH for caregiver training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines on use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing HIV Infection in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2016 Kenya Ministry of Health guidelines on the use of ART for treating and preventing&#xD;
      HIV recommend that ART should be started in all patients as soon as possible, preferably&#xD;
      within 2 weeks after confirmation of HIV infection. A patient preparedness assessment is&#xD;
      completed prior to initiating ART. Adherence support mechanisms need to be put in place for&#xD;
      same day ART initiation. Routine monitoring of treatment response in adults, adolescents and&#xD;
      children older than 2 years includes as assessment of VL at 6 months after ART initiation and&#xD;
      12 months after initiation of ART, and if suppressed (VL&lt;1000 copies/ml3), annually&#xD;
      thereafter. Routine monitoring for infants, and children below 2 years is recommended at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months and 12 months after initiation of ART, then annually thereafter if the&#xD;
      patient is stable and virally suppressed. Targeted VL is done for patients with suspected&#xD;
      treatment failure. Targeted VL is also done when considering regimen change or single drug&#xD;
      substitutions in patients who have been on ART for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with persistently high VL (&gt;1,000 copies/ml) after 6 months after initiating&#xD;
      ART, and for those who were previously suppressed but found to have high viral load (VL&gt;1000&#xD;
      copies/ml) after more than 6 months after initiating ART, the guidelines recommend at least 3&#xD;
      patient-focused enhanced adherence counselling sessions within a 3-month period to address&#xD;
      possible barriers before repeating the viral load test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Goals and Objectives Goal: To evaluate clinical outcomes (viral suppression,&#xD;
      adherence, retention) among children and adolescents with suspected treatment failure who&#xD;
      receive the standardized enhanced adherence counselling package as compared to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for children and adolescents with suspected treatment failure who received services&#xD;
      before standardization of enhanced adherence counselling package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Evaluation Design This study uses a mixed method design. The investigators will&#xD;
      use a pre-post design to evaluate specific treatment outcomes among children and adolescents&#xD;
      receiving the standardized EAC package after suspected treatment failure and after switch to&#xD;
      second- and third-line drug regimens. The investigators will conduct qualitative interviews&#xD;
      and abstract patient outcome data to evaluate the effectiveness of the standardized EAC&#xD;
      package, and qualitative methods (in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions)&#xD;
      to identify facilitators and barriers to accessing EAC. A process evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine whether the standardized package of EAC was implemented as intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods.&#xD;
      Pre-intervention, the investigators will abstract patient level data retrospectively from the&#xD;
      charts of patients with VL &gt;1000 copies/ml on demographic characteristics and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and facility level data from summary forms for up to 24 months prior to the&#xD;
      implementation of the standardized EAC package. Viral suppression will be evaluated at 6 and&#xD;
      12 months. After implementation of the standardized EAC package, data will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected from participants with high viral load (&gt;1000 copies). After receiving the&#xD;
      standardized EAC package, participants who are not suppressed will be switched to either&#xD;
      second or third line and data will be collected prospectively from them at every visit. The&#xD;
      investigators will use quantitative and qualitative methods of individual interviews, focus&#xD;
      group discussions, and patient satisfaction surveys to assess acceptability of EAC and&#xD;
      related services, as well as perceptions of facilitators and barriers to services pre and&#xD;
      post intervention. Data related to EAC coverage will be abstracted from facility records.&#xD;
      Coverage is defined as the proportion of patients with suspected treatment failure (STF) who&#xD;
      receive a repeat viral load. A repeat viral load is only done after the completion of EAC and&#xD;
      good adherence. Timelines will be determined using time from date when first high VL is&#xD;
      documented in patient's chart to date of standardized EAC intervention (initiation and&#xD;
      completion). This information will be abstracted from patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The study population will include HIV-positive male and female children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 0-19 years who are enrolled on ART at EGPAF supported sites and have&#xD;
      suspected treatment failure. The investigators will interview parents/caregivers, peer&#xD;
      educators/adherence counselors and health care providers in the same facilities to assess the&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators, including satisfaction with care, to accessing EAC, both pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention. For children below 9 years, the investigators will interview their&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Sites Selection There are 171 facilities supported by EGPAF under the Timiza90 project in&#xD;
      Homa Bay County. Among these, the investigators purposively selected seven high-volume&#xD;
      facilities in order to provide sufficient numbers of children and adolescents with suspected&#xD;
      treatment failure to include in the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Sampling Strategy The investigators purposively selected facilities that had&#xD;
      the greatest number of unsuppressed patients based on viral load tests done between October&#xD;
      2017 to September 2018. In the selected facilities, the investigators captured data from the&#xD;
      records of all patients who were unsuppressed over the period Oct 2016 - Sep 2018,&#xD;
      (pre-intervention). Similarly, investigators captured data from the records of all patients&#xD;
      who were unsuppressed for the post-implementation period, February 2019 - September 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated with an estimated 80% power at a 95% confidence level to&#xD;
      demonstrate a minimum 10% increase in viral suppression due to the standardized EAC, adjusted&#xD;
      for facility clustering (design effect 1.5), and estimates of missing records or lost to&#xD;
      follow-up (+20%). The investigators used probability proportional-to-size sampling, based on&#xD;
      the volume of VL tests by facility and age group; 0-9, 10-14, 15-19 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assume a 4:1 pre/post implementation number of clients unsuppressed for the&#xD;
      0-9-year age group and 3:1 pre/post implementation number of clients unsuppressed for the&#xD;
      10-14- and 15-19- year age groups. Table 3 presents these data, considering missing records&#xD;
      for the retrospective cohort, or lost-to-follow up/missing records for&#xD;
      prospective/post-intervention cohort, which may subsequently reduce the power to be able to&#xD;
      demonstrate a difference. These estimates are unadjusted for facility clustering; the&#xD;
      investigators will adjust for any clustering in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges and limitations Challenges and limitations to the evaluation include the quality&#xD;
      of the patient records and their potential for missing data, the potential for response and&#xD;
      response bias, the need for skilled interviewers and facilitators for the interviews and&#xD;
      FGDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of patients' record data may be limited by poor data quality including missing data&#xD;
      and data entry error especially for the retrospective data. The amount and patterns of&#xD;
      missing data will be evaluated and appropriate statistical methods, as they may be&#xD;
      applicable, will be used to account for the missing data in the analyses. The investigators&#xD;
      will mitigate error resulting from data entry by re-entering a 5 percent random sample of the&#xD;
      records on an ongoing basis. This subsequent data entry will be carried out by a different&#xD;
      data entry clerk from the original clerk. Deviations of &gt;10 percent will result in retraining&#xD;
      of the data entry staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges with FGDs and IDIs include the potential for response bias, (the respondents may&#xD;
      report what the interview would like to hear), differential non-response, (participants who&#xD;
      refuse to be interviewed may be different to those who agree), and recall bias, (participants&#xD;
      may selectively recall stakeholders and events).&#xD;
