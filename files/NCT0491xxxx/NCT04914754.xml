  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEXICO study is an observational study that aims to identify underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      contributing to severe exercise intolerance in the presence of persistent COVID-19 symptoms&#xD;
      (Long COVID).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent symptoms of fatigue and severe exercise intolerance have been observed in some&#xD;
      patients following infection with CoV-2. Termed 'Long COVID', these symptoms may persist for&#xD;
      months after the acute infection has resolved. The mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance&#xD;
      in Long COVID are not fully understood and could be the result of dysfunction at any point&#xD;
      along the transfer pathway of oxygen from atmosphere to skeletal muscle (uptake in the lungs,&#xD;
      heart and blood vessel function and metabolism within skeletal muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MEXICO study aims to assess the function of key components of the oxygen transport&#xD;
      pathway and compare results between 2 groups of patients with Long COVID; those who have&#xD;
      severely impaired exercise capacity versus those with persistent fatigue but preserved&#xD;
      exercise capacity. The study will assess 56 symptomatic patients who have been referred for&#xD;
      further clinical investigation following CoV-2 infection. Participants will undertake&#xD;
      assessment of lung function, exercise capacity, cardiac and vascular function and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle strength and capacity for oxygen extraction at an initial study visit and then 9&#xD;
      months later at a follow-up visit.&#xD;
