      Main objective The intervention study IRECO aims to (1) modify habits of personal care&#xD;
      product use for the participants and (2) evaluate the impact of those modification on urinary&#xD;
      concentration for the following compounds: phthalates, phenols and glycol ether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study aim to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. impact of modification of personal care product on the levels of biomarkers linked to&#xD;
           exposure to environmental pollutant other than phthalates phenol and glycol ether&#xD;
           (untargeted analysis) and biomarkers related to health (such as inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
           and oxidative stress).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. hazard perception linked to the exposure to chemical product present in personal care&#xD;
           product&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. barriers to change habits allowing to decrease exposure to environmental pollutant on&#xD;
           short and long term as well as levers allowing to remove those barriers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many chemical compounds are allowed as ingredients in personal care product. Among those&#xD;
      substances, phenols, phthalates and some glycol ether are widely detected in personal care&#xD;
      product. Few epidemiological studies suggested association between the use of personal care&#xD;
      product and higher urinary concentration of parabens, phthalates, bisphenol A and triclosan.&#xD;
      In France, studies in general population also show those associations and suggested higher&#xD;
      urinary concentration of some glycol ethers in users of cosmetics, (make up, nail polish,&#xD;
      nail polish remover), deodorant, and care product (cream, lotion etc.) The intervention study&#xD;
      IRECO (Intervention to Reduce Exposure to environmental Contaminant) aims to study the impact&#xD;
      of personal care product on exposure levels of compounds from phenol, phthalates and glycol&#xD;
      ether. This project will allow to better characterize sources of exposure of those chemical&#xD;
      compounds for which deleterious effect on health is suspected. The results of this study will&#xD;
      be informative and will allow to bring concrete solutions to the general population who wish&#xD;
      to reduce their exposure. The study will also allow to help decision maker in trying to limit&#xD;
      exposure to chemical compounds such as phthalates and phenols in daily consumption product.&#xD;
      To date, these type of intervention studies were conducted in the USA and no study have been&#xD;
      done in France so far where regulation and consumption habits differs from the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main objectives of the intervention study IRECO are: (1) modify habits of personal&#xD;
      care product use for the participants and (2) evaluate the impact of those modification on&#xD;
      urinary concentration for the following compounds: phthalates, phenols and glycol ether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet those objectives, 100 women with the following inclusion criteria will be included in&#xD;
      the study : (1) aged between 18 and 30 years, (2) accept to not use personal care product or&#xD;
      use only the alternative personal care product distributed by the research team for 5 days,&#xD;
      (3) to not have any known allergies to ingredients in the alternative personal care product,&#xD;
      (4) to benefit from the French health assurance ; (5) live in the area of Grenoble (France)&#xD;
      (6) speak French fluently, (7) have a freezer to store the urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follow-up will include 12 days of measure divided in three phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - The pre-intervention phase which will last for 3 days and during which the volunteer&#xD;
           will (1) collect a sample of each miction with collection tubes given by a field worker,&#xD;
           store those urines in her freezer and (2) use an application to collect data on use of&#xD;
           personal care product, cleaning product, food drinks and drugs intakes as well as the&#xD;
           hour of each miction. At the end of the pre-intervention phase, 24ml of blood will be&#xD;
           withdrawn and a semi-structured interview will be conducted aiming to evaluate&#xD;
           volunteer's knowledge on the studied compounds, the presence of those compounds in the&#xD;
           ingredients of personal care product and the hazard linked to the exposure of those&#xD;
           compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - The intervention phase will last 5 days during which the volunteers will: (1) stop&#xD;
           using her personal care product and use the alternative ones distributed by the research&#xD;
           team , (2) collect a sample of each miction with collection tubes given by a field&#xD;
           worker, store those urines in her freezer and (3) use an application to collect data on&#xD;
           use of personal care product, cleaning product, food drinks and drugs intakes as well as&#xD;
           the hour of each miction. At the end of the pre-intervention phase, 24ml of blood will&#xD;
           be withdrawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - The post intervention phase will last 4 days during which the volunteers will: (1)&#xD;
           collect a sample of each miction with collection tubes given by a field worker, store&#xD;
           those urines in her freezer and (2) use an application to collect data on use of&#xD;
           personal care product, cleaning product, food drinks and drugs intakes as well as the&#xD;
           hour of each miction&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 months after the intervention a fieldworker will go the volunteer's home to conduct a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview on her changes in the use of personal care product following her&#xD;
      participation into the intervention study IRECO.&#xD;
