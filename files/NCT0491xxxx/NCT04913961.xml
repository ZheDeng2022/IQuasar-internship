      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of supine daoyin&#xD;
      in the treatment of AECOPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic progressive disease with high&#xD;
      incidence rate, high mortality rate and high disability rate. Among the people over 40, the&#xD;
      prevalence rate is 10.1%, while the prevalence rate in China is 13.7%. Acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a major event that affects the natural&#xD;
      course of COPD. In particular, most patients with AECOPD have poor prognosis, higher&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, and lower quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation can improve the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of AECOPD patients, increase exercise tolerance, delay the decline of lung&#xD;
      function, and improve the quality of life. In recent years, the clinical research on the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of patients with AECOPD is still in the exploratory stage, which needs to be&#xD;
      supported by clear evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of supine daoyin in the treatment of AECOPD. After admission, the patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups, rehabilitation group and control group, 114 cases in each&#xD;
      group. After routine treatment, the patients began to recover when they reached the initial&#xD;
      rehabilitation standard, and recovered until they reached the discharge standard. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are the length of hospital stay due to acute exacerbation and clinical symptom&#xD;
      score. The secondary outcomes include activities of daily living, dyspnea score, 6-minute&#xD;
      walking distance, lower limb muscle strength, mechanical ventilation and quality of life.&#xD;
      Safety will also be assessed.&#xD;
