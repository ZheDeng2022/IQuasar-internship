  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The value of cytobacteriological examination of urine (CBEU) before double J catheter removal&#xD;
      has not been demonstrated. The aim of this study is to define the interest of this CBEU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double J stents are ureteral catheters that allow urine to flow from the kidney without&#xD;
      difficulty. These catheters protect the ureterovesical anastomosis of a renal transplant or&#xD;
      reduce the postoperative oedema, for example after stone removal by ureteroscopy. These&#xD;
      catheters are removed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthesia. Post ablation&#xD;
      infections of double J catheters have been poorly studied but their incidence varied&#xD;
      according to the populations and the definition used (10 to 54% for colonization, 1 to 10%&#xD;
      for symptomatic infection). The national and international guidelines advocate a routine&#xD;
      urine bacterial culture (UBC) before double J catheter removal as the procedure is in contact&#xD;
      with urine; but there is no evidence of its interest. In case of positivity of this culture,&#xD;
      it is recommended to delay the intervention or, what is more often chosen, to treat with&#xD;
      antibiotic to cover the procedure. Investigators can thus ask 2 questions: is it rightful to&#xD;
      withdraw a double J removal while the UBC is falsely negative and in case of a positive&#xD;
      bacterial culture is there an increased risk of post-ablation infection?&#xD;
