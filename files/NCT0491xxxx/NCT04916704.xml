      This is a prospective observational study to determine the frequency and magnitude of&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody&#xD;
      (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) in the acute phase of the disease (within 12 months of&#xD;
      diagnosis or relapse and commencement of induction of remission therapy) and its association&#xD;
      with clinical outcomes. The investigators hypothesise that reactivation of CMV during the&#xD;
      initial 12 months following diagnosis or relapse of AAV occurs frequently but is generally&#xD;
      asymptomatic. Based on the investigators' preliminary data the investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesise that subclinical reactivation of CMV during this period will be associated with&#xD;
      adverse clinical outcomes, including the severity of vasculitis, the response to treatment&#xD;
      and the damage caused by vasculitis. The investigators also hypothesise that CMV reactivation&#xD;
      will be associated with an increased frequency of non-CMV infection and reduced response to&#xD;
      clinically indicated vaccinations, as well as an increased risk of venous blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' research has recently shown that asymptomatic reactivation of CMV is a&#xD;
      frequent event in AAV patients, occurring in roughly 25% of AAV patients in remission.&#xD;
      However, the frequency of asymptomatic reactivation of CMV during the acute phase of the&#xD;
      disease is not known. The investigators have previously shown that CMV infection and&#xD;
      surrogate markers of CMV reactivation in patients with AAV are associated with worse outcomes&#xD;
      such as reduced kidney function, increased risk of infection and death, increased risk of&#xD;
      blood clots and increased stiffness of the blood vessels, which is a risk factor for heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke. If CMV reactivation during the acute phase of the disease is common and&#xD;
      linked with worse outcomes, this study may then lead on to future research involving&#xD;
      treatment to prevent CMV reactivation aiming to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be looking to recruit patients under the care of the Queen Elizabeth&#xD;
      Hospital with newly diagnosed or recently relapsed AAV in the last 2 weeks who are positive&#xD;
      for previous CMV infection.The investigators will follow these patients up with 10 visits&#xD;
      over 12 months; where possible these will coincide with participants' usual vasculitis clinic&#xD;
      appointments. At each visit the participants will be required to give blood and urine samples&#xD;
      and answer questions related to their vasculitis.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study to determine the frequency and magnitude of CMV reactivation&#xD;
      in patients with AAV in the acute phase of the disease (within 12 months of diagnosis or&#xD;
      relapse and commencement of induction of remission therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAVs are systemic autoimmune inflammatory conditions characterized by necrotising&#xD;
      inflammation affecting small to medium blood vessels leading to end-organ damage. Without&#xD;
      treatment AAV is life-threatening; treatment involves powerful immunosuppression to induce&#xD;
      remission, followed by maintenance treatment to prevent disease relapse. Treatment induction&#xD;
      for both new-onset AAV and major life-threatening relapses is usually in the form of&#xD;
      corticosteroids in combination with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Whilst prognosis&#xD;
      has significantly improved with current treatment options for AAV, there remains significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions, especially during the first 12&#xD;
      months following diagnosis and commencement of induction of remission therapy. Infection is&#xD;
      the leading cause of death within the first 12 months, accounting for approximately 50% of&#xD;
      mortality as well as considerable morbidity and hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a widely prevalent herpesvirus that is not cleared after primary&#xD;
      infection and establishes a state of persistent infection. CMV is present in over half the&#xD;
      population by middle age and is thought to undergo a state of latency with intermittent&#xD;
      periods of viral reactivation. This can be a significant clinical problem amongst patients&#xD;
      that receive immunosuppression for bone marrow or solid organ transplants. Although, patients&#xD;
      with AAV are heavily immunosuppressed, symptomatic CMV disease is uncommon in this patient&#xD;
      group (2%). However, asymptomatic reactivation is not uncommon. In a proof-of-concept study,&#xD;
      the investigators have shown that asymptomatic subclinical reactivation of CMV is a frequent&#xD;
      event amongst patients with stable AAV in remission, occurring in approximately 1 in 4 CMV&#xD;
      seropositive AAV patients in remission over a 12-month period. The investigators and others&#xD;
      have shown that asymptomatic CMV infection is associated with key adverse clinical outcomes&#xD;
      amongst patients with AAV, such as reduced kidney function, increased risk of infection and&#xD;
      mortality, increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and increased arterial stiffness, a&#xD;
      marker of cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that subclinical reactivation of CMV is&#xD;
      associated with the expansion of a cytotoxic T-cell subset known as CD4+CD28null T-cells.&#xD;
      Importantly, significant expansion of CD4+CD28null T-cells is exclusively seen in CMV&#xD;
      seropositive patients. The investigators recently demonstrated that CD4+CD28null T-cells&#xD;
      expansion is linked to a reduced functional capacity of the CD4 compartment and subsequent&#xD;
      reduced response to the pneumonia vaccine, amongst patients with AAV in remission.&#xD;
      Importantly, the investigators found that participants with evidence of subclinical CMV&#xD;
      reactivation during the 6 months preceding the vaccination did not mount a response to the&#xD;
      vaccine, but treatment with antiviral Valacyclovir suppressed CD4+CD28null T-cells expansion&#xD;
      and suppression of CD4+CD28null T-cells was in itself associated with a better response to&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that CMV reactivation will be significantly higher during the&#xD;
      acute phase of the disease process, both with de-novo disease and major relapses, at a time&#xD;
      where patients are exposed to intensive immunosuppressive therapy and heightened&#xD;
      inflammation. However, the degree to which subclinical reactivation of CMV occurs during the&#xD;
      acute phase of AAV is not currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this current proposed study confirms that subclinical CMV reactivation occurs frequently&#xD;
      during the acute phase of AAV and is linked to worse patient outcomes, the investigators&#xD;
      would propose that suppression of CMV during the acute phase of the disease would be a&#xD;
      potentially valuable therapeutic target to improve patient outcomes and will seek funding for&#xD;
      a multi-centre interventional study to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 participants will be recruited within 14 days of disease presentation or major&#xD;
      disease relapse and commencement of induction of remission therapy, over a period of 18&#xD;
      months. For the purposes of this study, a major relapse will be defined as a disease relapse&#xD;
      that requires re-induction of remission therapy with high dose corticosteroids AND either&#xD;
      rituximab or cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed up for a total of 12 months during their usual clinical&#xD;
      visits at the NIHR / Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF) at University&#xD;
      Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT). Some study visits may be conducted at a&#xD;
      remote offsite location in order to minimize patient hospital visits in light of the current&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that the study will take 36 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the frequency and magnitude of CMV reactivation during the acute phase (first&#xD;
      12 months) following diagnosis or relapse of AAV and commencement of induction of remission&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be drawn at all time points to measure CMV viral DNA copies by&#xD;
      quantitative PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed at UHBFT virology laboratory using a validated commercial assay, which&#xD;
      is routinely utilized for clinical samples. As this test does not form part of standard of&#xD;
      care for these patients, the CMV PCR results will be held back by the Virology Laboratory and&#xD;
      released to the research team at the end of the study. The investigators will therefore be&#xD;
      blind to the frequency of subclinical CMV reactivation over the 12-month study period whilst&#xD;
      the clinical outcome data is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where there is clinical suspicion of symptomatic CMV reactivation or CMV end-organ&#xD;
      disease, separate relevant samples will be sent as per clinical need. Should symptomatic CMV&#xD;
      reactivation or CMV end-organ disease be diagnosed or strongly suspected, the management will&#xD;
      be as per standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine whether subclinical asymptomatic CMV reactivation during the acute phase of&#xD;
      AAV is associated with adverse patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subclinical asymptomatic CMV reactivation will be defined as a detectable viral titre of &gt; 20&#xD;
      copies / ml in at least one sample of blood or urine in the absence of symptoms or signs in&#xD;
      keeping with CMV disease, and in the absence of symptoms or signs of what would be consistent&#xD;
      with CMV syndrome (CMV syndrome as defined in the transplant population). Patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic CMV reactivation and / or CMV end-organ disease would be excluded from these&#xD;
      comparisons. However, based on clinical experience, the investigators anticipate that such&#xD;
      symptomatic disease will be very uncommon in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between subclinical asymptomatic CMV and the following outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birmingham Vasculitis Activity score (BVAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to achieve disease remission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteinuria at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney function at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probability of dialysis dependency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient well-being at 12 months (patient-reported outcome using AAV-PRO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concentration of urinary markers of inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease activity will be monitored using the BVAS at all time points. Inflammation will be&#xD;
      assessed by CRP determination at all time points (as per standard of care). Disease burden&#xD;
      will be assessed using the VDI score at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Patient well-being will be&#xD;
      assessed as a patient-reported outcome using the AAV-PRO tool at 0, 3 and 12 months. Clinical&#xD;
      assessment and standard of care clinical blood and urine test monitoring will take place at&#xD;
      all time points to evaluate disease remission, ongoing activity and document renal function,&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy status and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) to assess the level of&#xD;
      proteinuria. Time to remission will be defined as time to attaining a BVAS score of 0. Time&#xD;
      to renal recovery will be defined as time to achieving dialysis independence or time to&#xD;
      stabilisation of renal function following initial improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of urinary soluble CD163 and MCP-1 has recently been shown to accurately&#xD;
      reflect the presence of subtle active renal vasculitis. Urinary CD163 and MCP-1 will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 10 and 12 months from cryopreserved urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether subclinical asymptomatic CMV reactivation during the acute phase of&#xD;
           AAV is associated with increased frequency of non-CMV infection and reduced response to&#xD;
           clinically indicated vaccinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether subclinical asymptomatic CMV reactivation during the acute phase of&#xD;
           AAV is associated with markers of endothelial dysfunction, increased pro-coagulant&#xD;
           activity and thromboembolic risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at every study visit as per standard of care and any infection&#xD;
      experienced by the participants will be documented along with treatment received.&#xD;
      Participants will be vaccinated with clinically indicated vaccinations as per standard of&#xD;
      care during the follow up period. A plasma sample will be drawn immediately prior to&#xD;
      vaccination and 2 months after vaccination to measure vaccination specific functional&#xD;
      antibodies in order to determine the response to vaccination. Samples will be tested at the&#xD;
      Clinical Immunology Laboratory (University of Birmingham), using a validated assay utilized&#xD;
      for clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected from participants at&#xD;
      the specified time points outlined in Table 1 and cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood will be collected in EDTA tubes (4mL) and centrifuged to yield plasma. Citrated&#xD;
      whole blood (5mL) will also be collected and centrifuged within 1 hour of collection to yield&#xD;
      platelet-free plasma, before being frozen at -80 degrees Celsius until further use. Whole&#xD;
      blood will be collected in lithium heparin tubes (42mL) and processed within four hours to&#xD;
      separate PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma aliquots will subsequently be thawed and batch assayed to measure markers of&#xD;
      endothelial damage, markers of inflammation and microparticle tissue factor activity. PBMC&#xD;
      will be thawed and immunophenotyped to enumerate T-cell and monocyte subsets including&#xD;
      CD4+CD28null T-cells and CCR2 expressing monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will have a maximum of 11 interactions with the research team. The&#xD;
      timing of the study visits has been selected to coincide with clinical visits that patients&#xD;
      would be expected to attend as part of their ongoing clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will either be recruited as in-patients or out-patients. For in-patients, the&#xD;
      first contact will be face-to-face during their inpatient stay, to provide verbal and written&#xD;
      information, including a Patient Information Sheet (PIS). The baseline visit will then occur&#xD;
      the following day, at which the patient will be given the option to be recruited to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For out-patients, the first contact will be written information in the post (PIS) and contact&#xD;
      details for the research team will be provided. This will be followed by a telephone&#xD;
      consultation to answer any questions and establish interest. For those patients who express&#xD;
      interest, the third point of contact (baseline visit) will be face-to-face with the research&#xD;
      team at their routine AAV clinic appointment or treatment schedule; this will not be an&#xD;
      additional hospital visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 study clinic appointments will be held at UHBFT. During the baseline visit&#xD;
      participants will be recruited to the study either during their hospital admission or during&#xD;
      a scheduled hospital visit either to the clinic or for treatment. After inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met, written informed consent will be obtained for all patients prior to&#xD;
      enrolment. A clinical assessment with be made, BVAS and VDI calculated, AAV-PRO completed,&#xD;
      and blood and urine samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining 9 follow-up visits will be scheduled at intervals over the next 12 months. In&#xD;
      light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, patients are only attending face-to-face hospital&#xD;
      appointments when necessary, with telephone consultations being conducted when appropriate;&#xD;
      decisions on who is allocated to which appointment type are being made on an individual&#xD;
      patient basis. The investigators will not bring participants to the hospital for additional&#xD;
      study visits where they cannot come through a 'clean' pathway; in these circumstances, with&#xD;
      the agreement of the subject, the investigators will arrange for home study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit the research team will complete a clinical assessment, calculate BVAS&#xD;
      and VDI where applicable and further blood and urine samples will be taken. The AAV-PRO will&#xD;
      be sent out to patients a few days prior to their study visit via the post or email (at their&#xD;
      preference) and patients will be asked to return completed forms at their visit. The&#xD;
      investigators will aim to give participants clinically indicated vaccinations during follow&#xD;
      up as per standard of care at month 10; the investigators will contact the patient's GP to&#xD;
      clarify previous vaccine history prior to administration. Participants will have completed&#xD;
      the study when the 12-month follow-up visit has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study with the primary outcome to estimate the rate of subclinical&#xD;
      CMV reactivation, so there is no formal power calculation. There is also a limit to the&#xD;
      number of patients that will meet the inclusion criteria during the study timeframe. As such,&#xD;
      no formal power calculation was performed, with the aim instead being to recruit as many&#xD;
      patients as is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that they will recruit up to 50 patients over 18 months, as they&#xD;
      expect this number will be the maximum feasible within a single centre with a population of&#xD;
      250 patients (around 40 new diagnoses AAV/year). The investigators expect around 70% of this&#xD;
      cohort will be CMV seropositive. Patients recruited following a major relapse of AAV will be&#xD;
      limited to 30% of the total study population. Historically, the AAV cohort of patients is a&#xD;
      very well-motivated group of patients with very high participation in research studies and&#xD;
      usually excellent clinic attendance. As such, the investigators would expect the vast&#xD;
      majority of eligible patients to be willing to join the study, and for negligible loss to&#xD;
      follow up or study withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of study data will be conducted by the research team with the assistance of a&#xD;
      statistical advisor. The main analysis will be conducted on the entire study cohort, although&#xD;
      planned sub-group analysis will also evaluate potential differences between patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed AAV, and those with a major relapse of previously diagnosed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary outcome of CMV reactivation will be performed using a time-to-event&#xD;
      approach, in order to account for the time that this was identified, and the potential for&#xD;
      varying follow up times across the cohort in patients that do not complete the study. As&#xD;
      such, patients will be censored where they are either lost to follow up, withdraw from the&#xD;
      study, or die during the study period. In addition to performing this analysis for the cohort&#xD;
      as a whole, a subgroup analysis will also be performed after excluding those with CMV&#xD;
      reactivation at the baseline visit, in order to estimate the rate of new-onset CMV&#xD;
      reactivation after the commencement of treatment for AAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary and tertiary outcomes are based on comparisons between patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic CMV reactivation, and those without CMV reactivation. Also, in addition to&#xD;
      dichotomising patients based on CMV reactivation, analyses will be performed which consider&#xD;
      the actual viral titre in those where it is detectable, to assess whether there is a&#xD;
      dose-response relationship between viral load and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the secondary and tertiary outcomes will utilise differing methodologies,&#xD;
      depending on how the outcomes of interest are quantified. For outcomes measured at a single&#xD;
      time point (e.g. VDI at 12 months), comparisons by asymptomatic CMV reactivation status will&#xD;
      be performed using independent group comparisons, such as independent samples t-tests.&#xD;
      Outcomes measured at multiple time points (e.g. clinical bloods recorded at every visit) will&#xD;
      be assessed using repeated-measures analyses, in order to account for the correlations&#xD;
      between multiple samples contributed by the same patient. For time-to-event outcomes (e.g.&#xD;
      time to achieve disease remission), analyses will be based on Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox&#xD;
      regression models. Finally, count-based outcomes (e.g. development of non-CMV infections)&#xD;
      will be analysed as an incidence (per patient-year), in order to account for the follow up&#xD;
      time contributed by each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all analyses, the asymptomatic CMV reactivation status will initially be considered as a&#xD;
      fixed-effects variable, such that patients will be assigned to a CMV reactivation group,&#xD;
      regardless of when this was first diagnosed. However, analyses will also be performed where&#xD;
      this factor is treated as a time-dependent covariate, such that all patients are assigned to&#xD;
      the negative group at the commencement of follow up, before transitioning to the CMV&#xD;
      reactivation group at the time that this was diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE/MONITORING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be subject to inspection and audit by UHBFT under their remit as sponsor and&#xD;
      other regulatory bodies, to ensure adherence to GCP and regulations. The named investigators&#xD;
      will allow study-related monitoring, audits, Research Ethics Committee review and regulatory&#xD;
      inspectors (where appropriate) by providing direct access to study source data and associated&#xD;
      documents e.g. consent forms, UHBFT laboratory results etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SAE form should be completed and submitted to the Principal Investigator for all SAEs&#xD;
      within 24 hours. The Principal Investigator's assessment of causality of SAEs (i.e. their&#xD;
      relationship to trial treatment) will be reported on the Serious Adverse Event form; the&#xD;
      investigators do not anticipate any related adverse events associated with this observational&#xD;
      study. Related and/or unexpected events will be reported to the main Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee by the Chief Investigator within 15 days of them becoming aware of the event, in&#xD;
      line with HRA recommendations.&#xD;

        Patients with new or relapsing AAV will be identified through the vasculitis&#xD;
        multi-disciplinary weekly meeting, clinician colleagues and the vasculitis specialist&#xD;
        nurse. Up to 50 participants will be recruited within 14 days of disease presentation or&#xD;
        major disease relapse and commencement of induction of remission therapy, over a period of&#xD;
        18 months. For the purposes of this study, a major relapse will be defined as a disease&#xD;
        relapse that requires re-induction of remission therapy with high dose corticosteroids AND&#xD;
        either rituximab or cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
