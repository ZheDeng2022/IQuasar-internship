  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of individuals with chronic kidney disease have concomitant hypertension and&#xD;
      the majority fail to achieve blood pressure control &lt;130/80 mmHg, leading to high risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and end-stage kidney disease. A stepwise combination of lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications and drug therapy is recommended to lower blood pressure; however, adherence to&#xD;
      time-intensive lifestyle interventions such as aerobic exercise in patients with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease is poor. This clinical trial seeks to establish the efficacy of&#xD;
      high-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training, a novel time-efficient lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention, for lowering systolic blood pressure and improving endothelial function in&#xD;
      midlife and older adults with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease and inadequately&#xD;
      controlled hypertension, and to use innovate translational assessments to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern that has reached epidemic&#xD;
      proportions. Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) and end-stage kidney disease, yet 50-70% of adults with CKD fail to achieve blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) control to &lt;130/80 mmHg. A key process linking high systolic BP (SBP) to CVD is&#xD;
      vascular endothelial dysfunction, which is due in part to increased reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      and decreased nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is also critical in the regulation of renal blood&#xD;
      flow, which is intimately related to blood pressure and vascular function. High-resistance&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a novel lifestyle intervention involving&#xD;
      repeated inhalations against a resistive load using a hand-held device. This study will test&#xD;
      whether high-resistance IMST (75% of maximal inspiratory pressure [75% PImax]; 30 breaths [5&#xD;
      min]/day, 6 days [30 min]/week) vs. Sham training (15% PImax) reduces resting systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure in midlife and older adults (&gt;50 years) with moderate-to-severe CKD and inadequately&#xD;
      controlled hypertension. Changes in 24-hr systolic blood pressure and endothelial function&#xD;
      (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) are secondary outcomes. Innovative translational&#xD;
      techniques will be used to provide mechanistic insight, including serum incubation in&#xD;
      endothelial cell culture, metabolomics analysis, endothelial cell collections, and assessment&#xD;
      of renal blood flow by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
