      Objective: This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of post-infectious olfactory dysfunction&#xD;
      treated with different doses of corticosteroids and specify factors related to the curative&#xD;
      effect. Methods: The medical records of patients diagnosed with post-infectious olfactory&#xD;
      dysfunction from January 2020 to december 2025 were reviewed. All patients were treated with&#xD;
      different doses of oral corticosteroids for 12 days or they inhaled corticosteroids for 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;

      All patients underwent nasal endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the olfactory&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 1 week after the symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny nose subsided,&#xD;
      olfactory disorders did not improve. Nasal sinusitis and other lesions were excluded by&#xD;
      physical and endoscopic examinations and imaging (sinus computed tomography and MRI), and the&#xD;
      disorder defined as post-infectious olfactory dysfunction. All participants had a clear&#xD;
      history of upper respiratory tract infection; other causes of olfactory disorders were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a subjective olfactory test at the first visit and after the last&#xD;
      treatment. The olfactory detection threshold and recognition threshold were tested using a&#xD;
      T&amp;T olfactory meter (Japan's First Drug Industry Co., Ltd.)，which is commonly used in&#xD;
      patients suffering from smelling disorders in asian, and correlate well with The University&#xD;
      of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)[13]. The test was carried out according to&#xD;
      the instructions on the olfactory meter, and the average recognition threshold of five&#xD;
      olfactory elements was calculated to determine the degree of olfactory loss. The test results&#xD;
      revealed normal (&lt;1.0), mildly decreased (1.1 ≤ 2.5), moderately decreased (2.6 ≤ 4.0),&#xD;
      severely decreased (4.1 ≤ 5.5), and complete lack of the sense of smell (&gt; 5.5). In order to&#xD;
      reduce the learning effects of repeated testing, all patients were order to close their eyes&#xD;
      during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were treated with three protocols: (1) oral methylprednisolone, 40 mg for 3&#xD;
      days, 20 mg for 3 days, and 8 mg for 6 days; (2) oral methylprednisolone, 20 mg for 3 days,&#xD;
      10 mg for 3 days, and 4 mg for 6 days; and (3) budesonide atomization suspension (AstraZeneca&#xD;
      Trading Co., Ltd.) inhaled through the nose atomized with an air compression atomizer for 4&#xD;
      weeks, 2 mg for the first 2 weeks and reduced to 1 mg for the last 2 weeks. At the same time,&#xD;
      all patients received olfactory training for 12 weeks as proposed by Hummel et al[3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat T&amp;T subjective olfactory test will be performed after the treatment. Patients with&#xD;
      normal sense of smell will be defined as cured; patients with average T&amp;T recognition&#xD;
      threshold decreased by 1 point will be defined as improved; patients with average T&amp;T&#xD;
      recognition threshold decreased by 2 points or more, which did not reach the normal range,&#xD;
      will be defined as significantly improved; and patients with average T&amp;T recognition&#xD;
      threshold decreased by 1 point, with or without falling, will be defined as invalid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAS 9.4 software was used for statistical analysis. The treatment plan was divided into three&#xD;
      groups, and the dependent variable was a disordered three categorical variable. The&#xD;
      description of the numerical variables of the normal distribution adopts the mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation, and the analysis of variance is used for statistical analysis; the description of&#xD;
      the numerical variables of the non-normal distribution adopts the median (interquartile&#xD;
      range), and the rank sum test of multi-sample comparison with a completely random design is&#xD;
      adopted conduct statistical analysis. Categorical variables are described by R*C contingency&#xD;
      table, and the chi-square test and Fisher exact probability method are used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The alpha level of the statistical test is set to 0.05.&#xD;
