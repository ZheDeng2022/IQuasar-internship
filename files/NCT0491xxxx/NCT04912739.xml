    <textblock>
      The County Council of Region Skåne, Sweden, has recently initiated Targeted Health Dialogues&#xD;
      in primary care. The prevention program includes health dialogues provided by specially&#xD;
      trained personnel, collection of clinical and laboratory data as well as questionnaire data&#xD;
      on, e.g., individual health and health behaviors. So far, it enrolls all 40-year old Swedish&#xD;
      and foreign-born inhabitants in the county and it will also include all 50- and 60-year old&#xD;
      persons within a near future. A research project will be integrated within the program where&#xD;
      the collected data will be linked, on the individual level, to national and regional data on&#xD;
      hospital admissions, clinical diagnoses from specialist clinics and primary care, causes of&#xD;
      death, and prescriptions. The individual linkages will also include population data on&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics, neighborhood of residence and family relations. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for analyses of molecular biomarkers. The research project will&#xD;
      examine associations between potential predictors and future risk of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      and other serious diseases, such as cancer, and also whether the effect of the prevention&#xD;
      program is modified by these potential predictors. The effect of the intervention will be&#xD;
      examined, and whether the protocol needs to be modified in order to develop more precise and&#xD;
      personalized medicine.&#xD;

      The County Council of Region Skåne, the third most populous region in Sweden with 1.4 million&#xD;
      inhabitants, has recently initiated Targeted Health Dialogues in primary care with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal to improve cardiovascular health in the entire population in Skåne. Targeted&#xD;
      health dialogues have previously been proven to improve health behaviors and risk factors and&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The prevention program&#xD;
      includes, in addition to the health dialogues provided by specially trained personnel,&#xD;
      collection of clinical and laboratory data (e.g. blood pressure, BMI, waist hip ratio,&#xD;
      lipids, fasting blood glucose) as well as detailed questionnaire data on, e.g., individual&#xD;
      health and symptoms, family history, diet, physical activity, alcohol and smoking. So far, it&#xD;
      enrolls all 40-year old Swedish and foreign-born inhabitants in the county and it will also&#xD;
      include all 50- and 60-year old persons within a near future. The County Council and the&#xD;
      Ethical Review Board have granted permission to integrate a research project within the&#xD;
      program where collected data will be linked, at the individual level, to national and&#xD;
      regional data on hospital admissions, clinical diagnoses from specialist clinics and primary&#xD;
      care, causes of death, and prescriptions. The individual linkages will also include&#xD;
      population data on sociodemographic characteristics, neighborhood of residence and family&#xD;
      relations. In addition to the collection and linkages of these data, blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for analyses of molecular biomarkers. The research project will allow for examining&#xD;
      associations between a number of potential predictors and future risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and other serious diseases, such as cancer, and also whether the effect of the&#xD;
      prevention program is modified by these potential predictors. The effect of the intervention&#xD;
      will be examined and whether the protocol needs to be modified in order to develop more&#xD;
      precise and personalized medicine.&#xD;

    <description>Before the targeted health dialogue, the participants fill in a questionnaire about health behaviors, background characteristics and self-rated health. Samples for blood glucose and total cholesterol are taken. BMI, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure are measured. The results are summoned in a &quot;health curve&quot;, which is discussed with specially trained healthcare personnel in a Targeted heath dialogue. In a sub-group, blood samples are collected for molecular analyses.</description>
