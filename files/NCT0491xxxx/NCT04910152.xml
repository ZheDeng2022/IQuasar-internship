  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects of PLX51107 in treating steroid-refractory&#xD;
      acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). PLX51107 is a novel, potent non-benzodiazepine&#xD;
      structured small molecule BET inhibitor with a unique binding mode selective for BRD4&#xD;
      inhibition and a more tolerable side effect profile. PLX51107 may work better in treating&#xD;
      steroid-refractory acute GVHD.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BRD4 inhibitor PLX51107 (PLX51107) as a single&#xD;
      agent for allogeneic transplant recipients with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of orally administered&#xD;
      PLX51107 in steroid-refractory acute GVHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of PLX51107 in steroid-refractory acute GVHD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BRD4 inhibitor PLX51107 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
