  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open, two-stage, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Utidelone in advanced solid tumors (excluding breast cancer, lung&#xD;
      cancer, and colorectal cancer) that have failed standard of treatment or were unable to&#xD;
      perform standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is divided into 2 stages, screening stage and expansion stage. In the screening&#xD;
      stage, 10 patients were enrolled for each tumor type(including Squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head and neck, Esophageal cancer, Stomach cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Cholangiocarcinoma,&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer and Other solid tumors). Based on the results of the tumor type screening&#xD;
      stage, the sponsor and the main investigator will have a discussion and have the alignment of&#xD;
      tumor types to enter the expansion stage. The expansion stage will refine the inclusion /&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and may adjust the treatment plan based on the tumor type and the&#xD;
      combination drug selection. A total of 30-50 patients (including patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      screening stage) were enrolled in each specified tumor type during the expansion stage.&#xD;
