  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ophthalmology clientele is vulnerable in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic because of their age and comorbidities. Specifically, elderly patients&#xD;
      aged 65 and above with glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      require regular follow-ups and commonly suffer from additional comorbidities. Further,&#xD;
      because of the proximity between the patient and health care personnel during&#xD;
      ophthalmological examinations, the risk of infection during visits is significant. The&#xD;
      delicate balance between the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and visual loss in delaying cases&#xD;
      is a psychological stressor to both patients and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study accumulating the data of 425 patients aged 65 and above with various&#xD;
      eye diseases will be conducted. Participants will be presented with a set of online&#xD;
      questionnaires designed to collect data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL),&#xD;
      vision-related quality of life (VRQOL), depression symptoms, anxiety, sleep quality,&#xD;
      community integration, and their experience with tele-consultations. Data on their delay in&#xD;
      medical and surgical follow-up and treatment will also be collected through medical chart&#xD;
      reviews. This study can help quantify the collateral impact of the COVID-19 beyond the direct&#xD;
      impact of the virus, to improve future quality of care guidelines on non-COVID-19 conditions,&#xD;
      and to help plan patient prioritization once restrictions are eased.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Like&#xD;
      many healthcare departments, the department ophthalmology presents risk of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. As a result, the present pandemic has led officials to rethink the management of&#xD;
      patient lists and to restrict the patients to be assessed or to be operated based on the&#xD;
      urgency of their condition in accordance with ministerial guidelines. A delay in visits might&#xD;
      increase the risk of visual loss not only through the delay of necessary care, but also&#xD;
      through an increase in non-adherence to treatment. Indeed, patients themselves might decide&#xD;
      to interrupt their treatment or postpone their visit for fear of contracting the disease.&#xD;
      There is concern not only about compliance to treatment, but also about accessibility issues&#xD;
      to medications in high-demand and modifications of treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly people aged 65 and above are commonly afflicted by many eye diseases with vision&#xD;
      loss. Furthermore, during times of the COVID-19 pandemic, this population can be vulnerable&#xD;
      to possible vision loss due to a delay of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, it is being proposed to perform a cross-sectional study using a sample of&#xD;
      patients from this population to gather information on follow-up and treatment delays&#xD;
      associated with the pandemic's offloading measures as well as any adverse effects on visual&#xD;
      acuity that have occurred during the pandemic. The evidence collected from this study could&#xD;
      be translated into clinical practices helping to provide recommendations to adjust the&#xD;
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ophthalmological management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual loss, potentially due to the reasons that were mentioned above, can bring about&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and deteriorate quality of life (QOL). In the proposed study, the&#xD;
      investigators have included questionnaires to assess the various stressors brought on during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic such as fear of vision loss, health-related QOL, vision-related QOL,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, number of ER visits for deterioration of&#xD;
      mental health. This evidence base collected from this study could, once again, be translated&#xD;
      into clinical practices helping to provide recommendations to adjust the response to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic in ophthalmological management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a cross-sectional survey, the investigators aim to build an evidence base to provide&#xD;
      decision makers with high quality, timely, and relevant evidence and to translate this&#xD;
      knowledge into clinical practices by providing real-time knowledge and recommendations to&#xD;
      adjust the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ophthalmological management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: To build an evidence base to provide decision makers with high quality,&#xD;
      timely, and relevant evidence and to translate this knowledge into clinical practices by&#xD;
      providing real-time knowledge and recommendations to adjust the response to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in ophthalmological management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Using a cross-sectional survey, the investigators will: 1) document the&#xD;
      follow-up and treatment delays associated with the pandemic's offloading measures 2)&#xD;
      determine whether any adverse effects on visual acuity occurred during the pandemic 3)&#xD;
      determine impact on mental health (e.g. fear of vision loss, health-related QOL,&#xD;
      vision-related QOL, depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, number of ER visits for&#xD;
      deterioration of mental health) 4) determine the role and impact of virtual care&#xD;
      (telemedicine, teleconsultation) in the state of the current pandemic and provide additional&#xD;
      data for the long-term implementation of telemedicine in vision care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional survey will be performed to gather the data required to build an evidence&#xD;
      base to provide decision makers with high-quality, timely, and relevant evidence, as well as&#xD;
      to translate this knowledge into clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the Ivey Eye Institute, St. Joseph's Health Care London, ON will be recruited&#xD;
      in-person, similar to the previous and ongoing research studies by the investigators, based&#xD;
      on inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is being hoped to complete recruitment within a year of receiving ethics approval. Based&#xD;
      on previous experience, it is planned to recruit at an average rate of 4 participants/week in&#xD;
      a staggered manner over a 9 to 10-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Fidelity, and Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day-to-day Management of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAs will oversee coordination and monitoring of the overall study. They will prepare all&#xD;
      documents required for informed consent and questionnaire administration. They will also be&#xD;
      responsible for recruitment, data management (Qualtrics), data analysis, and preparation of&#xD;
      presentations and manuscripts. They will be trained on the TTO, VFQ-25, CES-D, HADS-A, PSQI,&#xD;
      and CIQ by the Primary Investigator (PI). They will receive ongoing supervision throughout&#xD;
      the study by the PI and the co-investigator with the aim of approaching a reliability level&#xD;
      of Intra Class Correlation (ICC) &gt; .80 on all scales. Weekly meetings will be organized by&#xD;
      the investigators to ensure recruitment and progression of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity of Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAs will be trained and supervised weekly by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, Screening, and Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      425 eye disease patients will be recruited for this study as described previously in the&#xD;
      recruitment procedures section. Physicians at Ivey Eye Institute will identify potential&#xD;
      participants based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as described previously. The&#xD;
      potential participants will be asked whether they wish to participate in the following study.&#xD;
      Physicians will then refer the patients expressing interest who meet recruitment criteria to&#xD;
      the RA for an in-person interview to obtain informed consent or obtain contact information to&#xD;
      obtain informed consent electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be presented with an electronic letter of information and consent&#xD;
      (LOI), either in-person with the RA or online through the participant email. If the&#xD;
      participant contact is made in-person, the RA will briefly describe the study to these&#xD;
      potential participants and offer to send an electronic copy of the LOI by e-mail or by mail&#xD;
      as per the participants' request. Upon receiving a consent to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      RA will collect the participant's email and telephone number. If the participant contact is&#xD;
      made online, the RA will send an email to the potential participants that contains the&#xD;
      electronic LOI. The LOI will contain contact information of the study investigators and RAs&#xD;
      on the front cover page and the study description. In addition, those patients expressing&#xD;
      interest will be asked if they consent to providing their contact information (name, phone&#xD;
      number, and/or e-mail address).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant presents significant distress (severe depression as confirmed by a CES-D ≥&#xD;
      24), the PI will be required to respond within 48 hours upon receiving the questionnaire&#xD;
      result. The participant in distress will be referred to a mental health provider for further&#xD;
      screening for presence of imminent suicidality and safety. The mental health provider will&#xD;
      determine whether they have suicidal intent (the wish to harm or kill themselves). In the&#xD;
      rare event that there is what is considered an imminent risk, such participants will be&#xD;
      referred to the Centralized Emergency Psychiatry Service (CEPS) at the Victoria Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Community Integration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced community integration as measured by an increase in Community Integration&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CIQ) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Measures Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health, physical health, patient experience with virtual care, fear of vision loss,&#xD;
      and change in vision during the pandemic as measured using 5-point Likert scale&#xD;
      multiple-choice format questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the descriptive statistics for the participants group and&#xD;
      check for outliers. It is planned to use a linear-mixed model with the score as the dependent&#xD;
      variable, demographic variables as covariates. Univariate and bivariate analysis will be&#xD;
      performed for each independent variable against the dependent variable to elicit the impact&#xD;
      of each co-variate on the pattern of preference based HRQoL, depression, anxiety, community&#xD;
      integration, and sleep quality without adjusting for the effect of other variables. Models&#xD;
      will be deemed statistically significant if they are associated with a significant F value (p&#xD;
      &lt; 0.01) and if they explain over 15% variability of the dependent variable. Only those&#xD;
      independent variables that are statistically significantly associated with the preference&#xD;
      based HRQoL (p &lt; 0.05) will be used for model construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATA 15.0 will be used to run all statistical analysis. Based on population size of adults&#xD;
      with eye diseases above the age of 65 in South Western Ontario, 5% margin of error, and 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, the sample size has been computed to be 384 participants. Given a 10%&#xD;
      attrition rate, the study sample size of 425 participants will be adequate. As such, the&#xD;
      sample size has been set to n = 425.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS/ADVERSE EFFECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Safety of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also no direct risks associated with administering the questionnaires to the&#xD;
      participants in this study. It does not involve any procedures or medical tests. It is not&#xD;
      anticipated that there will be any increased risk in completing any of the questionnaires. It&#xD;
      could be that certain questionnaire items make one remember life events which could be&#xD;
      potentially disconcerting. Any indications of serious mental health issues will be reported&#xD;
      immediately for further clinical assessment and management. Standard of care will be&#xD;
      unaffected and only capable and consenting participants will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
      COVID-19 restrictions will be respected including the proper donning of personal protective&#xD;
      equipment, and sanitation of surfaces and hands. Potential risks to data collection include a&#xD;
      privacy breach since there will be various questionnaires to collect information from&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic research records will be stored using QUALTRICS up to a period of 15 years. Study&#xD;
      team members may access data on QUALTRICS, download this data and store the data. Any such&#xD;
      activities will be done under the direction and supervision of the PI. Data will be coded to&#xD;
      protect participant confidentiality.&#xD;
