  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic disabling disease. Patients present a&#xD;
      variable picture associating pain localized to an articular or peri-articular region, motor&#xD;
      and vasomotor disorders and trophic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its pathophysiology, still poorly understood to this day, results from local inflammatory&#xD;
      phenomena complicated by peripheral sensitization and central spinal and cerebral&#xD;
      sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is made difficult by the fluctuating nature of the symptoms and the absence of&#xD;
      specific complementary examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of CRPS is symptomatic and requires multidisciplinary care. CRPS is responsible&#xD;
      for an alteration in the patient's quality of life. This pathology has a global impact&#xD;
      because it affects not only the biomedical sphere but also the socio-family, professional and&#xD;
      psychological spheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that multidisciplinary intervention in the Day Hospital would&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of patients with CRPS. The investigators also think that the&#xD;
      passage in Day Hospital would make it possible to improve the pains, the functionality of the&#xD;
      affected limb as well as the satisfaction of the patients.&#xD;
