  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center clinical trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of an anti-aging eye cream and face moisturizer when used over the course of 12 weeks&#xD;
      twice-daily by women, 35-65 years, with mild to moderate droopy eyelids, moderate crow's feet&#xD;
      wrinkles, and moderate global facial photodamage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study. Female subjects, 35-65 years of&#xD;
      age, Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI, with mild to moderate droopy eyelids, moderate crow's feet&#xD;
      wrinkles, and moderate global photodamage were recruited. Subjects applied a multi-ingredient&#xD;
      anti-aging face moisturizer and eye twice-daily for 12 weeks. Subjects were provided with a&#xD;
      gentle cleansing lotion and a sunscreen SPF 40+ to be utilized during the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical grading of efficacy and tolerability parameters, VISIA-CR imaging, raking light&#xD;
      VISIA analysis, skin pH, Tewameter, and pinch recoil measurements were performed at baseline,&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, and 12. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was performed at baseline and&#xD;
      week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 42 subjects completed the study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of Clinical Efficacy Parameters at 4, 8, and 12 weeks versus Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the Investigator Clinical Grading using Modified Griffith's 10-point Scale. A change in scores at week 4, week 8 and week 12 in comparison to baseline indicates an improvement for the indicated parameter.&#xD;
The efficacy parameters will be assessed globally on each subject's face using a modified Griffiths' 10-point scale according to the following numerical definitions (half-point scores may be used as necessary to more accurately describe the skin condition): 0 = none (best possible condition); 1 to 3 = mild; 4 to 6 = moderate;7 to 9 = severe (worst possible condition). The lower the score equates to the best possible outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lack of Significant Increase in Objective Tolerability Parameters at week 4, 8, 12 compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary tolerability endpoint will be the Investigator Tolerability Assessment of Erythema, Edema and Dryness. A change in scores or lack of significant change at week 4, week 8 and week 12 in comparison to Baseline indicates tolerability/safety of the test material. Four point scale with a lower score indicating a better outcome.&#xD;
Example for Erythema: Erythema 0 = None No erythema of the treatment area&#xD;
= Mild Slight, but definite redness of the treatment area&#xD;
= Moderate Definite redness of the treatment area&#xD;
= Severe Marked redness of the treatment area</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lack of Significant Increase in Subjective Tolerability Parameters at week 4, 8, 12 compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary tolerability endpoint will be the Subject Tolerability Assessment of Burning, Itching and Stinging. A change in scores or lack of significant change at week 4, week 8 and week 12 in comparison to Baseline indicates tolerability/safety of the test material. Four point scale with a lower score indicating a better outcome.&#xD;
Example Burning. 0 = None No burning of the treatment area&#xD;
= Mild Slight burning sensation of the treatment area; not really bothersome&#xD;
= Moderate Definite warm, burning of the treatment area that is somewhat bothersome.&#xD;
= Severe Hot burning sensation of the treatment area that causes definite discomfort and may interrupt daily activities and/or sleep</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in transepidermal water loss at weeks 4, 8, and 12 versus baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• Tewameter Measurements at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. A change in Tewameter values reflects an improvement in the barrier properties of the skin; an absence of a change in treated skin indicates mildness of the applied treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stable skin pH during 12 week study</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>•pH Measurements at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. A stable pH measurement reflects that the test product does not affect the overall cutaneous pH value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Epidermal Thickness after 12 weeks versus baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>•OCT Imaging Procedures at baseline and week 12, with image analysis performed at the end of the study using images from baseline and week 12. A change in epidermal thickness indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the Self-Assessment Questionnaire and the Subject Treatment Satisfaction and Ease of Use Questionnaire. A change in response values at week 4, week 8 and week 12 indicates an improvement compared to baseline response values. Subjects are asked to rate based on a scoring system of the following: from 5 (completely agree) to 1 (completely disagree). The best outcome is to Completely Agree with the statement/ question being asked.</description>
