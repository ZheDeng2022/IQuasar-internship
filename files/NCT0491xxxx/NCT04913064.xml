      This clinical trial studies the effects of dietary white button mushroom on inflammation (the&#xD;
      body's process of fighting against harmful things) and immune cells (white blood cells) in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with both high body mass index or BMI (percentage of body fat) and high&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer. The body is in a constant state of alert when inflammation lingers at&#xD;
      a low level and becomes chronic, as with having button mushroom is a dietary supplement that&#xD;
      may improving responses of immune cells (white blood cells) and decreasing chronic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered from this study may help researchers determine whether white button&#xD;
      mushroom have any effects on body fat and breast cancer risk.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine effects of white button mushroom (WBM) on circulating immune cell profiles,&#xD;
      and specifically myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), in obese (BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m^2)&#xD;
      postmenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in circulating biomarkers of inflammation. II. To evaluate changes in&#xD;
      immune cell profiles and inflammation in breast adipose tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate tolerability of WBM in a study cohort of obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate changes in BMI, central adiposity (waist circumference), and metabolic health&#xD;
      (glucose, insulin, lipid panel, alanine aminotransferase [ALT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate effects of WBM on diet quality and composition (food frequency questionnaires,&#xD;
      24 hour recall, red blood cell fatty acid profiles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive white button mushroom orally (PO) daily for 3 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
