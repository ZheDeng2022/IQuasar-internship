  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hamburg TranscathEteR Mitral Valve REplacement RegiStry (HERMES) is a prospective&#xD;
      clinical cohort registry aiming to gather follow-up information on short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcome of patients with mitral valve disease that undergo transcatheter mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement (TMVR) screening. In particular, long-term durability and function of implanted&#xD;
      bioprosteses is of utmost interest for both patients and clinicians. Moreover, this study&#xD;
      aimes to investigate and compare the different treatment strategies patients undergo after&#xD;
      successful or unsuccessful screening for TMVR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) emerges as the most frequent valvular heart disease in&#xD;
      developed coun-tries with prevalence increasing with age. Mitral valve repair is the gold&#xD;
      standard therapeutic strategy in primary MR and is recommended in patients with secondary MR&#xD;
      who are in need of revascularization. However, in patients with secondary MR mitral valve&#xD;
      repair is associated with a higher rate of MR recurrence compared to mitral valve&#xD;
      replacement. Nevertheless, elderly patients often are at high or prohibitive surgical risk&#xD;
      and up to one half of all patients with severe MR are not referred to surgery. Transcatheter&#xD;
      edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) constitutes a feasible and effective alternative, but&#xD;
      eligibility for TEER is limited in some cases due to suboptimal anatomy or risk of mitral&#xD;
      stenosis. Moreover, MR reduction is less predictable and, again, MR may reoccur.&#xD;
      Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) represents a complementary therapeutic approach&#xD;
      for patients with severe MR. This novel therapy promises to reduce MR as durable as surgical&#xD;
      valve replacement while reducing the procedural risk with an interventional approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hamburg TranscathEteR Mitral Valve REplacement RegiStry (HERMES) is a prospective&#xD;
      clinical cohort registry aiming to gather follow-up information on short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcome of patients with significant mitral valve disease, at high surgical risk with&#xD;
      suboptimal anatomy for TEER, who undergo TMVR screening. In particular, long-term durability&#xD;
      and function of implanted bioprosteses will be investigated. Additionally, this study aimes&#xD;
      to investigate and compare the different treatment strategies patients undergo after&#xD;
      successful or unsuccessful screening for TMVR (i.e., TMVR, TEER, surgery and medical&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
