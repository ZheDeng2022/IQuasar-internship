      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is used to treat head and neck cancer. People who take this drug are at risk for&#xD;
      hearing loss. Atorvastatin is a drug used to treat high cholesterol. It might reduce the risk&#xD;
      of cisplatin-induced hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if atorvastatin reduces hearing loss in people treated with cisplatin and&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who will undergo&#xD;
      treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants currently taking a cholesterol-lowering statin medication are invited to&#xD;
      participate in the observational arm of the study. Those not taking such a medication are&#xD;
      invited to participate in the interventional arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have 2 visits. One before starting cisplatin treatment and within 3&#xD;
      months of completing treatment. They will have tympanograms. A small flexible tip will be&#xD;
      placed in the ear canal. A puff of air will be delivered to assess mobility of the ear drum.&#xD;
      They will have hearing tests. They will wear headphones. They will listen to tones that vary&#xD;
      in loudness. They will be asked to indicate when they hear a sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the interventional arm will have 2 additional visits for blood tests. These&#xD;
      will occur upon consent and 12 weeks after. They will be randomly assigned to take the study&#xD;
      drug or placebo orally, once daily. They will take it during cisplatin treatment and for 3&#xD;
      months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up will include a chart review 2 years after participants complete their&#xD;
      cisplatin therapy.&#xD;

      Study Description: Individuals undergoing cisplatin-based chemoradiation therapy are at risk&#xD;
      for developing significant, permanent hearing loss. The cholesterol-lowering drug&#xD;
      atorvastatin has the potential to reduce the incidence and severity of hearing loss, as&#xD;
      evidenced by our preclinical data in mice and our retrospective data in humans.Here we will&#xD;
      compare hearing changes between subjects on a concurrent daily dose of atorvastatin vs. a&#xD;
      placebo among individuals undergoing cisplatin therapy to treat head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective (Interventional Arm): To determine the effectiveness of atorvastatin (20&#xD;
      mg) at reducing the incidence of a CTCAEv5.0 Grade &gt;=2 hearing loss in patients treated with&#xD;
      cisplatin-based CRT for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective (Observational Arm): To examine the extent to which subjects taking other&#xD;
      statin drugs (and other doses of atorvastatin) exhibit reduced incidence CTCAEv5.0 grade &gt;=2&#xD;
      hearing loss in patients treated with cisplatin-based CRT for head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Objectives (Interventional Arm): To determine if concomitant atorvastatin (20 mg)&#xD;
      use alters disease-free survival or overall survival in subjects undergoing cisplatin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint (Interventional Arm): The primary endpoint is the change in hearing&#xD;
      sensitivity as measured by pure-tone audiometry between the pre-treatment (before&#xD;
      cisplatin-based CRT) hearing test and the post-treatment (after completion of cisplatin-based&#xD;
      CRT) audiogram. Hearing loss will be defined according to CTCAEv5.0 Grade &gt;=2 criteria and&#xD;
      will be compared in subjects taking atorvastatin vs. subjects not taking any statin drug.&#xD;
      Hearing sensitivity will be compared between audiograms collected at baseline prior to&#xD;
      treatment to a repeated audiogram at the end of treatment within 2-4 months of cessation of&#xD;
      cisplatin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints (Observational Arm): The secondary endpoint is the change in hearing&#xD;
      sensitivity as measured by pure-tone audiometry between the pre-treatment )(before&#xD;
      cisplatin-based CRT) hearing test and the post-treatment (within 2-4 months of cessation of&#xD;
      cisplatin administration) audiogram in the observational arm of the study. Hearing loss will&#xD;
      be defined according to CTCAEv5.0 Grade &gt;=2 criteria and will be compared in subjects taking:&#xD;
      1) any statin other than atorvastatin vs. subjects not taking any statin drug, 2) subjects&#xD;
      taking atorvastatin at doses other than 20 mg vs. subjects not taking any statin. Hearing&#xD;
      sensitivity will be compared between audiograms collected at baseline prior to treatment to a&#xD;
      repeated audiogram at the end of treatment within 2-4 months of cessation of cisplatin&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Endpoint (Interventional Arm): The tertiary endpoint is the overall survival and&#xD;
      disease-free survival at 2 years after cisplatin therapy. Overall survival and disease-free&#xD;
      survival will be compared between subjects taking atorvastatin (20 mg) vs. those not taking&#xD;
      any statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 414 adult male and female patients newly diagnosed with head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma scheduled to undergo cisplatin-based chemotherapy with concurrent&#xD;
      radiation. Subjects will be recruited from 3-4 U.S.-based sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Phase 3&#xD;

          -  Adult patients, male or female, aged &gt;=18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, confirmed by pathologic&#xD;
             review of surgical or biopsy specimen(s), who meets standard clinical and laboratory&#xD;
             criteria and will undergo treatment with concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and&#xD;
             radiation with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This includes patients who will be treated with either intensity-modulated radiation&#xD;
             therapy (IMRT) or proton radiotherapy, with planned dose to the cochlea of &lt;35 Gy (to&#xD;
             limit confounding effects of radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have hearing thresholds at or better than 70 dB SPL at 1, 2, and 4&#xD;
             kilohertz (kHz) at the time of their baseline audiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide consent and provision of signed and dated informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in the interventional arm of this study, an&#xD;
        individual must meet all of the&#xD;
&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline laboratory tests in the following range: aspartate aminotransferase (AST or&#xD;
             SGOT); alanine aminotransferase; creatine phosphokinase, creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN.&#xD;

             least 1 month prior to enrollment and agreement to use such a method during study&#xD;
             participation and for an additional 8 weeks after the end of atorvastatin&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators will attempt to enroll subjects of diverse race, gender and age. However,&#xD;
        our ability to do this will be limited by the demographics of patients typically diagnosed&#xD;
        with HNSCC. There is a male predominance, and patients tend to be in their 5th to 7th&#xD;
        decades of life (&quot;Cancer of the Oral Cavity and Pharynx - Cancer Stat Facts,&quot; n.d.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
