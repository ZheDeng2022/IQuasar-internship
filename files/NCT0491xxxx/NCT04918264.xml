  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digestive carcinomas chemotherapies regimen are mostly based on fluoropyrimidine drugs&#xD;
      (5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine). 5-FU is mainly catabolised by dihydropyrimidine&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (DPD) and partial or complete DPD deficiency can cause severe adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Different strategies have been proposed to predict DPD deficiency; the two main&#xD;
      approaches are phenotyping the enzyme activity (directly or indirectly), or genotyping the&#xD;
      four main polymorphisms associated with 5-FU-toxicity. In February 2018, the French medicines&#xD;
      agency (Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé, ANSM)&#xD;
      recommended DPD genotyping for all patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based treatment to&#xD;
      improve its safety as compared to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)13 and others&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics working group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2018, a new guideline from the French cancer institute (Institut National Du&#xD;
      Cancer, INCa) and the French health authority (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS) recommended the&#xD;
      measurement of the uracil blood level before genotyping DPD and dose adaptation if this level&#xD;
      is greater than 16 ng/mL. The aim herein is to assess how this recommendation has been&#xD;
      implemented in clinical routine. 5-FU displays a dose-response relationship regarding both&#xD;
      its efficacy and its toxicity, did tailored-dose impair the treatment efficacy as it&#xD;
      decreased the risk of toxicity? To address that matter we conducted a retrospective study to&#xD;
      evaluate how fluoropyrimidine dosage is adapted to uracil concentration with an emphasis on&#xD;
      how patients outcome were affected. We compared time to failure and overall survival between&#xD;
      patients with an uracil concentration &lt; 16 ng/mL and &gt; or = 16 ng/mL.&#xD;
