  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of eyelid erythema after anesthesia with the&#xD;
      use of TegadermTM vs. the Transpore®. Our null hypothesis is that the rate of erythema will&#xD;
      be similar between the two groups given there is no evidence currently to suggest otherwise&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Tufts Medical Center, a variety of adhesive tapes are used to shut the eyes during&#xD;
      anesthesia, including 3MTM TegadermTM and the Sharn Anesthesia Transpore®, with no preference&#xD;
      for one or the other. While all of these products decrease the risk of corneal abrasion, none&#xD;
      of these products have been shown to be superior to the others in terms of eyelid irritation.&#xD;
      According to Sharn Anesthesia, &quot;The [Transpore®] adhesive is light enough to reduce damage to&#xD;
      the outer eye&quot; (3). However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. All the&#xD;
      investigators know is that the Transpore is coated with a medical grade, pressure-sensitive&#xD;
      acrylic adhesive and that there are no phthalates, it is latex free and silicone free.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The co-investigator will ask the study subject to close his or her eyes and will take a photograph of the eyelids as a baseline assessment. Then, the co-investigator will apply the Transpore® on one eye and the TegadermTM on the other eye according to the randomization schema. The exact time of application will be documented. At the end of the surgery, the co-investigator will remove the Transpore® and TegadermTM. She will then take another photograph of the eyelids and document the time. The Cloud storage folder containing the photographs will be shared with the dermatologists who will evaluate the degree of erythema.</intervention_model_description>
