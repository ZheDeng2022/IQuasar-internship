      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety of atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      adenoviral-mediated interleukin-12 (ADV/IL-12) gene therapy in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on first-line immunotherapy&#xD;
      with or without chemotherapy. Approximately 16 patients will be enrolled on the study. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the safety of the atezolizumab and ADV/IL-12 gene therapy&#xD;
      combination and will be determined using the Bayesian model averaging-continual reassessment&#xD;
      method (BMA-CRM). ADV/IL-12 will be intratumorally injected on Day 0 of the study. The&#xD;
      starting dose of ADV/IL-12 will be 5 × 1011 vp. ADV/IL-12 dose level will de-escalate based&#xD;
      on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) occurrence: dose level -1, 3 × 1011 vp and dose level -2, 1 ×&#xD;
      1011 vp. The starting dose, based on the dose range explored in prior studies, is expected to&#xD;
      have activity and dosing changes are only in place in the event that toxicity is&#xD;
      demonstrated. Starting on Day 2 of the study, atezolizumab will be administered at 1200 mg IV&#xD;
      every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 2 cycles. Patients with stable disease or better after completion of&#xD;
      2 cycles of atezolizumab will continue to receive atezolizumab Q3W until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or up to 12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Willing to provide biopsy tissue as required by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating eggs, as defined below: Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for 5&#xD;
             months after the final dose of study treatment. Women must refrain from donating eggs&#xD;
             during this same period. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she&#xD;
             is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥12 continuous months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing&#xD;
             intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual&#xD;
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and&#xD;
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With a&#xD;
             female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain&#xD;
             abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final&#xD;
             dose of study treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
             The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
