  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized open study, which aims to evaluate the benefit of a&#xD;
      connected watch to help people aged 65 years and older to withdraw from BZD over a six-month&#xD;
      period, compared with classical withdrawal (e.g without connected watch). The study will&#xD;
      include 100 patients, 50 in the control group and 50 in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified during a 12-month period through either external geriatric&#xD;
      consultations or during a brief hospitalisation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a trivialized use of benzodiazepine (BZD) in elderly people (EP), long-term efficacy&#xD;
      is often questioned, and treatment has to be regularly re-examined to avoid side effects.&#xD;
      Typical intervention techniques to aid patients in reducing their dosage involve: providing&#xD;
      information about BZD, explaining the risks associated with a chronic exposure, and tips for&#xD;
      a successful withdrawal. In addition, the usage of a connected device may reinforce the&#xD;
      patient's motivation by providing details on the quality of sleep and the number of steps&#xD;
      taken (activity).&#xD;
