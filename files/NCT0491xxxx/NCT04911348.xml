  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurosarcoidosis represents up to 10% of sarcoidosis cases. Little is known about its&#xD;
      long-term course, even if the disease remains mainly monophasic with/w.o. sequelae, or if&#xD;
      bouts of new symptoms may arise over years (polyphasic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using retrospective data from patients diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis in three French&#xD;
      referral centers for neuro-inflammation, the investigators aim to determine patterns of&#xD;
      disease course, according to the initial presentation and the treatments used.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease which a 10-20/100.000/year incidence rate. The&#xD;
      nervous system is found to be affected in 5-10% in clinical series, rising to 14-27% in&#xD;
      post-mortem studies. Mortality is as high as 5% mainly due to cardiac, pulmonary or&#xD;
      neurological injury. The treatment of the disease uses cortico-steroids, and often&#xD;
      steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. More&#xD;
      recently, TNFalpha-blockers have been found to be highly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term data about the clinical and paraclinical course of the disease are lacking. &quot;Bouts&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;relapse&quot; of the disease are barely described, with no substantial information about their&#xD;
      frequency, their sequelae, or their response to the treatments when initiated. Less is known&#xD;
      about the risk of recurrence in each presentation of neurosarcoidosis (peripheral, spinal,&#xD;
      brain or meningeal presentations). In the end, if a truly relapsing-remitting form of the&#xD;
      disease exist is not sure, many patients presenting with a lond-standing pattern of invariant&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to this lack of knowledge about the natural history of neurosarcoidosis, even a &quot;good&#xD;
      treatment response&quot; cannot be defined, and in many cases, it is difficult to attribute to&#xD;
      treatments a seemingly favourable course af the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators aim to build a retrospective cohort of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis and seen at least once in three French referral centers for&#xD;
      neuro--inflammation from Jan-1st-2000 to date : Nancy (Lorraine, North-Eastern), Bordeaux&#xD;
      (Aquitaine, South-Western) and Strasbourg (Alsace, North-Eastern).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics, clinical and paraclinical data at presentation will be collected(magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging of the spine and brain, electroneuromyography if available, data of blood&#xD;
      and cerebro-spinal fluid). After having clustered patients by presentation pattern, data&#xD;
      about lines and types of treatments, change in clinical and paraclinical data will be&#xD;
      collected. From this perspective, patterns of disease course on the mid/long-term will be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated number of patients : 60-100. Estimated duration of follow-up : 5-10 years.&#xD;
      Intervention : none (existing data).&#xD;
