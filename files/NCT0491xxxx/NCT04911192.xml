      -  Primary objective: to evaluate the success and mortality rates of catheter-directed&#xD;
           reperfusion therapy in comparison to traditional use of systemic intravenous&#xD;
           fibrinolytic therapy, will focus at safety of such management measured by in-hospital&#xD;
           mortality and prevalence of severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: to assess the feasibility of catheter-directed reperfusion in&#xD;
           management of intermediate and high risk pulmonary embolism in Assiut University&#xD;
           hospital and its reflection on pulmonary artery pressure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolic disease represents one of the most important causes of cardiovascular&#xD;
      death in the world. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs in about 500,000 patients&#xD;
      annually, with an estimated mortality as high as 30% in high-risk patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-risk pulmonary embolism clinically manifests with hemodynamic instability and systemic&#xD;
      hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg, pressure drop of more than 40 mm Hg or&#xD;
      requiring administration of inotropic agents. In this form of PE (pulmonary embolism) imaging&#xD;
      studies usually reveal a &quot;saddle embolus&quot; at the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk, embolism&#xD;
      of the main pulmonary artery, or embolic occlusion of at least two lobar arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality in high-risk pulmonary embolism is at the level of 60%, and in 66% of these&#xD;
      patients fatal outcomes take place during the first hours from the onset of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. The remaining patients with severe pulmonary embolism , those with intermediate&#xD;
      risk of mortality, do not reveal hypotension, but present with clinical symptoms comprising&#xD;
      dyspnea and/or tachycardia. Estimated 30-day mortality in patients with intermediate risk PE&#xD;
      (pulmonary embolism) is at the level of 15-20%, and these patients are at a risk of&#xD;
      developing pulmonary hypertension and right ventricle heart failure. Given the fact that 40%&#xD;
      of patients with class 4 or 5 of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index present with&#xD;
      contraindications for systemic fibrinolytic therapy, Catheter-directed reperfusion therapy&#xD;
      seems to be a promising alternative treatment modality.&#xD;
