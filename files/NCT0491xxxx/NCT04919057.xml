    <textblock>
      Radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP) was the first approach utilized for the removal of the&#xD;
      entire prostate gland for prostate cancer. In the minimally invasive surgery era, the&#xD;
      robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) was first described in the early 2000s,&#xD;
      and has become the mainstay of prostatectomy in Hong Kong and many parts of the world.&#xD;
      Incorporating the robotic technology into the technique of RPP has been studied recently.&#xD;
      Some preliminary data showed that such approach resulted in a better functional outcome in&#xD;
      continence and erectile function. Our study aims at assessing the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      robotic RPP in prostate cancer management.&#xD;

      Radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP) was the first approach utilized for the removal of the&#xD;
      entire prostate gland for prostate cancer [1]. It continued to be the favoured approach for&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy for several decades before the description of the radical retropubic&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RRP) by Walsh in 1970s, who has refined the anatomical retropubic approach&#xD;
      [2]. In the minimally invasive surgery era, the robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy&#xD;
      (RALP) was first described in the early 2000s [3]. With time, the robotic retropubic approach&#xD;
      became one of the most common approaches for prostate removal in prostate cancer patients. In&#xD;
      parallel with the implementation of robotic surgery in retropubic prostatectomy, a revival in&#xD;
      interest was experienced for the RPP approach in its role for the management of localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. In 2003, Resnick reported a cohort of RPP with reasonable operative times&#xD;
      and cancer control concluding that the procedure was safe and effective [4]. Janoff and Parra&#xD;
      noted that in comparison to RRP, patients undergoing RPP had less postoperative discomfort,&#xD;
      shorter return of bowel function and hospital stay with a decreased transfusion rate [5].&#xD;
      Incorporating the robotic technology into the technique of RPP, Kaouk et al. performed&#xD;
      robotic RPP in four patients with localized prostate cancer using a multi-arm da Vinci&#xD;
      Surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The procedures were successfully&#xD;
      completed applying a robotic perineal approach with patients discharged within 48 hours [6].&#xD;
      Tugku et al reported their clinical experience with 15 patients who underwent robotic RPP&#xD;
      [7]. Early continence rate was shown to be 40% at urethral catheter removal and 94% at third&#xD;
      months postoperatively. Furthermore, a study was performed by the same group comparing&#xD;
      outcomes of robotic RPP versus transperitoneal RALP [8]. Eighty patients (40 robotic RPP vs&#xD;
      40 RALP) with localized prostate cancer were included in the study. Continence rates were 94%&#xD;
      in the robotic RPP and 72% in the RALP (p = 0.001) group at the 6th-month follow-up. In terms&#xD;
      of erectile function, the rates favoured robotic RPP at 3, 6, and 9-month follow-ups with&#xD;
      44%, 66%, and 75%, respectively. In addition, compared with conventional RALP, robotic RPP&#xD;
      would offer an advantage for those patients who had previous intra-abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Moreover, not having the need of putting the patients into steep Trendelenburg position is&#xD;
      another potential benefit of robotic RPP over conventional RALP. In this study, we evaluate&#xD;
      the early oncological outcome and objective functional outcome of patients undergoing robotic&#xD;
      RPP for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
