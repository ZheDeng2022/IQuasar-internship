  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a digestive enzyme supplement&#xD;
      (three times per day for 30 days) on gastrointestinal distress (GID) and body composition&#xD;
      (body mass and body fat percentage) in healthy men and women (18 - 55 years of age) who&#xD;
      experience regular GID (3 - 6 episodes of GID per month).&#xD;

      Pre-Screening: Subjects will first undergo a pre-screening visit with the PI. The PI will go&#xD;
      over the COVID-19 screening as well as the study screening for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Subjects will be given information regarding the study details, location of the&#xD;
      study, and parking during this pre-screening visit as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: This session will take place at the Exercise Physiology Laboratory (Prillaman 1102 -&#xD;
      Kennesaw State University) and subjects will be asked to arrive fasted (8-10 hours). Subjects&#xD;
      will be informed of the purpose, risks, and benefits of the study. They will be asked to&#xD;
      review and sign this consent form. Subjects may ask questions at any time. They will then&#xD;
      complete a Health History Questionnaire (HHQ) consisting of medical, physical activity, diet,&#xD;
      and supplementation history. Following completion of this consent and the HHQ a member of the&#xD;
      research team will take subjects to assess height, weight, and body composition (assessments&#xD;
      described below). Immediately following the body composition assessment, they will be asked&#xD;
      to fill out a series of questionnaires. These questionnaires will be electronic and will&#xD;
      require subjects to use a computer as well as applications on their phone (surveys and&#xD;
      applications described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will describe how to use the applications and computer&#xD;
      programs: 1) Cronometer (for dietary tracking); 2) MyGiHealth (for GID tracking); and 3)&#xD;
      SurveyMonkey (for GID tracking and supplement compliance tracking). Once subjects have&#xD;
      completed all surveys a member of the research team will then distribute their first 30 day&#xD;
      allotment of supplement (blinded, randomly assigned enzyme or placebo - both are 200 mg per&#xD;
      pill) and provide subjects with instructions on how to take the supplement (3 times per day -&#xD;
      right before a meal - for example right before breakfast, lunch, and dinner). They will then&#xD;
      be informed on how to track their GID and diet throughout the 30 days of supplementation&#xD;
      (described below). Lastly, subjects will be given their return date for Visit 2 and work with&#xD;
      the research team member on a time that works for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Subjects will return to the lab for Visit 2 following 30 days of supplementation.&#xD;
      During visit 2, they will have their body composition reassessed, as well as complete all GID&#xD;
      surveys as they did during Visit 1. Further, a member of the research team will ensure that&#xD;
      they completed all proper tracking of diet and GID during the 30 day supplementation period.&#xD;
      Subjects will then work with the research team member to determine a Visit 3 date. Visit 3&#xD;
      will be at least 7 days after Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 and Visit 4: Visits 3 and 4 will be similar to Visits 1 and 2, respectively. However,&#xD;
      subjects will not complete the informed consent form again and will not have to&#xD;
      download/install the applications, as they will have completed this during Visit 1. During&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4, they will first have their body composition reassessed and fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires (GID) (same as Visit 1 and 2). Further, subjects will be asked to take the&#xD;
      supplement they did not receive during the first 30 days, for 30 days following Visit 3&#xD;
      (still blind to both the participants and research team). Subjects again will be asked to&#xD;
      track their diet and GID during the 30 days of supplementation between Visits 3 and 4 (see&#xD;
      tracking below). Following completion of Visit 4, subjects will receive their body&#xD;
      composition results from visits 4.&#xD;
