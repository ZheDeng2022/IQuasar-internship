  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis and inflammatory myopathies, which sometimes combine (scleromyositis),&#xD;
      have shared pathophysiological elements. In both diseases, many cell subtypes are involved in&#xD;
      damage to organs such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and unconventional (non-B, non-T)&#xD;
      lymphocytes called innate lymphoid cell (ILC). The increasing complexity of our understanding&#xD;
      of the immune system (multiplication of recognized cell subtypes) also makes the strategies&#xD;
      for analyzing pathophysiological mechanisms more complex. Currently, no biomarker perfectly&#xD;
      predicts the phenotype and evolution of patients. Multi-OMIC analyzes will be performed&#xD;
      (identification of cell populations as well as genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic&#xD;
      characterization) in blood and tissue samples (skin and muscle biopsy) in patients with&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis and inflammatory myopathies, with the objective of identifying&#xD;
      discriminating molecular signatures (biomarkers) according to the characteristics of the&#xD;
      disease and its evolution.&#xD;

      Cohort study, monocentric, comparative, non-randomized, open-label, prospective and&#xD;
      longitudinal, quasi-experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating subjects will be classified according to their clinical, biological and&#xD;
      additional investigations into one of the 4 populations presented in the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1st sampling point will be carried out at inclusion visit (baseline). Prospective follow-up&#xD;
      of participating patients will be carried out as part of their routine care (1 to 2 visits&#xD;
      per year or more if disease complications appear).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 5-year follow-up, the investigating physician will remain attentive to the&#xD;
      appearance of a new clinical element which will mark the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up, 2 more sampling points will be carried out (blood and / or skin) on&#xD;
      each participating patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and muscle biopsies will be carried out in the usual way during diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic management. An additional volume of blood, an additional muscle biopsy (on the&#xD;
      occasion of the one performed for diagnosis) and two superficial skin biopsies (1 sclerotic&#xD;
      tissue &amp; 1 healthy tissue) will be taken for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in this cohort will not change the management of the patient, either with regard to&#xD;
      his treatment or his follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-omics analyzes will include single cell RNAseq, as well as proteomics and genomics&#xD;
      analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcriptomic analysis will be performed on PMBC, muscle and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genomic analysis (exome &amp; whole genome) will be performed on PMBC, muscle and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteomic analysis will be performed on serum, PMBC, muscle and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single cell analysis will be performed on PMBC, muscle and skin. During the analysis,&#xD;
           the clinical characteristics of baseline, the treatments and the evolutions during the&#xD;
           follow-up will be compared to reveal the clinical relevance of the multi-OMIC&#xD;
           signatures.&#xD;
