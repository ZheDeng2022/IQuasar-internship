  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open, single-arm, dose-escalating phase I exploratory clinical trial to&#xD;
      observe the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of different doses of TILs in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed and refractory NSCLC（Non-small cell lung cancer）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 7 stages: ① screening period; ② tissue collection; ③ TILs cell production&#xD;
      and preparation; ④ lymphocyte depletion pretreatment; ⑤ TILs cell infusion; ⑥ safety and&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation; ⑦ follow-up.&#xD;
