  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to answer the following question: What are the effects of a new drug&#xD;
      or drugs on ovarian cancer? The pre-study screening may be done to test a sample of tissue&#xD;
      for biomarkers to determine participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if this approach is better or worse than the&#xD;
      standard of care for ovarian cancer. The standard of care is defined as care most people get&#xD;
      for ovarian cancer.&#xD;
