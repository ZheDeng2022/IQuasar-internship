  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to find out what the longer-term physiological consequences&#xD;
      of COVID-19 are, and to determine if exercise therapy can help improve lung function, heart&#xD;
      function and overall fitness, and reduce symptoms in people recovering from SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to see if taking part in structured exercise training will&#xD;
      improve the ability to exercise, the function of the lungs and the function of the heart, and&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness in people recovering from COVID-19. After&#xD;
      enrollment all patients will complete exercise testing, lung function testing, and cardiac&#xD;
      imaging. Patients will be randomized to either 8 weeks of exercise training (4-5 times per&#xD;
      week) or will continue standard medical care. All patients will undergo detailed exercise&#xD;
      testing, lung function testing, and cardiac imaging after the intervention.&#xD;
