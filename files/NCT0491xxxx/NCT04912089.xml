  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to test the cognitive and neural effects of a cognitive training in&#xD;
      a sample of individuals seeking treatment for anxiety, depression, or traumatic stress&#xD;
      symptoms. Participants will be randomly assigned to a high dose, low dose, or assessment only&#xD;
      condition. Participants will be compared on cognitive performance and brain response during&#xD;
      cognitive tasks from baseline to post-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders are common psychiatric conditions - affecting&#xD;
      over 40 million U.S. adults - and are leading causes of disability worldwide. People with&#xD;
      these conditions are commonly plagued by difficulty controlling distressing personal thoughts&#xD;
      and memories, collectively referred to as repetitive negative thinking symptoms. Models&#xD;
      suggest that repetitive negative thinking is driven by executive functioning deficits, such&#xD;
      that cognitive resources are insufficient to downregulate unwanted thoughts. Executive&#xD;
      functioning deficits could be a promising treatment target but are not typically addressed&#xD;
      with existing interventions. The long-term goal advanced by this project is to develop&#xD;
      effective, mechanistic cognitive training programs that can improve cognition and reduce&#xD;
      symptoms associated with mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. The objectives of&#xD;
      this proposal are first to determine the optimal dose of a cognitive training program&#xD;
      designed to improve executive functioning in this population using behavioral and neural&#xD;
      outcomes. The central hypothesis is that repeated training exercises will enhance executive&#xD;
      functioning and will lead to a reduction of repetitive negative thinking in mood, anxiety,&#xD;
      and traumatic stress disorders. The project will randomize participants with depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and/or traumatic stress disorders to one of two doses of cognitive training or a&#xD;
      no-treatment control condition. The investigators will examine executive functioning change&#xD;
      with cognitive task performance and functional neuroimaging assessments.&#xD;
