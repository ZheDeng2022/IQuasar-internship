  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, cardiac pacing has been widely used in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias and&#xD;
      heart failure, which can effectively improve the survival rate of patients. With the rapid&#xD;
      development of technology, you can choose to pace the heart in different parts. The atrium&#xD;
      can choose the right atrial appendage, the atrial septum and the right ventricular side wall.&#xD;
      The right ventricle can choose to be paced in the His bundle, right ventricular apex and&#xD;
      ventricular septal outflow tract. The right ventricle can choose the pacing positions&#xD;
      including left bundle branch pacing and left ventricular pacing via coronary vein. There are&#xD;
      few studies comparing the long-term efficacy and safety of different pacing programs in daily&#xD;
      practice. This study is to observe the short-term and long-term effects and safety of&#xD;
      different parts of cardiac pacing, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different&#xD;
      parts of cardiac pacing.&#xD;

        According to the current reports and the researcher's pacing implantation status, with an&#xD;
        enrollment rate of 90% and a loss of follow-up rate of 10%, it is estimated that 600 cases&#xD;
        were screened, 540 cases were selected, and about 500 cases were effective.&#xD;
