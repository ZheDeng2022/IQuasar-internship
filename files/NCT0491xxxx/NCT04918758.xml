  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30,000 people in the UK are treated with pelvic radiotherapy each year. Rectal bleeding is a&#xD;
      common symptom side effect caused by radiation proctopathy (RP). RP is due to the effect of&#xD;
      radiation on the rectum (back passage) which causes poor blood supply (ischaemia) which leads&#xD;
      to stiffness/scarring (fibrosis) and the development of abnormal blood vessels on the surface&#xD;
      of the lining of the rectum (telangiectasia) which can bleed (1, 2). Six percent of patients&#xD;
      will develop severe bleeding from RP (3), passing large amounts of blood and clots, often&#xD;
      leading anaemia (low blood count) requiring either tablet or intravenous (IV) iron&#xD;
      replacement, or blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are very few safe, effective, evidence-based treatments available for RP. Purastat® is&#xD;
      a new haemostatic agent (treatment that stops bleeding) which is licensed to treat bleeding&#xD;
      from blood vessels in the gut. It is a liquid containing four peptides (protein&#xD;
      building-blocks). When this liquid comes in contact with blood these peptides join together&#xD;
      to form a mesh which closes the broken blood vessel thereby stopping the bleeding (4-7).&#xD;
      Purastat is safe with no side effects and it breaks down amino acids, which are tissue&#xD;
      building blocks that can be used to repair the site of injury (7). There are many studies&#xD;
      which show that Purastat® is effective at stopping bleeding quickly and safely (within 10-20&#xD;
      seconds) (6-13). Early data from a case series of 21 patients by the research team has shown&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms and endoscopic appearance. This study is a dual site randomised&#xD;
      feasibility study of 80 patients. It will obtain initial data into the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      Purastat in reducing bleeding in people with severe haemorrhagic RP. These data will be used&#xD;
      to support funding for an definitive randomised controlled trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessment Tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Demographic data 2.7 day patient-reported rectal bleeding diary 3.Rectal bleeding score&#xD;
      4.Endoscopic grading: Zinicola score, rectal telangiectasia density score 5.Bloods:&#xD;
      Haemoglobin concentration, ferritin 6.Blood transfusion requirement 7.Iron replacement&#xD;
      requirement 8.Quality of life (EQ5D 5L) 9. Healthcare use including GP visits, hospital&#xD;
      visit, A&amp;E attendences, day case hospital visits, hospital admissions, blood transfusion and&#xD;
      iron use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 20 weeks (+/- 2 weeks). The timing of assessments will be baseline&#xD;
      following consent (week 0); week 4 (+/- 1 week); week 8 (+/- 1 week); and week 20 (+/- 2&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened at their clinic appointment by study doctor. If they meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, then verbal consent will be taken from the participant for the research&#xD;
      nurse to contact them via telephone to discuss the study further. If the participant is happy&#xD;
      to take part in the study following discussion with the research nurse then a follow-up&#xD;
      telephone call will be arranged with study doctor for the participant to confirm happy to&#xD;
      proceed and ask any further questions. An invitation letter plus participant information&#xD;
      sheet and informed consent form will be either sent to the participant via post or email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are then 2 options for taking informed consent - either a telephone informed consent&#xD;
      visit with return of informed consent to investigator site OR a face to face informed consent&#xD;
      visit with respective study investigator and research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data plus details of cancer treatment, site, comorbidities, previous treatment&#xD;
      for radiation proctopathy will be obtained. Participants will be allocated a study number and&#xD;
      anonymised. They will then be randomised to Purastat or treatment as usual (sucralfate&#xD;
      enemas) using block sizes of 4 or 6, with block size itself determined at random.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by Hospital. An independent randomisation schedule will be&#xD;
      generated for each of the Hospitals. Prescriptions for sucralfate 2g BD for 2 months will be&#xD;
      issued to those randomised to treatment as usual for collection at first sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse will contact the participant to inform them of the arm they have been&#xD;
      randomised to, confirm their baseline sigmoidoscopy visit date and ensure that they start&#xD;
      completing their bleeding diary/healthcare utilisation starting 7 days before their baseline&#xD;
      visit. Demographic data plus details of cancer treatment, site, comorbidities, previous&#xD;
      treatment for radiation proctopathy will be obtained. Patients will be allocated a study&#xD;
      number and anonymised. They will then be randomised to Purastat or treatment as usual&#xD;
      (sucralfate enemas) using block sizes of 4 or 6, with block size itself determined at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by Hospital. An independent randomisation schedule will be&#xD;
