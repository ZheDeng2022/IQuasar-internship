  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by the occurrence of&#xD;
      abnormally frequent episodes of interrupted ventilation (apnea) or significant reduction of&#xD;
      ventilation (hypopnea) during sleep. It is linked to a repeated collapse of the upper airways&#xD;
      during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodes of apnea and hypopnea cause hypoxemia and micro-awakenings with a well-established&#xD;
      impact on quality of life and daily activities. Physiologically, OSAHS can be aggravated when&#xD;
      moving from a standing to a supine position through fluid shift from the lower limbs to the&#xD;
      upper body, thereby modifying the opening of the upper airways. A decrease of the water&#xD;
      balance by bilateral diurnal compression of the lower limbs (during daytime in standing&#xD;
      position) may limit this nocturnal fluid shift (at night in supine position) and thus reduce&#xD;
      the severity of OSAHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two comparative clinical trials [Redolfi 2011; White 2015] have shown a clinically modest&#xD;
      reduction of sleep apnea (-36% and -27%, respectively), which was however statistically&#xD;
      significant versus untreated control group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.04, respectively), when&#xD;
      elastic compression medical devices of 20 to 30 mmHg were worn during the daytime. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of fluid shift influence on OSAHS has been tested [Berg 1993; Redolfi 2011; White&#xD;
      2015], but the decrease of the water balance when the device is used remains to be&#xD;
      quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CVE101-15 exploratory clinical investigation sponsored by Laboratoires Innothera&#xD;
      performed on healthy volunteers confirmed the hypothesis of a diuretic effect of elastic&#xD;
      compression stockings applying a pressure of 33 mmHg at the ankle, worn for 13-14 hours&#xD;
      during the daytime for 3 days, with a good safety profile of this device. Moreover, it&#xD;
      enabled the identification of reliable parameters and the endpoints to be used to demonstrate&#xD;
      a diuretic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this information, there may be a real interest in conducting further investigations&#xD;
      about the evolution of water balance beyond a 3-day period of elastic compression use in the&#xD;
      daytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the main objective of this clinical investigation is to compare precisely, under&#xD;
      standardized test conditions, water balance changes in healthy subjects over 5 days with or&#xD;
      without daytime use of the investigational medical device (IMD), an elastic compression&#xD;
      device prototype specially designed for this study.&#xD;
