    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to select the optimal dose and evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the treatment. Stage 1 is a dose-finding study, which will enroll subjects&#xD;
      aged ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 75 years old to receive a single unilateral intravitreal (IVT)&#xD;
      injection of NR082 to observe its safety and efficacy. Stage 2 of the clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted after the dose is determined to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      study drug. In Stage 2 of the study, the first 6 subjects are aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years.&#xD;
      After monitoring for at least 6 weeks, if there are no new safety signals and the efficacy&#xD;
      data is similar to Stage 1, subjects aged 12-17 years can be enrolled upon approval by the&#xD;
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The clinical manifestation of all subjects is&#xD;
      reduced visual acuity caused by Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) associated with ND4&#xD;
      mutation, and laboratory test showed G11778A mutation (a CLIA-certified laboratory), while&#xD;
      the reduced visual acuity lasted for &gt;6 months and &lt;10 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the dose-finding stage, the principle is that the SRC, IDMC and sponsor must jointly&#xD;
      decide whether to make dose change and cohort expansion based on the safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      of the initial dose. The safe and effective dose of the Stage 2 study will be determined by&#xD;
      combining the safety and efficacy data after cohort expansion, i.e., the confirmatory stage&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose for Stage 1 is 1.5 × 109 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose. The safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the initial dose will be reviewed by the SRC, and the SRC's consent is required for dose&#xD;
      escalation, de-escalation or cohort expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of the initial dose will first be performed in 6 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
      After 6 subjects are evaluated, 1 of 3 scenarios may occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If both safety and efficacy criteria are met, the cohort can be expanded (see cohort&#xD;
           expansion in Stage 1 below) to enroll another 6 evaluable subjects; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If only the safety criteria are met but not the efficacy criteria, six evaluable&#xD;
           subjects will be enrolled for a treatment dose of 4.5 × 109 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose (high&#xD;
           dose). Then, if both safety and efficacy criteria are met, the cohort can be expanded to&#xD;
           enroll another six evaluable subjects to receive this dose; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If only the efficacy criteria are met but not the safety criteria, 6 evaluable subjects&#xD;
           will be enrolled for a treatment dose of 0.5 × 109 vg, 0.05 mL eye/dose (low dose).&#xD;
           Then, if both safety and efficacy criteria are met, the cohort can be expanded to enroll&#xD;
           another six evaluable subjects to receive this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the completion of Stage 1, the dose of 12 subjects with safety and efficacy data will be&#xD;
      used for the Stage 2confirmatory study.&#xD;
