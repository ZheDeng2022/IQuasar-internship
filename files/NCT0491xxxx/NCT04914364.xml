  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe balance deficits in patients post COVID-19. The&#xD;
      information the investigators learn may help influence balance training exercises for&#xD;
      patients post-COVID-19. Participants will have a primary or secondary diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      during hospitalization and off COVID-19 isolation and be receiving care in an acute inpatient&#xD;
      hospital. Following consent, participants will complete balance assessments and&#xD;
      questionnaires about balance and dizziness in a single session. Vital signs will be monitored&#xD;
      during the session.The greatest risks of this study include shortness of breath, and a risk&#xD;
      of falling or musculoskeletal soreness.These risks are no greater than those experienced&#xD;
      during a usual physical therapy visit.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor balance as measured by Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - single session</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG measures mobility, motor balance, walking ability, and falls risk based on one composite score of how long it takes the patient to complete the task.</description>

    <measure>Sensory influence on balance as measured by Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - single session</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance confidence as measured by Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - single session</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report questionnaire where patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities. Scores range 0-100 where 0 indicates no balance confidence and 100 indicates complete balance confidence.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dizziness as measured by a dizziness questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - single session</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale that ranges from 0-10 where 0 indicates no dizziness and 10 indicates maximal dizziness.</description>
