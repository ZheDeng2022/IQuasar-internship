    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study. Collect cotton swabs of the surface skin are obtained&#xD;
      from the non-diabetic and diabetic patients hospitalized in the Nanfang Hospital of Southern&#xD;
      Medical University. The investigators use omics technology to identify the structure and&#xD;
      functions of cutaneous microbiome, analyze the characteristics of the skin flora of diabetic&#xD;
      patients, and find the difference in skin microbiota among diabetic patients with different&#xD;
      risk levels for developing into diabetic foot. Then, the participants will be followed up to&#xD;
      compare the incidence of ulcers among different groups. And the skin tissues discarded during&#xD;
      surgical operations of non-diabetic and diabetes patients are collected for pathological&#xD;
      examination. Finally, based on the results of 16S high-throughput sequencing, metagenomics,&#xD;
      etc., specific flora could be extracted from human skin flora cotton swabs, and animal&#xD;
      experiments are performed to explore the effect of skin micro-ecology on diabetic skin&#xD;
      lesions. The investigators will explore in animal experiments to regulate the influence of&#xD;
      skin micro-ecology on diabetic skin lesions through treatment methods such as different&#xD;
      hypoglycemic drugs and probiotic emulsions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to explore the mechanism of diabetic skin micro-ecology in diabetic skin&#xD;
      diseases, and find new ways of early screening and prevention for diabetic foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective observational study. Adult participants were divided into the&#xD;
      following 5 groups (n=200, 40 in each group): control group, very low-risk group, low-risk&#xD;
      group, moderate-risk group, and high-risk group. Sterile rayon tipped swabs were&#xD;
      pre-moistened with a sterile solution containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. All swabs&#xD;
      samples were collected from the intact skin at plantar anterior. And the skin cotton swab was&#xD;
      subjected to 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing, metagenomic sequencing methods, etc. Based&#xD;
      on the result, the investigators will analyse the change of the cutaneous microbiome in DM as&#xD;
      the disease condition progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin tissues of the control group and observation group who met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were also collected during surgical operations, and pathological and immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      tests were performed respectively to analyze the pathological changes of diabetic skin&#xD;
      tissues in different disease progressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of multi-omics analysis, the research team screen for the specific&#xD;
      flora. Then sort out and culture specific strains, and establish mouse model of microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation in order to explore the effects of regulating skin microecology on diabetic&#xD;
      skin lesions through different treatment methods such as hypoglycemic drugs and probiotic&#xD;
      emulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will conduct telephone follow-ups of diabetic patients, collect data, and&#xD;
      statistically analyze the impact of changes in the skin microecology of diabetic patients on&#xD;
      the occurrence of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
