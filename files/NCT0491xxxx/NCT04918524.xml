  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Connective tissue disease (CTD) is a common group of autoimmune diseases, mainly including&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) , and so on. APS is&#xD;
      caused by autoimmune disorders that cause recurrent miscarriage, thrombosis, and&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, and often secondary to connective tissue diseases such as SLE.&#xD;
      Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is currently considered to be an&#xD;
      independent disease in the classification of CTD. And women of childbearing age who suffer&#xD;
      UCTD is more common than that in other definite CTDs. Therefore, the impact of the disease&#xD;
      flare and the influence of medicine on pregnancy and lactation are important for these&#xD;
      patients who may suffer high-risk of abnormal pregnance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To study the risk factors of poor pregnancy outcomes in CTD patients, and evaluate&#xD;
      impact of different therapies on the maternal and fetal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Our department and Shanghai Gothic Network Technology Co.Ltd. jointly established&#xD;
      the chronic disease management of CTD patients during pregnancy and lactation by using Smart&#xD;
      System of Disease Management (SSDM). With this platform, patients in pregnancy can consult&#xD;
      with rheumatologists face to face and follow-up regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Consultation and followup will be scheduled every 4 weeks from confirmed pregnancy&#xD;
      until delivery.&#xD;
