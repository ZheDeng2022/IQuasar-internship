      This is a prospective, single arm, observational study designed;' / Up to 100 participants&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV or V (End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD) who have&#xD;
      either a newly created or functioning AV access will be enrolled at up to five (5) clinical&#xD;
      sites. Participants in both groups will continuously wear the SmartPatch for up to eight (8)&#xD;
      weeks and undergo standard-of-care surveillance and treatment to assess their AV maturation&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, observational study designed to assess arteriovenous (AV)&#xD;
      access maturation and patency as determined by auscultation and AV access blood flow using&#xD;
      the Alio Medical Remote Monitoring System (RMS) as compared to standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV or V (End Stage Renal&#xD;
      Disease, ESRD) who have either a newly created or functioning AV access will be enrolled at&#xD;
      up to five (5) clinical sites. Participants in both groups will continuously wear the&#xD;
      SmartPatch for up to eight (8) weeks and undergo standard-of-care surveillance and treatment&#xD;
      to assess their AV maturation and/or patency. During this time, clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected from the SmartPatch and compared to standard of care auscultation and imaging&#xD;
      (duplex ultrasound) assessments.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Alio Medical Remote Monitoring System (RMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Alio Medical RMS utilizes a wearable, non-invasive patch (SmartPatch) placed on the AV access of enrolled participants. The SmartPatch gathers physiologic data using optical, mechanical, electrical, acoustic and thermal sensors to collect physiologic data from the participant's vessel related to vascular access health (e.g. volumetric flow and stenosis) and hemodynamic parameters (e.g. Hb/Hct, K+) and transmits it to a bedside hub located in the clinic or participant's home. The Bedside Hub then relays this raw data to the Alio Medical Cloud where it is processed and analyzed utilizing Alio's proprietary algorithms. Data is then accessible to the clinical site and Alio Medical via a web-based portal.</description>
