  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Intelligent Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation System (ICRS) was developed to automatically&#xD;
      control the resistance of pedaling in combination with the conventional stationary bike by&#xD;
      monitoring the user's heart rate for clinical use. To test its feasibility, 8 healthy&#xD;
      participants were recruited to complete 12 sessions (3 times per week for 4 weeks) of indoor&#xD;
      cycling on the stationary bicycle with ICRS. Subjects were received cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      testing (CPET) before and after the biking sessions.The 60-80% of heart rate reserve (HRR) of&#xD;
      each participant was determined according to their first CPET results. The algorithm of ICRS&#xD;
      was designed to enable the bicycle to adjust its training intensity in accordance with the&#xD;
      subject's 60-80% HRR which was detected by wearing a wristband heart rate monitor during&#xD;
      cycling. With ICRS, the participants' heart rates during training were expected to fall in&#xD;
      the 60-80% HRR, increasing their cardiopulmonary fitness after 12 sessions of indoor cycling.&#xD;

    <description>Oxygen consumption (VO2- peak) were measured during our cardiopulmonary test (with a incremental biking and a gas analyzer). The workload was increased at a ramp rate of 5-10 W/min. A cadence at 50~70 rpm was to be maintained.</description>

    <description>8 subjects were asked to complete indoor cycling training, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Each session of training consisted of 30-minute stationary biking (5 minutes of warm-up, 20 minutes of training and 5 minutes of cooldown).</description>

    <intervention_name>ICRS</intervention_name>
    <description>The ICRS enables a stationary bike to automatically adjust the pedaling resistance (i.e. training intensity) according to the subject's heart rate. The training intensity is determined by monitoring whether the subject is able to maintain a 50-70 cycles/min cadence with 60-80% HRR. Subjects heart rate was detected by a wearable device for heart rate, synching with the stationary bike.</description>
