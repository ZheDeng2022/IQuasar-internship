  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that in the first stages of the pandemic, a significant portion of the&#xD;
      general population experienced psychological problems such as anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      post-traumatic disorders. These problems persist today. A balanced diet, physical activity&#xD;
      participation and relaxation techniques are recommended for preventing such problems. In&#xD;
      studies conducted before the pandemic, it is reported that breathing exercises have positive&#xD;
      effects on anxiety, sleep and quality of life in both patients and healthy individuals. Aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the effects of breathing exercises applied via teleconference&#xD;
      on fear of COVID-19, anxiety, sleep and quality of life in healthy adult population.&#xD;

    <measure>Fear of COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2nd, 3rd and 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of COVID-19 will be evaluated using The Fear of COVID-19 scale. The scale consists of seven items, each with a five-point Likert scale of options. The participant is instructed to choose an option that best represents their perception about the statement presented. Higher score indicates higher levels of fear.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2nd, 3rd and 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be evaluated using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Scale measures the severity of a patient's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be evaluated using The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Questionnaire assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. It consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global score is calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2nd, 3rd and 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be evaluated using EQ-5D-3L. Questionnaire describes general health based on five distinct dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 Levels (indicating no problem, some or moderate problem and extreme problem).</description>

Individuals will perform exercises by themselves at their homes on the remaining 6 days of the week. Exercise program will be applied for 4 weeks. Individuals will also be informed about COVID-19 for once at baseline.</description>
