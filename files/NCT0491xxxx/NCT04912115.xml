      A Multi-Center, Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Prospective, Active Placebo-Controlled&#xD;
      Trial of Sub-Anesthetic Intravenous Infusion of Ketamine to Treat Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia&#xD;
      in Subjects with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel trial-design with&#xD;
      two arms. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with the investigational product&#xD;
      (ketamine) or an active control (midazolam). The active control causes mild sedation and is&#xD;
      employed to minimize unmasking of the test article.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an out-patient study. However, infusion days and days involving prolonged&#xD;
      assessments are expected to require the subject to be onsite. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      site for safety and efficacy evaluations. On Day 1, PK samples will be collected near the end&#xD;
      of Infusion 1 and post-infusion to evaluate near-steady-state blood levels in all subjects.&#xD;
      Intensive PK sampling will be conducted in all subjects prior to, during, and a few hours&#xD;
      after Infusion 2 (Day 5 ± 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of low-dose intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of ketamine on levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. All patients included in the study should meet the inclusion criteria. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will receive ketamine, while the other half will receive active placebo&#xD;
      (Midazolam). All participants will be assigned to either the active group or the control&#xD;
      group randomly. During the clinical trial, both investigators and patients are double-blind&#xD;
      except serious adverse events occurred.&#xD;

    <description>The change from baseline to week 8 of treatment in the sum of the items comprising the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS). The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) is administered to assess dyskinesia. The scoring range is 0-104, where higher score means more dyskinesia.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in daily &quot;OFF&quot;-time as assessed with patient diaries from run-in to week 8. This is a self administered diary where patients assess their motor state every half hour during 24 hours.</description>

    <description>Change in MDS-UPDRS sum score of part III (Motor Examination) from baseline to week 8. Minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 124. Higher score mean a worse outcome.</description>
