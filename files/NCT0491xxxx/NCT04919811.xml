  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of taletrectinib (also known&#xD;
      as AB-106 or DS-6051b) monotherapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of taletrectinib in&#xD;
      patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      119 patients will be enrolled and divided into 4 cohorts, depending on past history of ROS1&#xD;
      TKI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taletrectinib will be administered 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. Patients will continue&#xD;
      with the study treatment until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor response evaluation will be conducted on a regular basis until progression of&#xD;
      disease. Long-term survival follow up will be conducted as well.&#xD;
