      A randomized controlled trial comparing a comprehensive supervised training regimen with a&#xD;
      validated home-based regimen for subacromial impingement syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the study is to compare a comprehensive supervised training regimen (STR)&#xD;
      based on latest evidence including heavy slow resistance training with a validated home-based&#xD;
      regimen (HTR). We hypothesized that the STR would be superior to the HTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised control trial with blinded assessor. 126 consecutive patients with subacromial&#xD;
      impingement syndrome were recruited and equally randomised to 12 weeks of either supervised&#xD;
      training regimen (STR), or home-based training regimen (HTR). Primary outcomes were Constant&#xD;
      Score (CS) and Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (SRQ) from baseline and 6 months after completed&#xD;
      training. Results were analyzed according to intention-to treat principles.&#xD;

    <description>This training regimen consisted of 3 phases: the 1st focused on restoring motion, the 2nd on strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles, and the 3rd on strengthening of the scapular muscles. Stretching completed every training session.&#xD;
Motion training consisted of 6 exercises.&#xD;
Postural training: shoulder shrugs and shoulder retraction exercises.&#xD;
Glenohumeral training: pendulum exercises, and active assisted flexion, abduction and external rotation.&#xD;
Strengthening of the rotator cuff: side lying external rotation, internal rotation and scaption.&#xD;
Strengthening of the scapular muscles: press-up, push-up with a plus, serratus anterior supine punch, standing rowing (low row), and seated rowing (high row).&#xD;
Training sessions ended with 4 stretches: anterior shoulder stretch, posterior shoulder stretch, inferior capsular stretch, sleepers stretch.&#xD;
Exercises were performed 3 times a week, with progression after the 1st week, and thereafter every 2nd week.</description>

    <description>The program consisted of the following:&#xD;
1 motion exercise: upper trapezius relaxation&#xD;
3 strengthening exercises: serratus anterior strengthening exercise, humeral external rotation with the arm at the side of the body, and humeral external rotation with a rubber band and the arm at 90 degrees abduction.&#xD;
2 stretching exercises: posterior shoulder and pectoralis minor stretching, Exercises were performed daily, with weekly progression.</description>
