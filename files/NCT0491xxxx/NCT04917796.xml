  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroacupuncture (referred to as EA) may be an effective treatment for Chemotherapy-Induced&#xD;
      Peripheral Neuropathy/CIPN pain. Acupuncture is a medical technique that involves insertion&#xD;
      of very thin needles into specific areas on the body with the goal of promoting health and&#xD;
      well-being. EA involves adding a very small amount of electricity through the acupuncture&#xD;
      needles (electrical stimulation). Researchers have found that EA can increase the effects of&#xD;
      regular acupuncture, and it is particularly helpful for treating different kinds of pain. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to learn if EA can improve CIPN pain in cancer survivors, and if it&#xD;
      is effective against other CIPN-related symptoms.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will occur before the baseline assessments are administered. Once the patient is randomized, the acupuncturists will look up the patient's group assignment and provide the appropriate treatment. The study team and patients will be blinded to which acupuncture group the patient was assigned. The acupuncturists and one clinical research coordinator will be the only ones unblinded. The clinical research coordinator will be unblinded in order to assist acupuncturists to confirm randomization. This clinical research coordinator will not be the primary research coordinator in the study and will not have direct contact with the patient. The rest of the study coinvestigators and staff will remain blinded.</masking_description>
