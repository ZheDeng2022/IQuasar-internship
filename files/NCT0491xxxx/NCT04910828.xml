      The aim of this study is to test high and low glycemic index foods in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers and determine the effects on post meal pulse and blood pressure. Foods will be&#xD;
      consumed before 8am after an overnight fast (10-12 hours) over a 10-15 minute period. Pulse&#xD;
      and BP (where equipment is available) measurements will be taken 6 times at 5 min intervals&#xD;
      before eating, and twice every 15 min thereafter for the following 2h. We will recruit&#xD;
      between 30 to 40 students and 10 to 20 older adults to assess the effect of age, in cohorts&#xD;
      of 10.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test high and low glycemic index foods in healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      determine the effects on post meal pulse and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 30 to 40 students and 10 to 20 older adults (&gt;60 years) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Serious health condition preventing participants from eating 50g of &quot;available&quot;&#xD;
      carbohydrates as a test breakfast. For example: 1) food intolerances or allergies to common&#xD;
      foods; 2) gastrointestinal conditions requiring medical treatment (Crohn's, ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis) and a special diet; 3) bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Study participants will be recruited from those who have contacted us and showed&#xD;
      interest in working with our group as well as colleagues who show interest in this project.&#xD;
      The study coordinator will obtain consent by telephone and confirm by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Fifty of the original 65 carbohydrate foods, as used in the 1981 AJCN (American&#xD;
      Journal Of Clinical Nutrition) glycemic index paper, that established the first comprehensive&#xD;
      values for the glycemic index of foods, will be fed to healthy volunteers as 50g carbohydrate&#xD;
      portions as was done for the original GI testing. Foods will be consumed before 8am after an&#xD;
      overnight fast (10-12 hours) over a 10-15 minute period. Pulse and BP (where equipment is&#xD;
      available) measurements will be taken 6 times at 5 min intervals before eating, and twice&#xD;
      every 15 min thereafter for the following 2h. Participants will be asked to test at least 10&#xD;
      (or more as they wish) foods on separate days. The minimum duration for their participation&#xD;
      will therefore be 10 days but not necessarily consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size We will recruit between 30 to 40 students and 10 to 20 older adults to assess the&#xD;
      effect of age, in cohorts of 10, and to have the flexibility for volunteers to do less foods&#xD;
      but still have a wide range of foods on which to obtain a tachycardia or hypotension index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Prior to starting the study, they will be asked to complete a medical&#xD;
      questionnaire sent to them by email and return it to the study coordinator for review.&#xD;
      Participants will either come to the Risk Factor Modification Centre at St. Michael's&#xD;
      Hospital if pandemic restrictions allow, or will carry out the testing by themselves at home.&#xD;
      Tests will be carried out after an overnight fast. Participants will sit quietly for 15&#xD;
      minutes and then repeat pulse (and BP with the Omron or other monitor if available)&#xD;
      measurements 6 x at 5 min intervals or until measurements are consistent for 3 consecutive&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meal breakfast will then be eaten over 10-15 minutes, with 2 further pulse&#xD;
      measurements taken at 15 minute intervals for the following 2h after the start of breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout, participants will be asked to remain seated and emotionally uninvolved with their&#xD;
      environment. Pulse can be counted for 30 seconds to ensure concentration (and x by 2 for the&#xD;
      minute value). Written work, answering emails etc. can be undertaken providing the timing of&#xD;
      pulse measurements does not induce stress. The first 2h are crucial in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention/Breakfasts Participants will be given a list of 10 foods (including white&#xD;
      bread to be used as the standard), and their weights and method of preparation. They will&#xD;
      acquire these common foods themselves. If they have no scales available, they will portion&#xD;
      the foods using common measures and the values with which they will be provided. Cooking&#xD;
      instructions will also be provided where necessary. Food portions should be measured out the&#xD;
      night before and left in the refrigerator overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods will be consumed plain or with a set weight of fat (e.g. butter or margarine) or&#xD;
      protein (cottage cheese or tofu). A beverage of their choice (tea or coffee) will also be&#xD;
      taken with either cow or soy milk or water. The quantities should be constant across all test&#xD;
      breakfasts and the total volume of the beverage should be 300 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods A list of foods, portion sizes, preparation instructions and order in which to eat them&#xD;
      will be provided prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study test diary form Forms on which to record timing and study details (cooking instructions&#xD;
      for lentils, pasta etc.) will be provided for each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scales and measuring jugs Where possible participants should ensure that they have electronic&#xD;
      scales with wall plugs that are in gram weights and also jugs with ml volume calibrations.&#xD;
