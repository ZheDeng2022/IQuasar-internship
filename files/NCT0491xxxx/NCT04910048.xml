  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, we will test the hypothesis that a POPOP for currently ineligible UAMS&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery patients wanting hip or knee replacement improves markers of preoperative&#xD;
      health, ability to reach a BMI threshold &lt;40 kg/m2 required for surgical eligibility, and&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes versus SOC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of two groups: Standard of Care or the POPOP&#xD;
      (20Lighter).&#xD;

The program includes customized meal plans; vitamin, mineral and nutritional supplementation; and daily engagement via a smartphone app with a 20Lighter health care provider. Video conferencing appointments will occur approximately every 3 weeks. The program does not require any exercise or physical engagement but does necessitate that patients have a smartphone or tablet with Bluetooth capability, cell signal or WIFI connection. During the first 40 days the customized meal plans are adhered to, then from days 41-60 patients will transition back to a normal dietary lifestyle via a customized plan based on considerations including, food preferences, physical engagement and height.</description>
