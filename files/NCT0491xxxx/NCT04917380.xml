  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial infection is one of the common clinical complications after neurosurgery,&#xD;
      especially after external cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Postoperative intracranial infection&#xD;
      has a very high incidence, and its incidence is about 0.34%-3.1%. Once infection occurs, it&#xD;
      will directly affect the length of hospitalization, mortality and disability of postoperative&#xD;
      patients. The pathogenic bacteria of postoperative intracranial infections include G-bacteria&#xD;
      and G+ bacteria, and fungi. Common G+ bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus. Common G-bacteria&#xD;
      are Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteria,&#xD;
      Escherichia coli and so on. In recent years, studies have reported that postoperative&#xD;
      intracranial infections of G-bacteria are gradually increasing. In the previous study of our&#xD;
      research group, it was found that Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted&#xD;
      for the top two pathogens of postoperative intracranial infections in ICU. In particular, the&#xD;
      proportion of carbapenem-resistant G-bacteria has increased, which brings difficulty and&#xD;
      challenge to the treatment and seriously affects the prognosis of patients. Different&#xD;
      pathogen infections may lead to different prognosis of patients with intracranial infection&#xD;
      after neurosurgery. With different pathogens as the starting point, there are few studies&#xD;
      comparing the clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis of intracranial infections after&#xD;
      neurosurgery. Therefore, it is great significant to explore and understand different&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria, risk factors, drug resistance, treatment options, and prognosis after&#xD;
      neurosurgery.&#xD;

      1. To study the epidemiological distribution of pathogenic bacteria of intracranial&#xD;
           infection after neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the risk factors of intracranial infection after neurosurgery (operations, type&#xD;
           of external drainage tube, days of drainage tube , etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare differences in clinical character，risks , treatment options, prognostic&#xD;
           indicators between G+ bacterial infection group and G-infected bacterial group after&#xD;
           neurosurgery.&#xD;
