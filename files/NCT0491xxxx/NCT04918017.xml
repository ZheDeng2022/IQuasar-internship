  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is among the most established and common functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). FD is subdivided into two subtypes based on symptoms:&#xD;
      epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on international guidelines (Asian Consensus and Rome Consensus), a prokinetic,&#xD;
      medication which promotes gut movement (such as Itopride) should be the 1st line treatment&#xD;
      for the PDS sub-type and a proton pump inhibitor, medication which reduces stomach acid&#xD;
      production (such as Esomeprazole) should be the 1st line treatment for the EPS sub-type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in the routine practice in Malaysia, proton pump inhibitor is still commonly used as&#xD;
      1st line treatment for FD, regardless of subtypes. This may be one of the reasons why FD&#xD;
      continues to be inadequately treated locally and causes poor health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL) in FD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical symptoms and quality of life improvement&#xD;
      in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) after treatment according to international&#xD;
      guidelines versus treatment according to routine practice. Adverse effects when managed&#xD;
      according to guidelines versus routine practice will also be evaluated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of global symptom change using 'Overall Treatment Effect' (OTE) questionnaire from baseline to 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
Patients who were 'extremely improved' or 'improved' on the OTE scale are considered responders. This will be compared with intervention arm and routine practice arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms change</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in individual upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms (total 9 symptoms). Patients will be assessed on nine UGI symptoms (upper abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating, early satiety, excessive belching, nausea, vomiting and heartburn) and they will rate each symptom on a severity scale of 0-3 (none, mild, moderate and severe).&#xD;
On assessment of individual symptoms, patients who have a decrease in symptom severity of ≥50% from baseline are considered responders. Nine individual symptoms are evaluated and compared between intervention and routine practice group.</description>

    <measure>Change of quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) score based on Short Form-Napean Dyspepsia Index Questionnaire (SF-NDI).&#xD;
It is a 10-item questionnaire with 5 sub-scales each examining the influence of dyspepsia on domains of health in patients, namely tension/anxiety, interference with daily activities, disruption to regular eating/drinking, knowledge towards/control over disease symptoms and interference with work/study, with each sub-scale containing two items [10]. Each item is measured by a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all or not applicable), 1 (a little), 2 (moderately), 3 (quite a lot) to 4 (extremely). Individual items in each sub-scale are aggregated to obtain a score range from 0 (lowest HRQoL score) to 100 (highest HRQoL score) as per the developers' original calculation formula. A total, overall SF-NDI total score is obtained using the mean of 5 subscale scores.</description>
