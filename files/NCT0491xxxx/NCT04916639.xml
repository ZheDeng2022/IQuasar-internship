  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, multicenter, parallel group trial to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      Physiomer®, a natural seawater nasal spray, to reduce duration of COVID-19 nasal symptoms and&#xD;
      reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load in subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus enters into the human body mainly through the angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) nasal epithelial cells. Like&#xD;
      many other airborne viral diseases, penetration into the upper respiratory tract (URT) is the&#xD;
      first step of the infection. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the host via the respiratory tract,&#xD;
      airway and alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages are&#xD;
      among the first targets of viral entry. Several studies have reported that the viral loads in&#xD;
      the upper respiratory tract (URT) peak at the time of, or early after, onset of symptoms.&#xD;
      Higher virus load in upper respiratory tract (URT) also induces a higher overall SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      household secondary attack rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal saline irrigations are frequently prescribed for both prevention and treatment of upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Nasal wash provides mechanical cleansing of mucus,&#xD;
      crust, cell debris and various air contaminants including pathogens (virus and bacteria). It&#xD;
      enhances mucociliary clearance and reduces the mucus contact time of airborne elements. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of nasal lavage has been shown to reduce the duration of infectious episodes&#xD;
      and relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) caused by various&#xD;
      respiratory viruses including coronaviruses. Preliminary data showed that daily nasal wash&#xD;
      can significantly reduce symptom duration in subjects with mild and moderate forms of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor hypothesized that the daily use of seawater nasal wash in subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate forms of COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would relieve nasal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, including nasal obstruction and&#xD;
           rhinorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would reduce the intranasal viral load by mechanical evacuation of nasal secretions&#xD;
           containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and by reducing the contact time between the SARS-COV-2&#xD;
           virus and the nasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Physiomer®, an undiluted&#xD;
      isotonic seawater nasal spray, on reducing the duration of nasal symptoms of COVID-19 (nasal&#xD;
      obstruction or rhinorrhea) in subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in France among adults subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 who&#xD;
      developed nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea no more than 48 hours before study inclusion.&#xD;
      Subjects positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be randomized into one of two study groups: control&#xD;
      group or nasal wash group. Subjects in the nasal wash group will be asked to perform daily&#xD;
      nasal wash for a 3 weeks period with Physiomer®, a 100% seawater isotonic nasal spray.&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will complete daily online questionnaires for a 3 weeks period. In&#xD;
      order to follow the evolution of nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, 4 naso-pharyngeal swabs will be&#xD;
      collected at home by a nurse.&#xD;

Nasal wash four times every day&#xD;
These washes are to be carried out in each nostril&#xD;
By continuously pressing the spray for 3 seconds in each nostril&#xD;
Subjects are recommended to distribute the 4 nasal washes as follows:&#xD;
1st : morning&#xD;
2nd : midday&#xD;
3rd : afternoon&#xD;
4th : evening Subjects will be instructed to maintain daily nasal wash over the 3 weeks study period even in case of earlier nasal symptoms resolution, in order to assess the impact of nasal wash on viral load and other COVID-19 symptoms.</description>
