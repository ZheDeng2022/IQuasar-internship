  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish and validate age-based head kinematics, force-strain models and&#xD;
      brain injury probability maps from sensor worn data during soccer heading tasks. 40 youth&#xD;
      soccer players will be recruited from the Madison, WI area and can expect to be on study for&#xD;
      2 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the large popularity of soccer worldwide and in the US, the majority of research on&#xD;
      sport-related head impacts has been concentrated in male American football players using&#xD;
      head-impact measurement sensors in instrumented football helmets. The limited research in&#xD;
      soccer players likewise has focused on males, particularly those playing at an elite level,&#xD;
      such as collegiate or professional. Unfortunately there is a paucity of data on youth soccer&#xD;
      athletes in regards to how these younger players actually head the ball and what forces they&#xD;
      experience. Measurement of head impacts is essential to further understanding the potential&#xD;
      risks associated with heading in youth soccer, and to further inform rule or policy changes&#xD;
      that limit head impact exposure in these younger age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: Establish and validate age-based head kinematics, force-strain models and brain&#xD;
      injury probability maps from sensor worn data during soccer heading tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, age-and sex-specific force strain models will be validated using a study of&#xD;
      soccer headers under controlled conditions. Youth soccer players in 6th-12th grade will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in a header training session while wearing motion sensor headbands.&#xD;
      All children will undergo MRI scanning and baseline assessment of neurocognitive function,&#xD;
      psychological health, and academic aptitude and performance. Participant-specific finite&#xD;
      element models will be created from MRI scans, and principle tissue strains will be&#xD;
      determined based on head motion profiles during soccer headers and compared between age- and&#xD;
      sex-specific groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High fidelity head kinematics will be acquired during soccer headers under controlled&#xD;
      conditions using a custom headband embedded with multi-axis motion sensors. MRI scans will be&#xD;
      obtained in all participants, and individualized and population averaged (to reduce&#xD;
      computational burden), whole brain tractographs will be created. New participants-specific&#xD;
      finite element models will be generated using geometry-adaptive mesh morphing techniques to&#xD;
      match the head morphology of each subject using a baseline FE head model (to reduce model&#xD;
      development time). The linear and angular acceleration histories obtained from the pre- and&#xD;
      post-training soccer heading tasks will be applied directly to the FE models to simulate the&#xD;
      head motion of each participant. The principal strains will be determined for each heading&#xD;
      task, and brain injury probability maps will be generated based on the resulting tissue&#xD;
      strain. Brain injury risk will be assessed through the incorporation of a cellular injury&#xD;
      criterion embedded into the finite element simulations, with smaller strains correlating with&#xD;
      lower injury risk. Soccer header force-strain relationships will be compared between age&#xD;
      groups, and pre-and post-training session. This analysis will provide insight into the effect&#xD;
      of age and training on improving heading techniques and reducing the risk of injury.&#xD;

    <measure>BRIEF-Monitoring Trail Making Parts A and B Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test is administered in two parts. Part A is a visual-scanning, timed task where subjects are asked to connect with lines 25 circles numbered from 1 to 25 as quickly as possible. In Part B participants are asked to connect circles containing numbers (from 1 to 13) or letters (from A to L) in an alternate numeric/alphabetical order (i.e. 1-A-2-B-3-C etc.). Errors must be corrected immediately and the sequence re-established. The TMT A-B score, calculated as the difference between TMT-A and TMT-B times, is considered a measure of cognitive flexibility relatively independent of manual dexterity.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subject lies supine flat on their back, tuck their chin toward their chest and lift their head and neck approximately 2.5 cm off the ground and hold that position as long as possible. The length of time is recorded in seconds, and typically is 45-60 sec.</description>

    <measure>Y Balance Test (YBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Leg length is measured (cm). The test consists of a centralized stance platform and three pipes connected with the platform. The pipes represent AT (Anterior), PM (Posterior Medial), and PL (Posterior Lateral) reach directions and are marked in 1.0-cm increments for measurement purposes. All pipes are equipped with a moveable reach indicator. During the testing procedure, subjects stand with one leg on the centralized platform and are instructed to reach with the other leg as far as possible in the AT, PM, and PL directions while maintaining balance. Each subject will perform three practice trials followed by three data collection trials per leg. Starting with the AT reach direction while standing on the right leg followed by standing on the left leg, this protocol is then replicated for the PM and PL directions.</description>
