    <textblock>
      The management of cerebral infarctions (CI) is a real public health issue. The French&#xD;
      National Authority for Health recommends Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) either in combination&#xD;
      with Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT), or alone, after failure of IVT or in case of&#xD;
      contraindication to IVT, within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine the factors predicting good functional recovery at 3 months in&#xD;
      order to establish the typical profile of the &quot;good responder&quot; patient to MT and to evaluate&#xD;
      functional recovery at 3 and 12 months (mRS ≤ 2) according to the modality of MT (depending&#xD;
      on whether it is performed during the day or at night), the age of the patients, the&#xD;
      equipment used for MT, the type of anaesthesia, as well as the impact of the metrics from the&#xD;
      radiological evaluation in the patient's management. patient management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of cerebral infarction (CI) is a real public health issue. There are 120,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations of CI patients per year in France. It is the leading cause of acquired&#xD;
      disability and the second leading cause of dementia. Since 2015, the scientific community has&#xD;
      demonstrated the benefits of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      CI. The French National Authority for Health (HAS) recommends MT either in combination with&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) thrombolysis, or alone, after failure of IV thrombolysis or in case of&#xD;
      contraindication to IV thrombolysis, within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, the HAS has extended its recommendations for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients (with occlusion of large vessels of the anterior cerebral circulation) whose onset&#xD;
      of symptoms or last seen asymptomatic is between 6 and 16 hours, and may even extend up to 24&#xD;
      hours depending on strict inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These previous clinical trials have shown the remarkable efficacy of MT in CI patients under&#xD;
      the age of 80. There are no clear recommendations for MT in patients over 80 years of age,&#xD;
      and further research is needed to improve the safety of MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research is needed to improve patient selection in the elderly. Today, predictive&#xD;
      factors impacting on functional recovery such as age, blood glucose, and NIHSS neurological&#xD;
      severity score have been evaluated. However, no association between these factors during the&#xD;
      course of treatment has been established to determine the clinical and radiological&#xD;
      characteristics that define the standard profile of &quot;good responders&quot; to MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort is a continuation of the data previously collected in a database of the Commission&#xD;
      Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL). This database reports a complete&#xD;
      follow-up (clinical, imaging and MT procedure data) of patients, from admission to 3 months&#xD;
      after their hospitalisation. Some results have already been published.&#xD;
