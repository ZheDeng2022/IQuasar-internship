    <textblock>
      The main objective is to characterize neurocognitive developmental characteristics among&#xD;
      Chinese infants and toddlers (1.5 months to 2 years of age) assessed using MRI. This is an&#xD;
      observational study to learn and help describe the cognitive development characteristics of&#xD;
      Chinese children.&#xD;

      This is an observational study with accelerated, longitudinal, sequential design including 2&#xD;
      structured sub-cohorts with different baseline age ranges enrolling at the same time&#xD;
      (enrolment window at age 1.5-6 months [42-182 days] and 9-15 months [274-456 days],&#xD;
      respectively), and will undergo both MRI and behavioural assessment at enrolment and 8 months&#xD;
      later. The study includes an optional voluntary visit at 3 years of age (1095 days) to assess&#xD;
      cognitive functions.&#xD;

    <description>Neural flexibility is a quantitative measure of the frequency at which brain regions change their allegiance from one functional module to another during a given time period. It will be measured by MRI at the brain regions implicated to be associated with cognitive flexibility (including anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, interior frontal junction, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye fields, and temporoparietal junction)</description>
