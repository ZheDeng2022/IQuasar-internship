      This first-in-human open-label,dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and primary efficacy of IBI321 in participants with locally advanced,&#xD;
      recurrent, or metastatic incurable tumors for whom standard therapy does not exist, has&#xD;
      proven to be ineffective or intolerable.&#xD;
