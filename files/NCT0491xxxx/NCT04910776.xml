&#xD;
        -  Study duration: Screening - up to 4 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Analysis Period (PAP) - 52 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extended Treatment Period (ETP) - 52 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extended Long term Treatment Period (ELTP) - 104 weeks; 4-week follow-up period for a&#xD;
           total study duration - up to 4.08 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment duration: Up to 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit frequency: every other week and potentially every week&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have confirmed diagnosis of infantile-onset Pompe disease defined&#xD;
             as: the presence of 2 lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) pathogenic variants and a&#xD;
             documented GAA deficiency from blood, skin, or muscle tissue; or the presence of 1 GAA&#xD;
             pathogenic variant and a documented GAA deficiency from blood, skin and muscle tissue&#xD;
             in 2 separate samples (from either 2 different tissues or from the same tissue but at&#xD;
             2 different sampling dates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have established cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) status&#xD;
             available prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis: ie, LVMI equivalent to&#xD;
             mean age specific LVMI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1 standard deviation for participants diagnosed by newborn screening or sibling&#xD;
                  screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 standard deviation for participants diagnosed by clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents or legally authorized representative(s) must be capable of giving signed&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency, including any ventilation use&#xD;
             (invasive or noninvasive) at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with major congenital abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of&#xD;
             symptoms relating to Pompe disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid α&#xD;
             glucosidase (rhGAA) from any source.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant who has previously been treated in any clinical trial of avalglucosidase&#xD;
             alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions, or participants potentially at&#xD;
             risk of noncompliance to study procedures.&#xD;
