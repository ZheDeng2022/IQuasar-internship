  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) after craniotomy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      besides its major health care cost. In each hospital, all measures are taken to decrease SSI.&#xD;
      Despite current prophylactic measures, rates of SSIs have been reported in up to 5% of&#xD;
      patients post craniotomy. Intrawound vancomycin powder has been studied extensively in spinal&#xD;
      fusion surgeries and been found to reduce rates of surgical site infections (SSIs)&#xD;
      significantly. Despite its success in spinal surgeries, topical vancomycin has not been&#xD;
      extensively studied with respect to cranial neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of adjuvant vancomycin powder was associated with a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative infection as well as infection-related medical costs. These&#xD;
      findings suggest that the use of adjuvant vancomycin powder in high-risk patients undergoing&#xD;
      spinal fusion is a cost-saving option for preventing postoperative infections, as it can lead&#xD;
      to cost-savings of $438,165 per 100 spinal fusions performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that Topical vancomycin is a safe, effective, and cost-saving&#xD;
      measure to prevent SSIs following craniotomy.&#xD;

      its Prospective Randomized clinical trial. The investigator will do block randomization that&#xD;
      is done by a biostatistician through SAS software . Patients will be divided in this Trial&#xD;
      into two groups, first group (intervention arm) they will receive the drug (vancomycin). The&#xD;
      second group (control arm) they will not receive the drug, otherwise both groups they will&#xD;
      receive identical measure to decrease the postoperative SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will use one vial of vancomycin that contains 1000 mg of the drug in the&#xD;
      powder form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be SSI rate factored by cohort. Secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      cost savings from vancomycin usage estimated from hospital costs associated with SSI in&#xD;
      craniotomy patients, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSI found to be around 0.49% when vancomycin was used, while SSI in standard care found to be&#xD;
      5%, to get power of study 80% and level of significance 5%. Sample size will be 250 in each&#xD;
      group using sample size calculator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical formula used in computation of required and adequate sample size in view of&#xD;
      primary outcome i.e., SSI rate between the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was computed using the following statistical formula and sample size&#xD;
      determination equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = (Zα/2+Zβ)2 * (p1(1-p1)+p2(1-p2)) / (p1-p2)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where Zα/2 is the critical value of the Normal distribution at α/2 (e.g. for a confidence&#xD;
      level of 95%, α is 0.05 and the critical value is 1.96), Zβ is the critical value of the&#xD;
      Normal distribution at β (e.g. for a power of 80%, β is 0.2 and the critical value is 0.84)&#xD;
      and p1 and p2 are the expected sample proportions of the two groups (SSI rate between the two&#xD;
      groups i.e., vancomycin and control groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study starts the investigator will do automated coded file with each code&#xD;
      randomized to either arm (intervention arm and regular arm), then patient will be assigned to&#xD;
      subsequent arm according to the code. CONSORT guidelines will be followed when reporting the&#xD;
      results of the trail.&#xD;
