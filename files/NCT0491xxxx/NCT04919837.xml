  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the WHO's definition of visual impairment, as of 2018, there were approximately&#xD;
      1.3 billion people with visual impairment in the world, and only 10% of countries can provide&#xD;
      assisting services for the rehabilitation of visual impairment. Although China is one of the&#xD;
      countries that can provide rehabilitation services for patients with visual impairment, due&#xD;
      to restrictions on the number of professionals in various regions, uneven diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment, and regional differences in economic conditions, not all visually impaired&#xD;
      patients can get the rehabilitation of assisting device fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional statistical methods were not enough to solve the problem of intelligent fitting&#xD;
      of assisting devices. At present, there are almost no intelligent fitting models of assisting&#xD;
      devices in the world. Therefore, in order to allow more low-vision patients to receive&#xD;
      accurate and rapid rehabilitation services, we conducted a cross-sectional study on the&#xD;
      assisting devices fitting for low-vision patients in Fujian Province, China in the past five&#xD;
      years, and at the same time constructed a machine learning model to intelligently predict the&#xD;
      adaptation result of the basic assisting devices for low vision patients.&#xD;
