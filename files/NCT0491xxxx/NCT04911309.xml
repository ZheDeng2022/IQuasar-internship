    <textblock>
      This cross-over study analyzes a novel and inclusive approach in how therapy for adolescents&#xD;
      with CP is administered, with the main goal of examining the effects of a functional exercise&#xD;
      intervention on motor capability and motor capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to investigate the effects of a functional movement-based exercise intervention in a&#xD;
      group setting on motor capacity, motor capability and quality of life in adolescents with CP&#xD;
      compared to standard therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent disorder which affects the development of movement and&#xD;
      posture. It causes activity limitation and is oftentimes accompanied by secondary&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems, disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regard of the complex interplay between physical restrictions, motor disabilities,&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyles and low participation in physical activity, an innovative exercise&#xD;
      intervention study for adolescents with CP is intended in order to break the stated vicious&#xD;
      cycle. This study aims at providing a novel and inclusive approach in how therapy for&#xD;
      adolescents with CP is administered, with the main goal of examining the effects of a&#xD;
      functional exercise intervention on motor capability and motor capacity.&#xD;

    <description>The bear hug carry will be performed carrying a medicine ball over a 100m distance. Two lines will be marked 20m apart and participants will be asked to walk the distance 5 times as fast as they can while holding the weighted ball in front of their chest. Participants at pre-measurement will be asked to carry the lightest ball (4 lbs). The same weight will be used in M2 as well as in M3 and the duration to walk the distance (in seconds) will be recorded. An additional test at M2 und M3 will be proposed, in which participants may choose an-other weight if they believe to be able to increase the load and repeat the test. This allows the measurement of individual increase in activity capacity. Weight and time will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The repeated chair rising test will be performed on a force plate (Leonardo Mechanography GF®, Novotec Medical GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) with a 46cm high locked bench. Starting from a seated position, arms crossed in front of the chest, participants will perform five complete sit-to-stand cycles as fast as possible. Total time of the five repetitions as well as relative power and mean velocity for a cycle will be analyzed</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric Mid-thigh pull (IMTP) is a multi-joint test which measures isometric force and rate of force development (RFD) in the back as well as lower body muscles and is strongly correlated to dynamic performance. Participants will be instructed to pull as fast and as hard as possible for a duration of 5 seconds</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Push Ups</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The push up measures upper body strength (m. triceps brachii, m. pectoralis) and reflects the participants' ability to press and control their own body weight. For a full repetition, participants must start with their arms extended, touch the ground with their chest, and press back into an extended position. To find their 6 Repetition maximum (RM), participants will position their hands on a box with their feet on the floor. As in the squat depth test, depth of the boxes increase in a 10 cm increment. The lower the boxes, the more body weight is transferred on the upper body and must be pressed. Three minutes rest will be granted between trials to ensure complete recovery. The lowest box (or floor) on which 6 full repetitions can be performed will be noted. Box height and increase of active ROM will be analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medicine Ball over Bar Lift</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the ability to lift and heave an object over an obstacle and allows a high trans-fer into daily life (i.e. lifting groceries onto a table or counter). Participants will lift a medicine ball from the ground and drop it over a bar installed in a rack at chest height as many times as possi-ble over 60 seconds, whereby testing personnel will roll the ball back in front of participants feet after every repetition. Weight of MB will be determined individually at M1 and corresponds to a 6 RM (whereby the lightest weight is a 4 lbs ball and the heaviest a 30 lbs medicine ball). Number of repetitions in the given time will be recorded. At M2 and M3, test will be repeated with the same medicine ball. Additionally, a new 6 RM will be determined and in the case of an increase in weight the test will be repeated with the new weight. Weight and number of repetitions will be recorded and increase in work capacity will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Seated sled pull</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess participants' strength capacity in pulling strength, seated sled pulls will be performed. From a seated position, participants will pull a weighted sled over 20m using their upper body. Participants must pull the entire rope length (20m) without interruption in order for it to be counted as valid. The resistance (weight on the sled) will be increased in every round until failure (cannot pull rope or pull is interrupted). Weight and time of every round will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximum Power Output</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum power output and anaerobic capacity will be measured on an Assault Bike (Assault AirBike Classic ®, Ostfildern, Germany). Participants will perform a 1-minute all-out test. The resistance increases in line with rotations per minute (RPM). Participants will be instructed to go as hard as they can for the entire minute. Maximum heartrate and mean watt will be recorded and relative watt calculated to measure maximum power output.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (M1), at week 12 (M2: after intervention phase 1) and at week 24 (M3: after intervention phase 2)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to examine whether the intervention increases activity in daily life, patients will be asked to wear an Actigraph wGT3X-BT around their non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive days and nights during each measuring phase. This triaxial accelerometer records intensity and duration of acceleration and converts the signals to &quot;activity counts&quot;, allowing an analysis of duration and intensity of movement patterns during everyday life.</description>

    <description>12 weeks functional exercise training twice per week, each session lasting 60 min, additionally to standard therapy. Training sessions will be performed in a group-setting consisting of minimum 4 and maximum 8 participants and coached by experienced sport scientists with the supervision of a medical doctor. The exercises will be individually pants and constantly recorded in order to allow a progression over the course of the 12 week-period. The motor tasks and exercises will be tailored to individual capacity by experienced and trained sport scientists and coaches, therefore insuring the participants' safety and a continuous and progressive monitoring of training load.&#xD;
After 12 weeks the groups will switch the intervention method. Group 1 will therefore reassume their standard therapy for 12 weeks.</description>
