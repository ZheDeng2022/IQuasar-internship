  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study project will aim at the evaluation of the occurrence of exercise desaturation&#xD;
      phenomenon during two different modalities of exercise (walking and stepping condition). This&#xD;
      study will allow determining the sensibility of the 3-minute step test to detect exercise&#xD;
      desaturation, in comparison with the gold standard (6-minute walking test). The 3-minute step&#xD;
      test could therefore appear as a complementary tool for the evaluation of oxygen desaturation&#xD;
      in chronic respiratory disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 6-minute walking test is currently the gold standard for the evaluation of oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation phenomenon during exercise and for the adjustment of O2 flow rate. But, due to&#xD;
      spatial constraints, this test remains difficult to apply in ecological conditions and the&#xD;
      3-minute step test could be a complementary method to the walking test for the evaluation of&#xD;
      chronic respiratory diseases. For this study, patients will perform, during 2 visits, a&#xD;
      maximal graded test and two field tests (6-min walking test and 3-min step test) under&#xD;
      identical conditions. During these tests, pulsed oxygen saturation and psycho-physiological&#xD;
      adaptations to exercise will be monitored.&#xD;

    <description>For this research, 2 visits will be scheduled (V1 and V2) for each patient. During V1, after collecting the filled and signed consent form from the patient, anthropometric measurements and pulmonary function assessment will be performed before the realization of a maximal graded test. This inclusion visit will be carried out as part of an inclusion within a respiratory rehabilitation program. During V2, each patient will randomly perform a 6-minute walking test and a 3-minute step test, in similar standard conditions. A 30-minute resting period will be allowed between the two field tests. During the realization of the tests, cardio-respiratory adaptations will be monitored throughout both tests with portable gas analyzer and pulsed oxymetry system.</description>
