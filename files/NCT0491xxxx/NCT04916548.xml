  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we will A) track the functioning of a collection of potential&#xD;
      neurobiological targets for depression over time, B) examine how fluctuations in the&#xD;
      functioning of those targets relates to real-world functioning, and C) in a subset of the&#xD;
      sample, determine how the functioning in those targets is altered by a single dose of&#xD;
      ketamine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. be between the ages of 18 and 60 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. score ≥ 14 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. possess a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and examinations&#xD;
             required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of lifetime bipolar, psychotic, or autism spectrum; current problematic&#xD;
             substance use (e.g., ongoing moderate-to-severe substance use disorder);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Failure to meet standard MRI inclusion criteria: those who have cardiac pacemakers,&#xD;
             neural pacemakers, cochlear implants, metal braces, or other non-MRI-compatible metal&#xD;
             objects in their body. History of significant injury or surgery to the brain or spinal&#xD;
             cord that would impair interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Acute suicidality or other psychiatric crises requiring treatment escalation. We will&#xD;
             use the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) as both an initial exclusion&#xD;
             criteria (CSSRS &quot;Baseline/Screening&quot; Version for past 1month period) and as grounds&#xD;
             for rescue/removal (CSSRS &quot;Since Last Visit&quot; form). The CSSRS will be administered&#xD;
             using a paper form by an experienced and thoroughly trained clinical assessor on the&#xD;
             study team. Subjects with CSSRS suicide ideation scores scored &quot;yes&quot; on items 4&#xD;
             (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act) and/or 5 (active suicidal ideation&#xD;
             with specific plan and intent) will be excluded from the study, and if enrolled, will&#xD;
             be exited from the study and referred immediately to the nearest emergency mental&#xD;
             health facility for additional thorough assessment and appropriate treatment referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Changes made to treatment regimen within 4 weeks of baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Reading level &lt;6th grade as per patient self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have received ECT in the past 2 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ketamine phase subsample additional exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients currently taking any psychotropic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lifetime recreational ketamine or PCP use&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current pregnancy or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For ketamine phase entry, patients must be reasonable medical candidates for ketamine&#xD;
             infusion, as determined by a physician co-investigator. Serious, unstable medical&#xD;
             illnesses including respiratory [obstructive sleep apnea, or history of difficulty&#xD;
             with airway management during previous anesthetics], cardiovascular [including&#xD;
             ischemic heart disease and uncontrolled hypertension], and neurologic [including&#xD;
             history of severe head injury] will be exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant abnormal findings of laboratory parameters [including urine&#xD;
             toxicology screen for drugs of abuse], physical examination, or ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, as determined by a physician&#xD;
             co-investigator's review of vitals collected during screening and any other relevant&#xD;
             medical history/records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients starting hormonal treatment (e.g., estrogen) in the 3 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Past intolerance or hypersensitivity to ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients taking medications with known activity at the NMDA or AMPA glutamate receptor&#xD;
             [e.g., riluzole, amantadine, lamotrigine, memantine, topiramate, dextromethorphan,&#xD;
             Dcycloserine], or the mu-opioid receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients taking any of the following medications: St John's Wort, theophylline,&#xD;
             tramadol, metrizamide.&#xD;
