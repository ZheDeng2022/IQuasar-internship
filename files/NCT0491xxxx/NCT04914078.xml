  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a hypothesis-generating project to investigate a) infective etiology and b)&#xD;
      inflammatory profile of the exacerbations of asthma in severe asthmatic patients treated with&#xD;
      the humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5 Mepolizumab. Under these treatment&#xD;
      conditions the study will inform on the relationship between these two axes: infection &amp;&#xD;
      innate immunity Vs inflammatory profile changes occurring during exacerbation events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will also explore the effect of Mepolizumab treatment on airway&#xD;
      microbial composition and on airway/systemic immune response both at stable state and at the&#xD;
      exacerbation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Longitudinal, observational study to evaluate the infective etiology and the inflammatory&#xD;
      profile of asthma exacerbations in severe asthmatic patients treated (as part of routine&#xD;
      medical care) with the humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5 Mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants receive Mepolizumab as part of routine medical care (see inclusion&#xD;
      criteria). The study will assess the effect of the intervention (Mepolizumab) on airway&#xD;
      microbial compositions and on airway/systemic inflammation at exacerbation and at stable&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be evaluated at baseline (the day of Mepolizumab initiation, before&#xD;
      Mepolizumab administration - V0), at 1 month after Mepolizumab initiation (treatment visit -&#xD;
      V1), at exacerbation (exacerbation visit - V2) and at 3 months after the exacerbation event&#xD;
      (convalescence visit - V3) up to 12-month study period (Table 1). To perform the&#xD;
      convalescence visit, a 3-month extension of the study period will be applied if the&#xD;
      exacerbation occurs from month 9 to month 12 from the initiation of Mepolizumab. Recurrent&#xD;
      exacerbation events will be evaluated separately when a paired-3-month convalescence visit&#xD;
      can be performed within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will contact the center/researchers in case of worsening of the respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms to schedule the exacerbation visit. The visit will be performed within 7 days from&#xD;
      the beginning of the deterioration of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the following procedures will be performed in all the patients: 1)&#xD;
      Clinical/pharmacological assessment (including assessment of asthma control; and measurements&#xD;
      of central and peripheral fractional exhaled nitric oxide); 2) lung function tests (including&#xD;
      lung volumes evaluation and small airway functional assessment by impulse oscillometry -&#xD;
      IOS); 3) blood and sputum differential inflammatory cell counts; 4) sputum samples for&#xD;
      microbiological assays (conventional sputum cultures and Multiplex Real Time PCR for virus&#xD;
      and bacterial detection); 5) blood and sputum samples for cytokine profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a representative subgroup of patients (n=30) breath condensate, blood and sputum samples&#xD;
      will be performed for: 1) airway microbiome (16S ribosomal RNA Sequencing) evaluation; 2)&#xD;
      blood innate immune responses; 3) transcriptomics and proteomics of sputum inflammatory&#xD;
      cells; 4) breathomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been submitted for approval to the ethics committee, and informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from each enrolled subject.&#xD;
