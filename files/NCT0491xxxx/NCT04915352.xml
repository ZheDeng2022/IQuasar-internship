    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the positive predictive value of the combination&#xD;
      rapid nasal provocation test (RNTP) + skin tests (TC) + specific immunoglobulins E (IgEs) to&#xD;
      the combination of TC + IgEs (strategy currently used in clinical practice) concerning the&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment with Allergen immunotherapy (ITA) at 1 year, in patients with symptoms&#xD;
      suggesting allergic rhinitis to house dust mites.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis due to house dust mites (AAR) is a common condition which impairs the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and which can be responsible for complications such as the&#xD;
      development of asthma. The only curative treatment available is allergenic immunotherapy&#xD;
      (ITA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnostic approach is based on the history, which collects the symptoms&#xD;
      reported by patients during a possible allergen exposure and on the results of skin tests&#xD;
      (CT) and / or specific IgE assays (IgEs), which confirm biological sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent retrospective study, the positive predictive value of TCs and IgEs is estimated&#xD;
      at 77% for D. pteronyssinus and 69% for D. farinae. Approximately 30% of patients who have&#xD;
      TCs and / or IgEs directed against mites therefore only have biological sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasal challenge test (NPT) has been shown to be an effective tool in improving the&#xD;
      diagnosis of dust mite allergic rhinitis. The RNTP is easy to perform, consisting of the&#xD;
      nasal spraying of 3 solutions of increasing concentrations (50; 500 and 5000 SBE / ml). RNTP&#xD;
      demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity (83.7% and 100%) as well as identical safety in&#xD;
      use compared to &quot;classic&quot; TPN. But its real impact on the diagnostic and above all&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy has not yet been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that RNTP has a positive predictive value superior to TC and IgEs for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of allergic rhinitis to dust mites and therefore for the efficacy of ITA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate this, the investigators propose to compare the diagnostic values of these 3&#xD;
      tests, taking the efficacy of ITA at 1 year as the gold standard. The expected results are&#xD;
      better predictive values for RNTP, and therefore the possibility of avoiding unnecessary&#xD;
      treatments for the patients concerned. About 30% of patients could be treated wrongly now,&#xD;
      with the use of TCs and IgEs alone.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is negative predictive value, calculated with the efficacy of ITA at 1 year as the gold standard. It corresponds to the number of patients for whom treatment with an ITA will have been effective at 1 year, divided by the number of patients who have received an ITA.&#xD;
It will be calculated on the one hand for patients with TC and / or IgEs positive (control strategy), and on the other hand for patients with TC and / or IgEs positive and RNTP positive.</description>

    <description>cSMS: Combined Symptom and Medication Score The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology published a consensus related to the combination of symptom and medication scores (MSs). The total daily medication score (dMS) ranges from 0 to 3. The CSMS is the sum of total daily symptom score (dSS:range 0-3) and total daily medication score (dMS: range 0-3). Therefore, the values of CSMS are in the range of 0-6 (minmum-maximum).</description>

    <description>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) The RQLQ is a self-administered questionnaire that contains 28 questions in 7 domains: activities limitation (3 questions), sleep problems (3 questions), nose symptoms (4 questions), eye symptoms (4 questions), non-nose or eye symptoms (7 questions), practical problems (3 questions), and emotional function (4 questions). Scores for each question range from 0 (not troubled/none of the time) to 6 (extremely troubled/all of the time). The overall RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses, and the individual domain scores are the means of the questions in each domain - both range from 0 to 6.</description>
