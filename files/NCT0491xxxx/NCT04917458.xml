      One in eleven adults falls ill with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and 90% of them suffered from type&#xD;
      2 DM. Depression in type 2 DM patients had a big impact, acting as a major barrier to&#xD;
      self-care in type 2 DM patients. Depression in diabetes patients is also associated with&#xD;
      decreasing quality of life. Poor self-care behavior and adherence, poor glycemic control, and&#xD;
      increased risk of mortality about 36-38% from cardiovascular complications are other known&#xD;
      debilitating results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D receptors are present in many organ systems, namely the pancreas, intestine,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects, which were seen from&#xD;
      its mechanism as an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory agent. Based on&#xD;
      the mechanism of Vitamin D action in the nervous system, which also plays a role in&#xD;
      depression pathogenesis, vitamin D is hypothesized to have a beneficial effect on depression,&#xD;
      both for depression prevention and treatment. Few studies denote that Vitamin D can improve&#xD;
      depression in type 2 DM patients. Vitamin D may become an important adjuvant therapy to&#xD;
      ameliorate depression in type 2 DM patients. These clinical trials concerning vitamin D in&#xD;
      type 2 DM are relevant, reminding that type 2 DM resulted in higher morbidity, mortality, and&#xD;
      numerous high-risk complications in the population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to World Health Organization report's, depression was estimated causing distress in&#xD;
      most people on 2030. 1 In Indonesia, the prevalence of depression in 2017 was 3,7%.2&#xD;
      Depression often found in Internal medicine patient's as a comorbid in various chronic&#xD;
      diseases. 3 One of the most common chronic disease is type 2 diabetes mellitus. There's one&#xD;
      in eleven adults suffered from diabetes mellitus, and 90% of them had type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM). Basic Health Research Data on 2018 showed there were 10.9% case type 2 DM in&#xD;
      Indonesia. 4 DKI Jakarta Province had 3,4% or 11.226 people aged 15 years and over with&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus and had been a highest prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus among population&#xD;
      aged 15 years and over. Meanwhile, prevalence of depression among adults aged 15 and over in&#xD;
      DKI Jakarta was 5.9%. Seminkovics K et al5 reported one in four people with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus suffered from depression in United States. In Indonesia, Nasrun WMS6 reported there&#xD;
      were 27,6% prevalence of depression in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients's with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, while Arshita et al7 found there were 60% patients with depression in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus patients with pedic ulcers in RSCM .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients had a big impact, such as: depression can be&#xD;
      a major barrier to self-care in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. 1,5 Depression in diabetes&#xD;
      patients is also associated with decreasing quality of life. 6 Poor of self-care behavior and&#xD;
      adherence, poor of glycemic control, and increased risk of mortality about 36-38% from&#xD;
      cardiovascular complication are other known debilitating results. 8 Vitamin D receptors are&#xD;
      present in various organs such as the pancreas, intestine, musculoskeletal, and nervous&#xD;
      system. Vitamin D has a pleiotrophic effect which were seen from its mechanism as&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory. 16 Based on mechanism of Vitamin D&#xD;
      action in nervous system, which also plays a role in the depression pathogenesis, vitamin D&#xD;
      is hypothesized to have a beneficial effect on depression, both for prevention and treat the&#xD;
      pathomechanism. The protective effect of Vitamin D for prevent depression had been widely&#xD;
      studied in copious observational epidemiological studies, although with diversified results.&#xD;
      Many studies have been conducted to assess the beneficial effects of vitamin D on a variety&#xD;
      outcomes including depression, which are summarized in systematic reviews and meta-analyzes&#xD;
      of observational studies. A meta-analyses by Ju SY et al38 found that low plasma 25 (OH) D&#xD;
      levels were associated with and increased risk of depression in a cross sectional study with&#xD;
      43,1377 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem. Vitamin D had known as an important role&#xD;
      in biological processes, calcium homeostasis, and various health problems. In addition to its&#xD;
      role in musculoskeletal, vitamin D is also associated with a few non-musculoskeletal diseases&#xD;
      such as immunity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and psychological&#xD;
      problems like dementia or depression. 17 Both Vitamin D and its analogues are natural ligands&#xD;
      for vitamin D receptor (VDR). Vitamin D receptors are widely distributed throughout body&#xD;
      including brain and pancreas. Vitamin D receptors found in cerebellum, hippocampus,&#xD;
      substantia nigra, basal forebrain, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus. This explains the role&#xD;
      of vitamin D in brain development and emotional disorders. In brain development, vitamin D&#xD;
      played role in proliferation and differentiation of neuron cells. In adult brain, vitamin D&#xD;
      played a role in neurogenesis in the hippocampus and synthesizes neurotransmitters such as&#xD;
      dopamine, GABA, and serotonin. 18 It's known as depression neurotransmitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies showed that vitamin D might repair neurotransmitters, inflammation, metabolic,&#xD;
      and oxidative stress. Cholecalciferol will activate 1-Î± hydroxylase enzymes and P450&#xD;
      cytochrome, which transformed calcifediol hydroxylation into activated vitamin D in central&#xD;
      nervous system, so that improving depression. Anti depressants such as SSRIs (Selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors), can induce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients whose taking&#xD;
      anti-platelets or anti-coagulants, increase weight and dyslipidemia. Thus, other studies&#xD;
      therapy based on pathogenesis of depression, effective and side effects need to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies denote that Vitamin D can improve depression in type 2 DM patients. Those studies&#xD;
      used only Beck Depression Inventory test to assess depression without any biological markers.&#xD;
      Vitamin D may become an important adjuvant therapy to ameliorate depression in type 2 DM.&#xD;
      These clinical trials concerning vitamin D in type 2 DM are relevant, reminding that type 2&#xD;
      DM resulted in higher morbidity, mortality and numerous high risk complication in the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, and controlled clinical&#xD;
      study to investigate the effects of cholecalciferol on depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus patients. Patients included into the study will be randomized into two groups and&#xD;
      receive placebo (as control group) or cholecalciferol administered orally for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion : Vitamin D may become an important adjuvant therapy to ameliorate depression in&#xD;
      type 2 DM patients. Thus, type 2 diabetes mellitus with depression symptoms will have a&#xD;
      better quality of life.&#xD;
