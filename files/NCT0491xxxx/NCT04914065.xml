  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) has become a hotspot issue in the&#xD;
      patients with critical illness. The symptoms of ICUAW, including sensory impairment and&#xD;
      muscle atrophy, may lead to poor quality of life even though the patients discharged from the&#xD;
      ICU for a long time. Therefore, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. At the same&#xD;
      time, early evaluation is necessary to keep critically ill patients away from ICUAW. Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC) scale is the most common approach for diagnosis clinically. Regarding&#xD;
      the interrater variation of MRC, handgrip strength (HGS) has been thought to be a simple and&#xD;
      accurate alternative. However, HGS does not belong to antigravity or respiratory muscle which&#xD;
      are the first to be affected by immobilization. It is still unknown whether HGS can represent&#xD;
      the general muscle condition in ICU or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, previous studies have proved that patients with critical illness in the ICU&#xD;
      would have better prognosis and less complications, if they undergo physical therapy as soon&#xD;
      as possible. In addition to early ventilator weaning and reduced mortality rate, physical&#xD;
      therapy could enhance quality of life (QoL) after patient discharges from hospital. However,&#xD;
      early mobility in the ICU mainly emphasizes cardiopulmonary patients due to the traditional&#xD;
      concept in Taiwan. Hence, the duration of mechanical ventilation in the critical patients&#xD;
      will affect the timing to receive physical therapy, even impact the improvement of QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these reasons, this study will investigate the relationship between HGS and muscle&#xD;
      mass among patients with critical illness and find the predictors of the short-term and&#xD;
      long-term goals in the ICU, including ventilator weaning and QoL after hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective and observational study will be divided into 2 parts: 1) The association&#xD;
      between handgrip strength and muscle mass in intensive care unit patients. 2) Predictors of&#xD;
      short-term and long-term goals in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the surgery intensive care unit of Taoyuan General Hospital will be recruited and&#xD;
      evaluated in 48 hours from admission to ICU. The outcome measures include HGS assessed by&#xD;
      electronic hand dynamometer and muscle thickness of diaphragm and quadriceps detected by&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term goal is weaning ventilator, and the long-term goal is quality of life after&#xD;
      discharge from hospital assessed through SF-36 Taiwan version. Patients in the surgery&#xD;
      intensive care unit of Taoyuan General Hospital will be recruited and evaluated in 48 hours&#xD;
      after ICU admission. The collected data contain muscle strength, muscle mass, physical&#xD;
      function, respiratory function, and observation of delirium or not. The evaluations of muscle&#xD;
      strength include 3 parts which are limbs(handgrip), respiratory muscle(Maximal Inspiratory&#xD;
      Pressure), and general muscle strength(Medical Research Council scale); Secondly, the&#xD;
      evaluations of muscle mass divide 2 parts which are limbs(muscle thickness of quadriceps) and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle(muscle thickness of diaphragm); Thirdly, the evaluations of physical&#xD;
      function are 2 ways which are FSS-ICU and 2 mins walk test after discharge from the ICU;&#xD;
      Fourthly, the evaluations of respiratory function contain 3 measurements of FEV1, FVC, and&#xD;
      FEV1/FVC; Finally, the evaluation of delirium is assessed by CAM-ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will use SPSS version 24. Pearson correlation test will be conducted&#xD;
      to investigate the association between HGS and muscle thickness. Multiple regression will be&#xD;
      used to investigate the predictors for weaning ventilator successfully and quality of life&#xD;
      after hospital discharge.&#xD;
