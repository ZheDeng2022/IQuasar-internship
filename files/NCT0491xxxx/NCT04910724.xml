  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel study will examine the effects of energy balance and varying&#xD;
      magnitudes of energy deficit on 1) the protein kinetic responses to consuming high quality&#xD;
      protein and 2) carbohydrate oxidation during steady-state exercise. Healthy adults,&#xD;
      representative of active duty military personnel, will complete a 2 d energy balance phase&#xD;
      followed by a randomly assigned, 5 d energy deficit phase (n=15 per group; 20%, 40% and 60%&#xD;
      energy deficit). At the end of each energy phase the effects of energy balance and energy&#xD;
      deficit severity on resting postabsorptive (fasting) and postprandial (after consuming ~34 g&#xD;
      protein) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and whole-body protein synthesis, breakdown, and&#xD;
      balance (synthesis - breakdown) will be determined. On the next day, the effects energy&#xD;
      balance and energy deficit severity on carbohydrate oxidation during steady-state exercise&#xD;
      will be determined. Primary study procedures include anthropometric and body composition&#xD;
      measures, resting metabolic rate measures, aerobic exercise, tightly controlled diet and&#xD;
      exercise interventions, repeated blood sampling, stable isotope infusion, stable isotope&#xD;
      ingestion, and percutaneous muscle biopsies. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) Δ&#xD;
      (postprandial - postabsorptive) MPS and Δ whole-body protein balance at rest will&#xD;
      progressively decrease as magnitude of energy deficit increases and 2) exogenous carbohydrate&#xD;
      oxidation will be higher and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation will be lower during&#xD;
      steady-state exercise as magnitude of energy deficit increases.&#xD;
