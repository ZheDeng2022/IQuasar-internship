  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In motor learning is essential to consider that movements are produced by the cooperation and&#xD;
      combination of many brain structures and are influenced by the emotions to which individuals&#xD;
      are subjected. Several neural circuits have been identified that closely link the emotional&#xD;
      system and the motion control system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arousal is associated with many emotional responses and has effects on the nervous and motor&#xD;
      system. In line with the &quot;Inverted 'U' Hypothesis&quot;, all levels of both high and low arousal&#xD;
      do not allow optimal task performance, yet moderate levels lead to excellent performance.&#xD;
      Arousal also plays a vital role in movement learning, where a critical element is memory.&#xD;
      There is evidence that a minimum level of arousal is required to encode or record information&#xD;
      and that that moderate levels of arousal improve memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how movement, emotions and interactions are regulated is significant because of&#xD;
      the large number of movements humans perform. Of these, manual tasks represent precise&#xD;
      movements that require the integration of many elements by the nervous system to perform&#xD;
      these tasks successfully. How different levels of arousal influence the way manual tasks are&#xD;
      learned is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, motor imagery (MI) is a cognitive process that is an important contributor&#xD;
      to how movements are planned and executed. The use of MI has been recommended to improve&#xD;
      movement learning and task execution. For an effective and individualize MI program is&#xD;
      imperative to know this capacity. However, how different levels of arousal can affect our&#xD;
      motor imagery ability is also still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine and quantify the effects of arousal levels&#xD;
      in the learning of a precise manual task not previously trained on four parameters of fine&#xD;
      motor control: time, error, speed, and accuracy. On the other hand, the aim is to determine&#xD;
      if the ability of internal visual, external visual, and kinaesthetic imagery varies when&#xD;
      participants are subjected to different levels of arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches expect that non-anxious, non-stressed participants who are shown images that&#xD;
      elicit an optimal level of arousal will show better motor performance on the fine motor task&#xD;
      and better motor imagery ability. In contrast, researches expect that participants without&#xD;
      anxiety and stress who are shown pictures that elicit a sub-optimal level of arousal will&#xD;
      show poorer motor performance on the fine motor task and poorer motor imagery ability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to meet the study objectives of determining and quantifying the effects of arousal&#xD;
      levels on learning a precise manual task and on motor imagery ability, this study will be&#xD;
      conducted. The development of the study will take place in a conditioned room belonging to&#xD;
      the University of Alcala, the Complutense University of Madrid, or the European University of&#xD;
      Madrid. The study may also be carried out in other Spanish and international university&#xD;
      centers, subject to the consent and permission of the respective centres. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out by all national and international laws, regulations, and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be longitudinal, experimental, randomized, and double-blind, as&#xD;
      specified in the present registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be composed of participants who are undergraduate and postgraduate&#xD;
      students at the university centers where the study will be carried out, from which the&#xD;
      participants will be recruited. All participants included in the study must meet the study&#xD;
      selection criteria and participate voluntarily after reading the information sheet and&#xD;
      signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three intervention groups, in which low, medium, or high arousal&#xD;
      will be induced, respectively. Each group will consist of a minimum number of 30 subjects to&#xD;
      be able to study the desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each participant freely chooses to participate in the study, an initial questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to ensure that each participant meet the criteria for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. At this point, the participant will be coded and assigned a number, which will serve&#xD;
      as identification throughout the study. Participants will take the State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI), one of the most widely used instruments for the self-reported assessment of&#xD;
      anxiety and equivalent to a measure of stress, as it considers the amount of stressful&#xD;
      stimulus. Thus, the two components of anxiety will be assessed: state anxiety and trait&#xD;
      anxiety. Participants with scores indicative of state or trait anxiety will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study, and those with scores indicating neither trait anxiety nor state anxiety will be&#xD;
      included. Included participants will be randomized through sealed envelopes stratified by&#xD;
      gender to one of three experimental groups: low arousal, medium arousal, and high arousal.&#xD;
      Participants will also take the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3) to measure internal&#xD;
      visual, external visual, kinaesthetic imagery ability, and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory&#xD;
      (EHI) to determine the participant's laterality. Depending on the group to which participants&#xD;
      have been assigned, participants will be visualize a series of International Affective&#xD;
      Picture System (IAPS) images that will induce the different states of arousal. The IAPS is&#xD;
      one of the most widely used standardized emotion-eliciting stimulus sets in experimental&#xD;
      research and has been shown to produce reliable and measurable changes in all three emotional&#xD;
      response systems in the study population of this study: subjective-verbal, behavioral and&#xD;
      physiological. After visualizing the images, participants will learn a precise manual task&#xD;
      with the non-dominant hand. The task will consist of going over a 127 mm circumference on a&#xD;
      graphics tablet at a rate of 2 seconds per lap, which will be set by a metronome using a&#xD;
      wireless pen that will leave no trace of ink but will store the data in the MATLAB program&#xD;
      via the graphics tablet. Thus, data from the learning process and short-term memory of the&#xD;
      task will be recorded. Afterward, there will be a 20-minute break during which participants&#xD;
      will perform the MIQ-3 again. Finally, the task data will be collected to record the&#xD;
      long-term memory of the manual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during all experiments, electrodermal activity and heart rate variability will&#xD;
      be recorded using the Empatica E4 physiological variable measurement wristband. This&#xD;
      measurement of physiological variables will serve to confirm that a significant emotional&#xD;
      effect has been generated and to test motor imagery processes since both arousal and motor&#xD;
      imagery produce activation of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis and processing of data from MATLAB version R2020b, and the Empatica E4 wristband&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS 25.0 statistical software and Kubios HRV software (for HRV&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to see if the data are distributed&#xD;
      according to a standard curve through the Shapiro-Wilk test and to assess the influence of&#xD;
      sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the descriptive analysis of the relative and absolute frequencies for the&#xD;
      qualitative variables of gender and age will be carried out, and their homogeneity will be&#xD;
      tested using the Chi-square test. The descriptive analysis of the quantitative variables of&#xD;
      time, error, speed, accuracy, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and&#xD;
      kinaesthetic, internal visual, and external visual imagery will also be carried out. If the&#xD;
      variable conforms to the normal, the mean, range, and standard deviation shall be calculated.&#xD;
      If the variables do not conform to normality, non-parametric tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis will be performed using mixed ANOVA to see the differences in the mean&#xD;
      values respective to motor control (time, error, speed, and accuracy), and the differences&#xD;
      between the first and last lap and between consecutive laps of the task in the same four&#xD;
      parameters, both in the task performed in the short term and the long term. A further ANOVA&#xD;
      analysis will take place for imagery ability, comparing the results obtained at the two&#xD;
      respective points during the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of learning between laps will be analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA comparing&#xD;
      each motor control measurement parameter with respect to the lapping factor. Electrodermal&#xD;
      activity, and heart rate variability during the measurement of imagery ability, emotional&#xD;
      state induction, manual task learning, and its maintenance in the short and long term will&#xD;
      also be studied by repeated-measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hypothesis testing, a significance level of 0.05 will be set.&#xD;
