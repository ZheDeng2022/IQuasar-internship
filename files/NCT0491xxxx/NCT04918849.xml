  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital misinformation has been flagged as a major risk of the 21st century, with an&#xD;
      estimated cost of $78 billion to the global economy each year. Given this scope, we propose&#xD;
      to characterize how misinformation is spread via messenger platforms (e.g. WhatsApp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we seek to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify metrics of potential misinformation (Aim 1). This is based on the hypothesis&#xD;
           that although message contents are highly private, proxy markers can be used to identify&#xD;
           potential misinformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand the base-rate by which misinformation is shared via messaging applications&#xD;
           (Aim 2). This is founded on the hypothesis that misinformation is endemic on messaging&#xD;
           platforms, and thus needs to be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify &quot;super spreaders&quot; responsible for sending and receiving a large volume of&#xD;
           misinformation (Aim 3). Here, we hypothesise that a small group of super spreaders are&#xD;
           responsible for the bulk of misinformation-sharing on messaging applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thrust of this work aligns with both government priorities and the grant's thematic&#xD;
      areas, providing actionable findings that are timely amidst a worldwide surge of&#xD;
      misinformation.&#xD;
