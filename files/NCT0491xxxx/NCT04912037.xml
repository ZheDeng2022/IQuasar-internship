    <textblock>
      In this study,the AI-assisted system（EndoAngel）has the functions of reminding the ileocecal&#xD;
      junction, withdrawal time, withdrawal speed, sliding lens, polyps in the field of vision,&#xD;
      etc. These functions can improve the colonoscopy performance of novice physicians and assist&#xD;
      the colonoscopy training。&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a key technique for detecting and diagnosing lesions of the lower digestive&#xD;
      tract.High-quality endoscopy leads to better disease outcomes.However, the demand for&#xD;
      endoscopy is high in China, and endoscopy is in short supply.A colonoscopy is a complex&#xD;
      technical procedure that requires training and experience for maximal accuracy and&#xD;
      safety.Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the colonoscopy ability of novice&#xD;
      physicians and shorten the colonoscopy training time for solving the problems such as the&#xD;
      lack and uneven distribution of digestive endoscopists and the substandard quality of&#xD;
      endoscopy in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been continuously developed and increasingly&#xD;
      mature.They have been gradually applied to the medical field. Computer vision is a science&#xD;
      that studies how to make machines &quot;see&quot;. Through deep learning, camera and computer can&#xD;
      replace human eyes to carry out machine vision such as target recognition, tracking and&#xD;
      measurement.Interdisciplinary cooperation in the field of medical imaging and computer vision&#xD;
      is also one of the research hotspots in recent years. At present, it is mainly applied to the&#xD;
      automatic identification and detection of lesions and quality control, and has achieved good&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary experiments have shown that deep learning has a high accuracy in endoscopic&#xD;
      quality monitoring, which can effectively regulate doctors' operations, reduce blind spots&#xD;
      and improve the quality of endoscopic examination.At the same time, it can also monitor the&#xD;
      doctor's withdrawal time in real time and improve the detection rate of adenoma.In the&#xD;
      previous work of our research group, we have successfully developed deep learning-based&#xD;
      colonoscopy withdraw speed monitoring and intestinal cleanliness assessment, and verified the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the AI-assisted system（EndoAngel） in improving the quality of gastroscopy&#xD;
      and colonoscopy in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above rich foundation of preliminary work, as well as the huge demand in the&#xD;
      field of colonoscopy training,By comparing the colonoscopy operation training for novices&#xD;
      with and without EndoAngel assistance, we plan to compare the colonoscopy learning effect of&#xD;
      novices with and without assistance, including skill results and cognitive level, to explore&#xD;
      whether AI can promote the improvement of the colonoscopy operation training for novices.&#xD;
