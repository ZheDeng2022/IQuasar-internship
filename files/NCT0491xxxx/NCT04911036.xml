    <measure>Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (score PPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The score PPQ derived from this instrument corresponds to the number of items (there are 14) to which the parent responded positively (theoretical spread: 0-14 points)</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire on early support</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire co-constructed with the Association Française de l'Atresie de l'œsophage (AFAO) to collect information on the perception of support available or received upon suspicion of an abnormality in the child. It consists of 15 questions. The first eight explore satisfaction with various aspects of early support (information, support, professionals met...). The next seven address parental perceptions regarding information and support. Most of the questions are to be answered on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., from &quot;Not at all satisfied&quot; to &quot;Very satisfied&quot; or &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Almost always&quot;), the other questions are closed-ended. Time to complete the test: 5 to 10 minutes.</description>
