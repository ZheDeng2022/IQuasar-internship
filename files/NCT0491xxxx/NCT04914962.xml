    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the antagonist enamel wear of two processing options of&#xD;
      Celtra duo crowns (polished and glaze fired) restoring posterior teeth in comparison with&#xD;
      sound enamel wear at baseline and 6 months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive dental ceramics have proven to guarantee optimal esthetic results alongside&#xD;
      satisfactory mechanical properties. Due to these qualities, today they are considered the&#xD;
      first-choice restorative materials both for minimal restorations and for the reconstruction&#xD;
      of severely compromised teeth. Gold alloy reconstructions preferred in the past, especially&#xD;
      for their optimal wear properties, have been progressively substituted by these new&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of hard tooth substance is a natural process taking place during mastication. Also,&#xD;
      Increased wear is a common reason of failure for restorations exposed to masticatory forces.&#xD;
      Excessive wear may be responsible for numerous problems, such as hypersensitivity, loss of&#xD;
      occlusal contact, defects of the periodontium, reduction of masticatory efficiency, tooth&#xD;
      migration and wrong tooth relations, weakness of masticatory muscles, and changes in the&#xD;
      vertical and horizontal jaw relations, which may cause functional and esthetic impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optimal restorative material should provide similar characteristics to natural dental&#xD;
      tissues. The physiological wear of enamel and dentin should represent the reference for a&#xD;
      reasonable wear pattern of restorative materials The manufacturers tend to improve the&#xD;
      mechanical behavior of their products leads to the progressive offer of new ceramics for&#xD;
      daily practice. Assessment of their wear behavior and comparison through detailed tests&#xD;
      become necessary at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      comparing the wear of enamel opposing polished zirconia, polished lithium disilicate crowns&#xD;
      opposing to natural tooth. Patients were recalled after 1year and impression were recorded&#xD;
      with opposing arch and baseline and final cast were scanned and superimposed using 3 D&#xD;
      scanner. They found that the mean of occlusal wear of the antagonistic enamel of polished&#xD;
      zirconia was 42.0 μm, Enamel wear against natural antagonist (control group) 34.68 μm,&#xD;
      whereas, for Enamel wear against polished lithium disilicate crowns (group 2) 40.06 μm Enamel&#xD;
      wear against natural antagonist (control group) 35.09 μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      studying the quality of CAD/CAM fabricated single tooth restorations (Ten zirconia&#xD;
      restorations were compared to 12 metal ceramic and 10 lithium disilicate counterparts). They&#xD;
      found that were no significant differences between the studied crown systems. No difference&#xD;
      of the gingival response among the different crown systems. Eighty percent of zirconia crowns&#xD;
      needed no occlusal adjustment; also it showed the least amount of marginal discrepancy.&#xD;
