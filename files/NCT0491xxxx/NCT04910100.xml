  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (in the eye and throughout the body) and&#xD;
      effectiveness of nebivolol (0.5 and 1 percent) and timolol (0.5 percent) eye drop&#xD;
      suspensions. These eye drops will be compared to timolol 0.5 percent eye drop solution in&#xD;
      participants with open angle glaucoma (the most common type of glaucoma) or high eye pressure&#xD;
      (ocular hypertension).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 240 participants (60 in each treatment arm) who will be treated for 84&#xD;
      days (12 weeks). Participants will have OAG (open angle glaucoma) or OHT (ocular&#xD;
      hypertension) in both eyes (OAG in one eye and OHT in the follow eye is acceptable) that&#xD;
      requires therapy and elevated IOP (intraocular pressure) adequately controlled on no more&#xD;
      than 2 ocular hypertensive medications. Participants with OHT on no ocular hypotensive&#xD;
      medications are acceptable. After being informed about the study and potential risks,&#xD;
      participants giving written informed consent will undergo an washout period, if required,&#xD;
      from previous glaucoma medications (28 days for prostaglandin analogs, rho-associated protein&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors, or beta blockers; 14 days for adrenergic agonists; and 5 days for&#xD;
      muscarinic agonists or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). Eligible participants must have&#xD;
      unmedicated IOP measurements at Visit 3/Baseline ≥ 22 and ≤ 34 mm Hg at 8:00 AM and ≥ 18 and&#xD;
      ≤ 34 mm Hg at 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (each qualifying eye must fall within the required IOP&#xD;
      range at all 3 time points and must be at least 22 mm Hg at each consecutive measurement at&#xD;
      the 8:00 AM time point). Both eyes will be treated twice daily. Study visits will comprise&#xD;
      Visit 1/Screening/Day -35 to -1, Visit 2/Washout Safety Check/Day -14 ± 3 (performed for&#xD;
      participants undergoing 28-day washout periods at the Investigator's discretion), Visit&#xD;
      3/Qualification/Baseline/Day 1, Visit 4/Day 15 ± 3, Visit 5/Day 42 ± 3, and Visit 6/Day 84 ±&#xD;
      3. At Visits 4, 5, and 6, participants will be evaluated at 8:00 AM, at 2 hours after study&#xD;
      medication dosing at the clinical site (approximately 10:00 AM), and at 4:00 PM (each ± 30&#xD;
      minutes). All ophthalmic assessments will be performed bilaterally.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study is observer masked. The study medication will be provided in foil pouches contained in identical-appearing boxes. An unmasked staff member not involved in performing study endpoint-related procedures (i.e., IOP measurement) will be responsible for providing dosing instructions, dispensing study medication, and conducting study medication accountability and dosing compliance assessment. The identity of the study medications will be masked to the Investigator and study personnel responsible for study endpoint-related procedures. IOP measurements will be performed by the Investigator/designee who will be masked to the readout of the tonometer, which will be read and entered into the source documentation (whether electronic or paper) by a second staff member once the Investigator/designee reaches the correct applanation effect in the slit lamp.</masking_description>

    <measure>Intraocular Pressure Over 84 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured utilizing a calibrated Goldmann tonometer; two consecutive IOP measurements of each eye will be performed. If the 2 measurements differ by more than 2 mm Hg, a third measurement will be taken. The primary efficacy analysis will be the between-group comparison of the mean IOP values in the study eye at 10AM, 2 hours postdose, and 4PM, at each of the Visit 4/Day 15, Visit 5/Day 42, and Visit 6/Day 84 visits (ie, a total of 9 between-group comparisons). A hierarchical analysis will be conducted to compare each of the investigational products against the comparator, timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution, as follows: (1) nebivolol 1% ophthalmic suspension, (2) nebivolol 0.5% ophthalmic suspension, and (3) timolol ophthalmic suspension.</description>
