      Vaccine hesitancy is defined by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization&#xD;
      as a 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination&#xD;
      services'. This varies in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what&#xD;
      vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently available.&#xD;
      As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is known about&#xD;
      people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African countries. ACHES&#xD;
      (African COVID -19Vaccine Hesitancy) is an observational study aimed at measuring COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine hesitancy in five west African countries and exploring causes behind the hesitancy&#xD;
      with the main objective of informing guidelines for the proficient roll-out of the vaccines&#xD;
      in the region.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a Public Health Emergency of International&#xD;
      Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Although African countries seem&#xD;
      to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far, with fewer than one confirmed case for&#xD;
      every thousand people and around 50,000 death, the African continent has now officially over&#xD;
      two million- COVID-19- case threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization defined vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
      as a 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination&#xD;
      services', which can vary in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what&#xD;
      vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in&#xD;
      development. As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is&#xD;
      known about people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African&#xD;
      countries. A recent study published in Nature provides results on the acceptability of&#xD;
      vaccines in 19 of the 35 hardest hit countries worldwide. South Africa was the only African&#xD;
      country included in the survey. An additional survey conducted in 15 African countries&#xD;
      between August and December 2020, reveals that the majority of Africans would take a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine. Nevertheless, vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines evolves&#xD;
      over-time. In this view, it is crucial to investigate in depth barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      influencing vaccine hesitancy/acceptability within African population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade several initiatives have emerged that aim at improving vaccine&#xD;
      coverage and acceptability across the African continent. A noteworthy example is the&#xD;
      Francophone African Civil Society Organizations' Platform for Strengthening Health Systems&#xD;
      and Immunization, which has been since 2015 supported by GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines&#xD;
      and Immunisation). OAFRESS encourages activities among francophone African members, with the&#xD;
      primary objective of reinforcing capacities and coordinating strategies among these&#xD;
      countries. The last West African Ebola epidemic demonstrated the importance of engaging&#xD;
      communities in order to promote vaccine acceptability. The three most hit countries, Guinea,&#xD;
      Sierra Leone, and Liberia, worked together and invested in research and campaigns to identify&#xD;
      and address barriers and facilitators of vaccine acceptance, which informed both clinical&#xD;
      vaccine studies and roll-out strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to promote the equitable and prompt roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, as&#xD;
      the COVAX initiative strives for, factors influencing vaccine hesitancy in low and&#xD;
      middle-income countries need to be investigated more thoroughly. The request for a first&#xD;
      roll-out of the vaccines in eligible countries was to be submitted by December 7, 2020. Many&#xD;
      of the eligible African countries have placed the order to receive the vaccines, which are&#xD;
      already being deployed within these first months of 2021. Country and population preparedness&#xD;
      are crucial to making the roll-out a success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Study Objectives 2.1 Overall objective To investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among&#xD;
      five African countries to inform effective context-specific public health strategies for&#xD;
      roll-out of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Primary objectives • To describe and compare levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among&#xD;
      the general population and health care workers in rural and urban settings across African&#xD;
      countries&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To explore factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among the general population&#xD;
      and health care workers in urban and rural Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methodology 3.1 Study design A cross-sectional survey will be conducted in five African&#xD;
      countries. A core study will be implemented in five countries, other countries will enter the&#xD;
      study as budget will become available. Study participants will be selected among the general&#xD;
      population aged older than 18 and health care workers. Sample sizes have been calculated&#xD;
      separately for these two groups.&#xD;

        The general population will be selected in the capital and a rural area (around the&#xD;
        capital) from each country. Approximately 5 clusters per area will be considered. The&#xD;
        interviews will be house hold based.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Health workers will be interviewed in facilities located in the study area and selected by&#xD;
        the local study coordinator. Only people who have direct contact with patients will be&#xD;
        considered for the analysis. To select study participants, staff lists including social&#xD;
        workers from each facility will be used to randomly select people to be interviewed.&#xD;
