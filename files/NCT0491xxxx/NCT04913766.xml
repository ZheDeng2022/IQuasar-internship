  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve mental health of minority and other vulnerable populations&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2. The study will evaluate the impact of mental&#xD;
      health services on SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies such as prevention behaviors, receiving&#xD;
      vaccinations, and safe healthcare utilization. Successful completion of this study will&#xD;
      contribute to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan employing implementation&#xD;
      science to maximize the public health impact of research for effectiveness and reach of&#xD;
      mental health services, especially for minority groups and other underserved populations in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 has had major mental health impacts across the United States. The economic,&#xD;
      livelihood, social and other effects brought on by the pandemic have affected most of the&#xD;
      national population, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. New York City has had one of the&#xD;
      highest SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates, and it has disproportionately affected National Institute&#xD;
      of Health-designated United States health disparity populations (e.g., Black, Hispanic). In&#xD;
      humanitarian crisis such as this, there is a need for delivery of psychological interventions&#xD;
      by non-specialists when specialists are unable to meet the increased service demand. In the&#xD;
      United States, training staff at community-based organizations to deliver psychological&#xD;
      support has been highlighted as a way to increase availability of mental health services and&#xD;
      increase access to mental health care, particularly for underserved populations. This study&#xD;
      employs a mental health task-sharing model by partnering with community based organizations&#xD;
      in New York City to train community based organizations staff without professional mental&#xD;
      health training to deliver mental health services. This study examine the impact of community&#xD;
      based organizations staff delivering mental health services to (a) reduce the negative mental&#xD;
      health consequences of the pandemic, and (b) improve public health behaviors to reduce the&#xD;
      spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study is a cluster randomized control trial in New York City&#xD;
      comparing Services as Usual arm and delivery of mental health services with Problem&#xD;
      Management Plus (Intervention arm) among participating community based organizations within&#xD;
      the Thrive New York City consortium. The target condition will be depression. In Aim 1, this&#xD;
      study will evaluate mental health outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable populations served by&#xD;
      community based organizations integrating Problem Management Plus into their other activities&#xD;
      compared to community based organizations delivering services as usual. In Aim 2, this study&#xD;
      will evaluate the difference between the Intervention and services as usual arms on&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 risk prevention adherence among populations served by the community based&#xD;
      organizations. In Aim 3, this study will evaluate implementation science outcomes to inform&#xD;
      policy recommendations for of community-based delivery of psychological interventions and&#xD;
      inclusion of mental health within the infectious disease response measures. Successful&#xD;
      completion of these aims will contribute to the 2020 National Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      Strategic Plan. Specifically, a) employing implementation science to maximize the public&#xD;
      health impact of research for improving effectiveness and reach of mental health services,&#xD;
      especially for minority groups and other underserved populations, b) strengthening&#xD;
      research-practice partnerships to expedite adoption, sustained implementation, and continuous&#xD;
      improvement of evidence-based mental health services, and c) developing innovative service&#xD;
      delivery models to dramatically improve outcomes of mental health services received in&#xD;
      diverse communities and populations.&#xD;
