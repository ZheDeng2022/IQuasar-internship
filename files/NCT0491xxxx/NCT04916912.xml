      This study is planned to assess the effect of obesity (BMI over 30 kg / m2) on hospital&#xD;
      outcomes of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with chronic ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to retrospectively enroll around 500 patients who underwent coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting for chronic ischemic heart disease at the Tomsk Research Institute of&#xD;
      Cardiology. It is planned to develop a register of isolated coronary bypass grafting&#xD;
      procedures, to conduct a comparative analysis of hospital results in obese patients (BMI more&#xD;
      than 30 kg / m2) and without (BMI less than 30 kg / m2), to identify risk factors for adverse&#xD;
      outcomes in patients of this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical status of the patient: collection of complaints, medical history, physical&#xD;
           examination, assessment of anthropometric indicators (measurement of body weight,&#xD;
           height, BMI), and demographic indicators before and in the control period after surgical&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General clinical examination: standard 12-lead ECG, general urine analysis, general&#xD;
           blood analysis, blood chemistry, coagulation, chest x-ray, ultrasound of the carotid and&#xD;
           femoral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coronarography to assess the anatomy and condition of the coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Echocardiography to assess the following parameters: mass of viable left ventricular&#xD;
           myocardium; volumes of cardiac cavities; diameter of the mitral and tricuspid valve&#xD;
           rings with the determination of regurgitation degree; the long axis of the ventricle;&#xD;
           left ventricular ejection fraction; visualization of akinetic and hypokinetic&#xD;
           myocardium; the presence of blood clots in the cavities of the heart; All surgical&#xD;
           procedures will be performed via median sternotomy Intraoperative information will be&#xD;
           collected from the anesthetic record, surgical notes and perfusion records.&#xD;
           Intraoperative data collection will include total operative time, CPB time, cross-clamp&#xD;
           time, intraoperative red blood cell transfusion (units), highest dose/agent used for&#xD;
           intraoperative inotrope or vasopressor support. Intraoperative flowmetry of coronary&#xD;
           grafts during coronary artery bypass grafting using the Medistim VeriQ System will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative data will include valuation of following indicators: mortality (hospital&#xD;
      mortality and death from any cause); neurological injury (TIA, stroke, delirium), acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (creatinine level prior and 1 postoperative day, urine output-up to 24-48 h,&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy (dialysis); time of mechanical ventilation; re-exploration for&#xD;
      bleeding, tamponade or other reasons; postoperative transfusion (packed red blood cells,&#xD;
      platelets, fresh frozen platelets, cryoprecipitate); postoperative myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (electrocardiogram and troponins); inotropic support during 24-48 h (agent and dose (VIS));&#xD;
      length of stay (intensive care unit and total hospital days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured collection of patient data will be performed in a database formed on the platform&#xD;
      of the Microsoft Excel 2010 software (Microsoft Corp., USA). Statistical processing of the&#xD;
      results will be carried out using the SPSS 23.0 for Windows software package (IBM Corp.,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of the law of distribution of quantitative indicators will be&#xD;
      checked using the Shapiro-Wilks criterion. Normally distributed parameters will be presented&#xD;
      as mean value (M) and standard deviation (StD) in the form M Â± StD; not normally distributed&#xD;
      parameters will be presented as median (Me) and the 1st and 3rd interquantile intervals (Q25&#xD;
      - Q75) in the form of Me [Q25; Q75]. Qualitative data will be described by the frequency of&#xD;
      occurrence or its percentage. To find statistical dependences, to determine their strength&#xD;
      and direction, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) (for normally distributed parameters)&#xD;
      and Spearman correlation coefficient (for for not normally distributed parameters and for&#xD;
      qualitative indicators in the ordinal scale) will be calculated. Using logistic regression,&#xD;
      significant predictors will be identified for the values of reverse remodeling in the long&#xD;
      term after surgical treatment. When conducting a multivariate analysis of interconnections,&#xD;
      first, by means of a univariate analysis, the main parameters that influence the studied&#xD;
      value will be identified, then, based on the search for intergroup correlations, the signs&#xD;
      that have a moderate or strong relationship will be eliminated, and multivariate modeling of&#xD;
      the relationships will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the work, the methods of statistical analysis can be revised and (or) supplemented.&#xD;
