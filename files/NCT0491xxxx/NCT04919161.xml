  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strokes are neurological events that can lead to devastating physical and cognitive deficits,&#xD;
      such as the inability to ambulate, impaired balance regulation, and loss of coordination. Due&#xD;
      to the physical and cognitive deficits experienced following a stroke, many require admission&#xD;
      to an inpatient rehabilitation facility to maximize their independence before returning to&#xD;
      the home setting. The ability to walk, stand, climb stairs, and other mobility-related&#xD;
      functional tasks, are critical components of achieving this functional independence. However,&#xD;
      it is often difficult for post-stroke patients with balance impairments to safely practice&#xD;
      balance and gait training without putting both therapists and patients at risk for injury.&#xD;
      Incorporating robotic technologies to neurological rehabilitation can play a critical role in&#xD;
      delivering safe and effective gait and balance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body-weight support systems (BWSSs) unload paretic lower limbs, patients with gait&#xD;
      impairments can practice a higher repetition of steps in a safe, controlled manner. As&#xD;
      participants perform gait training, these systems support the participant's body-weight,&#xD;
      permitting those with excessive weakness and poor coordination, to ambulate and perform more&#xD;
      intensive therapy sessions sooner in their recovery, with minimal risk injurious fall. In&#xD;
      addition to BWSSs, balance perturbation systems, which purposefully unbalance participants so&#xD;
      to rehabilitate their postural control, have been used to improve gait and balance-control&#xD;
      after stroke, or other age and disease related balance impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a recently developed, not yet&#xD;
      reported, balance perturbation module for the ZeroG BWSS. This new balance perturbation&#xD;
      training module is directly integrated into the ZeroG BWSS and allows for the direct&#xD;
      induction of safe lateral, anterior, and/or posterior perturbations via a Wi-Fi-enabled&#xD;
      handheld device. During both stationary and ambulatory activities, this system was used&#xD;
      unbalance participants in order to train their balance-control and balance-reactions. The&#xD;
      purpose of this pilot study was to determine if this newly developed BWSS balance&#xD;
      perturbation system more effectively rehabilitates participant gait and balance after stroke&#xD;
      than the standard BWSS protocol without perturbations.&#xD;

      Body-Weight Support System Equipment and Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the BWSS used was the FDA listed ZeroG Gait and Balance System (Aretech, LLC,&#xD;
      Ashburn, VA). ZeroG was first introduced to the investigators institution in September 2019.&#xD;
      Unlike some BWSSs, this device is mounted on an overhead track that follows users during&#xD;
      ambulation. Like other BWSSs, this system is designed to unload the users of up-to 200 pounds&#xD;
      of their body weight while simultaneously protecting patients from falling. For this study,&#xD;
      10 pounds of participants' body-weight, the system minimum required to engage the BWSS, was&#xD;
      continuously displaced. If a participant were to fall, the system would detect the change,&#xD;
      decelerate, and stop the descent after a set distance; the fall distance was set between 8 to&#xD;
      12 inches for the purpose of this study. Unlike other BWSSs, a newly developed balance&#xD;
      perturbation module known as the Training Responses in Postural rehabilitation or TRiP, is&#xD;
      directly integrated to the ZeroG BWSS. This perturbation module is different than other&#xD;
      systems as the balance perturbations are elicited directly through the BWSS and do not&#xD;
      require a treadmill, tilt-table/shaking platform, or manual exertion by a. Further, they can&#xD;
      be induced during normal gait and balance exercises during therapy. The BWSS control group&#xD;
      interventions consisted of various balance activities, including: marching, side-stepping,&#xD;
      retro-ambulation, step-taps, and step-ups. The BWSS control group also practiced various gait&#xD;
      tasks, including: ambulation over the ground, going up and down stairs, and performing&#xD;
      sit-to-stand transitions. The BWSS with perturbation (BWSS-P) intervention group performed&#xD;
      the same activities as the control group, with the addition of lateral, anterior, and&#xD;
      posterior perturbations. Assistive devices and equipment were used during intervention&#xD;
      sessions as recommended by the participant's primary therapist, including: canes, rolling&#xD;
      walkers, hemi-walkers, and ankle-foot-orthoses (AFO), ankle support braces, and upper&#xD;
      extremity slings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators administered perturbations using a Wi-Fi-enabled handheld device linked to the&#xD;
      BWSS and these consisted of a sudden and brief assistive or resistive force in the desired&#xD;
      direction. Lateral perturbations were issued while participants were in a static stance,&#xD;
      while anterior and posterior perturbations were issued during ambulation; eight&#xD;
      perturbations, two in each direction, were completed each session. All participants started&#xD;
      at perturbation level &quot;one&quot; and progressed up to a maximum perturbation level of &quot;ten&quot;&#xD;
      through the course of the study. The amount of force exerted at each perturbation level is&#xD;
      pre-set by the manufacturer. The perturbation level (i.e. intensity or force) used each&#xD;
      session was based on the participant's progress and observational analysis made by the&#xD;
      investigator of the participants' response to the perturbation level. If the participant was&#xD;
      able to tolerate the initial perturbation level without exhibiting a balance reaction, the&#xD;
      perturbation level was incrementally increased until an appropriate balance reaction was&#xD;
      exhibited. If a participant was unable to recover and elicited a fall response in the system,&#xD;
      the perturbation level was decreased by one level to ensure patient safety, and the exercise&#xD;
      repeated to reinforce the exercise mechanics and participant confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both study groups received a total of eight treatment sessions over two&#xD;
      weeks. As necessary, participants received up to two sessions in one day to ensure they&#xD;
      completed the required eight sessions before discharge. These sessions were incorporated into&#xD;
      the participants' regular care. Treatment sessions were broken into 30 minute blocks as it&#xD;
      standard at the host facility. This time includes participant transportation, equipment&#xD;
      set-up, and in the case of this study, donning the BWSS harness. On average, participants&#xD;
      received 20 minutes of active time in the BWSS for each 30 minute treatment block. All&#xD;
      sessions were analyzed equally despite the length of time in the BWSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When outcome measurements are missing due to early participant withdrawal, if the participant&#xD;
      completed 50% or less of the study sessions, that participant's data was removed. If the&#xD;
      participant completed greater than 50%, then that participant's data was analyzed as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To&#xD;
      compare the observed proportion of males and females in the BWSS groups, a Binomial Test and&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test were used. The 95% confidence intervals reported the proportion of males&#xD;
      and females in the BWSS-P group were calculated using the Wilson-Brown Method. Berg Balance&#xD;
      Scale (BBS) and Activities specific Balance Confidence measurement changes between the pre-&#xD;
      and post-intervention were compared directly, as well as between groups. The degree of change&#xD;
      made by each individual was shown by calculating the percent change: [((Post assessment) -&#xD;
      (Pre assessment)) / (Pre assessment)] Ã—100% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BBS data of stroke rehabilitation patients from fiscal year 2018 served as a historical&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) baseline control. The SOC data was sorted to consist of patients with&#xD;
      initial BBS scores of 21 or greater and who were admitted and discharged before the launch of&#xD;
      the institution's BWSS in September 2018. This resulted in the inclusion of retrospective BBS&#xD;
      data from 30 patients. Shapiro-Wilk testing was first used to test for normality; if one or&#xD;
      more of the data-sets in the group failed (p&lt;0.05), nonparametric tests were used going&#xD;
      forward. For hypothesis testing between two groups, unpaired or paired two-tailed Student's&#xD;
      t-test were conducted as appropriate. When indicated by an F-test for variance (p&lt;0.05),&#xD;
      Welch's correction was applied for unequal standard deviations between groups. When comparing&#xD;
      three or more groups, if one or more groups were abnormally distributed, non-parametric&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variation (ANOVA) test and Dunn's multiple comparison test for&#xD;
      statistical hypothesis testing were used. When normally distributed, an Ordinary one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA with a Tukey's multiple comparisons test for statistical hypothesis testing was used.&#xD;
      If Brown-Forsythe's test for variance indicated the variance of the groups were significantly&#xD;
      different (p&lt;0.05), a Brown-Forsythe correction was applied and Dunnett's T3 multiple&#xD;
      comparisons test for statistical hypothesis testing was used instead.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred over 12 months, from October 2019 through September 2020. Participants were recruited from patients admitted to the inpatient stroke rehabilitation program at Gaylord Hospital after receiving a stroke diagnosis at a regional acute care hospital.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>To be initially considered, patients had to be classified as a Moderate fall risk or better, shown by a Berg Balance Scale score of 21 or greater during their initial physical therapy evaluation. Patients who did not initially meet this criteria could screen-in at a later time pending a BBS reassessment. If the reassessment showed a sufficient functional improvement, and the patient had a discharge date of greater than two-weeks after the reassessment, the patient was recruited for the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>In this arm, participants will undergo their normal physical therapy treatment while using the ZeroG body weight support system.&#xD;
Body weight support system (BWSS) control group: The BWSS control group interventions consisted of various balance activities, including: marching, side-stepping, retro-ambulation, step-taps, and step-ups. The BWSS control group also practiced various gait tasks, including: ambulation over the ground, going up and down stairs, and performing sit-to-stand transitions.</description>

          <description>Similar to the control group arm, participants will undergo their normal physical therapy treatment while using the ZeroG body weight support system, with the inclusion of 8 total balance perturbations each session, including 2 in the posterior, anterior, left lateral, and right lateral directions.&#xD;
Body weight support system with balance perturbations: The BWSS with balance perturbations group conducted the same balance and gait activities as the control group, including: marching, side-stepping, retro-ambulation, step-taps, step-ups, ambulation over the ground, going up and down stairs, and performing sit-to-stand transitions.In addition, this arm will receive eight balance perturbations, two in each direction (lateral, anterior, and posterior) each session. BWSS-P participants will start at perturbation level &quot;one&quot; and progress up to level &quot;ten&quot; as appropriate. Each session, the perturbation level will be set based on the participant's progress.</description>

        <title>Difference in Berg Balance Scale Pre-intervention and Post-intervention Assessment Scores</title>
        <description>The Berg Balance Scale is a standardized objective measure of a subject/participant's balance. It is scored on a scale of 0 to 56, with 56 being the best score possible. Admission and discharge Berg scores are collected from a chart review within 48 hours of participant discharge. The change in Berg score is calculated by subtracting the participants admission or pre-assessment score from their discharge or post-assessment score: (Post assessment)-(Pre assessment)</description>
        <time_frame>The pre-assessment Berg Balance Scale score was collected during the initial physical therapy assessment within 48 hours of admission, as part of their normal care. The post-assessment was collected within 24 hours prior to discharge.</time_frame>
        <population>The data from the 15 subjects from the BWSS control group and the 14 subjects from the BWSS-P who completed the study and were not withdrawn early, were included in this analysis.</population>

These scores were collected during a chart review conducted within 48 hours after participant discharge.</description>
          <population>The data from the 15 subjects from the BWSS control group and the 14 subjects from the BWSS-P who completed the study and were not withdrawn early, were included in this analysis.</population>

        <description>All participants started at perturbation level &quot;one&quot; and progressed up to a maximum perturbation level of &quot;ten&quot; through the course of the study; the higher the level,the more intense the exerted force. The amount of force exerted at each perturbation level is pre-set by the manufacturer.The highest perturbation level achieved by the participant achieved was recorded immediately after each intervention session. In total, 8 readings were collected for each BWSS-P participant for the 8 intervention sessions completed for the study.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was partly conducted during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (03/2020-08/2020). As such, this environment may have shortened the time participants were willing to spend in an inpatient setting. As a consequence, 40% of participants, at least once, needed to receive two sessions in the same day to complete all eight sessions due to expedited discharge timelines; in one case, a participant discharged before completing the last treatment session.</limitations_and_caveats>
