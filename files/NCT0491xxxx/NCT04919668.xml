  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of gamification on the diet&#xD;
      quality of food choices made by American adults in an online grocery shopping experiment.&#xD;
      Participants will shop for 12 food items from a grocery shopping list determined by the&#xD;
      research team in a simulated online grocery store designed for this experiment. Each product&#xD;
      has a nutritional quality score based on the Guiding Stars algorithm. The experiment tests&#xD;
      the gamification of the nutritional quality score. Participants exposed to gamification see&#xD;
      one to five crowns illustrating the nutritional quality of the food and a scoreboard&#xD;
      indicating the total number of crowns from foods in the participant's shopping basket.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to experimental conditions of gamification (game or no game)&#xD;
      and a fictitious budget ($30 or $50). The investigators will test if the game and the budget&#xD;
      affect the dietary quality of their final shopping baskets. The experiment is a 2x2&#xD;
      experimental design. The investigators hypothesize that the presence of gamification will&#xD;
      change the dietary quality of participants' final shopping baskets. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a higher budget will change the dietary quality of the final shopping&#xD;
      basket. The investigators also hypothesize that the game and higher budget together will&#xD;
      change the dietary quality of the final shopping basket.&#xD;

      Participants will be assigned to one of four experimental conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Game=No and Budget = $30&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Game=No and Budget = $50&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Game=Yes and Budget = $30&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Game=Yes and Budget = $50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Game: Indicates exposure to the game (dummy variable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Budget: Indicates exposure low ($30) or high ($50) budget constraint (dummy variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total number of crowns: sum of the number of crowns associated with the 12 items&#xD;
           included in participants' final shopping baskets (a continuous variable that ranges from&#xD;
           12 to 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of crowns: number of crowns associated with each of the 12 items included in&#xD;
           participants' final shopping baskets separately (a continuous variable that ranges from&#xD;
           1 to 5).&#xD;
