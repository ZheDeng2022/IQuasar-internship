      The purpose of this study is to assess the cognitive benefits of combined physical activity&#xD;
      and cognitive training on cognitive health compare to physical activity or cognitive training&#xD;
      programs singly administrated among type 2 diabetes. Two group in cross over will take part&#xD;
      in either physical activity only (for the first one) or cognitive training only (for the&#xD;
      second one) for one month then the other way around during the second month. A fallow up will&#xD;
      be administrated 3 months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing Type 2 diabetes prevalence is associated with health, economic and social&#xD;
      consequences. As such, type 2 diabetes is recognized as major health issue. Health care&#xD;
      should go on after being discharged from the hospital in order to promote cognitive autonomy.&#xD;
      Physical activity and cognitive training are two interventions often recommended individually&#xD;
      to benefit cognition among type 2 diabetes patients. Yet, a program combining physical&#xD;
      activity and cognitive training might be more effective to favor cognitive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, diabetes patient between 50 and 75 years old will be allocated randomly in 3&#xD;
      intervention groups in order to have a homogeneous distribution of the education level, sex&#xD;
      and age across the 3 samples. The first group will take part in a physical activity program&#xD;
      the first month and in a cognitive training one the second. The second group will be&#xD;
      cross-over meaning taking part in a cognitive training program the first month and engaging&#xD;
      in the physical activity one the second month. The last group will engage in a program based&#xD;
      on resonance frequency breathing the first month (as a control condition), then in a combined&#xD;
      physical activity and cognitive training program. Between the 2 interventions, there will be&#xD;
      a 15 days break (limiting the transfer of the effect of one intervention onto another). At&#xD;
      the beginning of the study, a screening will allow to identify possible exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (health factors that could influence the main outcomes). At the beginning (baseline) of the&#xD;
      first intervention and after each month, neuropsychological tests assessing cognitive and&#xD;
      psychological health as well as well-being. Physiological parameters such as heart rate&#xD;
      variability, cortisol and DHEA levels, muscle and lean mass, blood circulation (assessed by&#xD;
      Laser speckle contrast imaging). A whole session (psychological and physiological testing)&#xD;
      should take 1 h 30. Besides, participants will complete online questionnaires. They have one&#xD;
      week after the testing to complete those surveys. If they are late an email will be sent&#xD;
      before a phone call in the case the delay goes on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the increase of the cognitive variables after the intervention. It is&#xD;
      expected that the physical activity and cognitive training combined program will benefit&#xD;
      cognitive functioning more than either of those programs administrated individually. To&#xD;
      investigate to long-term effects of the intervention, a fallow up 3 months later will be&#xD;
      conduct&#xD;
