      Patients included in the study went through standard preoperative preparation and were&#xD;
      informed about potential conversion to open surgery. The procedure started with LUS performed&#xD;
      according to the department's standard guidelines (one twelve mm trocar in the midline and&#xD;
      one 12 mm trocar in the left upper quadrant) followed by a stepwise scanning of relevant&#xD;
      structures (e.g. liver, pancreas, retroperitoneum) with dedicated laparoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      equipment (BK Medical, Herlev, Denmark). If the suspected lesion(s) was detected by LUS in&#xD;
      the relevant area (according to preoperative imaging), laparoscopic resection was attempted,&#xD;
      and if successful the specimen was removed in an eEndo-bBag (Kebomed, Denmark) through one of&#xD;
      the trocars. A second LUS was performed to ensure that no tumor was left behind&#xD;
      (&quot;loss-of-lesion(s)&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any problem occurred during the laparoscopic procedure, the operation was converted to an&#xD;
      open procedure. Prophylactic antibiotics were not given routinely but were administered&#xD;
      during surgery at the surgeons' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra- and postoperative course and final clinical outcome including pathology reports&#xD;
      were retrieved from the patient's electronical records. This included a postoperative follow&#xD;
      up of at least 12 months to investigate potential incomplete resection. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications were graded according to Dindo-Clavien (17). The pathology reports were&#xD;
      retrieved from the Danish Pathology Registry.&#xD;

        The patients were discussed at the Upper or Lower GI Multidisciplinary Team conferences MDT&#xD;
        in order to make sure that only patients where explorative laparotomy was considered the&#xD;
        next and only possible clinical step, were referred for the minimal invasive procedure.&#xD;
