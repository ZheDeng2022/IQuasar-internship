  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral KPT-9274 for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KPT-9274 is a first-in-class orally bioavailable, non-competitive, small molecule, dual&#xD;
      modulator of p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide&#xD;
      phosphoribosyltransferase /PBEF/visfatin (NAMPT). NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the&#xD;
      metabolic scavenging pathway that utilizes nicotinamide to replenish nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD), an essential metabolic cofactor and second messenger. Recent&#xD;
      investigations have shown that in in vitro and in vivo models, NAMPT is uniquely essential&#xD;
      for relapsed or refractory AML stem cells. Targeting relapsed AML stem cells, through&#xD;
      targeting of NAMPT, may allow for a promising therapeutic opportunity for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>During dose escalation, patients will receive oral KPT-9274 three times a week every other day (Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26) during each 28-day cycle, and the first dose cohort will be 30 mg. Subsequent dose escalation cohorts, as well as a de-escalation cohort, will be administered. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 patient experiences a DLT in Cycle 1. A RP2D equal to or less than the MTD will be declared and used for the Dose Expansion Phase, if conducted.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
          5. Patients with known active central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
