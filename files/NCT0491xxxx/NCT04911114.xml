  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the feasibility (suitability), efficacy (research-setting outcomes),&#xD;
      and participant satisfaction of a virtually-supervised 12-week exercise and diet intervention&#xD;
      for women with ovarian cancer. It will include exercise, behavior change strategies, and&#xD;
      guidance around healthy eating. Participants will be instructed and supervised virtually in&#xD;
      two exercise sessions weekly for 12 weeks by a professional trained to deliver the program.&#xD;
      An additional 1 exercise session per week, completed independently, will be added from weeks&#xD;
      4-12 of the program. Finally participants will participate in two separate virtual group&#xD;
      nutrition sessions. Assessments will occur at baseline, end-of-intervention, and 6 months&#xD;
      post-baseline.&#xD;

      Purpose: To assess the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and patient perspectives of a&#xD;
      12-week supervised, virtually-delivered exercise and healthy eating program for women living&#xD;
      with and beyond ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the program will be feasible and will&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy, and that patient perspectives will be overall positive and in support&#xD;
      of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Women living with and beyond ovarian cancer exercise at levels below the&#xD;
      general population, and are at an increased risk for falls. Exercise and healthy eating&#xD;
      programming is not a part of routine care. This project has the potential to demonstrate a&#xD;
      feasible and relatively low-cost option for offering such programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: the objectives of this program are: 1) Primary Objective: To measure the&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering the BE-BALANCED program from a virtual (i.e. live video) setting.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be evaluated per individual item based on a priori targets; 2) Secondary&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the BE-BALANCED program; 3) Tertiary&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate patient satisfaction (post-intervention only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This study is a prospective single-arm feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The primary aim is feasibility. This will be evaluated using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, focusing on the program recruitment, attendance, attrition, and&#xD;
      fidelity. For secondary and tertiary/exploratory aims, a repeated measures ANOVA will be&#xD;
      performed for each measure to evaluate the change in outcomes from baseline and end of&#xD;
      intervention (12-weeks) and 3-month follow-up. In addition to the RM-ANOVA, an effect size&#xD;
      for each measure will be calculated based on the same time-frame comparisons. SPSS will be&#xD;
      used to process data.&#xD;
