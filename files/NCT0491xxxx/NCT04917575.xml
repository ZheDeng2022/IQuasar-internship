  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to assess the acceptability, usability and efficacy of using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art video game technology to increase HIV testing among adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults (AYA) ages 13-24. AYA often lack awareness of their personal risk of contracting HIV&#xD;
      and where to go for testing and care. This lack of awareness has contributed to poor uptake&#xD;
      of HIV testing among AYA despite engagement in high risk behaviors. The goal of this project&#xD;
      is to harness this strong motivation to play games to increase HIV testing. Previous games&#xD;
      for behavior change have yielded early success for increasing target behaviors among their&#xD;
      sample populations, yet research on increasing HIV testing among AYA through gaming has been&#xD;
      limited. This intervention builds on prior formative work and is designed to offer AYA&#xD;
      personally-tailored risk messages and supports their accessibility to HIV testing and&#xD;
      prevention services through an innovative gaming approach that is sharable over social media&#xD;
      with in-game rewards for sharing the game with peers. The specific aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of a life-simulation game in changing HIV testing, knowledge, and risk&#xD;
      behaviors among AYA at risk for HIV.&#xD;
