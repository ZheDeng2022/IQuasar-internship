  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, multicenter, study conducted in 12 hospitals in the Nord and Pas-De-Calais&#xD;
      departments. The aim of this study is to describe the relationship between reported exposure&#xD;
      to molds and asthma control in a pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient followed by a specialized asthma pediatrician in one of the study center will be&#xD;
      proposed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 1 to &lt; 18 years, with asthma diagnosis, based on the assessment of a&#xD;
      specialized physician after a follow-up of at least 6 months Inclusion, non-inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be verified by the investigators. The questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed during the consultation, collected by the physician in charge of the consultation&#xD;
      and sent to the principal investigator for data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will take place over a period of 12 consecutive months from the date of obtaining&#xD;
      regulatory approval.&#xD;
