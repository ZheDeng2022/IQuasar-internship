    <textblock>
      This phase randomized phase 2 clinical trial to study the safety and effect of C3 complement&#xD;
      inhibitor APL-2 (Pegcetacoplan) alone and in combination with Pembrolizumab, as well as APL-2&#xD;
      in combination with both Bevacizumab and Pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer with symptomatic malignant effusion (ascites or&#xD;
      pleural effusion). APL-2 (Pegcetacoplan) is the lead drug in the class of compstatins, which&#xD;
      are synthetic peptides that bind to C3 and inhibit the classical and alternative pathway C3&#xD;
      convertase formation required for complement activation. The rationale for using APL-2 in&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer with recurrent malignant&#xD;
      effusion is two-fold: (1) to decrease the immune system suppressing neutrophil cell&#xD;
      accumulation in tumor tissue thereby making immune check point blockade more effective; and&#xD;
      (2) to prevent generation of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) that increase vessel&#xD;
      permeability and lead to malignant fluid accumulation. The current standard for palliation of&#xD;
      ascites and/or pleural effusions in recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer involves the use of bevacizumab alone or combined with a chemotherapy drug as well as&#xD;
      repeated drainage of the fluid.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety of APL-2 (Pegcetacoplan) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      and APL-2 in combination with both bevacizumab and pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian cancer with symptomatic malignant effusion II. Effect of therapy on of malignant&#xD;
      effusion measured by total volume of effusion drained every 3 weeks (patient diary and/or&#xD;
      drained volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control&#xD;
      rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS) II. Changes in quality of life measures during the&#xD;
      clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, Phase 2 clinical trial of APL-2 in combination with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab or in combination with Bevacizumab and Pembrolizumab vs. Bevacizumab alone in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer and persistent&#xD;
      malignant effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety-lead in cohort of 3-5 patients, (patients will receive APL-2 alone for 2 weeks prior&#xD;
      to adding pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab and bevacizumab) will be recruited to assess the&#xD;
      safety of APL-2 alone, determine PK/PD levels is serum and malignant effusion and to test the&#xD;
      short-term single-agent APL-2 effects on malignant effusion. If no concerning treatment&#xD;
      limiting toxicity signal is seen, the randomized expansion cohorts (2B) are allowed to start.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 cohorts (2 experimental arms and 1 standard of care&#xD;
      control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2B-1: APL-2 (Pegcetacoplan) and pembrolizumab (experimental arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2B-2: Pegcetacoplan, pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (experimental arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2B-3: Bevacizumab only (control arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks and treatment will continue until disease progression,&#xD;
      patient withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients&#xD;
      are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks thereafter up to 3 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Accumulation of effusion (Phase 2b)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine the effect of therapy on accumulation of effusion measured by total volume removed every 3 weeks. The change in accumulation of effusion (relative to pre-treatment) will be modeled as a function of cohort, time-point, their two-way interaction, baseline levels, and a random subject effect using a linear mixed model. The change will be compared: a) over-time within each cohort, and b) between the control cohort (cohort C) and each dosing cohort (cohorts A and B) using two-sided Bonferroni or Dunnet adjusted tests about the appropriate contrasts of model estimates. The model assumptions will be evaluated graphically, and transformations will be applied as appropriate.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QOL) scores</measure>
