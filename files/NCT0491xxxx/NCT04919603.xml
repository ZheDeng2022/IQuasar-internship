  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled clinical trial, which is designed&#xD;
      to enroll people with different glucose metabolism status who are also overweight or obese,&#xD;
      including people with normal glucose metabolism, pre-diabetes patients and newly diagnosed&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes patients. The patients are randomized to an enhanced physical activity&#xD;
      intervention (high-intensity interval training exercise prescription combined with resistance&#xD;
      training) or standard education group (diabetes health education only, including lifestyle&#xD;
      education and guidance) for 12 weeks. This trial intends to compare the influence of enhanced&#xD;
      physical activity treatment with that of a standard education on liver steatosis, serum&#xD;
      glucose and lipids level, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular metabolic parameters, metabolic&#xD;
      molecules, and gut microbiota profile et al.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit 270 patients from 2 hospitals within the China Diabetes Clinical&#xD;
      Research Network. Eligible criteria include men and women aged 18-65 years; with normal&#xD;
      glucose metabolism or pre-diabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes; no insulin treatment;&#xD;
      BMI ≥23 kg/m2 and &lt;40 kg/m2. Main exclusion criteria include severe cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension, and other serious illness. The proposed trial has 90% statistical&#xD;
      power to detect an absolute 3.0% reduction of liver triglyceride level changes between&#xD;
      intensive physical activity intervention and standard education groups at a 2-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05. To achieve the proposed study objectives, we plan to perform the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit 270 study participants who meet the eligibility criteria, including 90 people&#xD;
           with normal glucose metabolism, 90 pre-diabetes patients and 90 newly diagnosed type 2&#xD;
           diabetes patients, and randomly assign 135 to the enhanced physical activity&#xD;
           intervention group and 135 to the standard education group for 12 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employ a study-wide strategy to encourage standard of care for all participants for the&#xD;
           treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain clinical data on study outcomes for up to 12 months of follow-up among all trial&#xD;
           participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform strict quality control procedures for intervention and data collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Conduct data analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Disseminate the study findings to influence clinical practice and clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed to examine the pan-omics changes after the interventions and&#xD;
      clarify their predictive benefits on the effects of the interventions.&#xD;

Responses range from &quot;0&quot; (Not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).The total sum of the responses suggests varying levels of depression. Scores range from 0 to 27. In general, a total of 10 or above is suggestive of the presence of depression.</description>
