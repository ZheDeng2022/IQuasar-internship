  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-assignment, pilot study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, initial clinical effectiveness, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of SCB-420 as compared with Eylea (aflibercept), in subjects with&#xD;
      Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 subjects with Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration will be enrolled&#xD;
      across up to 11 sites in 3 countries (Australia, New Zealand, and China). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 parts - Sentinel Safety Cohort and Open Enrolment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered with 2 mg of SCB-420 or Eylea via intravitreal (IVT) injection every 4 weeks for&#xD;
      a total 3 doses.&#xD;
