  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to identify the potentially crucial role of anticipatory&#xD;
      reward mechanisms maintaining bulimic behavior (i.e., binge eating and purging) in bulimia&#xD;
      nervosa (BN). The research will investigate neural and psychological anticipatory processes&#xD;
      in BN, both in the scanner and the natural environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia nervosa (BN), an eating disorder characterized by recurrent bulimic episodes of binge&#xD;
      eating and often persists in spite of treatment, likely indicating ineffectively targeted&#xD;
      maintenance mechanisms. Treatment outcome data suggest that &lt; 30-45% of adults who receive&#xD;
      treatment for BN exhibit prolonged remission. Further, BN is often characterized by a&#xD;
      worsening course in which symptom severity increases with duration of illness. Intervention&#xD;
      advances require identification of both the mechanisms that underlie reward derived from&#xD;
      bulimic behavior and the mechanisms that maintain these behaviors over time. Current&#xD;
      treatments for BN focus on immediate antecedents and consequences of bulimic behavior,&#xD;
      despite the possibility that the reward derived from these behaviors may occur well before&#xD;
      this point during the anticipation of binge eating and purging. A majority (&gt;75%) of&#xD;
      individuals with BN report &quot;planning&quot; some or most of their bulimic episodes. Thus,&#xD;
      determining the role of reward anticipation in BN will facilitate the application of novel&#xD;
      interventions that more precisely target these neglected mechanisms. Further, research&#xD;
      indicates that reward mechanisms become increasingly focused on anticipation in later phases&#xD;
      of reward learning. Therefore, it is important to determine how reward anticipation processes&#xD;
      contribute to the maintenance of bulimic behaviors and interact with illness duration to&#xD;
      facilitate BN chronicity. The purpose of this investigation is to identify the potentially&#xD;
      crucial role of anticipatory reward mechanisms maintaining bulimic behavior (i.e., binge&#xD;
      eating and purging) in bulimia nervosa (BN). The research will investigate neural and&#xD;
      psychological anticipatory processes in BN, both in the scanner and the natural environment.&#xD;

    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) self-reported negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report measure comprising two scales, one of which we will use to assess participants' negative affect. The scale includes ten Likert-style items, which participants rate from 1 = not at all to 5 = very much. Composite scores range from 10-50, and a score of 50 indicates greater negative affect. The PANAS will be administered to measure emotion at multiple times during the second visit as well as during EMA administration and to establish a baseline at the first visit.</description>
