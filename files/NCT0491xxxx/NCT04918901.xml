      Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) is the pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus&#xD;
      infection. Critically ill patients with this disease develop dyspnea and hypoxemia, and even&#xD;
      further aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulation dysfunction,&#xD;
      and multiple organ failure. Since February 15, 2020, the 171-member medical team of the&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine has taken over the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of the Cancer Center of the Union Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical&#xD;
      College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and the Intensive Care Unit of the&#xD;
      West Hospital of Union Hospital to carry out severe and critical care. Treatment of patients&#xD;
      with new coronary pneumonia. In clinical practice, combined with the changes in chest CT&#xD;
      imaging of severe COVID-19 patients, it has been found that some laboratory indicators of&#xD;
      severe patients can effectively judge the clinical prognosis and outcome of patients, but&#xD;
      there is no relevant retrospective study with large sample size so far.&#xD;

      Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) is the pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus&#xD;
      infection. Critically ill patients with this disease develop dyspnea and hypoxemia, and even&#xD;
      further aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulation dysfunction,&#xD;
      and multiple organ failure. Since February 15, 2020, the 171-member medical team of the&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine has taken over the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of the Cancer Center of the Union Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical&#xD;
      College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and the Intensive Care Unit of the&#xD;
      West Hospital of Union Hospital to carry out severe and critical care. Treatment of patients&#xD;
      with new coronary pneumonia. In clinical practice, combined with the changes in chest CT&#xD;
      imaging of severe COVID-19 patients, it has been found that some laboratory indicators of&#xD;
      severe patients can effectively judge the clinical prognosis and outcome of patients, but&#xD;
      there is no relevant retrospective study with large sample size so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In April 16, 2020, the investigators submitted the research project, comparative analysis of&#xD;
      clinical parameters and radiographic changes of severe COVID-19, to human subject research&#xD;
      ethics committee of Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The&#xD;
      research process began after the committee for approval in May 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, by comparing the changes in chest CT imaging of patients with severe COVID-19,&#xD;
      the investigators analyzed the effects of some clinical indicators on the prognosis and&#xD;
      outcome of patients.&#xD;

    <measure>The progressive rise of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a clinical warning indicator for the deterioration of COVID-19.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly monitoring of interleukin-6 in severe COVID-19 patients. The level of IL-6 increase is consistent with the severity of the disease. Once the disease is under control, it will drop rapidly; if it does not decrease rapidly after treatment, it often indicates a poor prognosis. The notification of the diagnosis and treatment plan for severe and critical cases of new coronavirus pneumonia (the second version on trial) has clearly identified the progressive rise of IL-6 as a clinical warning indicator for the deterioration of the disease.</description>

    <measure>Chest computer tomography (CT) can reflect the progress of the disease, and may have a certain prompting effect on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly monitoring of chest CT imaging of patients with severe COVID-19. COVID-19 is highly contagious, chest CT manifestations are diverse, with multiple ground glass shadows in both lungs with or without partial solidification as the main feature, mainly subpleural distribution, as the course of the disease progresses, CT manifestations gradually increase with the time of onset. At the same time, CT semi-quantitative scores can reflect the progress of the disease, and may have a certain prompting effect on the prognosis of patients.</description>
