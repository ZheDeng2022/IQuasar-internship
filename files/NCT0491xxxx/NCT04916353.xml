      The aim of this study is to investigate the echoguide hypertonic injection and compared&#xD;
      steroid injection in subacromial bursitis patients about clinical and ultrasound image&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial bursitis is one of the major causes of chronic refractory shoulder pain. It can&#xD;
      cause patients with shoulder pain when shoulder exercise and heavy lifting and limiting the&#xD;
      range of motion. It can also influence the sleep quality due to pain symptoms of the&#xD;
      shoulder. Usually, these patients had limited response to medication and physical modality.&#xD;
      Steroid injection was often adopted for intervention, but the adverse effects should be&#xD;
      considered. Therefore, prolotherapy was taken as an alternative treatment for chronic&#xD;
      subacromial bursitis. It involves the injection of small volumes of an irritant agent, most&#xD;
      commonly a hyperosmolar dextrose solution, at the lesion site. Hyperosmolar dextrose appears&#xD;
      to be the most commonly used agent today. The aim of this study is to investigate hypertonic&#xD;
      injections in subacromial bursitis patients about clinical and ultrasound image presentation.&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial for 60 participants&#xD;
      with chronic shoulder pain for 3 months with subacromial bursitis. In the study group, the&#xD;
      echo guide 20% dextrose water was injected into the lesion site, and the control group&#xD;
      received the echo guide steroid injection. ROM, SPADI, VAS, x-ray, and ultrasound data were&#xD;
      obtained at baseline. At weeks 2, 6, 12, ROM, SPADI, VAS, and ultrasound data were evaluated.&#xD;
      The ANOVA and independent t-test are applied for analysis by SPSS 20.0 with a P value less&#xD;
      than 0.05 as statistical significance.&#xD;

    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), a self-administered assessment tool that was used to measure pain and disability related to shoulder disease. The SPADI consists of 5 pain and 8 disability items that are measured on a visual analog scale. Pain and disability subscales were calculated as the mean of the corresponding items on a 0-100 scale; the highest score indicated the most severe pain and disability. The total outcome score used for statistical analysis was calculated as the sum of the pain and disability subscales.</description>

    <time_frame>Week0 Week2 Week6 Week12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-free passive range of motion (PROM) of the shoulder was designated as the range of motion attained at the most painful position and was measured using a digital goniometer in 6 directions flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation and internal rotation. Five directions of the shoulder joint were measured (flexion, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation) while participants were lying in a supine position. Additionally, shoulder extension was measured in the side-lying position.</description>

    <measure>Pain (VAS, Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week0 Week2 Week6 Week12</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder pain was assessed according to an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). This tool was simple to use and was highly correlated with the visual analog scale, verbal rating scale, and Faces Pain Scale-Revised. The NRS is considered a valid and reliable pain assessment tool. The pain intensity was graded from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most intense level of pain). The participants reported their pain level at rest and during the movement of shoulder joint in all direction. The most painful movement score was used for further data analysis.</description>
