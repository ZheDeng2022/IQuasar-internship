  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study expands on the principles of SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy)&#xD;
      and SABR (Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy) for centrally located NSCLC (Non-Small Cell&#xD;
      Lung Cancer) to further optimize outcomes in this patient population with utilization of the&#xD;
      adaptive workflow to maintain tumor control rates but decrease the incidence and grade of&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the first occurrence of local and/or regional disease progression, distant metastases, second primary tumor, or death due to any cause. PFS time is measured from the date of start of SBRT to the date of the failure event for PFS.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) time is measured from the date of start of SBRT to the date of death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) quality of life instrument has been extensively used for measuring quality of life in patients with lung cancer. There are 5 sections dealing with physical, family, emotional, functional well-being, and additional concerns. There are nine questions that are specific to lung cancer (LSC), including shortness of breath, cough, etc. The TOI (Trial Outcome Index) is the sum of the scores on the LCS and the physical well-being and functional well-being subscales of the FACT-L scale.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The five-item index score from EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate utility scores that will lie between 0 (Worst health state) and 1 (Best health state).</description>
