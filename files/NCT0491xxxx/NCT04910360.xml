  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 outbreak has caused death of millions of people because of not only the severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection itself but also infection dependent&#xD;
      complications. Abnormalities in thrombotic events leads to some of these complications which&#xD;
      eventually result in emboli. The endothelial damage caused by the virus interacting with ACE2&#xD;
      on the host cells leads to the activation of coagulation cascade. Accumulation of byproducts&#xD;
      of the cascade might have some roles in embolism inducing risk of organ damage, other&#xD;
      life-threatening problems, and even death. To enlighten the factors triggering embolism, the&#xD;
      investigators have focused on genetic changes such as polymorphisms and mutations in certain&#xD;
      genes in DNA samples coming from intensive care unit (ICU) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has conducted to find the possible links between genetic make up of ICU patients&#xD;
      with severe Covid-19 and embolism. 13 polymorphisms and mutations that the investigators&#xD;
      targeted are located on Factor II, Factor V, Factor XIII, MTHFR, angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme (ACE), endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), and FGB. The investigators have&#xD;
      found significant changes in the mutant allele frequencies in most of the factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main workflow to study a point change on DNA sequence begins with DNA isolation from a&#xD;
      biological material. In this case, we received blood samples in ethylenediaminetetraacetic&#xD;
      acid (EDTA) tubes from ICU patients with severe Covid-19. The investigators hypothesis claims&#xD;
      that genetic factors triggering thrombotic events might increase the severity of the diseases&#xD;
      by inducing the risk of emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After DNA isolation, desired loci on DNA were amplified via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).&#xD;
      Amplicons including the mutations and polymorphisms need to be purified before next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators analyze the data using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) program and check&#xD;
      the genetic profile (wt, het, mut). Some of the changes are meaningful by themselves while&#xD;
      some other need to be considered as combinations. Compound heterozygosity and diagnosis for&#xD;
      thrombophilia require cooccurrence of the changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare allelic frequencies, the investigators include the average of the data coming from&#xD;
      more than 2000 individuals with no know thrombophilia cases. In the investigators focus&#xD;
      cohort, the investigators have the data of 47 Covid-19 patients in ICU.&#xD;

        Case group involves ICU patients with emboli that suffer from severe COVID-19. The&#xD;
