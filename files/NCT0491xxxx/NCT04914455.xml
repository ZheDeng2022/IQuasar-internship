  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid expansion in critically ill patients following high risk surgery may induice fluid&#xD;
      overload and worse outcome. Several tools have been developped to predict fluid reponsiveness&#xD;
      in such situation in order to avoid inappropriate fluid administration but with several&#xD;
      limitations. Inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility is one of those tools which has the&#xD;
      advantage to be non-invasive, dynamic and safe, is usually measured by subcostal&#xD;
      (SC)approach. In post surgical setting this acess is limited du to practical reasons (scar,&#xD;
      dressing...), therefore a transhepatic (TH) approach is used but has not been validated as a&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness prediction tool. The correlation between SC approach with the TH&#xD;
      approach vary according to studies. Therefore the performances, the threshold indentified for&#xD;
      SC approach can not be translated to the TH approach. Further, fluid congestion status&#xD;
      measured before IVC analyses, may be a usefull confounder and safety endpoint for fluid&#xD;
      reponsiveness interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectif of this study is therefore to study the performance of the IVC measured&#xD;
      using TH approach (IVCth) in predicting of fluid responsiveness defined as an increased of&#xD;
      10% and over of stroke volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives intend to analyse the correlation between TH and SC approaches, to&#xD;
      compared their performances for fluid responsiveness prediction, and to analyse the weight of&#xD;
      venous congestion on fluid responsiveness prediction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inappropriate volume expansion in the critically ill patient may leads to an increase in&#xD;
      fluid balance, fluid overload and worse outcome. This increase in fluid balance is associated&#xD;
      with a poor prognosis in the ICU patients, especially after cardiac surgery and high risk&#xD;
      surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the primary objective of an adequate volume expansion is a significant increase in&#xD;
      stroke volume called fluid responsiveness (&gt; 10% of increase). This increase in cardiac&#xD;
      output promotes tissue perfusion, thus avoiding the occurrence of organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of fluid responsiveness in these patients is thus a cardinal element of&#xD;
      haemodynamic management in intensive care. Among the non-invasive tools to assess this fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness, the assessment of the ventilatory or forced inspiration distensibility of the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava (IVC) has been proposed with convincing results in several clinical&#xD;
      studies. However with various diagnostic performances and threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the diameter of the IVC is classically performed via the subcostal (SC) or&#xD;
      subxiphoid approach. However, this approach is not always easily accessible in intensive care&#xD;
      patients, particularly after cardiovascular surgery or laparotomy, due to practical&#xD;
      constraints (algic scars, dressings, prone position). The transhepatic approach (TH) is a&#xD;
      technically feasible approach in such cases. However, it has little validation in the&#xD;
      literature, particularly in its ability to predict response to volume expansion. knowing that&#xD;
      the correlation between the SC approach with the TH approach varies according to studies, the&#xD;
      performance and the threshold indentified for SC approach can not be translated into that of&#xD;
      the TH approach. Further, fluid congestion status measured before IVC analyses, may be a&#xD;
      usefull confounder and safety endpoint for fluid reponsiveness interpretation.&#xD;
