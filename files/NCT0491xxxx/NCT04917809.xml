  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether erdafitinib is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      FGFR3-altered non-muscle invasive bladder cancer/NMIBC between the time that a recurrent&#xD;
      tumor is identified and a TURBT (transurethral resection of a bladder tumor) or biopsy&#xD;
      procedure is performed to remove it.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is the objective response rate at the time of TURBT/biopsy (defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial pathologic response by cytologic examination, cystoscopic examination, and biopsy) following treatment with erdafitinib. A complete response is defined as the absence of tumor on TURBT/biopsy, with a negative urinary cytologic result; a partial response is defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the size of the target tumor(s), on the basis of modified RECIST 1.1 criteria (RECIT-BLADDER).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive erdafitinib at a dose of 6 mg orally once daily for the first 14 days (±3 days). Serum phosphate levels will be assessed on day 14 (±3 days). No up-titration will be done regardless of serum phosphate level. If there are no significant toxicity, participants will continue on a dose of 6 mg orally once daily until the day of standard-of-care TURBT/biopsy. Participants with a serum phosphate level between 7.0 and 9.0 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L to 2.9 mmol/L) will continue on 6 mg once daily while concurrently initiating treatment with a phosphate binder until the day of their standard-of-care TURBT/biopsy. Standard-of-care TURBT/biopsy will be performed after approximately 28 days (±5 days) of treatment with erdafitinib, and biologic and pathologic tumor response will be assessed. All participants will then be followed up for recurrence or progression in accordance with the standard of care.</description>
