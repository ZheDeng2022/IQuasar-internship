      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of various forms of exercise&#xD;
      training on blood vessel function in healthy individuals as well as individuals with mental&#xD;
      health disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or generalized anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (GAD)).&#xD;

      Study #3 is made up of five sessions done on five separate days and the entire study can be&#xD;
      completed in as little as 14 weeks. All testing sessions will take place at the Exercise&#xD;
      Physiology Research Laboratory. Volunteers will be asked to participate in one initial&#xD;
      testing session (Visit 1) lasting &lt; 1 hour that will help make them more familiar with the&#xD;
      study equipment and procedures, determine body measures (height, weight, body fat), determine&#xD;
      the maximum strength of their forearm and calf, and require one blood draw. The following two&#xD;
      testing sessions (Visits 2 and 3) with each session lasting between 2-3 hours that will&#xD;
      involve multiple tests designed to determine the health of their blood vessels. For Visit #2&#xD;
      they will be randomly given either antioxidant pills or placebo pills to determine the effect&#xD;
      of oxidants on blood vessel health. For Visit #3, they will be given whatever set of pills&#xD;
      (antioxidant or placebo) that they did not receive during Visit #2. also include two&#xD;
      additional testing days (Visits 5 and 6) that are identical to Visits #2 and #3, two visits&#xD;
      to test endurance or strength prior to and after the exercise training (Visit 4 and 7), and&#xD;
      ten weeks of exercise training (done 3-5 days per week). The exercise training will include&#xD;
      one of two weight lifting programs that differ based on the amount of weight lifted (heavy vs&#xD;
      moderate weight).&#xD;
