      Objective: This study's primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation with high vs. low tidal volume (Vt) in people with acute spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI). Secondary objectives include a comparison of inflammatory markers between these&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized comparative effectiveness trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study population: Adults with acute traumatic SCI on mechanical ventilation (MV).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either a lower Vt of 8-10 cc/kg predicted body weight&#xD;
      (pbw) or a high Vt of 14-16 ml/kg pbw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and potential Benefits: Risks of study interventions are similar to usual care as&#xD;
      proposed tidal volume settings are within the current usual care range. However, people&#xD;
      assigned to the lower tidal volume group may have a lower risk of pneumonia and respiratory&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Respiratory complications associated with mechanical ventilation (MV) are the&#xD;
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality following acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Emerging&#xD;
      evidence suggests pneumonia is also associated with reduced neurologic recovery. Therefore,&#xD;
      pneumonia prevention is of primary importance to improve outcomes. In the non-SCI population,&#xD;
      MV with lower tidal volume (Vt) has been shown to reduce inflammation and rates of pneumonia.&#xD;
      High Vt MV results in disruption of pulmonary endothelium and release of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, which play a role in the development of pulmonary complications. In contrast,&#xD;
      guidelines for SCI practitioners recommend MV with higher Vt without strong evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized control trial comparing MV with high vs. low Vt. Secondary objectives include a&#xD;
      comparison of clinical outcomes and inflammatory mediators between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study population: Adults with acute traumatic SCI admitted to an acute inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation facility on MV. Subjects will be randomized to receive either a lower Vt of&#xD;
      8-10 cc/kg predicted body weight (pbw) or a high Vt of 14-16 ml/kg pbw. Study participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to high tidal volume (14-16 ml/kg pbw) or low tidal volume of 8 to&#xD;
      10 ml/kg pbw within 48 hrs of admission, stratified based on vital capacity at admission to&#xD;
      ensure equal allocation of those with most severe respiratory impairment and unlikely to wean&#xD;
      from the vent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of knowledge gained from the study: Investigators believe the completion of this&#xD;
      study will add to the fund of knowledge of respiratory management of people with SCI,&#xD;
      especially at the early stages of the injury, including reducing respiratory complications in&#xD;
      people with SCI who are at very high risk of severe respiratory complications which is the&#xD;
      main cause of morbidity and mortality in this population.&#xD;
