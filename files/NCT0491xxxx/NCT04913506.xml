  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate whether or not NMES in front of the mirror brings an&#xD;
      additional benefit to mirror therapy alone or NMES alone on upper extremity motor and&#xD;
      functional development, spasticity, anxiety, depression, cognitive function and activities of&#xD;
      daily living, and neuropathic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular diseases are the general name given to clinical neurological pictures that&#xD;
      occur as a result of pathological changes in the blood vessels of the primary lesion and / or&#xD;
      in the properties of the blood passing through them. Many complications develop in the acute&#xD;
      and chronic periods in patients with stroke, and the rate of complication development has&#xD;
      been reported to vary between 40-96% in different studies. The aim of hemiplegic upper&#xD;
      extremity rehabilitation is to prevent complications and improve lost motor-sensory control.&#xD;
      Upper limb rehabilitation is less successful than lower limb rehabilitation because the upper&#xD;
      limb is more functional and more complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For muscle reeducation, NMES is used to strengthen inhibited muscle groups, facilitate&#xD;
      voluntary isolated muscle contraction, prevent muscle atrophy, increase metabolism and enzyme&#xD;
      activity, change the contractile properties of the muscle, maintain or increase the normal&#xD;
      range of motion of the joint, develop voluntary movement and functional gains. NMES has been&#xD;
      used in hemiplegia rehabilitation since 1960 for the purpose of functional retraining of&#xD;
      muscles. The purpose of this treatment is to enable the muscles with impaired neural function&#xD;
      of the electrical current to perform a functional and useful movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications in front of the mirror are thought to trigger the neuronal connections in the&#xD;
      motor cortex associated with the imagined movement. Findings obtained from studies with&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance support this theory. Compared to conventional PR, applications&#xD;
      in front of the mirror are thought to have more and longer-lasting effects.&#xD;
