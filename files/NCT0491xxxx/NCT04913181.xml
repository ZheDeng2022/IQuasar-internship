    <textblock>
      The development of sepsis prediction model in line with Chinese population, and extended to&#xD;
      clinical, assist clinicians for early identification, early intervention, has a good&#xD;
      application prospect. This study is a prospective observational study, mainly to evaluate the&#xD;
      accuracy of the previously established sepsis prediction model. The occurrence of sepsis was&#xD;
      determined by doctors' daily clinical judgment, and the results of the sepsis prediction&#xD;
      model were matched and corrected to improve the clinical accuracy and applicability of the&#xD;
      sepsis prediction model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sepsis prediction model adopted in this study has been completed in the preliminary&#xD;
      preparation, which was constructed on 7,000 patients since the establishment of comprehensive&#xD;
      ICU, and the sepsis 3.0 diagnostic standard was adopted.The sepsis prediction model was built&#xD;
      using Python platform and XGBoost algorithm, which was used to predict the incidence of&#xD;
      sepsis in ICU patients within 24 hours. The overall accuracy was 82%, and the area under the&#xD;
      Auroc curve was 0.854.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were given a daily prediction of sepsis&#xD;
      model, and a quantitative checklist was formed based on the test results.There are two kinds&#xD;
      of forecast outcomes: low risk and high risk.Quantitative checklists are available to&#xD;
      attending physicians to improve diagnostic efficiency.The results were kept confidential to&#xD;
      the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were diagnosed with sepsis by two senior attending physicians at a fixed time.&#xD;
      The diagnosis consisted of two types: yes and no.If two attending physicians have different&#xD;
      opinions, the third attending physician will be included for correction diagnosis, and the&#xD;
      presence of sepsis will be determined in a 2:1 manner.The attending physicians are&#xD;
      independent of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the diagnosis results of the attending physician are input into the system, the&#xD;
      prediction results of yesterday's sepsis prediction model are compared and calculated to&#xD;
      determine the accuracy of the prediction model&#xD;

        Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were predicted daily by sepsis model,&#xD;
        and a quantitative list was formed according to the test results. There are two kinds of&#xD;
        prediction results: low risk and high risk. The quantitative list is open to attending&#xD;
        physicians to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The predicted results are kept secret&#xD;
        from clinicians.&#xD;
