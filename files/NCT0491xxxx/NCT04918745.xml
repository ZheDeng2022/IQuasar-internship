  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the VertiGO! trial 8 participants with bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) and severe sensory&#xD;
      neural hearing loss in the ear to be implanted will receive a combined cochlear (CI) and&#xD;
      vestibular implant (VI), capable of stimulating both the cochlear and vestibular nerves&#xD;
      (CVI). The participants will make use of this combined stimulation during 3 weeks of&#xD;
      prolonged use under supervision in a hospital environment. This trial will serve as a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept for restoring vestibular function in patients with BV, an as-of-yet&#xD;
      untreatable disorder causing severe impairment and discomfort. The aims of this trial are to&#xD;
      investigate efficacy and safety of prolonged vestibular stimulation, to identify the&#xD;
      influence of different stimulation algorithms, to assess the feasibility of the combined&#xD;
      VI/CI device, to develop a VI rehabilitation program and to further build on the fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge of vestibular organ stimulation while also taking into account the patient&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vestibular sensory organ is essential for balance and image stabilization. Patients with&#xD;
      severe function loss of both vestibular organs present themselves with serious day-to-day&#xD;
      disabilities such as strong balance disturbances, higher risk of falling, visual symptoms&#xD;
      (oscillopsia) and a loss of autonomy. Up until now no effective treatment is available for&#xD;
      these patients to restore vestibular function. In the past years experimental electric&#xD;
      stimulation of the vestibular nerve in humans by means of a VI has shown to be able to partly&#xD;
      restore balance and gaze functionality in test situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate combined prolonged stimulation of both the vestibular organ and the cochlea,&#xD;
      participants will be implanted with a CVI. This modified CI also consists of 3 vestibular&#xD;
      electrodes, each placed in individual electrode leads for insertion into the three&#xD;
      semicircular canals. Therefore the CVI is capable of stimulating both the cochlear and&#xD;
      vestibular nerves. Hearing rehabilitation with the CI part of the device will follow the&#xD;
      standard clinical protocol, with the participant using a standard CI processor. Functionality&#xD;
      of prolonged combined vestibular and cochlear stimulation will be assessed using a research&#xD;
      processor during 3 weeks (3x4 days, +- 8 hours a day) of prolonged stimulation under&#xD;
      supervision in the safety of a hospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each identical period of 4 days a different stimulation algorithm will be used for&#xD;
      vestibular stimulation, with the order being randomized and single-blinded. The stimulation&#xD;
      algorithms which will be used are constant un-modulated stimulation, modulated stimulation&#xD;
      based on angular head movement and modulated stimulation based on linear head movement.&#xD;
      Alongside the 3 weeks of prolonged stimulation, the participant will make yearly visits to&#xD;
      our clinic up to 5 years after implantation for evaluation of long-term response to acute&#xD;
      vestibular stimulation and general CI performance.&#xD;
