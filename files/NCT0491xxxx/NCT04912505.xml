  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of immune thrombocytopenia increases with older age. This population is at risk&#xD;
      for arterial thrombosis. Due to an increased turn-over of platelets, low-dose aspirin once&#xD;
      daily may be insufficient in this population to protect against arterial thrombosis. This&#xD;
      study is aimed at assessing the pharmacodynamics of aspirin once daily on platelet function&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of immune thrombocytopenia increases with older age. About 20% of patients who&#xD;
      develop immune thrombocytopenia are exposed to low-dose aspirin for arterial thrombosis&#xD;
      prophylaxis. Moreover, immune thrombocytopenia patients have an increased risk for developing&#xD;
      arterial thrombosis as compared with matched controls from the general population. Because&#xD;
      ITP patients have an increased turn-over of platelets and aspirin is an irreversible&#xD;
      inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1, aspirin taken once daily may be insufficient to provide stable&#xD;
      inhibition of platelet function. This has been demonstrated in myeloproliferative neoplasms&#xD;
      with a higher platelet turn-over as well; aspirin is given twice daily to these patients. In&#xD;
      immune thrombocytopenia, epidemiological findings sustain this assumption because aspirin is&#xD;
      not associated to an increased risk of bleeding. The primary aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the residual platelet function after 75 mg aspirin intake (H24). Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the kinetics of platelet function after daily 75 mg aspirin intake and the relation&#xD;
      with arterial thrombosis.&#xD;
