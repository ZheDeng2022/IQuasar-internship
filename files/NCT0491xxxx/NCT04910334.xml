  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study of 6 and 12 months long-term outcome&#xD;
      of Danish speaking patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To describe frailty, cognitive function, functional status, fatigue, mortality and the&#xD;
      quality of life 6 and 12 months after ICU admission of the COVID-19 patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      Danish ICU COVID-19 database. Furthermore to investigate the association between ventilator&#xD;
      days and Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and the MiniMoCA, respectively at 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      ICU admission&#xD;

    <measure>The cognitive status at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission using the validated instrument MiniMoCA</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive status at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission using the validated instrument MiniMoCA. Score 0-15, score above 11 indicate normal cognitive function. Two time points to see if there is a change in the cognitive status over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The functional status at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission using the validated instrument CFS</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The functional status at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission using the validated instrument CFS (score 1-9) higher levels indicate more frailty. Two time points to see if there is a change in the frailty status over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L score 6 and 12 months after ICU admission. Score 5-25. low score indicate better quality of life. Two time points to see if there is a change.</description>

    <measure>Barthel ADL score 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel ADL score 6 and 12 months after ICU admission. Score 0-20, high score indicate high independence. Two time points to see if there is a change.</description>

    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>Lawton-Brody IADL score 6 and 12 months after ICU admission. score from 0-8 for female and 0-5 for male. High score indicate high independence. Two time points to see if there is a change.</description>

    <time_frame>at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>FAS score 6 and 12 months after ICU admission. score from 10-50, high score indicate high level of fatigue. Two time points to see if there is a change.</description>
