      The investigators propose a mixed-methods intervention design to evaluate the acceptability&#xD;
      of epidemic intelligence (EpI-Net) intervention using Community Engagement (CE) principles to&#xD;
      promote COVID-19 testing and prevention practices in socially vulnerable communities in PR.&#xD;
      The team hypothesizes that the integration of lay community leaders, trained in the use of&#xD;
      COVID-19 prevention technology tools (EpI-Net), will result in increased COVID-19 testing&#xD;
      uptake and prevention practices among the targeted socially and epidemiologically vulnerable&#xD;
      communities in Puerto Rico.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. In Puerto Rico (PR), the first COVID-19 case was confirmed&#xD;
      early March 2020. To date, cases have exponentially increased partly due to the lifting of&#xD;
      locked-down restriction by the PR government, limited COVID-19 testing, and contact tracing.&#xD;
      As a major Public Health Emergency (PHE), the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally&#xD;
      affected racial and ethnic minorities as well as patients with chronic health conditions.&#xD;
      Specifically, residents of PR are socially and epidemiologically vulnerable with one of the&#xD;
      highest prevalence rates for chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, HIV)&#xD;
      prevalence rates and arbovirus-related diseases, such as Zika and Dengue. Puerto Ricans&#xD;
      living on the island are also particularly vulnerable to the current overlapping of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters (earthquake, hurricanes/storms). Limited access to&#xD;
      molecular COVID-19 testing throughout PR has been a significant challenge. Without adequate&#xD;
      testing, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection rates are limited, and targeted&#xD;
      prevention efforts (focused testing) be inadequate. Ponce Research Institute (PRI) with the&#xD;
      support of Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) - leads the COVID-19 outreach efforts in&#xD;
      PR related to earthquake aftershocks, tropical storms, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The&#xD;
      PHSU-PRI Research Center for Minority Institutions-Community Engagement Core (RCMI-CEC)&#xD;
      leaders in collaboration with community leaders, implemented the COVID-19 prevention&#xD;
      education initiative which targets socially vulnerable populations in southern Puerto Rico&#xD;
      (the earthquake and aftershocks epicenter). Also, PHSU-PRI epidemiologists (led by Dr.&#xD;
      Marzán-Rodríguez, MPI) developed a web-based COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance System&#xD;
      (ESSS) in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Public Health Trust (PRPHT, a community partner&#xD;
      for this grant) with more than 46,000 surveys completed up to September 2020. The ESSS tool&#xD;
      is an online geocoded survey that identifies real-time COVID-19-related symptoms during the&#xD;
      last 24 hours; and thus, prioritizes communities for COVID-19 testing. The ESSS tool can be&#xD;
      easily accessed on the PRPHT website. Leveraging the current PHSU-PRI COVID-19 prevention&#xD;
      efforts and the ESSS infrastructure, the research team proposes a mixed-methods approach for&#xD;
      intervention trials for dissecting the impact of an epidemic intelligence (EpI-Net)&#xD;
      community-based intervention aimed at increasing COVID-19 testing uptake and prevention&#xD;
      practices among socially vulnerable communities in PR. Under Aim 1, the team will train lay&#xD;
      community leaders on the use and application of COVID-19 early detection epidemic&#xD;
      intelligence tools. Under Aim 2, the team will identify and understand the individual&#xD;
      (beliefs and behaviors), social, cultural, and contextual factors facilitating the adoption&#xD;
      and adherence to routine COVID-19 testing and prevention practices. Under Aim 3, the team&#xD;
      will test EpI-Net intervention preliminary impact on increasing COVID-19 testing uptake and&#xD;
      prevention practices among socially vulnerable communities in PR. The working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the integration of lay community leaders, trained in the use of COVID-19 prevention&#xD;
      technology tools (EpI-Net), will result in increased COVID-19 testing uptake and prevention&#xD;
      practices among the targeted socially and epidemiolocal vulnerable communities in Puerto&#xD;
      Rico.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Community Leaders Eligibility Criteria: After the team's identified the community,&#xD;
             with the support of the community partners and the Community Scientific Advisory&#xD;
             Committee, we will invite community leaders to be part of the EpI-Net training. The&#xD;
             inclusion criteria for the community leaders to be trained in EpI-Net activities are:&#xD;
             (1) &gt;21 years of age, (2) living in a socially vulnerable community for COVID-19&#xD;
             according to the CDC-SVI; (3) self-identified as a Latino/Hispanic and; (4) be able to&#xD;
             provide support for the EpI- Net implementation process in their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In-depth Interview Participants' Eligibility Criteria: The eligibility criteria for&#xD;
             the qualitative interviews will be: (1) &gt;21 years old, (2) living in a socially&#xD;
             vulnerable community for COVID-19 according to the CDC-SVI (Ref); (3) self-identified&#xD;

             program or PRPHT network and (5) be able to complete an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Communities' Eligibility Criteria: Based on factors associated with COVID-19&#xD;
