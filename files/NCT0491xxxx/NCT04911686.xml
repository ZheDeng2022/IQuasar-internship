    <textblock>
      Management of pediatric fixed knee flexion deformities (FKFD) has always been a challenge for&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons. They occur due to a variety of causes, including cerebral palsy,&#xD;
      arthrogryposis, spina bifida, trauma, and many others. The deleterious effects of FKFD&#xD;
      include instability of gait and balance, exhaustion of extensor mechanism, and anterior knee&#xD;
      pain, which together produce marked limitation of the activities of daily living in affected&#xD;
      children .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many options have been proposed for the correction of FKFD, with each having its pros and&#xD;
      cons. Hamstring release and posterior capsulotomy are frequently used. However, extensive&#xD;
      soft tissue release may be needed to treat severe deformities with the risk of neurovascular&#xD;
      compromise and genu recurvatum. Supracondylar extension osteotomy with patellar tendon&#xD;
      advancement requires postoperative non-weight bearing for at least three weeks and is&#xD;
      associated with risk of neurovascular damage and coronal plane deformities and it is mostly&#xD;
      used in older children and adolescent . Gradual distraction by ring fixators may be&#xD;
      complicated by pin tract problems, fractures, and recurrence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study entails the application of a simple method for correction of FKFD in younger&#xD;
      children using a simple cast distraction technique. This conservative method aims at avoiding&#xD;
      the complications of surgery in children while achieving a reasonable amount of correction.&#xD;
