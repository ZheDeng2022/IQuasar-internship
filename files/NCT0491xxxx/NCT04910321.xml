      The Hangzhou Hospital Staff Cohort (HHSC) is a prospective cohort study among staffs from&#xD;
      three hospitals located in Hangzhou, China, including the Hangzhou First People's Hospital,&#xD;
      Hangzhou Women's Hospital, and Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital. Participants recruitment and&#xD;
      baseline survey including anthropometric, lifestyle and clinical measurement, as well as&#xD;
      biological samples collection are initiated in January 2021. Recruited hospital staff are&#xD;
      followed up every year during the medical examination organized by their employer. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the HHSC study is to investigate the prospective associations of diet,&#xD;
      physical activities, sleep, and other lifestyle factors with the long-term metabolic health&#xD;
      of the hospital staffs. The secondary aim of the HHSC study is to integrate multi-omics data&#xD;
      including genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiome by a machine learning algorithm,&#xD;
      to probe into the complex mediating roles of gene, metabolism and gut microbiota linking&#xD;
      lifestyle factors with metabolic health.&#xD;
