    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of extremely hypofractionated intensity modulated&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has rising&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) after radical prostatectomy. Stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with&#xD;
      high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and&#xD;
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses&#xD;
      of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have&#xD;
      fewer side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the two-year change in patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms based&#xD;
      on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) instrument following stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) to the prostate bed and/or pelvic lymph nodes, with a comparison to&#xD;
      historical control data for more prolonged radiation regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the two-year change in patient-reported urinary (GU) symptoms based on the&#xD;
      EPIC instrument following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the prostate bed and/or&#xD;
      pelvic lymph nodes, with a comparison to historical control data for more prolonged radiation&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify patient-reported GI symptoms using the EPIC instrument at 3 months, 6 months,&#xD;
      1 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To quantify patient-reported GU symptoms using the EPIC instrument at 3 months, 6 months,&#xD;
      1 and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To quantify rates and severity of acute physician scored adverse events using the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version [v.] 5.0) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To quantify the five-year cumulative incidence of physician scored adverse events the&#xD;
      CTCAE v4.03 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To quantify five-year progression-free survival. VI. To quantify 5-year cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of biochemical recurrence. VII. To quantify 5-year distant metastasis-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare all primary and secondary endpoints between patients treated with an magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI)-guided versus a computed tomography (CT)-guided linear accelerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare primary and secondary endpoints between patients treated with short course (=&lt;&#xD;
      6 months) or long-term &gt;= 12 months) antiandrogen therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SBRT every other day or on consecutive days for up to 14 days. Patients may&#xD;
      receive hormonal therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for the first&#xD;
      year, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
