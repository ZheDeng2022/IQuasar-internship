    <textblock>
      Thromboelastography (TEG) is a laboratory technique used to examine the process of clot&#xD;
      formation and degradation by measuring and reporting the kinetic changes, the rate of clot&#xD;
      formation, clot strength, and clot stability. TEG provides numeric values and a graphical&#xD;
      representation of the primary and secondary hemostatic systems and fibrinolysis more quickly&#xD;
      and with a smaller blood sample than routine coagulation studies. TEG6s, the newest TEG&#xD;
      platform, simplifies and standardizes TEG technique and is currently available at only four&#xD;
      US children's hospitals. Normative values of TEG6s results have not been established in&#xD;
      healthy neonates. There are a number of well-established perinatal risk factors for&#xD;
      thrombosis in the newborn; however, maternal diabetes has been the most frequently identified&#xD;
      risk factor in the newborn since 1965. Despite the well-established hypercoagulable state&#xD;
      observed in infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs), there have been no studies evaluating TEG in&#xD;
      IDMs. To establish normative data and investigate the hypercoagulable state of IDMs, this&#xD;
      observational prospective cohort study will evaluate TEG6s in these two populations: a&#xD;
      control group that will include neonates ≥37 weeks gestational age born to mothers with&#xD;
      uncomplicated pregnancies and a comparison group that will include neonates ≥37 weeks born to&#xD;
      mothers with gestational diabetes or a history of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes prior to&#xD;
      pregnancy, either requiring insulin or diet controlled. We hypothesize that cord blood TEG6s&#xD;
      results will differ between healthy newborns and IDMs reflecting a hypercoagulable state in&#xD;
      IDMs with an increased coagulation index (CI) in the IDM group. A sample size calculation was&#xD;
      performed for a two-sample t-test using the POWER procedure in SAS version 9.4. Based on a&#xD;
      two-tailed alpha of 0.05 and a standard deviation of 0.9, the total N was determined to be 40&#xD;
      (i.e., 20 in each group). This yields a power of 0.84 to detect a difference of 1.25 units in&#xD;
      the mean CI between IDMs and healthy controls. To avoid blood loss and skin breaking&#xD;
      procedures in the subjects, umbilical cord blood obtained from the umbilical cord will be&#xD;
      used for analysis. To assure appropriate dilution, a hematocrit will be measured at the time&#xD;
      of blood collection using a blood gas machine for prompt results. Sample blood will&#xD;
      immediately be taken by the investigators from the delivery hospital to the children's&#xD;
      hospital, where the following clotting studies will be performed: PT, aPTT, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      platelet count, platelet mapping, and TEG6s. Statistical analyses will be performed on the&#xD;
      results of these studies and will provide normative data in healthy newborns and infants of&#xD;
      diabetic mothers. Having data on the coagulation profile of neonates will help guide&#xD;
      management techniques and help explain the propensity to clot among IDMs and guide further&#xD;
      research into prevention and treatment of this complication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thromboelastography (TEG), is a laboratory technique used to examine the process of clot&#xD;
      formation and degradation by measuring and reporting the kinetic changes, the rate of clot&#xD;
      formation, clot strength, and clot stability in umbilical cord blood samples. TEG provides&#xD;
      numeric values and a graphical representation of the primary and secondary hemostatic systems&#xD;
      and fibrinolysis. The current standard assessments of coagulation status require a&#xD;
      combination of multiple tests with multiple blood samples. These tests, including prothrombin&#xD;
      time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen level, and platelet count, only&#xD;
      partially reflect components of the coagulation system, whereas TEG reflects the complex&#xD;
      interplay between coagulation factors, cellular components, enzymes, and highly organized&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms that maintain equilibrium between clot formation and lysis. TEG has&#xD;
      advantages over routine coagulation studies because it is able to assess coagulation function&#xD;
      more quickly and with a single smaller blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies, however, have established normative TEG results in newborns. These studies&#xD;
      used older TEG systems/technology. There is a newer TEG6s platform which is currently&#xD;
      available at Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) and only 3 other children's hospitals in the&#xD;
      country. Normative values using TEG6s have not been established in healthy neonates. In fact,&#xD;
      although there are investigations in adults, there are no published studies using this newer&#xD;
      technology in newborns. The lack of normative standards for TEG6s in newborns is limiting the&#xD;
      use of this technology in research and clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEG6s simplifies and standardizes the technique for performing TEG by eliminating the need&#xD;
      for manual pipetting. This platform also enables multiple assays to be performed&#xD;
      simultaneously from a single blood sample. The TEG6s measures clot viscoelasticity throughout&#xD;
      the coagulation process by using resonance technology. Using light-emitting diode&#xD;
      illumination, an infrared detector measures vertical motion of the coagulating blood&#xD;
      meniscus. Greater clot strength causes higher resonant frequencies, which is subsequently&#xD;
      identified by the detector and converted to a graphical image. The TEG6s can deliver the same&#xD;
      quality test results without the complicated test preparation process required when using the&#xD;
      older TEG platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of well-established perinatal risk factors for thrombosis in the newborn,&#xD;
      including systemic infections, dehydration, congenital heart disease, birth asphyxia,&#xD;
      polycythemia, presence of intravascular catheters, inherited thrombophilias, and&#xD;
      transplacental passage of maternal antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies. Described&#xD;
      since at least 1965, however, maternal diabetes is the most frequently identified risk&#xD;
      factor. This risk of thrombosis in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) has been found to be&#xD;
      15.8% compared with &lt;1% in the non-IDM group. Despite the well-established hypercoagulable&#xD;
      state observed in IDMs, there have been no studies evaluating TEG in these newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are few published studies on TEG as it relates to neonates. The clotting&#xD;
      profile in neonates differs vastly from adults and even the pediatric population, explaining&#xD;
      why prior data on TEG from these populations cannot be extrapolated to this special&#xD;
      population of newborns. The significant difference is likely explained by the delicate&#xD;
      balance in the neonatal hemostatic system that is composed of lower levels of plasma&#xD;
      coagulation inhibitors, such as antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, while having&#xD;
      procoagulant factor levels, such as factor VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and factor XIII&#xD;
      levels that are comparable to the levels in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been prior studies establishing normative values for TEG in term newborns but none&#xD;
      with the new TEG6s platform. Furthermore, there have been minimal studies looking into the&#xD;
      diverse subgroups of the neonatal population on either TEG or TEG6s. With regards to my&#xD;
      proposed project, TEG is likely to identify differences among healthy newborns and IDMs,&#xD;
      which will help explain the propensity to clot and guide further research into prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of coagulation currently entails multiple tests, requires multiple blood samples,&#xD;
      and has a waiting period for laboratory results. Large volumes of repeated blood sampling in&#xD;
      this physically small-sized population can lead to iatrogenic anemia. TEG6s, however, uses a&#xD;
      single blood sample to deliver results quickly with both a graphical representation and&#xD;
      numeric value. The results provided by TEG are useful in helping to determine specific&#xD;
      deficiencies affecting a patient, for example, clotting factors, heparin, fibrinogen and&#xD;
      platelets.&#xD;
