  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VIRGIL is a monocentric interventional study aiming to investigate the effect of immersion in&#xD;
      a virtual tilted room on modulation of the verticality representation (postural vertical [PV]&#xD;
      and visual vertical [VV]), which in turn might affect body orientation (head and trunk). To&#xD;
      this end, the investigators will conduct a within-person randomized trial including&#xD;
      post-stroke patients and healthy participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project proposes to test the effect of immersion in a tilted virtual reality on&#xD;
      verticality representation in hemisphere stroke patients showing lateropulsion and in healthy&#xD;
      participants. The idea is to use the virtual reality as a tool to recalibrate the internal&#xD;
      reference of verticality (contralesionally biased) in stroke patients and to experimentally&#xD;
      create a bias in verticality perception of healthy participants, then to investigate how this&#xD;
      modulation of the internal model of verticality might affect the erect posture. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that, in stroke patients, the recalibration of the verticality&#xD;
      perception might ameliorate their lateropulsion, whereas in healthy participants, the&#xD;
      experimental verticality bias introduced might induce a transient experimental lateropulsion.&#xD;
      A transmodal modulation of the verticality perception, both on PV and VV, would imply a&#xD;
      modulation by the virtual reality not only at the level of perception but also at the&#xD;
      internal model of verticality, advocating for a powerful effect of this technology. The&#xD;
      analysis of a post-effect (on verticality perception) that would continue after the&#xD;
      intervention (immersion in the virtual titled room) would be a supplementary argument&#xD;
      advocating for its clinical use in rehabilitation of post-stroke lateropulsion. To judge the&#xD;
      effect of the immersion in tilted virtual reality, the following measures will be considered:&#xD;
      (a) PV perception, (b) VV perception, (c) body orientation measured by inertial captors, and&#xD;
      (d) weight-bearing asymmetry in erect posture assessed by posturography.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>20 stroke participants perform the experiment over 4 weeks (W0, W1, W2, W3). W0 and W1 are devoted to clinical assessments of lateropulsion, balance disorders and other clinical deficits post-stroke. W2 is devoted to the intervention over 4 consecutive half days: 2 for the verticality perception assessments (PV, VV), and 2 for concomitant assessments of lateral body orientation (by inertial captors) and weight-bearing asymmetry (by posturography). These 4 tests are performed before and during virtual reality. A post-effect is investigated only for PV and VV. Each patient is randomly assigned to one of the two following planes: plane A (PV/VV assessment on days 1 and 3 and postural assessment on days 2 and 4) or plane B (postural assessment on days 1 and 3 and PV/VV assessment on days 2 and 4).The W3 is devoted to conventional rehabilitation with only assessment of lateropulsion and balance on Friday (as each week of this protocol).&#xD;
20 controls perform the same experiment on 2 days.</intervention_model_description>
