      This is a Phase I, first-in-human trial to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of HY-0102 administered intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) once every two weeks in adult patients with locally advanced/metastatic malignant solid&#xD;
      tumors (head and neck, liver, colorectal and lung cancers, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six dosing cohorts are planned with the dose of 0.03, 0.3, 1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg. The first&#xD;
      two dose levels (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) will each enroll one patient using an accelerated&#xD;
      escalation design that will convert to a 3+3 design upon the occurrence of one&#xD;
      treatment-related Grade 2 toxicity occurring in the safety evaluation window following the&#xD;
      first dose of treatment. After the initial two cohorts are completed, the study will use a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of enrolled patients is estimated to be up to 32. The dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      evaluation period will be the first 28 days (Cycle 1) and subsequent cycles will be 4 weeks&#xD;
      in duration. Patients will receive the investigational drug on Day 1 of cycle 1 followed by&#xD;
      28 days of observation. HY-0102 will be administered IV once every two weeks for Cycle 2 and&#xD;
      beyond.&#xD;
