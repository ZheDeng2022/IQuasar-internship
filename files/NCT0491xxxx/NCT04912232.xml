  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is Phase 3 of a three-phase DOD CDMRP funded project for the development of a&#xD;
      multi-technology poly-anatomic noninvasive system for early detection of occult hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally&#xD;
      acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the&#xD;
      detection of OH are associated with a &quot;failure to rescue&quot; and a dramatic deterioration in&#xD;
      prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. An early alert to the&#xD;
      presence of OH with an acceptable rate of false-positives and false-negatives would save&#xD;
      countless lives. Additionally, such technology would save significant time, money and effort&#xD;
      by allowing medical resources to be applied more accurately - the essence of precision&#xD;
      medicine. An automated system would monitor currently stable patients continuously, leaving&#xD;
      clinicians free to care for patients in need of attention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 480 trauma patients in a &quot;no significant risk&quot; prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial to 1) evaluate the performance of a Mark I prototype, 2) validate the&#xD;
      performance of the Phase II algorithm, and 3) re-train the algorithm to Phase III iteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is not a therapeutic study. The main outcome variables are non-invasive measurements&#xD;
      that will be used for machine learning, not real-time patient management. The data generated&#xD;
      will be used later for discovery and validation in traditional and innovative machine&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a minimal risk study, there will be no change from standard of care for patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. The surgical procedures and pharmacotherapies will proceed as per&#xD;
      standard clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will undergo standard preoperative, anesthetic, and postoperative&#xD;
      physiological monitoring that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram: Heart rate and electrical activity of the heart will be recorded via a&#xD;
      3-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): Pulse oximetry will be recorded using a commercially&#xD;
      available finger pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finger Photoplethysmography: waveforms will be obtained non-invasively from either the SpO2&#xD;
      photoplethysmography or alternatively a Flashback Technologies Compensatory Reserve Index&#xD;
      (CRIâ„¢) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these standard physiologic measurements, as a part of the research, the&#xD;
      investigators will also acquire the following non-invasive optical and impedance&#xD;
      measurements. All of these devices have been previously validated as non-invasive and safe in&#xD;
      humans. The impedance electrodes and optical emitter/detectors will be incorporated into&#xD;
      easily applied latex-free based &quot;belts&quot; that will be applied to anatomic locations along the&#xD;
      thorax, abdomen and thigh. Application of these belts will be as soon as practical after&#xD;
      patient arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinicians providing care to the patient will be blind with respect to the measurements&#xD;
      from these devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous-wave Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (CW-NIRS) Device, custom built:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is built on an Ocean Optics FLAME USB Spectrometers, with two OSRAM 4736 NIR LEDs&#xD;
      in plastic holders meant to be taped or strapped to the patient on the chest/torso and thigh&#xD;
      locations. An Oceans Optics tungsten-halogen light source is used for an additional probe&#xD;
      location on the forehead. Probe holders are designed to collect light from surface of skin by&#xD;
      means of a mirror and collimator. The device will collect data on light attenuation of muscle&#xD;
      in models of shock/trauma. The light output for all locations is below the ANSI limits for&#xD;
      maximum permissible skin exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SwissTom Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) System:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of device: Pioneer Set (Electrical Impedance Tomography System) Device Manufacturer:&#xD;
      SwissTom AG (Parent company SenTec AG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device monitors dynamically changing perfusion physiology. To record multiplexed&#xD;
      impedance signature a belt of 16-32 electrodes is placed around the thorax above the nipple&#xD;
      line and thigh and impedances are recorded between multiple sets of electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SwissTom develops a clinical EIT system that is approved for pulmonary imaging. This Pioneer&#xD;
      system is their research platform that has similar functionality and safety performance to&#xD;
      their clinical system but provides research teams with access to raw data and additional&#xD;
      functionality for specifying imaging parameters (e.g. control of frame rates, signal&#xD;
      frequency acquisition, electrode drive patterns).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ScioSpec MultiChannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) System:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of device: ISX-Mini (MultiChannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy System) Device&#xD;
      Manufacturer: ScioSpec&#xD;
&#xD;
      To record multiplexed impedance signatures- an array of 4 electrodes is placed around the&#xD;
      cranium and thorax of the patient and impedance spectroscopy signatures are recorded at each&#xD;
      anatomic location. This device monitors dynamically changing intracranial, intrathoracic and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Approach to Minimize Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will be minimal risk to patients as there is little risk associated with the&#xD;
      placement of these devices and they can be removed at any time. They don't interfere with&#xD;
      standard equipment used in clinical management of trauma patients.&#xD;
