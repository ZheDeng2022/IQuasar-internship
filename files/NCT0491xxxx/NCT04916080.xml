  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common comorbidity of CKD and is associated with a decreased quality of life and&#xD;
      increased healthcare resource utilization. Anemia increases the risk of CKD progression,&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications, and overall mortality. The current standard of care includes&#xD;
      oral or intravenous iron supplementation, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusion. Treatment with high doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents increases&#xD;
      rates of hospitalization, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Resistance to&#xD;
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents is a therapeutic challenge in many patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAC reduces the risk of progression of CKD of any etiology to end stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
      but the mechanism by which it reduces the progression of CKD to ESRD is unclear. It may be&#xD;
      because of its antioxidant and vasodilatory nature. Prolonged duration of administration and&#xD;
      higher dosage of NAC can protect kidneys.&#xD;

      All patients with chronic kidney disease on regular hemodialysis will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study location: The patients will be recruited from pediatric nephrology department, Cairo&#xD;
      University Children's Hospital and Beni Suef University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History taking including the age, sex, primary cause of CKD, onset of hemodialysis,&#xD;
      medications including erythropoietin dose, frequency, and duration, oral or intravenous iron&#xD;
      therapy, and frequency of blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination focusing on pallor, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements and&#xD;
      their percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations including hemoglobin level at the start of the study and every month during&#xD;
      the study period, serum ferritin, alanine aminotransferase, total oxidative stress (TOS),&#xD;
      total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and oxidative stress index (OSI) at the start and after 3&#xD;
      months of the onset of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive N-acetyl cysteine (10 mg/kg/day, orally). The duration of the study&#xD;
      will 3 months.&#xD;
