      The purpose of this study is to develop The Scale for Evaluating Early Mother-Baby Attachment&#xD;
      Indicators and to examine its validity and reliability.This is a cross-sectional,&#xD;
      methodological, descriptive, and correlational study.The sample of the study for analysis was&#xD;
      planned to consist of 130 mothers..The content validity of the scale will assessed by&#xD;
      consulting 13 experts in pediatrics, psychiatry and women's health.After the contents of the&#xD;
      scale were verified, a pilot test will conducted with a draft scale consisting of 13&#xD;
      items.After the analyzes to be made, it will be tested whether it is a validite and reliable&#xD;
      measurement scale.&#xD;

      The behavior of the mother toward her baby in the mother-baby encounter after the birth&#xD;
      provides important clues about the bonding process between the mother and the baby in the&#xD;
      later period. Therefore, it is important for the nurse responsible for the care of the&#xD;
      newborn to carefully observe the mother's behavior to identify the emotional bond between the&#xD;
      mother and the baby.Therefore, there is a need for a measurement tool to be developed to be&#xD;
      used in the evaluation of early mother-infant attachment, which covers the postnatal period.&#xD;
      This scale can enable healthcare professionals to quickly and easily evaluate mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment behavior in the early postnatal period. Thus, it can contribute to the early&#xD;
      identification of negative attachment behavior that may develop in the future and allow&#xD;
      nurses to provide the necessary support. The purpose of this study is to develop The Scale&#xD;
      for Evaluating Early Mother-Baby Attachment Indicators and to examine its validity and&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Method Aim This study aims to develop a tool to measure Early Mother-Infant&#xD;
      Attachment Indicators and test them psychometrically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a cross-sectional, methodological, descriptive, and correlational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The development of The Scale for Evaluating Early Mother-Baby Attachment&#xD;
      Indicators, the design of the scale, and the phases in its validity are shown in Figure 1.&#xD;
      These items include: (1) the preparation and scoping phase; (2) the development of the&#xD;
      questionnaire items and rating scale; (3) the content validity; and (4) the pilot study&#xD;
      (psychometric evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample/Participants This study will carried out in the XXXX Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Maternity Service-Infant Team between june and july of 2021. Participants will selected by&#xD;
      the random sampling method. The literature states that the number of samples should be at&#xD;
      least five times the number of scale items-ideally 10 times the number of items when&#xD;
      developing a scale. The number of items in the scale is 13. Accordingly, the study for&#xD;
      analysis was planned to consist of 130 mothers. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the&#xD;
      participants had to be over 18 years old, had to have volunteered to participate in the&#xD;
      study, had to have no health problems related to the newborn, and had to be the mother or the&#xD;
      primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The Sociodemographic Form This form will completed by the mothers while&#xD;
      they were in the hospital. It consists of 26 questions about age, the number of children, the&#xD;
      maternal educational level, the income levels of the families, and satisfaction with having a&#xD;
      baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scale for Evaluating Early Mother-Baby Attachment Indicators The scale consists of 13&#xD;
      items showing physical and emotional intimacy, exploration, and striving.The content validity&#xD;
      of the scale will assessed by consulting 11 experts in pediatrics, psychiatry and women's&#xD;
      health.After the contents of the scale were verified, a pilot test will conducted with a&#xD;
      draft scale consisting of 13 items Research experts were sent a draft of the Scale for&#xD;
      Evaluating Early Mother-Baby Attachment Indicators and a content validity index (CVI) rating&#xD;
      form. They were asked to rate the relevance of each item. Relevance was rated on a&#xD;
      three-point scale: 1 = not at all relevant, 2 = need to be fixed, 3 = highly relevant. The&#xD;
      experts were also encouraged to add comments to each item and to make suggestions for any&#xD;
      other item that they deemed necessary but was missing from the instrument. The CVI rating&#xD;
      form was created in congruence with best practices for the development of such forms. Rich&#xD;
      reviews from experts provided sufficient data for content review. Based on the analysis of&#xD;
      the completed CVI forms and the research experts' comments, two scale items were revised.&#xD;
