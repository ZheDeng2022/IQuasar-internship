      The Teen Quit Vaping Study (QVS Teen)'s primary aim is to conduct a fully powered comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a quit vaping text message program in&#xD;
      promoting abstinence from e-cigarettes among young users aged 13-17. This study is a 3-arm&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted among young users aged 13-17 recruited through online&#xD;
      channels. Participants will be randomized to a quit vaping text message intervention, an&#xD;
      assessment-only control condition, and a minimal contact control condition and followed for 7&#xD;
      months to roughly correspond to 6-months post-treatment. The secondary aim is to examine&#xD;
      potential mediators of program effectiveness, including treatment engagement and changes in&#xD;
      self-efficacy and perceived social support for quitting.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be enrolled to receive messages from This is Quitting.&#xD;
Users receive one age-appropriate message per day tailored to their enrollment date or quit date, which can be set and reset via text message. Those not ready to quit receive 4 weeks of messages focused on building skills and confidence. Users who set a quit date receive messages for a week preceding it and 8 weeks afterward that include encouragement and support, skill- and self-efficacy building exercises, coping strategies, and information about the risks of vaping, benefits of quitting, and cutting down to quit. Keywords COPE, STRESS, SLIP, and MORE provide on-demand support.</description>
