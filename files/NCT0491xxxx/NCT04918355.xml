  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing three clinical decision support (CDS) tools to enhance care by&#xD;
      easing health care provider review of the Colorado prescription drug monitoring program&#xD;
      (PDMP) prior to prescribing opioids (pain medications often called narcotics) or&#xD;
      benzodiazepines (sedatives or muscle relaxants). The tools screen information from the PDMP&#xD;
      (a statewide database of filled controlled medication) and a patient's medical record to&#xD;
      identify high-risk factors for overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tools only appear when relevant, are purely informational to facilitate an evidence-based&#xD;
      practice (PDMP review) and do not dictate care or suggest changes in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will track how each of the tools are used and if providers use the PDMP. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include if a controlled medication prescription was written and future opioid use by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research by this team has shown that when emergency department (ED) prescribers are&#xD;
      less likely to prescribe an opioid analgesic to patients at high-risk of overdose or misuse&#xD;
      when they consult the Colorado Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Despite extensive&#xD;
      work to reduce workflow and accessibility barriers to use of the PDMP, the majority of&#xD;
      providers still do not use the PDMP when making prescription decisions. Clinical decision&#xD;
      support (CDS) that is embedded in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has promise as a tool to&#xD;
      increase PDMP use, advance presentation of important PDMP data to providers and improve&#xD;
      opioid safety without interrupting provider workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pragmatic, cluster-randomized study is designed to determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDS tools that deliver focused, timely clinical information about high risk&#xD;
           prescriptions to prescribers can improve use of the PDMP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of focused CDS tools can decrease high-risk opioid prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of focused CDS tools is associated with better patient outcomes: decreasing&#xD;
           high-risk, long-term, and aberrant opioid use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Focused CDS tools will increase the percentage of high-risk prescriptions with a PDMP&#xD;
           review, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Focused CDS tools will decrease the percentage of high-risk controlled medication&#xD;
           prescriptions, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alerts will fire for discharge prescriptions in all system emergency departments,&#xD;
      inpatient facilities and ambulatory care facilities. Evaluation of patient risk as described&#xD;
      below will be conducted automatically and for two of the three visible alerts, the provider&#xD;
      will only see the alert if the patient meets high risk criteria. Providers in emergency&#xD;
      departments and inpatient facilities will be randomized at the individual level, while&#xD;
      providers in the ambulatory setting will be randomized as &quot;clinics&quot; defined as groups of&#xD;
      providers who prescribe at the same site or set of sites (such as a series of primary care&#xD;
      clinics staffed by an identifiable set of providers). Approximately 4000 providers will be&#xD;
      included, based on historical staffing of UCHealth facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified on the basis of an encounter with an enrolled provider and will&#xD;
      not be further randomized. Automated risk assessment steps will be carried out on patients&#xD;
      seen at included UCHealth facilities in the course of the year-long activation of the alerts.&#xD;
      Based on historical patient counts, this is approximately 950,000 unique patients. Visit data&#xD;
      will be retrospectively collected. This population is expected to be approximately 200,000&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDS only changes the provider interface with the PDMP and does not include any treatment&#xD;
      recommendations or limit providers in any way from providing opioids or benzodiazepines if&#xD;
      that is the best course of action in the provider's clinical judgement. Providers are not&#xD;
      required to check the PDMP. The CDS is designed to enable access to the PDMP specifically&#xD;
      focused on high risk prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study implements an automated CDS, which is routinely introduced into clinical&#xD;
      practice with no consent process, and does not make any treatment recommendations or&#xD;
      requirements, it is being conducted at the provider level under a waiver of informed consent.&#xD;
      Patient outcome determination will be conducted as secondary research, with patients to be&#xD;
      included identified on the basis of their interaction with an enrolled health care provider.&#xD;
      Only data collected as part of routine care will be collected to measure secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      All patient data will be de-identified by the research team's Honest Broker and a&#xD;
      de-identified data set provided for analysis.&#xD;
