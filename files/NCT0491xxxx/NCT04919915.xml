    <textblock>
      This study seeks to reduce exposure to asthmagens in the homes of a community of Latino&#xD;
      children residing in an area of intense agricultural production in Eastern Washington by&#xD;
      testing the effectiveness of an intervention (high efficiency particulate air filter- HEPA&#xD;
      portable room air cleaners) plus asthma education to reduce indoor measures of particulate&#xD;
      matter, ammonia, improve clinically relevant measures of asthma health, and reduce biomarkers&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;

      Over the course of five years, this project's specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Build on a well-established community based participatory research program to engage&#xD;
           community partners in the design, implementation and evaluation of this asthma&#xD;
           intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a year-long intervention study with longitudinal measurement of key asthmagen&#xD;
           exposures and health outcome indicators with minimal participant burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop and characterize evaluation metrics for the process, impact and outcomes of this&#xD;
           project in achievement of the aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Promote sustainable public health action via positive and transparent communications&#xD;
           about the project to participants, local stakeholders, and state level policy makers&#xD;
           through broad-based community outreach.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>HEPA air cleaner</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in the intervention group received two HEPA air cleaners per household. They were informed to place the HEPA air cleaners in the child's bedroom and the living room. Field staff provided and discuss how to use the air cleaner which promoted continuous operation of both air cleaners, keeping the child's bedroom door closed, and selected the highest fan speed. Typical use of the HEPA cleaners were questioned during the mid-study and final visits.</description>
