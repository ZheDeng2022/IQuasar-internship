      day 7 (+/- 1) of their participation to the meeting. This rate will be compared to a cohort&#xD;
      of health care professionals (medical doctors and paramedical professionals) from the same&#xD;
      hospital ward as the attendees but who did not attend the meeting (stratified on centers,&#xD;
      gender, age (&lt; and &gt;= 40 years, vaccination status (0, 1 or 2 doses) and socio-professional&#xD;
