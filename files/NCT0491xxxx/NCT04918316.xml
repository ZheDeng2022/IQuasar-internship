  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, progressive disease in which corneal irregularity&#xD;
      increases. As the condition develops, more advanced forms of optical correction are needed to&#xD;
      improve vision for patients. Until recently, small diameter corneal gas permeable lenses were&#xD;
      considered the primary mode of correction for patients with keratoconus. Now, however,&#xD;
      practitioners have multiple options for reducing the optical aberrations caused by&#xD;
      keratoconus, including scleral lenses. As of yet, no single option for optical correction has&#xD;
      been identified as the preferred mode of correction in terms of overall patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with vision, comfort, and ease of use. The order in which various forms of optical correction&#xD;
      would be most logically introduced has yet to be determined. This is a study comparing small&#xD;
      diameter corneal gas permeable and large diameter scleral lenses in individuals with&#xD;
      keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will prospectively compare visual satisfaction and ease of use between corneal gas&#xD;
      permeable and scleral lenses for patients with mild to moderate keratoconus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While both corneal gas permeable and scleral lenses have been show to improve visual acuity&#xD;
      in individuals with keratoconus, it has yet to be determined if one option has superior&#xD;
      comfort and overall patient satisfaction in patients new to gas permeable lens use. In this&#xD;
      study, patients will be prospectively fit with both corneal gas permeable and scleral lenses&#xD;
      according to standard clinical practice. Both corneal gas permeable and scleral lenses are&#xD;
      considered standard of care for patients with keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that study participants will select scleral lens over corneal&#xD;
      gas permeable lens as their preferred final lens type of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome measure of this study is participant selected final lens choice for&#xD;
      continued use for the management of keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized interventional clinical trial&#xD;
      with a 2x2 crossover design of patients with keratoconus fit with corneal and scleral gas&#xD;
      permeable contact lenses. The crossover design allows intra-subject differences between two&#xD;
      randomized groups with participants serving as their own controls. Contact lens #1 will be&#xD;
      the SynergEyes VS (Synergeyes, Inc., Carlsbad CA) which features bi-tangential toric&#xD;
      peripheries with linear landing zones. The standard lens is 16.0mm and is available from 14.5&#xD;
      to 17.5mm diameters. Contact lens #2 will be the RoseK2 corneal gas permeable lens (Blanchard&#xD;
      Contact Lens, Inc. Manchester, NH). The lens is available in with a base curve range from&#xD;
      4.30 to 8.60 mm, diameter of 7.90 to 10.40mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Available baseline corneal topography and pachymetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amsler-Krumeich keratoconus classification of stage 1 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior corneal transplantation or INTACTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior use of hybrid, corneal or scleral gas permeable lenses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of corneal scarring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures During the initial study visits patient demographics, past ocular and&#xD;
      medical history and best corrected visual acuity with manifest refraction will be recorded.&#xD;
      Additional testing may include corneal topography, pachymetry and meibography. Dry eye&#xD;
      symptoms and contact lens comfort will be assessed using the OSDI and CLDEQ questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fit according to standard practices with the RoseK 2 corneal gas&#xD;
      permeable and Synergeyes VS scleral lenses following manufacturer's recommendations. Over&#xD;
      refraction and best corrected visual acuity will be recorded. Subjective comfort with lens&#xD;
      use rated on comfort scale of 0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to dispense lens #1 vs lens #2. They will be trained in safe&#xD;
      application and removal and provided instructions on lens disinfection procedures. Best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity with lens #1 and subjective comfort with lens use will be rated on&#xD;
      comfort scale of 0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the next visit, participants will return wearing lens #1 for minimum of 3 hours. Best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity with lens #1 will be recorded as well as hours of lens wear today,&#xD;
      average hours of lens wear time, days per week of per week and daily time spent on lens&#xD;
      application and removal. They will rate subjective comfort with lens use on comfort scale of&#xD;
      0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable). Dry eye symptoms will be assessed using OSDI&#xD;
      and CLDEQ questionnaires. Participants will be trained in application and removal with lens&#xD;
      #2. Best corrected visual acuity with lens #2 and subjective comfort will be rated on comfort&#xD;
      scale of 0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final visit, participants will return wearing lens #2 for minimum of 3 hours. Best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity with lens #2 will be recorded as well as hours of lens wear today,&#xD;
      average hours of lens wear time, days per week of per week and daily time spent on lens&#xD;
      application and removal. They will rate subjective comfort with lens use on comfort scale of&#xD;
      0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable). Dry eye symptoms will be assessed using OSDI&#xD;
      and CLDEQ questionnaires. Participants will be trained in application and removal with lens&#xD;
      #2. Best corrected visual acuity with lens #2 and subjective comfort will be rated on comfort&#xD;
      scale of 0 (not comfortable) to 10 (very comfortable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will make a final selection of lens of choice #1 or #2.&#xD;
