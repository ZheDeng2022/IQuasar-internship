    <textblock>
      This interventional, randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blind study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a dietary supplementation with a blue fish hydrolysate derived from marine&#xD;
      by-products, containing peptides and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on cognitive&#xD;
      performance in a healthy older population, between 60 and 73 years old, with lower memory&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary supplementation&#xD;
      with a hydrolysate derived from marine by-products compared to a placebo on the evolution of&#xD;
      episodic memory at 3 months in healthy elderly people with lower memory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with a hydrolysate derived from marine by-products compared to a placebo on&#xD;
      the evolution at 3 months of verbal recognition memory, working memory, perceived stress&#xD;
      level, biological markers of nutritional and hormonal status in healthy elderly people with&#xD;
      lower memory performance. Finally, participants' satisfaction with the product will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have to take 4 capsules per day of the hydrolysate containing 770 mg (dose per&#xD;
      capsule) or of the placebo for 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a phone screening interview and will attend 5 visits to the Bordeaux&#xD;
      University Hospital on the Neuro-Psychopharmacological Research Platform.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the frequency with which the respondent has experienced feelings of stress or loss of control over events in the past month. Each item is rated by the patient on a Likert scale from 0 to 4. The total score is obtained by adding the score for each item. The total score is between 0 and 40. A score below 13 suggests a low stress level, a score between 14 and 19 a moderate stress level and a score above 20 a high stress level.</description>

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>

    <description>The MMSE consists of 30 questions or tasks (items) exploring possible disorders of: orientation in time and space, memory, attention, language (speech, comprehension, reading, writing), motor performance. For each of the thirty questions, a correct answer results in a score of 1 and a wrong or approximate answer in a score of 0. The final score is marked out of 30 points.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GDS Short Form is a self-administered questionnaire with 15 items, each with a binary Yes-No response. It was designed to test for depressive symptoms in elderly subjects. In the original form of the scale, an individual with a score of 0 to 5 is considered normal. A score between 5 and 9 indicates a high probability of depression and a score between 10 and 15 almost always indicates depression.</description>
