    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Avatrombopag in&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease undergoing an elective invasive&#xD;
      procedure through a prospective, non-randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial. The&#xD;
      patients were non-randomly assigned to the Avatrombopag group (119 patients) and the&#xD;
      conventional treatment group (357 patients). The primary endpoint was the proportion of&#xD;
      patients not requiring prophylactic platelet transfusion or rescue therapy due to bleeding&#xD;
      from grouping up to 10 days post-procedure. Second endpoints included the proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving a platelet count of ≥50x10^9/L and the mean change in platelet count from&#xD;
      baseline at the time before the procedure, the proportion of patients requiring platelet&#xD;
      transfusion and the mean platelet transfusion units per capita, the incidence of bleeding&#xD;
      events (WHO≥2 and requiring rescue therapy), the imaging evaluations of bleeding events, the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, the changes in life quality between two groups before and after&#xD;
      treatment, and the pharmacoeconomic index of two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of chronic liver disease (CLD), which severity&#xD;
      increases with the aggravation of CLD. TPO, the primary physiological regulator of platelet&#xD;
      production, is mainly produced by the liver. With the progressive liver injury in patients&#xD;
      with CLD, TPO production decreases, resulting in the reduction of platelet production and&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, which cause the significantly increased risk of bleeding during the&#xD;
      invasive procedure in these patients and pose a severe challenge to clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet transfusion is a standard clinical treatment for CLD-related thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
      Whether prophylactic platelet transfusion is needed before elective invasive procedure&#xD;
      depends on the level of platelet count and the judgment of medical staff on the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding in those procedures. Clinically, without effective preventive treatment in severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (PLT&lt; 50×10^9/L), the risk of bleeding in related procedures is high, the&#xD;
      hospitalization is prolonged after bleeding, and other post-procedure complications may&#xD;
      occur. However, repeated prophylactic platelet transfusion may lead to ineffective platelet&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 were identical design randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      international multicenter phase III clinical trials. They confirmed that 1. Avatrombopag&#xD;
      could significantly increase the platelet count in patients with chronic liver disease with&#xD;
      severe thrombocytopenia (PLT&lt;50×10^9/L), thus reducing the proportion of platelet transfusion&#xD;
      or rescue due to bleeding in adult patients with chronic liver disease-associated&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia undergoing elective invasive procedures; 2. In terms of safety, the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events in the Avatrombopag group was comparable to that in the placebo&#xD;
      group. At present, Avatrombopag has been successively approved in Europe, the United States,&#xD;
      and China for adult patients with chronic liver disease-associated thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      undergoing elective invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avatrombopag is effective and safe in raising platelet count in patients with chronic liver&#xD;
      disease. In addition, it has the characteristics of no risk of neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      generation from small molecules and convenient oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to observe the clinical benefit of Avatrombopag to raise&#xD;
      platelet count in adult patients with chronic liver disease-associated thrombocytopenia who&#xD;
      received elective high-risk invasive procedures and to validate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Avatrombopag further in Chinese population with different spectrum of etiology in chronic&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
