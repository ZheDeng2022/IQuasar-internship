  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation is an established treatment for movement disorders. New indications&#xD;
      for deep brain stimulation are under investigation, among them severe and treatment-resistant&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. Here, the investigators investigate clinical outcomes, safety&#xD;
      and mechanism of action of DBS in the BNST in a series of 11 participants with severe&#xD;
      therapy-refractory OCD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring the effect on obsessive-compulsive symptoms after treatment with DBS in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis using YBOCS</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the psychiatrist-rated YBOCS at one year, with response defined as ≥ 35% decrease in YBOCS score and partial response as a 25-34% decrease. In YBOCS is a 10-item clinically rated scale where the items are divided by obsessions and compulsions. The scale measures the severity of OCD by time spent on obsessions/compulsions, level of anxiety and decrease of functioning caused by OCD symptoms and ability to control obsessions and compulsions. Maximum points on the scale are 40, where 0-7 points indicates subclinical, 8-15 mild, 16-23 moderate, 24 - 32 severe and 33- 40 extreme OCD symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring the effect on depressive symptoms after treatment with DBS in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis using the Montgomery-Asberg Depressive Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depressive Rating Scale is a 10-item clinically rated scale of common symptoms in major depressive disorder. The scale measures severity of depressive symptoms with a maximum score of 60 where 0-6 indicates normal levels, 7 - 19 mild, 20 - 34 moderate and &gt;34 severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring the effect on functioning after treatment with DBS in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis using the Global Assessment of Functioning scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning is a numeric clinician rating scale to rate social, occupational, and psychological functioning. Scores range from 100 (high function) to 0 (sever impairment).</description>

    <description>Stereotactic functional neurosurgery was first developed in 1947 and is today an established treatment for movement disorders. The surgical procedure is initiated by mounting a stereotactic frame on the head of the patient and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) is performed. Using a computerized navigational system the target structure is identified on the MRI and a trajectory chosen. In the operating theatre a burrhole is made on each side of the midline for the implantation of two electrodes. The electrodes are about 1.3 mm in diameter with several contacts at their distal end. An extension cable is tunneled under the skin, connecting the electrodes with a neuropacemaker placed below the clavicle in a subcutaneous pocket. The hospitalization time after surgery is dependent on the time needed for programming of the device, but the patients can usually return home within 3-5 days.</description>
