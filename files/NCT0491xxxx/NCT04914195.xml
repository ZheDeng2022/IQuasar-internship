  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Active Controlled, Comparative, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Phase 3&#xD;
      clinical study to compare the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of leuprolide acetate&#xD;
      for injection 3.75mg (depot) of two brands (Luprodex and Lucrin) administered in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 168 subjects (males )of age above 18 years fulfilling the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The IP will be given as a monthly dose for two cycles on day 0 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic analysis will be done for 12 patients receiving Luprodex. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be captured on days as per protocol. Adverse events will be noted for&#xD;
      safety evaluation.&#xD;
