      This study will assess if the CARES (Cancer Advocacy, Resources, Education and Support)&#xD;
      intervention improves time to start of treatment after diagnosis and time to treatment&#xD;
      completion for Lung Cancer and Head and Neck Cancer patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study. 320 participants will be enrolled to the CARES intervention or&#xD;
      usual care arms. All participants will complete surveys to assess Quality of Care and Patient&#xD;
      Reported outcomes at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The CARES intervention will include a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 navigation and 10 counseling sessions delivered over approximately a 6- month&#xD;
      period delivered by oncology nurse navigators and master's level counselors. Sessions will be&#xD;
      scheduled to correspond with key transition points during treatment and may be held in&#xD;
      person, virtually, or by phone. Patients enrolled to the usual care arm will receive a&#xD;
      standardized list of resources. Participation will last 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Nurse navigators and masters levels counselors will meet with participants up to 10 times each (10 navigation and 10 counseling) over a 6 month period. The number of sessions will be determined by the length of the patient's treatment. The timing of each session will be guided by a regular assessment to reduce the time from diagnosis to initiation of treatment and the time between subsequent treatments. Sessions will occur at key transition points during treatment to target the factors associated with treatment delays, reduced Quality of Care and poor Patient Reported Outcomes</description>
