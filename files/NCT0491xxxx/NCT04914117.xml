    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, First-in-Human, Multicentre, Open-label Study of RC118 for Injection in&#xD;
      Patients with Locally Advanced Unresectable/Metastatic Solid Tumours to determine the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of RC118, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered&#xD;
      dose (MAD), and to define the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, FIH, study consisting of dose-escalation (Part A) and dose&#xD;
      confirmation (Part B) in Australia. This trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      (MTD/MAD), PK, immunogenicity of RC118, and further determine the RP2D. In addition, the&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of RC118 as single agent will be assessed.&#xD;
