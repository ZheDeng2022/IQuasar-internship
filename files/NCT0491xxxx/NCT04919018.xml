  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though common, morbidities related to upper airway disease in primary ciliary dyskinesia&#xD;
      (PCD) and primary immunodeficiencies (PID) have not been fully characterized. These&#xD;
      conditions can be difficult to distinguish due to their overlapping phenotypes. The sinonasal&#xD;
      and middle ear features are often identified as most problematic by patients and their&#xD;
      families, and optimal, highly effective treatment regimens have not been established. The&#xD;
      main objective of this project is to characterize and compare the upper airway phenotypes in&#xD;
      individuals with confirmed diagnosis of PCD and PID, and to collect critical data to inform&#xD;
      the design of future clinical trials of treatment of the upper airway diseases. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that these investigations will discern the clinical, anatomical, and&#xD;
      pathophysiological phenotypes of paranasal sinus disease in PCD and PID, identifying disease&#xD;
      endpoints and biomarkers that differentiate these two overlapping disorders. Findings from&#xD;
      these studies will also enhance our understanding of middle ear disease and associated&#xD;
      hearing loss in a cross-sectional cohort of patients with PCD and PID. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      long-term goal of our Consortium is to elucidate underlying phenotypes and genotypes of these&#xD;
      diseases, potentially leading to novel therapeutics that will improve the lives of affected&#xD;
      individuals. Given the COVID pandemic, certain procedures will have the option to be&#xD;
      converted to telehealth visits to ensure compliance with local guidelines and participant&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 participants with a diagnosis of PCD (n=100) and PID (n=100) who will each&#xD;
      participate in a single study visit will be recruited. 30 percent of participants will be&#xD;
      under the age of 12 in both the PCD and PID cohorts. The investigators will use a systematic&#xD;
      approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients in order to identify characteristics which&#xD;
      may distinguish between PID and PCD and serve as future clinical trial endpoints. This will&#xD;
      include collection of relevant medical history, physical examination, sinonasal quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires, olfactory testing, bilateral audiometry and tympanometry, nasal&#xD;
      endoscopy, sinus culture, analysis of mucus composition, Sinus CT scan, nasal nitric oxide&#xD;
      measurement and a blood draw.&#xD;

    <description>SNOT-22 is a subject-completed questionnaire that consists of 22 questions. Each item is rated as follows: 0=no problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=mild or slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem, 5=problem as bad as it can be. The total score can range from 0-110, 0 being the best and 110 being the worst.</description>
