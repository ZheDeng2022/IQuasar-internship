  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, randomized study conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness, safety and long-term safety of Saypha® FILLER Lidocaine for lip augmentation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent and screening, eligible subjects with moderate to severe&#xD;
      deficiency of lip volume will be randomized to receive Saypha® FILLER Lidocaine from 1 of 2&#xD;
      manufacturing sites. The device will be injected into the submucosa of the lips, and subjects&#xD;
      will return for follow-up assessments at Week 3, 6, 26, 52 and optional at Week 76 after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Touch-up treatment may be done at Week 2, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. The&#xD;
      performance of the investigational device will be evaluated by the investigator by assessing&#xD;
      severity using the LFS, Lip Fullness Scale, at Week 6, 26, 52 after the treatment and&#xD;
      optional at Week 76 and in comparison to Day 0. The upper and lower lip will be graded&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone visits will be performed approximately 24 hours post-administration to monitor&#xD;
      possible adverse events. In case any adverse events are reported during the telephone visits&#xD;
      an unscheduled visit should be performed.&#xD;
