  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare the effects of blow bottle technique and interdigital&#xD;
      exercises on the pulmonary functions of the post laparotomy patients where there is sudden&#xD;
      decline in lung function and increased rate of complications after the surgery. A randomized&#xD;
      control trial was conducted including post laparotomy patients, randomly allocated to&#xD;
      interventional and control groups. Both the groups received breathing exercises along with&#xD;
      conventional treatment during phase I rehabilitation. Data was collected at baseline, before&#xD;
      and after every session and after 6 sessions before patient discharge from hospital. Outcome&#xD;
      measures include assessment of lung volumes and capacities, oxygen saturation and vitals of&#xD;
      the post laparotomy patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary complications are common in post laparotomy patients because of multiple pre&#xD;
      operative, intra operative and post operative factors. To manage these complications many&#xD;
      interventions and breathing techniques are used. These complications alter the pulmonary&#xD;
      function leading to decreased chest expansion, oxygen saturation and post operative&#xD;
      atelectasis. Anesthetic drugs that also cause cardiac depression along with hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability of the patient. Incision given to the chest or abdominal wall during procedure&#xD;
      causes to lose the integrity of respiratory muscles which effects the functions of the muscle&#xD;
      directly. Respiratory muscles are compromised, normal lung volumes are depressed. More than&#xD;
      75% of patients who are receiving neuromuscular blocking agent develops atelectasis. The&#xD;
      estimated time after surgery for patient to return to its preoperative health status is&#xD;
      approximately 6 weeks. These complications increase the hospital length of stay and cost&#xD;
      associated with it as well as increase the morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung expansion techniques (LETs) are widely used to prevent postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications (PPCs). However, the effects of each of these techniques on thoraco-abdominal&#xD;
      mechanics and PPC incidence after abdominal surgery remain unclear. Active Cycle of Breathing&#xD;
      Techniques (ACBT) has shown to be effective in mobilizing and clearing the excess bronchial&#xD;
      secretions and to improve lung function. It neither causes nor increases hypoxemia or&#xD;
      increases airflow obstruction. Chest physiotherapy and breathing exercises are often&#xD;
      prescribed to patients undergoing cardiac surgery and abdominal surgery in order to prevent&#xD;
      or reduce post-operative pulmonary complications. There are different breathing techniques&#xD;
      with and without mechanical devices after the surgery, but there is controversy regarding&#xD;
      which breathing techniques are the most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researches have proved change in pulmonary functions by the use of various breathing&#xD;
      exercises. Depressed pulmonary functions i.e. decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) ,&#xD;
      decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) are seen as&#xD;
      result of disturbed lung function. Alteration in function of diaphragm contributes in&#xD;
      postoperatively pulmonary function disturbances. Chest physiotherapy is implied for&#xD;
      minimizing the altered lung functions and complications. This includes multiple breathing&#xD;
      exercises, percussion , vibrations, huffing, coughing techniques, postural drainage and&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is conducted to compare two respiratory techniques for the improvement in&#xD;
      post operative pulmonary function; because of incisional pain, patients find the inspiratory&#xD;
      exercises difficult to perform, therefore, the study is conducted to assess if easy-to&#xD;
      -perform expiratory techniques are similar in effect to the inspiratory techniques and for&#xD;
      the said purpose comparison of blow bottle technique and interdigital breathing on post&#xD;
      laparotomy patients is made for the improvement of pulmonary function and vitals of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Three zones of measurement are commonly used to interpret peak flow rates. Normal value of PEFR is (80-100%). Green zone indicates 80 to 100 percent of the usual or normal peak flow reading, yellow zone indicates 50 to 79 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings, and red zone indicates less than 50 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings.</description>
