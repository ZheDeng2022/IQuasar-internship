      This is a open label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Vero cell) developed by Beijing Institute of Biological&#xD;
      Products Co., Ltd in healthy people aged 3-17 years old in comparison with healthy population&#xD;
      aged 18 years old and above. Total of 1800 healthy volunteers aged 3 years old and above will&#xD;
      be enrolled, of whom the subjects will be divided into two groups, 3-17 years old group and&#xD;
      18 years old and above group with each consisting of 900 volunteers. The 3-17 years old group&#xD;
      was further divided into three subgroups: 3-6 years old, 7-12 years old and 13-17 years old,&#xD;
      with 300 volunteers in each subgroup. 2 doses of vaccines will be injected into the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle of either upper arm according to the immunization schedule of D0, D21 (+7 Days). Based&#xD;
      on interim analysis'results of the booster dose administered to adults aged 18 years old and&#xD;
      above, a booster dose might be introduced.&#xD;
