      This trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic&#xD;
      administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty&#xD;
      treatment in Vietnam&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health&#xD;
      associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major&#xD;
      implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and&#xD;
      treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty.&#xD;
      Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal&#xD;
      cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted&#xD;
      to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based&#xD;
      therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs&#xD;
      (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study&#xD;
      describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently&#xD;
      employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II&#xD;
      trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July&#xD;
      2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a&#xD;
      UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty&#xD;
      treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed&#xD;
      UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of&#xD;
      three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified&#xD;
      administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The&#xD;
      potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions&#xD;
      (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers&#xD;
      of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This&#xD;
      clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different&#xD;
      timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the&#xD;
      improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion&#xD;
      profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The&#xD;
      ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies&#xD;
