  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the FDA's emergency use authorization declaration in December of 2020, the&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine became the first of several vaccines to kick off the mass vaccination&#xD;
      effort across the United States against CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Subsequently,&#xD;
      Moderna as well as Johnson and Johnson both had vaccines receive emergency use authorization.&#xD;
      While the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines both utilize novel mRNA technology, Johnson and&#xD;
      Johnson's vaccine uses a viral vector that has been used previously in both the approved&#xD;
      European Ebola vaccine and a trial vaccine for HIV. However, none of these vaccine types have&#xD;
      previously been approved in the United States. While preliminary data from safety and&#xD;
      efficacy trials have shown positive results, actual-world data on its effectiveness is still&#xD;
      lacking. Several small cohort studies and one large trial from Israel are currently the only&#xD;
      insights into the actual rates of infection, hospitalization, and severe illness among&#xD;
      vaccinated individuals. As COVID-19 variants, with the potential to reduce vaccine efficacy,&#xD;
      continue to emerge worldwide, there is a need of more data regarding the real-world&#xD;
      effectiveness of our current mass vaccination efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination efforts in the State of Michigan have been ongoing since December 2020. Given&#xD;
      that approximately 33.7% of the state's population is either partially or fully vaccinated,&#xD;
      it is unclear why the number of cases has risen so dramatically or if immunization efforts&#xD;
      can help the situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current situation in the State of Michigan, this study will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccination on rates of hospital visits and severe illness when breakthrough&#xD;
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurs in a region&#xD;
      with high incidence of variant strain disease.&#xD;

      A retrospective chart review of all patients presenting to Beaumont Health System emergency&#xD;
      departments between December 15, 2020 and April 30, 2021 who tested positive for COVID-19&#xD;
      will be performed. The primary aim is to compare the rate of Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      presentations/hospitalizations among unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated&#xD;
      patients presenting to an emergency center (EC). Secondarily, the rates of individual&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infection for hospitalized patients will be compared among&#xD;
      unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients, including the proportion&#xD;
      of COVID-positive patients who develop severe disease, require admission to the hospital, and&#xD;
      rates of those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), renal replacement therapy (RRT), supplemental&#xD;
      oxygenation, or noninvasive ventilation, as well as the rate of in-hospital mortality and the&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. Exploratory outcomes may include comparisons among fully-vaccinated&#xD;
      individuals receiving each of the three types of vaccines, and investigation of demographic,&#xD;
      epidemiological, clinical and laboratory predictors of hospitalization. For each individual,&#xD;
      data collected will include vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, pulse oximetry), demographics (age, gender, existing medical conditions), home&#xD;
      medications, chief complaint from emergency provider note, duration of symptoms in days at&#xD;
      the time of presentation from emergency provider note, chest X-ray or chest computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) results, and laboratory values. For patients who were admitted, data&#xD;
      collected will include initial hospital admission unit (regular medical or surgical floor,&#xD;
      progressive floor, intensive care unit), change in unit type during admission, oxygen therapy&#xD;
      (none, nasal cannula, supplemental high flow oxygen, ventilator), days on high flow oxygen,&#xD;
      days on ventilator, specific inpatient medical therapies, laboratory values, imaging results,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, and disposition from hospital (home, rehabilitation unit, death).&#xD;
