    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm and open-label phase II study, evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of anlotinib combined with tislelizumab and AT regimen as neoadjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer. Participants will undergo/receive PDL1 testing after&#xD;
      enrollment. All patients will be receive 6 cycles of low-dose anlotinib combined with&#xD;
      tislelizumab and AT（Doxorubicin or Epirubicin+albumin-bound paclitaxel）regimen, followed by&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to approximately 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE.</description>
