  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      I am conducting an experimental study examining the bonding between father and baby.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental group and the control group (1st group and 2nd group) will be formed by&#xD;
      randomly selecting the spouses of women who applied to Afşin State Hospital and Elbistan&#xD;
      State Hospital Gynecology Polyclinic. Fathers in the first group will be met face-to-face&#xD;
      with powerpoints and visuals, and training will be provided. It is planned to provide a total&#xD;
      of 3 educations by contacting fathers at the time of birth and 2 months after birth. The&#xD;
      scope of the 1st education is planned to be about attachment, father-infant attachment, the&#xD;
      benefits of father-infant attachment to the baby and the father and how this bond can be&#xD;
      strengthened. Care and feeding of the baby is planned within the scope of the second&#xD;
      education. In the third education, it is planned to inform the father about spending quality&#xD;
      time with the baby and its importance. As a result, the first education will be focused on&#xD;
      more about attachment and its importance, the second education will focus on the importance&#xD;
      of the father's participation in the care of the baby and the information about care, and the&#xD;
      last education the importance of the father's taking care of the baby and spending time with&#xD;
      him. Fathers in the second group will be given a training brochure at the end of the 6th&#xD;
      month, after the scale is applied. If the baby's health is affected by possible adverse&#xD;
      events at birth, that father will be excluded from the study. After the birth with the&#xD;
      fathers, when the baby reaches 6-12 months, face-to-face or phone calls will be applied and&#xD;
      the father-infant attachment status will be analyzed by statistical analysis. The study will&#xD;
      be done as pre-test and post-test. Güleç D. and Kavlak O. examined the validity of the&#xD;
      father-infant Attachment Scale in Turkish society, and they came up with a questionnaire&#xD;
      consisting of 19 questions in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail added (15.06.2021): Power analysis was performed with the study from 5 control groups&#xD;
      from 5 experimental groups. A total of 58 workers, consisting of 29 experimental and 29&#xD;
      control groups, were found sufficient for the study&#xD;
