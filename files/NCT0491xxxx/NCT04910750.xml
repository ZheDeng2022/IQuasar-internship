      This study aims to evaluate the impact of introducing pulse oximeters and clinical decision&#xD;
      support algorithms (CDSAs) to primary care on health outcomes of children under 5 years of&#xD;
      age. We will enrol sick children 0 to 59 months of age attending government primary care&#xD;
      facilities in India and Tanzania to a three-arm parallel group, superiority pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In India, 120 facilities (Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs)) in&#xD;
      three districts of Uttar Pradesh (Deoria, Sitapur and Unnao) are included; in Tanzania, 66&#xD;
      facilities (dispensaries and health centres) in Mwanza, Tabora and Tanga are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities are randomised 1:1:1 to i) pulse oximetry and tablet-based CDSA ii) pulse oximetry&#xD;
      and paper job aid, or iii) routine care. Interventions are implemented with a package of&#xD;
      training, supportive supervision, operational support and community engagement. IMCI&#xD;
      refresher training is provided to all arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers at intervention facilities are provided with handheld, UNICEF-approved, pulse&#xD;
      oximeters along with guidance and training in line with government-approved criteria. In&#xD;
      Tanzania, healthcare providers are advised to measure oxygen saturation (SpO2) on all&#xD;
      children under 2 months of age, all children 2 to 59 months of age with cough or difficulty&#xD;
      breathing or with signs of moderate or severe disease based on Integrated Management of&#xD;
      Childhood Illness (IMCI); in India, healthcare providers are advised to measure oxygen&#xD;
      saturation for all sick children. Providers are advised to urgently refer children with SpO2&#xD;
      &lt;90% (and also &lt;94% in India if SARS-CoV-2 is suspected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tablet-based CDSA provides step-by-step support to healthcare providers through&#xD;
      consultations, providing national guideline-based recommendations on assessment, diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment based tailored to the individual child based on information entered by the&#xD;
      provider. Following training, providers are advised to use CDSA for all consultations with&#xD;
      sick children under 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between arms will be assessed through two main primary outcomes: a.) the&#xD;
      proportion of children with severe complication (death or secondary hospitalization i.e.&#xD;
      delayed beyond 24 hours of primary care consultation, or without referral) by Day 7; and b.)&#xD;
      the proportion of children appropriately hospitalised (admitted to hospital within 24 hours&#xD;
      of primary care consultation and as a result of referral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the trial is calculated separately for each country, taking the following&#xD;
      assumptions into account: a.) a power of 80%, b.) alpha level of 0.05 per arm, c.)&#xD;
      intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.001, d.) control arm severe complication of&#xD;
      1.1%, e.) control arm appropriate hospitalization of 1.5% and f.) a recruitment period of 12&#xD;
      months. Based on these assumptions, to be able to detect a 30% or greater decrease in severe&#xD;
      complication and 30% or greater increase in appropriate hospitalization for each arm compared&#xD;
      to the control, 120 and 66 facilities will be required in India and in Tanzania respectively.&#xD;
      The estimated average recruitment over the 12-months period is 61,200 children in India (510&#xD;
      per cluster) and 110,880 children in Tanzania (1680 per cluster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main trial is is complemented by embedded mixed-method, cost &amp; cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      studies, including periodic service provision assessments, process mapping and time-flow&#xD;
      studies, in-depth interviews with caregivers, and healthcare providers, key informant&#xD;
      interviews and online surveys with stakeholders, and document routine data review. The main&#xD;
      is preceded by a 3-month pilot phase, in which sub-studies are also conducted.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of children admitted to hospital within 24 hours of the Day 0 primary care consultation and as a result of a referral</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is used as a proxy for 'appropriate referral' of children, as those with severe disease should generally be admitted to hospital. The denominator for this outcomes is all children enrolled in the study, rather than only referred children. This is because the proportion of referred children that are admitted may be high in routine care, in the context of an inappropriately low referral rate. The aim of the intervention is therefore to increase the overall referral rate of children with severe disease. Hospital admission is chosen as the proxy of severe disease rather than using primary care classification of severe disease, as there are inadequacies in the classification of severe disease in routine practice.</description>
