  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study to assess the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and renal&#xD;
      response of isatuximab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients with severe renal impairment or dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease. Such&#xD;
      patients have limited therapeutic options due to renal clearance or nephrotoxicity of many&#xD;
      myeloma therapies and are often excluded from clinical trials. Isatuximab in other regimens&#xD;
      has shown efficacy and tolerability in patients with moderate renal impairment, although data&#xD;
      are lacking for regimens containing CD38-targeting immunotherapies in severe renal&#xD;
      impairment/ESRD.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will enroll 28 evaluable patients. Fourteen (+/- 2) patients will be required&#xD;
        tto be on dialysis and 14 (+/- 2) patients will not be on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma diagnosis according to IMWG criteria. Patients&#xD;
             eligible for autologous stem cell transplant may be enrolled if the intent is to&#xD;
             proceed to transplant after 4 or more cycles of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m^2 using the MDRD calculator) or on&#xD;
             dialysis. The value at screening confirms eligibility (if eGFR improves prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, this does not render a patient ineligible) The renal impairment may be&#xD;
             acute or chronic and may be related to the underlying myeloma (e.g. multiple myeloma&#xD;
             (MM) cast nephropathy, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease [MIDD], myeloma&#xD;
             cell infiltration) or another cause (e.g. diabetes, hypertension), however the&#xD;
             acuity/chronicity and the underlying cause should be documented clearly. Those who&#xD;
             have acute kidney injury from hypercalcemia should receive intravenous hydration and&#xD;
             calcium-lowering therapy to see if this renal impairment is reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow and organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count â‰¥ 1,000/mm3 (growth factor to achieve this level is&#xD;
                  permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets â‰¥ 50,000/mm3 (transfusion to achieve this level is permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin â‰¤ 2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) â‰¤ 3.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of isatuximab and bortezomib on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 5 months after discontinuation&#xD;
             of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of the study, and 5 months after completion of&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of other anti-neoplastic medications or radiotherapy (except for&#xD;
             localized disease). Note: Participants are permitted to have received one dose of&#xD;
             bortezomib or up to 80 mg of dexamethasone (or equivalent) prior to study treatment&#xD;
             initiation if deemed clinically necessary for disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of myeloma within the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of amyloidosis without concomitant multiple myeloma. Patients with&#xD;

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to isatuximab, bortezomib, or dexamethasone or other agents used&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;

                  and HBsAb) and HBV total core antibody (HBcAb IgG and IgM), and screening for HCV&#xD;
                  (HCV Ab and HCV RNA level) are required to have been performed within 1 year of&#xD;
                  screening, or should otherwise be performed as part of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with uncontrolled or active HBV infection (patients with positive HBsAg&#xD;
                  and/or HBV DNA), as well as patients with active HCV infection (positive HCV RNA&#xD;

                  and undetectable (under limit of quantification) HBV DNA at study entry (HBV&#xD;
                  carriers: past resolved infection, resolving acute infection or receiving&#xD;
                  antiviral treatment with controlled infection), specialist advice may be&#xD;
                  requested, close monitoring of viral reactivation throughout and following the&#xD;
                  end of study treatment should be proposed (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase, and HBV DNA at least every 3 months, up to 6 months after&#xD;
                  treatment discontinuation or initiation of further anticancer therapy.&#xD;

             they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the 12 months&#xD;
             prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS&#xD;
