  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing speech intelligibility in a pilot study of patients speaking with a mask microphone&#xD;
      while being treated with standard of care non-invasive ventilation. This is a feasibility&#xD;
      study to test the microphone in a real world setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a prospective feasibility study to evaluate speech intelligibility of 10&#xD;
      patients (target distribution of gender: 5 males, 5 females) undergoing standard of care,&#xD;
      clinically indicated non-invasive ventilation. Patients will be their own control with and&#xD;
      without the ReddyPortâ„¢ microphone using a crossover design, with the sequence of conditions&#xD;
      randomized (half of patients start with microphone turned on, half start with the microphone&#xD;
      turned off). The patients in this study will all receive standard of care. No medical&#xD;
      decisions for a change in care will result from the speech recordings obtained during this&#xD;
      feasibility study. The speech recordings will be analyzed off-site using a pool of blinded&#xD;
      volunteers. The microphone on and off test conditions will not be used to change outcome of&#xD;
      the clinical course of care.&#xD;
