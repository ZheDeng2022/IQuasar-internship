  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Rehabilitation After Surgery (ERAS), developed in the 1990s, is a program&#xD;
      encompassing a set of measures before, during and after surgery aimed at improving management&#xD;
      by promoting the early recovery of the patient's abilities after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERAS has been scientifically validated and standardized in many surgical disciplines&#xD;
      since the implementation of guidelines in France in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the obstetrical field, it was not until 2018 that the caesarean section could&#xD;
      benefit from ERAS, with the publication of specific guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been able to demonstrate ERAS effectiveness in reducing the length of&#xD;
      hospitalization, postoperative complications, the consumption of analgesics immediately after&#xD;
      surgery, and the financial cost, including in the context of cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But beyond immediate benefit, the impact of an ERAS protocol on chronic pain has not yet been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is defined as physical discomfort that persists for more than 2 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was not until 2004 that research focused on chronic post-cesarean pain, finding an&#xD;
      incidence of chronic pain of 18.6% at 3 months and 12.3% at 6 months. In 2016, another study&#xD;
      estimated an incidence of chronic pain in the caesarean scar at 15% at 3 months and 11% at 1&#xD;
      year. The investigators can notice that the presence of chronic post-cesarean pain remained&#xD;
      stable over this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several risk factors have been identified, such as the presence of acute pain immediately&#xD;
      after surgery, the type of anesthesia, the type of surgical incision or a significant state&#xD;
      of anxiety before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators wish to assess the rate of chronic post-surgical pain in&#xD;
      scheduled cesarean sections (excluding emergencies) under spinal anesthesia as part of a ERAS&#xD;
      protocol. The investigatrors will also specify the type of pain and its impact on the daily&#xD;
      activities of young mothers and will assess the level of adherence of medical and paramedical&#xD;
      teams to the ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, the investigators will conduct a telephone survey with a&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess pain at 3 months and then 6 months after their cesarean section. The&#xD;
      pain studied is defined as being the pain at the level of the caesarean scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an innovative subject evaluating the impact of the implementation of an ERAS protocol&#xD;
      on chronic pain. Depending on the results, the investigators will be able to optimize the&#xD;
      prevention of chronic pain of cesarean section.&#xD;
