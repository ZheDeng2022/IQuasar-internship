    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical phase I single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study with open comparator is to investigate tolerability and safety as well as the&#xD;
      immunological effects of BM41 in comparison to placebo (double blind) and to a standard&#xD;
      subcutaneous immunotherapy Alutard SQ (open) in birch allergic patients.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of immunological responses during subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) with BM41 compared to placebo and to a conventional, standardized and registered birch pollen extract (Alutard SQ).The evaluation will be done by monitoring changes in serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels against recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1), BM41 and birch pollen extract. Serum will also be used in a so-called IgE facilitated allergen-binding assay (FAB) and in a rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL)-based histamine release test, to monitor the functional blocking antibody capacity of induced IgG/IgG4 antibodies.</description>
