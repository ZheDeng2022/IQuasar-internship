  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For an antiviral agent to act as an effective biological barrier on nasal mucosal surface,&#xD;
      the formulation preferably has to be maintained on the site of action for several hours, and&#xD;
      the nasal spray dispenser can be utilized for administering the solution to the upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract. A &quot;first-in-man&quot; clinical study of the nasal spray containing&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies derived from bovine colostrum was conducted. The study on healthy&#xD;
      volunteers was undertaken to evaluate how long the bovine antibodies would be maintained on&#xD;
      the nasopharyngeal surface after administration of nasal spray. In addition, the study&#xD;
      enabled to determine which of the two concentrations of antibodies should be used in the&#xD;
      final nasal-spray formulation. The volunteers were followed up for 4h after administration of&#xD;
      antibody spray and sampling was done at different time-points during this period. The&#xD;
      concentration of antibodies from patient samples was measured using ELISA analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, as this was a &quot;first-in-man&quot; study any adverse events following the administration&#xD;
      of spray were also monitored.&#xD;

      To test the nasal biological availability of the BioBlock® immunoglobulin preparation, 16&#xD;
      healthy volunteers were recruited in the phase 0 clinical trial. The study was conducted in&#xD;
      the premises of the Ear Clinic of Tartu University Hospital. The study protocol was approved&#xD;
      by Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu on March 17, 2021 (No 336/T-1).&#xD;
      Written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from&#xD;
      each healthy volunteer. The study group was divided into two subgroups where the individuals&#xD;
      were intranasally administered into both nostrils of BioBlock® formulation which contained&#xD;
      either 0.1 mg/mL or 0.2 mg/mL of the colostrum immunoglobulin preparation (n=8 in both study&#xD;
      groups). A filter paper with a volume capacity of 15 µL was placed on the medial nasal&#xD;
      surface using surgical forceps and it was kept on nasal mucosa for 10 minutes. Following this&#xD;
      the BioBlock was administered to the nasal cavity. The nasal mucosal sampling was done at 4&#xD;
      timepoints. The samples were analyzed using a Cow IgG ELISA kit.&#xD;
