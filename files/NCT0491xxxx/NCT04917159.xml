  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to examine whether group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in the&#xD;
      patient-caregiver dyads with Chronic Heart Failure is effective in improving dyadic&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, dyadic psychological symptoms, caregiver burden, the rate of&#xD;
      patient's readmission, and patient's self-care behavior in comparison with those dyads&#xD;
      receiving health education over three-month post intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex progressive debilitating illness characterized by&#xD;
      high morbidity and mortality with unpredictable course and frequent hospital readmissions.&#xD;
      Patients with CHF are often old with comorbid impaired psychosocial functioning, and worse&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which generate unavoidable increased dependence on&#xD;
      their family caregivers at home. The family caregivers often bear physical and psychological&#xD;
      challenges with declined HRQoL, maintaining interdependent relationships with their care&#xD;
      recipient when participating in CHF self-management. Dyadic interventions delivered to the&#xD;
      patients along with their family caregivers are successful to facilitate patients'&#xD;
      self-management to reduce patients' hospital readmission rates and improve HRQoL for both&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers post-discharge in the context of chronic disease management.&#xD;
      However, little attention has been paid to this vulnerable group. It is noteworthy that a&#xD;
      transdiagnostic psychological approach, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), aiming to&#xD;
      promote psychological flexibility, has demonstrated an ability to break through the&#xD;
      psychological barriers to meaningful living among clinical and non-clinical populations.&#xD;
      Existing evidence shows promising improvements of ACT on HRQoL in both patients with chronic&#xD;
      illness and the family caregivers of the patients with childhood illness. Such evidence&#xD;
      implies that ACT in the patient-caregiver dyads may be beneficial for HRQoL and other health&#xD;
      outcomes for both patients with CHF and their family caregivers. However, little has been&#xD;
      done to address these concerns in mainland China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot testing was to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting participants at the clinical&#xD;
      setting and the acceptability of group-based ACT to patient-caregiver dyads with CHF. Then, a&#xD;
      pragmatic, single-center, two-arm, parallel (in 1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be performed to examine the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy in&#xD;
      patient-caregiver dyads with CHF. Eligible patient-caregiver dyads will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either the intervention group or the control group. Assessments will be conducted before&#xD;
      the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention by blind&#xD;
      outcome assessors. The ACT intervention will be delivered by two facilitators and continually&#xD;
      supervised by an experienced ACT researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approvals were obtained from the university's Research Committees in Hong Kong&#xD;
      (reference number: HSEARS20210225006) and the study hospital in mainland China (reference&#xD;
      number: LC-2021-001).&#xD;

    <description>The ACT intervention was structured to take place over one month on a weekly basis. Each roughly 2-hour session will consist of a group-based ACT (1.5 hours) and a brief health education talk on CHF self-management (0.5 hours), the contents of which are the same as that offered to the control group. Each training session will serve about 7-8 dyads. In addition, each participant will receive one set of session handouts on CHF education, ACT skills, and a homework assignment at the beginning of each session.</description>

Each session will include a brief health education talk (0.5 hours), a section in which participants share their experiences (0.5 hours), a discussion of the main topics (0.5 hours), and a Q&amp;A section (0.5 hours) to evaluate the participant's understanding of the key concepts. Each session will be offered to 7-8 patient-caregiver dyads. In addition, each participant will receive session handouts on the main topic related to CHF self-management at the beginning of each session and will be invited to review them as homework assignments.</description>

    <description>The participants will learn 1) Mindfulness skills that promote changes in the relationship to the thoughts, feelings, action urges (E.g., depression, anxiety, caregiver burden, interpersonal difficulties, etc.) that can function as barriers to successful achieving better HRQoL for both patients and their caregivers. The skills such as mindfulness of breathing, listening and eating, leaves on the stream, and living-kindness exercise will be taught to patients and their family caregivers. Both conjoint and separated group-based formats will be provided. 2) Skills of values clarification and commitment to values-based actions allow individuals to reconnect with what is most important in their lives and promote value-based activities on health that reflect their internal motivators. The skills include values clarification, SMART goal setting for committed action. The rational bond between the patient and his/her family caregiver will be emphasized.</description>
