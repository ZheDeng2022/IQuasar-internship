      Design: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll outpatient subjects of either gender aged 12-18 old years with clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) within the first days after the&#xD;
      onset of the disease. The patients will be recruited during seasonal ARVI morbidity.&#xD;
      Collection of history, thermometry, objective examination, laboratory tests, recording&#xD;
      concomitant therapy will be made after parent/adoptive parent signing information sheet and&#xD;
      informed consent form for the child participation in the clinical study, for children ≥14&#xD;
      years old after signing patient information sheet and informed consent form for children ≥14&#xD;
      years old to participate in the clinical study. The severity of ARVI symptoms will be&#xD;
      evaluated with a 4-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR diagnosis and verification of respiratory viruses will be&#xD;
      performed prior to therapy to confirm the viral etiology of ARVI. To rule out the infection&#xD;
      caused by the new coronavirus COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019), a rapid test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antigen will be made. In case of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the physician will&#xD;
      act in accordance with the current version of the RF MoH Temporary methodological&#xD;
      recommendations &quot;Prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient meets all inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion criteria, at Visit&#xD;
      1 (Day 1), he/she will be randomized into one of two groups: patients of group 1 will take&#xD;
      Rafamin according to the dosage regimen for 5 days; patients of group 2 will take Placebo&#xD;
      using Rafamin 5-day regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use an electronic patient diary (EPD) for recording morning and evening&#xD;
      axillary body temperature (using a classic mercury-free thermometer) and disease symptoms&#xD;
      (Symptom Severity Score). Besides, antipyretic dosing (if applicable) and any deterioration&#xD;
      in a patient's condition (if applicable, for safety evaluation/AE documentation) will also be&#xD;
      recorded in a patient diary. The investigator will provide instructions on filling the diary.&#xD;
      At Visit 1 the parent/adoptive parent together with an investigator will record ARVI symptom&#xD;
      severity and body temperature in the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for 14 days (screening, randomization - up to 1 day, treatment&#xD;
      period - 5 days, follow-up - up to 2 days; deferred &quot;phone visit&quot; - day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment and follow-up period the patients/physicians will make 3 visits and the&#xD;
      fourth &quot;phone visit&quot; will be scheduled additionally: 1) visits by physician/patient - on Days&#xD;
      1, 5, and 7 (Visits 1, 2, and 3) - in a study center or at home; 2) &quot;phone visit&quot; (Visit 4) -&#xD;
      on Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visits 2 and 3, the investigator will perform an objective examination, document changes&#xD;
      in the symptoms and concomitant medications, and check patient diaries. At Visit 3 laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be performed and compliance will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Phone visit&quot; will be performed to interview parents/adoptive parents about the patient's&#xD;
      condition, presence/absence of secondary bacterial/viral complications, and use of&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, symptomatic therapy and therapy for their co-morbidities are allowed with&#xD;
      the exception of the drugs indicated in the section &quot;Prohibited Concomitant Treatment&quot;.&#xD;

    <description>Outcome Measure is evaluated on the basis of ARVI, confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), i.e virus detection.&#xD;
ARVI's resolution criteria: temperature ≤37.3°С + total symptom score (TSS) ≤2. Axillar temperature, 6 flu-like nonspecific symptoms (headache, chills, sweating, weakness, muscle pain, drowsiness), and 6 nasal/throat/chest symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, hoarseness, sore throat, cough) are registered for TSS according to the 4-point scale for each of them (0 = no symptom; 1 = mild symptom; 2 = moderate symptom; 3 = severe symptom). To calculate TSS absolute axillar temperature (in degrees Celsius) are converted to relative units (or points) using the following scale: ≤37.3 С=0 points; 37.4-38.0 С=1 point; 38.1-39.0 С=2 points; ≥39.1 С=3 points. The range of TSS is from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;39&quot;.</description>

    <description>The outcome measure is based on the area under the curve (AUC) for the TSS. AUC is calculated between 6 points (by TSS for every 6 days of the treatment and observation). The minimum value for the AUC is &quot;0&quot; and the maximum value was &quot;234&quot; units (day*score). Higher TSS and AUC scores meant worse results.</description>
