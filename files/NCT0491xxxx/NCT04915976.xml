  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the commonest form of valvular abnormality in the developed&#xD;
      world and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now widely practiced as in many&#xD;
      cases is the preferred treatment option over conventional aortic surgery. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that females have an apparent better outcome with TAVI than males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of possible reasons as to the apparent favourable benefit of TAVI in women&#xD;
      including: having both lower rates of moderate / severe aortic regurgitation and&#xD;
      peri-procedural mortality, lower rates of bleeding and renal failure, better patient&#xD;
      prosthesis match and recovery of left ventricular function with more favourable left&#xD;
      ventricular remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to explore the long term outcomes of TAVI between males and females to try and&#xD;
      identify specific tailored treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be useful in providing important information regarding gender differences in&#xD;
      patients who are treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Data provided will&#xD;
      include long term outcomes and predictors of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will then identify and implement strategies to improve outcomes in patients&#xD;
      being treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the commonest form of valvular abnormality in the developed&#xD;
      world and accounts for more than 40% of patients with native valvular disease with an&#xD;
      approximately equal prevalence in males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now widely practiced with treatment of over&#xD;
      300,000 patients worldwide. Many centres now regularly implant devices in patients for whom&#xD;
      conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) is deemed high or intermediate risk. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that females have an apparent better outcome with TAVI than males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous possible reasons as to the apparent favourable benefit of TAVI in women&#xD;
      including: having both lower rates of moderate / severe aortic regurgitation and&#xD;
      peri-procedural mortality, lower rates of bleeding and renal failure, better patient&#xD;
      prosthesis match and recovery of left ventricular function with more favourable left&#xD;
      ventricular remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer devices have reduced the introducer French size and are hence associated with reduced&#xD;
      rates of vascular and bleeding complications. This may translate to an even higher survival&#xD;
      benefit in female versus male patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with transfemoral&#xD;
      TAVI. In the current study we will aim to investigate gender temporal survival trends, and&#xD;
      complications including stroke and heart attack in aortic stenosis patients treated with&#xD;
      current versus older generation transcatheter valves. We have already been successful in&#xD;
      obtaining the periprocedural data from NICOR and and mortality data will be linked from NHS&#xD;
      digital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Compare the mid-long term survival of females versus males in patients with AS treated&#xD;
      with current versus older TAVI technologies. Study design In the current study, all patients&#xD;
      undergoing transfemoral TAVI in the UK (between 2007 and 2017) will be included.&#xD;
