  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess if personalized peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTATOC results in fewer adverse events than standard PRRT. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to either receive personalized or standard PRRT. Personalized PRRT will be determined based&#xD;
      on dosimetry calculations after the first cycle. In addition comparisons, will be made with&#xD;
      progression-free survival, serial CT imaging, ctDNA, and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 5 years or until they have progression and are switched to&#xD;
      another systemic treatment (not including treatment with somatostatin analogues).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall, 200 subjects will be randomized (1:1 randomization ratio) to receive standard&#xD;
      injected activities of 177Lu-DOTATOC PRRT or personalized injection of 177Lu-DOTATOC PRRT.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified for grade and primary location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase: Subjects will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Screening by SSR imaging will be completed to determine expression of SSR and feasibility of&#xD;
      treatment by PRRT. Once eligibility has been confirmed they will be randomized. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a physical exam, complete a medical history questionnaire, quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, blood work, and a diagnostic CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase: During the treatment phase, subjects will undergo 4 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle will be followed by 2 dosimetry SPECT/CT scans on day 1 (18 - 32 hours&#xD;
      after treatment administration) and day 2 (64 - 80h after treatment administration) After&#xD;
      cycle 3 quality of life questionnaires will be completed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Phase: At the end of treatment or after discontinuation of any cause, subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for 5 years to continue data collection for the other objectives. Objective&#xD;
      tumour response will be assessed every 6 months by diagnostic CT according to the RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
