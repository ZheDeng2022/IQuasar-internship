    <textblock>
      Teeth extraction is one of the commonly preformed procedures in the dental clinics, and one&#xD;
      of the most important precautions followed during the different techniques of teeth&#xD;
      extraction is tissue preservation and the avoidance of tissue trauma. So, for the&#xD;
      preservation of bone and tissues integrity and elimination of post operative pain and&#xD;
      discomfort, atraumatic extraction techniques are presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A claim has risen that due to its thin tips which is inserted vertically to the PDL avoiding&#xD;
      the leveraging forces caused by conventional elevators, Periotome will aid in the reduction&#xD;
      of soft tissue injury and the preservation of bone integrity. While Piezotome which is a&#xD;
      newer and innovative device using ultrasonic vibrations mainly for the purpose of osteotomy&#xD;
      is considered very efficient due to its selective cutting and being inert against soft&#xD;
      tissues, including nerves and blood vessels. leading to lesser cell necrosis and faster bone&#xD;
      regeneration providing a minimally invasive atraumatic extraction technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And with the rapid development of implantology and painless dentistry, the demands on more&#xD;
      efficient, minimally invasive and more durable atraumatic extraction techniques has&#xD;
      increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare between periotome and piezotome in terms of efficiency and&#xD;
      durability in procedures of simple extractions as an alternative atraumatic extraction&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

    <description>Dental instrument used to perform atraumatic dental extraction.&#xD;
After the initial de attachment, the periotome was inserted between the root and the bone parallel to the long axis of the root and pushed apically to the maximum depth that the tissue allowes severing the PDL and leaving it for 10-15 seconds allowing the biomechanical creep to occur.&#xD;
This proses is repeated at different points of entries at all the different surfaces of the tooth.</description>
