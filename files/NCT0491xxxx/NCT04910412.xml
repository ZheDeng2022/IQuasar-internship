      The result from the previous studies of Water in 1994 regarding the ambulation status of&#xD;
      patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) for a period of 1 year after injury. It was found that&#xD;
      76% of incomplete paraplegia and 46 % of incomplete tetraplegia can recovery their walking&#xD;
      ability to become community ambulators. However, the recovery rate gradually decreased and&#xD;
      started to hit the plateau level around 9 months post injury or in chronic phase. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is a challenge in rehabilitation to restore their functions such as walking which is a&#xD;
      primary goal of functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity-based rehabilitation therapy (ABRT) (such as locomotion training) is an intensive&#xD;
      intervention that has the potential to promote neurological recovery and enhance walking&#xD;
      ability in individual with incomplete SCI. Although, ABRT showed positive results in motor&#xD;
      function recovery in incomplete SCI survivors, it may not be able to promote full recovery,&#xD;
      especially in chronic patients. Recent studies showed that the combination of training with&#xD;
      top-down approach may be an option that could promote motor recovery after SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      that is currently being used as an add-on treatment in neurorehabilitation. tDCS over the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex has been shown to modulate neural activity at both cortical and spinal&#xD;
      levels. It also produce an after-effect in modulating neuronal synaptic plasticity and&#xD;
      increasing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Early tDCS studies&#xD;
      have shown that increasing stimulation intensity or duration within certain limits enhances&#xD;
      tDCS efficacy: while anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability, cathodal stimulation&#xD;
      decreases it. The application of tDCS is to place the electrode in a specific montage on the&#xD;
      decided target brain area and deliver the low-intensity current pass through that brain area&#xD;
      for neural modulation during or after providing a rehabilitation program. Previous studies of&#xD;
      the application of tDCS showed that applying of tDCS on primary motor cortex with intensity&#xD;
      of 2 milliampere (mA) for 10-20 minutes combined with rehabilitation can enhance lower limb&#xD;
      performance such as knee strength, ankle movement, and sit to stand performance in people&#xD;
      with stroke as well as walking speed in people with Parkinson's disease. According to result&#xD;
      from those previous studies can revealed that the combination of rehabilitation with&#xD;
      modulation of corticospinal excitability can enhance lower limb performance in individual&#xD;
      with neurological condition. In individuals with incomplete SCI, the excitability of the&#xD;
      preserved corticospinal pathways is reduced which can affect the control of their motor&#xD;
      skills and motor recovery. Several studies reported positive effect of anodal tDCS combined&#xD;
      with training in individuals with incomplete SCI, however most of studies focused on upper&#xD;
      limb function. Only few studies on the outcome of lower limb function and walking ability,&#xD;
      which are required to return to their daily living and thus increase in quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL). Moreover, most of studies in the lower limb were conducted in a small sample size and&#xD;
      reported inconclusive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the effects of combining anodal&#xD;
      tDCS with gait training for 5 consecutive session in people with incomplete SCI can improve&#xD;
      lower limb performance consist of gait performance(spatiotemporal), dynamic balance(time up&#xD;
      and go test), sit to stand performance (5 times of sit to stand test) and QOL after a&#xD;
      prolonged period of follow-up at 1-month and 2-month compare to control group of sham tDCS&#xD;
      with gait training.&#xD;
