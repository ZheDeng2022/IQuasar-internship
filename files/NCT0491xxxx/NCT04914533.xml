  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canker sores, also called aphthous ulcers, are small, shallow lesions that develop on the&#xD;
      soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores don't&#xD;
      occur on the surface of your lips and they aren't contagious. They can be painful, however,&#xD;
      and can make eating and talking difficult. Recurrent aphthous ulcer stomatitis (RAS) is&#xD;
      characterized by recurrent bouts of solitary or multiple shallow painful ulcers, at intervals&#xD;
      of a few months to a few days in patients who are otherwise well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) sometimes known as Low Level Light Therapy or&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a low-intensity light therapy. The effect is photochemical not&#xD;
      thermal. The light triggers biochemical changes within cells and can be compared to the&#xD;
      process of photosynthesis in plants, where the photons are absorbed by cellular&#xD;
      photoreceptors, which trigger chemical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main medical usage of LLLT is for pain and inflammation reduction, promoting the&#xD;
      regeneration of different tissues and preventing damage to tissues. With the use of the&#xD;
      appropriate power (from 5 to 200mW) and wavelength (600-900nm), the therapy brings&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic results aiding in wound healing. The mechanism of action of&#xD;
      LLLT may be very beneficial in the treatment of oral erosions and ulcers, however, very few&#xD;
      studies have been performed on the treatment of RAS with LLLT. There are few reports on&#xD;
      accelerated healing in erosive mucocutaneous disorders and they are often presented as a case&#xD;
      series rather than large randomized clinical trials. The effects on skin wound healing and&#xD;
      periodontal inflammation management with laser biostimulation suggest that this treatment&#xD;
      modality may also be useful for oral erosive conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect of the Luminance RED device on the management&#xD;
      of RAS.&#xD;
