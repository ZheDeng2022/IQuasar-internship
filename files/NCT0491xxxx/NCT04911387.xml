    <textblock>
      Self-tonometry with iCare Home is regularly performed at Sankt Erik's Eye Hospital since a&#xD;
      few years back. The purpose of this study was to show that the eye pressure measurements made&#xD;
      with iCare® Home by patients / relatives do not vary more than those made with the standard&#xD;
      method, Goldman applanation tonometry (GAT), by different healthcare professionals. This will&#xD;
      hopefully confirm the usefulness of self-tonometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since a few years back, self-tonometry with iCare® Home has been available in glaucoma care.&#xD;
      Sankt Erik's Eye Hospital was first in Sweden to use the new technology. Several studies have&#xD;
      shown good agreement between measurements made by patients or healthcare professionals with&#xD;
      iCare® Home and Goldman applanation tonometry (GAT). However, some researchers raise critical&#xD;
      voices about the reliability of iCare® Home measurements because they can differ from GAT.&#xD;
      GAT is considered the gold standard method of tonometry to which all other instruments are&#xD;
      compared. But like all other methods, GAT has some limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the clinic, the eye pressure is usually measured with GAT by different staff&#xD;
      (ophthalmological nurses, opticians or doctors) from visit to visit. This can sometimes lead&#xD;
      to pressure variations that may affect the follow-up of glaucoma patients. This raises the&#xD;
      question of whether the difference between GAT and iCare® Home is statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to show that the eye pressure measurements made with iCare®&#xD;
      Home by patients / relatives do not vary more than those made with the standard method GAT by&#xD;
      different healthcare professionals. This will hopefully confirm the usefulness of&#xD;
      self-tonometry.&#xD;
