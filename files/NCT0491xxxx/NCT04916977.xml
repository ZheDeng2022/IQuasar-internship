             severe/fatal outcomes if earlier, can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent to undergo in the cross-sectional protocol clinical visit and&#xD;
             to retrospectively collect genetic/clinical data. In case of deceased or untraceable&#xD;
             patients, the written informed consent is not required to collect retrospective&#xD;
             clinical data (excluding genetic data).&#xD;
