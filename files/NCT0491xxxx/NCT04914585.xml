  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT scans of the spine include vertebrae, intervertebral discs and the spinal cord. These&#xD;
      tests are performed in an orderly protocol and allow for three-dimensional reconstruction of&#xD;
      the vertebra in sagittal and coronal guides.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spinal surgery, there are a number of navigation technologies based on CT scans performed&#xD;
      before surgery (or during surgery) and identify the vertebrae (using special photographs or&#xD;
      markers on the spine), such as Mazor with the Renaissance Robotic Surgical System used in&#xD;
      hospitals, or BrianLab Which uses non-robotic navigation and is based on a marker located on&#xD;
      the patient's back. These technologies are not optimal, and have a number of significant&#xD;
      drawbacks: Because during spinal surgery, there is a displacement, the level of accuracy&#xD;
      decreases as the surgery progresses. In addition, there is extensive use of radiation in&#xD;
      these means since in many cases CT is performed before and during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, in the age of optical detection, it is possible to detect three-dimensional structures&#xD;
      in photography and allow high levels of accuracy (less than 0.5 mm). Optical scanning does&#xD;
      not include radiation and lasts the entire length of the operation. Of the patient and of the&#xD;
      treating staff.&#xD;
