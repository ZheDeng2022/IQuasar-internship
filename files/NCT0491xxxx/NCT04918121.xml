  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, which will include approximately five eyes of 5 patients. This study&#xD;
      proposes that a sustained release steroid insert (Yutiq)1 be implanted along with a glaucoma&#xD;
      drainage device (Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) Model FP7) when the patient is undergoing&#xD;
      glaucoma tube implant surgery or combined glaucoma tube implant and cataract surgery. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy (controlling intraocular&#xD;
      pressure) of the Yutiq inserts to reduce post-operative scarring in surgical glaucoma&#xD;
      patients. It is expected that post-operative week 12 onwards there will be a clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant lower IOP in the study eyes than eyes in a group undergoing the&#xD;
      same surgery without the Yutiq insert. The estimated duration of the present study is 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
