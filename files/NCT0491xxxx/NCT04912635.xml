    <description>Neo is a smartphone-based dashboard application that utilizes concepts from behavioral science and health psychology to support patients to improve their adherence to therapy. This is done through behavior change techniques and intervention functions (Michie, Atkins &amp; West, 2014). This app is designed to prompt participants' self-regulation of lifestyle and health behaviors, to support adherence to therapy. Such self-regulation of lifestyle behaviors is informed by presenting health metric data (through wearables, myAir (biofeedback) and self-report), in an easy to understand dashboard platform on the app. Participants will be asked to use their PAP device (as normal), use a Withings blood pressure cuff and activity monitor. This data is brought into the Neo app through an API Exchange gateway. This data will be presented to the participant and communicated in an easy to understand way.</description>
