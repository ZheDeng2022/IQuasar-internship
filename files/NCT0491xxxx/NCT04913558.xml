      The study aims to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on stress and fatigue of employed&#xD;
      lactating women. This study will be carried out on Sixty lactating mothers working in the&#xD;
      medical field who have returned to work after maternity leave and suffering from stress and&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be divided randomly into two groups equal in number, the Aerobic exercise&#xD;
      group ( group A) and the Control group ( group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will consist of thirty employed lactating women suffering from stress and fatigue.&#xD;
      These women will perform aerobic exercise for 30 minutes for each session, 5 times per week,&#xD;
      for 6 weeks in the form of treadmill training (60- 70% of HR max) and do some modifications&#xD;
      of their routine by following lifestyle modification advice given to them during the 6 weeks&#xD;
      of the program period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (group B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group will consist of thirty employed lactating women suffering from stress and fatigue.&#xD;
      This group will receive the same lifestyle modification advice that will be given to group&#xD;
      (A) during the six weeks of the program period.&#xD;
