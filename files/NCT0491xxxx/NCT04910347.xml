    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of nivolumab for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients&#xD;
      with residual disease after standard chemoradiotherapy is not known. In this study, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate the role of nivolumab in locally advanced NPC after chemoradiotherapy the safety&#xD;
      profile and antitumor activity of the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, nivolumab after in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;

      Dosage within 12 weeks after the end of concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Nivolumab 360mg&#xD;
      Intravenously administered every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consolidation regimen, administration of Nivolumab is administered for up to a total of&#xD;
      1 year until disease progression or unacceptable to toxicity occurs.&#xD;
