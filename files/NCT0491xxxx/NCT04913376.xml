  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether constant cooling of the hands and feet using Hilotherm&#xD;
      ChemoCare devices reduces the incidence of (severe) oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      and pain compared to standard care (i.e. no hand and foot cooling) in patients with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors.&#xD;

    <measure>Time until Grade 2 or higher patient-reported peripheral neuropathy after start of treatment in the first 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-event analysis of Grade 2 or higher patient-reported peripheral neuropathy (severity scale, based on a patient-reported outcome questionnaire: &quot;Patient-Reported Outcomes for Adverse Events&quot; (PRO-CTCAE)). Outcome measurement value: percentage, absolute number, grade number.&#xD;
-- PRO-CTCAE: patient-reported outcome scale that assesses adverse events (e.g. &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;numbness &amp; tingling&quot;) on severity (5-point Likert scale 0 = &quot;None&quot;, 1 = &quot;Mild&quot;, 2 = &quot;Moderate&quot;, 3 = &quot;Severe&quot;, 4 = &quot;Very severe&quot;) and interference with daily activities (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot;, 1 = &quot;A little bit&quot;, 2 = &quot;Somewhat&quot;, 3 = &quot;Quite a bit&quot;, 4 = &quot;Very much&quot;). We use the scale to assess the current experienced symptoms, and the scale has been translated to Dutch.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Outcome Measures regarding peripheral neuropathy (pro-ctcae)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-event analysis and longitudinal analysis of a patient-reported outcome questionnaire (based on PRO-CTCAE: 4 items) and analysis of clinical decision-making to assess the incidence, severity and interference of peripheral neuropathy. Outcome measurement value: percentage, absolute number, grade number. This will be used to assess the cut-off point for the severity and interference experienced due to neuropathy.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Outcome Measures regarding peripheral neuropathy (eortc-qlq-cipn20)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-event analysis and longitudinal analysis of a PRO questionnaire (based on &quot;European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire - Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 items&quot; (EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20)) and analysis of clinical decision-making to assess the incidence, severity and interference of peripheral neuropathy. Outcome measurement value: percentage, absolute number; to assess the degree of neuropathy in a more detailed way in comparison to the PRO-CTCAE.&#xD;
-- EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20: PRO scale that assesses 20 items (sensory (9), motor (8), autonomic symptoms (3)) with the use of a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;A little&quot;, 3 = &quot;Quite a bit&quot;, 4 = &quot;Very much&quot;). We use the scale to assess the current experienced symptoms, and the scale has been translated to Dutch. Sum score will be calculated by item 1-18 (item 19: driving ability; item 20: male impotence; seperate assessment).</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive analysis of a patient-reported outcome questionnaire to assess comfort and compliance of hilotherapy. Outcome measurement value: percentage, absolute number. Self-developed 5-point Likert scale to assess patient experiences with three items: hilotherapy cuffs, tolerance of temperature and impact on mobility during chemotherapy (1 = &quot;Very difficult&quot;, 2 = &quot;Difficult&quot;, 3 = &quot;Neutral&quot;, 4 = &quot;Comfortable&quot;, 5 = &quot;Very comfortable&quot;), and one specific question regarding patient experiences with the impact of hilotherapy on their experiences of numbness &amp; tingling and pain during the administration of hilotherapy (1 = &quot;More severe&quot;, 2 = &quot;Less severe&quot;, 3 = &quot;Same experiences&quot;, 4 = &quot;No present experiences of numbness &amp; tingling and pain&quot;).</description>
