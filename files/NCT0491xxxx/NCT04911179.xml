  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial of 310 older adults over 75 years old recruited from the Falls&#xD;
      Units of Geriatric Departments in 4 three University Hospitals in Spain (Pamplona, San&#xD;
      Sebastián, Albacete and Barcelona). Participants who met inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to the usual care group (Otago exercise program) or the Vivifrail-Cog Intervention&#xD;
      (a combination of physical exercise Vivifrail program and cognitive training). The main&#xD;
      objective of the present randomized clinical trial is to investigate the effect of the&#xD;
      combined intervention (exercise and cognitive intervention) in frail older participants&#xD;
      living in the community and at risk of falling. The main endpoint will be the rate of falling&#xD;
      in the following year. Secondary endpoints include physical performance, muscle strength,&#xD;
      cognitive performance, hospitalizations, institutionalization, depression and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usual care: subjects randomized to the usual care group will receive an evidence-based&#xD;
      multidisciplinary intervention tailored at reducing the fall risk (polypharmacy,&#xD;
      environmental intervention, physical exercise). Importantly, the Otago exercise program&#xD;
      (considered the standard physical exercise intervention) will be prescribed in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: subjects assigned to this intervention will engage in a multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention combining an exercise program, Vivifrail (A practical guide for prescribing a&#xD;
      Multicomponent Physical Training Program to prevent weakness and falls in people over 70,&#xD;
      more information at www.vivifrail.com) and a cognitive training. Vivifrail exercise program&#xD;
      combines resistance, endurance, balance and flexibility exercise tailored to the functional&#xD;
      level of the subjects, guaranteeing an individualized approach. Exercises progress in terms&#xD;
      of intensity and difficulty as the subject adapts to exercise. The cognitive stimulation&#xD;
      program combines exercises to work on different cognitive functions, mainly addressing&#xD;
      executive functions (attentional system, processing speed, perceptual organization, working&#xD;
      memory and cognitive flexibility, verbal comprehension, abstraction and reasoning, planning,&#xD;
      execution and problem solving ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It lasts 12 weeks, two weekly sessions. It is divided into 4 levels in order to adapt the&#xD;
      intervention to participant's individual capacity, and the level can be adjusted throughout&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct execution will be monitored by constant contact with relatives in charge of&#xD;
      supervising the exercise program, who will be familiarized with the intervention prior to&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

FES-I was developed as part of the Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) project from 2003 to 2006, following an intensive review of fear of falling, self-efficacy and balance confidence questionnaires. It ascertains the impact that fear of falling has on 16 activities of daily living. Scores range from 16 to 64 and classify the fear of falling as low (16-19), moderate (20-27) and high (28-64) concern.</description>
