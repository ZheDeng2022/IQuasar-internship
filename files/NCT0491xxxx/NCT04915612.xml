    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of liposomal cytarabine,&#xD;
      daunorubicin, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin in treating pediatric patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia that has returned after treatment (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs, such as liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, called gemtuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab attaches&#xD;
      to CD33 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Giving&#xD;
      liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin may help to control the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of liposomal cytarabine and&#xD;
      daunorubicin (CPX-351) in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in relapsed refractory&#xD;
      pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by overall response (OR), including&#xD;
      complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery and partial remission),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR) of pediatric&#xD;
      patients treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment with this combination and&#xD;
      its impact in long-term outcome (OS and EFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of the level of pre-treatment expression of CD33 with response to&#xD;
      this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of this treatment combination on responding pediatric patients&#xD;
      transitioning to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) i.e., number and percentage of&#xD;
      patients that are able to transition to HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION 1 (28 days): Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 and GO IV over 2 hours on day 1 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION 2: Patients who do not attain a defined clinical response after cycle Induction 1&#xD;
      receive CPX-351 IV on days 1 and 3 and GO IV over 2 hours on day 1 in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 4 weeks after last induction, patients receive CPX-351 IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 3 and GO IV over 2 hours on day 1 in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.&#xD;
