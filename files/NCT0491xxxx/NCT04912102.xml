  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is commonly performed under deep&#xD;
      sedation to provide amnesia, comfort, and optimal procedural conditions. However, anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs commonly used such as midazolam and/or propofol and opioids for sedative endoscopy in&#xD;
      clinical practice may depress normal ventilation by blunting central chemoreceptor&#xD;
      responsiveness to CO2, and alveolar hypoventilation and predispose patients to upper airway&#xD;
      obstruction; all of that can result in hypoxemia, hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis,&#xD;
      hypotension, and, in rare cases, brain injury or death.(1-3)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of hypoxia during ERCP with sedation has been reported to range from 16.2 to&#xD;
      39.2% (4) may be because ERCP procedures can be lengthy and are often performed in the prone&#xD;
      position.(5) Hypoxemia is the most common adverse cardiopulmonary complication during sedated&#xD;
      endoscopy and is caused by respiratory depression, airway obstruction, and decreased chest&#xD;
      wall compliance. (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients are particularly at risk of upper airway obstruction and hypoxemia under&#xD;
      sedation and may benefit from Conventional CPAP, applied nasally to improve ventilation and&#xD;
      oxygenation during spontaneous ventilation in patients under deep sedation through&#xD;
      maintenance of upper airway patency.(6) Recently novel techniques have been shown to be more&#xD;
      effectively help ventilation than conventional low flow nasal oxygen. High flow nasal oxygen&#xD;
      (HFNO) has been utilized in the intensive care setting for over 15 years. Its use in&#xD;
      anaesthesia is rapidly increasing, providing an alternative to low flow oxygen devices during&#xD;
      sedation for procedures such as gastroenterology, non-invasive cardiological, radiological,&#xD;
      emergency medicine and persistent pain procedures.(1) Multiple mechanisms account for the&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of HFNO, including a reduction in dead space, increased positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure, increased functional residual capacity, and delivery of higher&#xD;
      inspired oxygen concentrations to the distal airways.(7) Moreover the heated and humidified&#xD;
      HFNO provides adequate oxygenation with less drying of the upper airway mucosa, thereby&#xD;
      improving patient comfort.(8) The use of HFNO in the gastroenterological suite had reduced&#xD;
      critical incidents by providing high-inspired oxygen and slowing carbon dioxide rises related&#xD;
      to respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining patient safety while successfully completing the procedures under sedation&#xD;
      requires careful monitoring. Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA)&#xD;
      Guidelines on Monitoring during Anaesthesia, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great&#xD;
      Britain &amp; Ireland (AAGBI) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Standards for Basic&#xD;
      Anesthetic Monitoring had all emphasized the importance of monitoring exhaled Co2 during&#xD;
      moderate to deep sedation to improve patients' safety. (9) Monitoring EtCO2 for the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist is more superior to the pulse oximeter for immediately detecting an&#xD;
      obstructed airway, opiate-induced apnea, or other airway problems that only much later may be&#xD;
      detected by the pulse oximeter.(9) Unfortunately, it would be expected that the high oxygen&#xD;
      flow rates during HFNO would severely dilute expired carbon dioxide and make sampling&#xD;
      impossible.&#xD;
