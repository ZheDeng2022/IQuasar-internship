      The purpose of this study is to make a dialectical classification of patients who will&#xD;
      receive 131I treatment after operation of thyroid cancer from the point of view of dialectics&#xD;
      of syndrome elements of traditional Chinese medicine. By observing the changes of TSH among&#xD;
      patients with different syndrome types, investigators can better understand the reasons for&#xD;
      the differences in TSH changes among patients. Thus, it provides a basis for putting forward&#xD;
      the scheme of stopping taking levothyroxine before iodine treatment, improving the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients after radical thyroidectomy, and providing reference for individualized&#xD;
      guidance of the timing of radioactive iodine therapy for patients after DTC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is a common thyroid tumor. In the past few decades, the incidence of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer in most parts of the world has increased steadily year by year. At present, the best&#xD;
      treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer at home and abroad is surgery + radioactive&#xD;
      iodine + thyroid hormone replacement inhibition.131I therapy, as an important adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy for patients with DTC, can effectively remove the residual thyroid tissue and&#xD;
      unresectable local and distant metastatic lesions during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is considered that the level of TSH and the time of thyroid hormone withdrawal are&#xD;
      important factors affecting the efficacy of radioiodine therapy, and there is a close&#xD;
      relationship between the two factors. Clinically, investigators also observed that TSH&#xD;
      changes were different in patients who were about to receive iodine treatment after DTC&#xD;
      during the withdrawal of thyroxine. In some patients, TSH levels rise rapidly in a short&#xD;
      period of time, while others rise slowly. For patients with rapid increase of TSH (sometimes&#xD;
      even more than 100uIU/ml), it may promote tumor growth, recurrence and recessive metastasis.&#xD;
      Patients with slow rise of TSH may need to constantly review thyroid function until reaching&#xD;
      the standard, which brings inconvenience to patients, and withdrawal of drugs for too long&#xD;
      will affect patients' physical, psychological and living conditions, resulting in patient&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the dialectical classification of TCM syndrome factors was carried out in the&#xD;
      patients before radioiodine therapy after DTC. After collecting the patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided into two groups according to TSH ≤&#xD;
      30uIU/mL and TSH &gt; 30uIU/mL on the 14th day. The TCM syndrome elements and other clinical&#xD;
      information of each group were collected respectively. Investigators will observe the changes&#xD;
      of TSH in patients with different types of TCM syndrome factors, and gain a deeper&#xD;
      understanding of the reasons for the differences in TSH changes. Investigators hope to&#xD;
      provide a basis for putting forward a plan to stop thyroxine before iodine therapy, to&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of postoperative patients with thyroid cancer, and to provide a&#xD;
      reference for individualized guidance of the timing of radioactive iodine therapy for&#xD;
      patients after DTC.&#xD;
