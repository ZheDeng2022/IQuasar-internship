    <textblock>
      An evaluation and validation study on oral cancer screening methods will be carried out, and&#xD;
      two different methods will be used for oral cancer screening among the population. The two&#xD;
      different methods are: (1) clinical observation (including inspection and palpation) combined&#xD;
      with pathological biopsy. (2) Clinical observation (including inspection and palpation), in&#xD;
      vivo staining (toluidine blue) combined with pathological biopsy. By evaluating and comparing&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of the two screening methods, the more effective oral cancer&#xD;
      screening method will be selected.&#xD;

      An evaluation and validation study on oral cancer screening methods will be carried out, and&#xD;
      two different methods will be used for oral cancer screening among the population. The two&#xD;
      different methods are: (1) clinical observation (including inspection and palpation) combined&#xD;
      with pathological biopsy. That is, inspecting and palpating the oral cavity and neck of the&#xD;
      screened object. If positive lesions are found, then further pathological biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed. This is also the commonly used screening method for oral cancer now; (2) Clinical&#xD;
      observation (including inspection and palpation), in vivo staining (toluidine blue) combined&#xD;
      with pathological biopsy. That is, toluidine blue staining is performed at the same time as&#xD;
      the inspection and palpation of the oral cavity and neck of the screening object. As long as&#xD;
      the screening subjects found positive lesions or abnormal living body staining, pathological&#xD;
      biopsy was performed. By evaluating and comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the two&#xD;
      screening methods, the more effective oral cancer screening method will be selected. Finally,&#xD;
      we will carry out prospective controlled population studies in high-risk areas and&#xD;
      non-high-risk areas to further evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of screening method&#xD;
      after selection.&#xD;
