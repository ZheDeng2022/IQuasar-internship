  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign gallbladder disease, including acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis, biliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia, and biliary colic, is very common, with over 300,000 surgical cholecystectomies&#xD;
      performed per year in the US. Unfortunately, complication rates in elderly patients or&#xD;
      patients with many comorbidities are high. These patients are often managed with percutaneous&#xD;
      tube drainage of the gallbladder (percutaneous cholecystostomy). The recurrence rate of&#xD;
      calculous cholecystitis after cholecystostomy tube removal is as high as 35% at 1 year. These&#xD;
      patients are thus faced with permanent cholecystostomy tube drainage, high-risk surgery, or&#xD;
      cholecystostomy tube removal and risk of repeat cholecystitis. Gallbladder cryoablation is an&#xD;
      alternative to surgical cholecystectomy which is performed percutaneously and does not&#xD;
      require general anesthesia. Published evidence on the outcomes of gallbladder cryoablation is&#xD;
      however limited at this point in time. The purpose of the proposed study is to follow the&#xD;
      outcomes of high-risk patients who undergo gallbladder cryoablation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the outcomes of gallbladder cryoablation&#xD;
      in high-risk surgical candidates with benign gallbladder disease (acute cholecystitis,&#xD;
      chronic cholecystitis, biliary dyskinesia, biliary colic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of gallbladder cryoablation in high-risk surgical&#xD;
      candidates. Patients who undergo gallbladder cryoablation will be followed long-term&#xD;
      according to standard of care. This includes scheduled clinic follow up, laboratory analysis,&#xD;
      and imaging as needed. We hypothesize that gallbladder cryoablation is a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for high-risk surgical patients with benign gallbladder disease. Clinically, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients will be free from any clinical symptoms or signs after gallbladder&#xD;
      cryoablation and removal of a cholecystostomy tube. These include, but are not limited to&#xD;
      right upper quadrant pain, fever, chills, and jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the imaging changes seen in the gallbladder after cryoablation. Imaging is&#xD;
      part of routine follow up after percutaneous ablation and may include CT, MRI, and nuclear&#xD;
      medicine studies as needed. We hypothesize that after cryoablation, patients will be&#xD;
      functionally acholecystic, which occlusion of the cystic duct and involution and fibrosis of&#xD;
      the gallbladder demonstrated by imaging.&#xD;
