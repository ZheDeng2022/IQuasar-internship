  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to improve clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of patients with chronic schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia too.&#xD;
      Whether combined treatment of an NMDA-enhancing agent and a drug with anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      property can be better than an NMDA-enhancing agent alone deserves study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and inflammatory hypotheses have been&#xD;
      implicated in schizophrenia. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able&#xD;
      to augment efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia. In addition,&#xD;
      several drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have been tested in clinical trials for the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia too. Whether a drug with anti-inflammatory property can strengthen&#xD;
      the efficacy of an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of schizophrenia remains unknow.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with anti-inflammatory property and&#xD;
      NMDAE plus placebo in the treatment of schizophrenia. The subjects are the patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have responded poorly to two or more kinds of&#xD;
      antipsychotics treatment. They keep their original treatment and are randomly, double-blindly&#xD;
      assigned into two treatment groups for 12 weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Anti-inflammatory Agent&#xD;
      (AIFA), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at&#xD;
      weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of&#xD;
      treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacies of NMDAE plus AIFA and NMDAE plus placebo&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical&#xD;
      variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous&#xD;
      variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure&#xD;
      assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values&#xD;
      for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
