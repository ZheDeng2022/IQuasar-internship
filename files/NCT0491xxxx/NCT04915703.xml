  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is a drainage method for biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. Patients with a PTBD catheter often need multiple re-interventions because of&#xD;
      symptoms of catheter obstruction such as pain, jaundice, pruritus, leakage and/or fever. The&#xD;
      onset of these symptoms results in hospital visits, opening of the external catheter of an&#xD;
      internal external PTBD and re-interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that daily flushing of an internal external biliary catheter will increase the&#xD;
      time-to-symptom-onset.&#xD;

      Bile is synthesized and secreted by the liver and transported into the peripheral bile ducts,&#xD;
      to the left or right hepatic duct which join together in the common hepatic duct and more&#xD;
      distally in the common bile duct. Secreted bile is stored in the gall bladder. During a meal,&#xD;
      the bile is secreted into the duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstruction of the biliary tract will result in cholestasis with symptoms as jaundice and&#xD;
      pruritus and cholangitis in case of infection, usually related to prior biliary intervention.&#xD;
      Causes of biliary obstruction are benign or malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is a drainage method for biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. The procedure starts with percutaneous puncture under fluoroscopic or ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance and cannulation of the peripheral biliary tree, which is confirmed by contrast&#xD;
      injection in the biliary tree. The needle will be exchanged for a guidewire which can be&#xD;
      advanced into the biliary tract. When the correct position is reached, a drainage catheter&#xD;
      with side holes is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of PTBD techniques: placement of an external biliary drain and placement&#xD;
      of an internal external biliary drain. The external biliary drain is positioned in the bile&#xD;
      duct above a stenosis and drains the bile externally into a bag outside the patient. Capping&#xD;
      of an external biliary drain will stop the drainage of bile into the bag and forces the bile&#xD;
      to drain towards the digestive tract. The internal external biliary drain is placed in the&#xD;
      bile duct and the tip of the internal external biliary drain is localised in the duodenum&#xD;
      allowing both bile flow through the drain to the digestive tract (internal) or into the bag&#xD;
      (external). Capping of an internal external biliary drain will stop the external drainage and&#xD;
      results in internal drainage only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of PTBD are bleeding (usually during or shortly after the procedure), infection&#xD;
      (cholangitis, abscess, peritonitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis), catheter obstruction and&#xD;
      catheter dislocation(1). Catheter obstruction will result in cholestasis resulting in&#xD;
      jaundice, drain leakage and finally cholangitis. The exact prevalence of PTBD catheter&#xD;
      obstruction is not described in literature, however the prevalence of cholangitis in patients&#xD;
      with a PTBD catheter is reported as high as 59%(2). Subsequently, the PTBD catheter often&#xD;
      needs a revision (re-intervention), i.e. exchanging the catheter for a new one. If catheter&#xD;
      obstruction is assessed during re-intervention, attempts can be made to remove the&#xD;
      obstruction or the obstructed PTBD catheter can be exchanged for a new PTBD catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After PTBD catheter placement, flushing of the PTBD catheter is not standard protocol in our&#xD;
      center. In clinical practice, when obstruction of PTBD catheter occurs, we advise patients to&#xD;
      start with daily flushing of the PTBD catheter which we believe will decrease the extent of&#xD;
      obstruction and omits re-intervention. We performed a literature search and we did not find&#xD;
      any clinical trial on the efficacy of flushing of PTBD catheters. Guidelines of the Society&#xD;
      of Interventional Radiology on percutaneous biliary drainage do not mention flushing of the&#xD;
      catheter(1). We did find some publications in which an advice with regard to flushing of a&#xD;
      PTBD catheter was mentioned, however without any scientific substantiation(3-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no scientific evidence for or against PTBD catheter flushing. Flushing is a simple,&#xD;
      low-cost and low-risk procedure. Complications or side-effects of PTBD catheter flushing are&#xD;
      not reported in literature. PTBD re-interventions on the other hand are associated with risks&#xD;
      and are invalidating for the patient. We hypothesize that daily flushing of an internal&#xD;
      external biliary catheter will increase the time-to-symptom-onset requiring hospital visits&#xD;
      and re-interventions in this patient group.&#xD;
