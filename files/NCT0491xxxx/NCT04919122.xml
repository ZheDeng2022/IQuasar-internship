      This trial is a prospective, observational Phase IV study is to understand the cancer&#xD;
      management and health-related quality of life in patients with mRCC in routine real-world&#xD;
      clinical practice in the United States, including both community and academic treatment&#xD;
      settings. Primarily, the study will evaluate patient experience through collection of patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PROs). The study will also collect and assess information on the therapies&#xD;
      used such as first-line treatment selection, treatment sequence and duration, the drivers of&#xD;
      physician selection of particular agents, and discontinuation of therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine distinct patterns of change in the quality of life and&#xD;
      symptom burden in mRCC patients receiving therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and undergo consent and baseline assessments, including research&#xD;
      blood collection and processing, by the study site team, this baseline visit will be their&#xD;
      only clinic visits per protocol. All other visits are standard of care visits and outside the&#xD;
      scope of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent follow up with be coordinated centrally by DCRI. Additional clinic data will be&#xD;
      obtained via PCORnet data pull and Medicare claims. Patient reported outcomes, quality of&#xD;
      life and medications data will be obtained via the DCRI Call Center through follow-up phone&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
