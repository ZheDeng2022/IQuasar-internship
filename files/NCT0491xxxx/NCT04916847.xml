  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive immune responses are essential for clearing viral infections and retention of virus&#xD;
      specific memory populations is required for long-term immunity. However, there is still&#xD;
      uncertainty about whether adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective. Such&#xD;
      knowledge is of immediate relevance, as it will provide insights into immunity of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection and thus help define future immunization strategies. Because of the importance of&#xD;
      asymptomatic cases in children, a specific study is needed in this population in order to&#xD;
      determine their individual and collective protective capacity. This is even truer for immune&#xD;
      compromised children that likely have severe forms of the disease with active and prolonged&#xD;
      viral replication in whom it is therefore essential to determine the extent of sero&#xD;
      conversion but also the quality and duration of the memory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we plan to analyze the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and memory T cell responses,&#xD;
      in different groups of immuno-compromized children (i.e with different levels/type of&#xD;
      immunosuppression; HIV, renal or stem cell transplantation, anti-TNF or methotrexate&#xD;
      treatment) and healthy controls seen in 3 University Hospitals, in order to determine the&#xD;
      proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral responses, their protective capacity,&#xD;
      the magnitude and the quality of the SARS-Cov-2 memory T cells but also their long term&#xD;
      persistence at 1 year.&#xD;

      Adaptive immune responses are essential for clearing viral infections and retention of virus&#xD;
      specific memory populations is required for long-term immunity. However, there is still&#xD;
      uncertainty about whether adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective. Such&#xD;

      immuno-compromised children that likely have severe forms of the disease with active and&#xD;
      prolonged viral replication in whom it is therefore essential to determine the extent of&#xD;
      seroconversion but also the quality and duration of the memory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we plan to analyze the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral and memory T cell responses,&#xD;
      in different groups of immuno-compromized children (i.e with different levels/type of&#xD;
      immunosuppression; HIV, renal or stem cell transplantation, anti-TNF or methotrexate&#xD;

      the magnitude and the quality of the SARS-Cov-2 memory T cells but also their long term&#xD;
      persistence at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will evaluate the proportion of children who developed anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      humoral and cellular memory immune responses and the protective capacity of these responses&#xD;
      in different groups of immune-compromised children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As explained above, clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 varies among different&#xD;
      immune-compromised populations, in relation to the individual degree and type of&#xD;
      immunosuppression. It is therefore necessary to obtain data on post infection protective&#xD;
      immunity in different groups of immunosuppressed children. The intervention added for this&#xD;
      study, blood samples will be taken. The blood sample will consist of two to three (depending&#xD;
      on weight) additional tubes (heparin-lithium, dry) between 5 ml and 15 ml each taken during a&#xD;
      blood test necessary for the patient's standard care. A second blood sample will be taken one&#xD;
      year later. The volume of blood taken does not exceed the volume allowed by the guideline&#xD;
      &quot;Ethical considerations for clinical trials of drugs in the pediatric population&quot;.&#xD;
