  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poorly controlled chronic pain in teens can impact quality of life, increase opioid use and&#xD;
      is a risk factor for developing chronic pain in adulthood. Currently, there is a shortage of&#xD;
      support to help teens manage chronic pain in the community and the support that did exist has&#xD;
      been significantly scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This research study will&#xD;
      investigate, based on questionnaires with teens and healthcare providers and interviews with&#xD;
      teens, whether pain rehabilitation virtual reality is easy to use and understand,&#xD;
      satisfactory to use, and whether it may improve pain, mobility, and function for the teens&#xD;
      using the program compared to those doing standard physiotherapy treatment over&#xD;
      videoconference.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects the lives of 1 in 5 - or 2 million - Canadian children and adolescents&#xD;
      and has negative impacts on all aspects of health-related quality of life as well as&#xD;
      significant economic costs to families and society. The standard of care for pediatric&#xD;
      chronic pain management is an interprofessional biopsychosocial treatment approach, a&#xD;
      cornerstone of which is physiotherapy (PT) led functional rehabilitation. Furthermore, lack&#xD;
      of access to pain clinics and physiotherapy is an ongoing issue which has been exacerbated by&#xD;
      the current COVID-19 pandemic; many ambulatory pediatric chronic pain clinics and&#xD;
      community-based physiotherapists have halted appointments, with only a few pivoting to&#xD;
      virtual service delivery. Providing care virtually is particularly challenging in this field&#xD;
      given the physical and hands-on nature pain physical therapy assessment and treatment. These&#xD;
      challenges delay treatment and leave vulnerable youth at risk for severe sequelae without the&#xD;
      services they require for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) can help bridge these gaps in care during and beyond COVID-19 by&#xD;
      reducing fear associated with movement. A growing body of research has shown the power of&#xD;
      immersive VR for reducing anxiety and managing acute pain via distraction in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. While there is emerging evidence for the benefit of VR for treating chronic pain&#xD;
      in adults, there is minimal research evaluating VR's effectiveness for reducing pain and&#xD;
      improving physical function in children and adolescents with chronic pain. Changes to health&#xD;
      service delivery due to the COVID- 19 pandemic confirms the crucial need to develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive, engaging, and effective approach to home-based chronic pain rehabilitation.&#xD;
      The ability of VR to offer patients with chronic pain access to multi-sensory, 3D, immersive&#xD;
      therapeutic experiences, has the potential to break the cycle of pain, fear and activity&#xD;
      avoidance from a patient's own home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will: (1) Primary Aim: determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of implementing an off-the-shelf VR program and custom VR program (i.e., accrual rates,&#xD;
      engagement in therapy sessions, retention rates, technical and practical issues, time to set&#xD;
      up and conduct PR-VR, treatment acceptability, outcome evaluation, adverse events and&#xD;
      participant satisfaction) and; (2) Secondary Aim: evaluate preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      (estimates of magnitude of effect) of VR interventions compared to the usual care condition&#xD;
      (standard virtual PT [SVPT]).&#xD;

The Off-the-shelf VR program for Oculus Quest VR features a suite of &quot;off-the shelf&quot; applications that can be tailored by the PT and used with participants including. PR-VR sessions will be 30 minutes in total with approximately 20 minutes in the virtual experience and 10 minutes for set-up, screening, instructions, and rest breaks. The Off-the-shelf VR intervention group will also receive 30 minutes of usual care, and Standard Virtual Physiotherapy Treatment (SVPT) during the same appointment, for a total 1-hour usual care session length.</description>

    <description>Operates using Oculus Quest VR HMD with PR-VR software developed with two gaming options: Fruity Feet and Space Burgers 2. Game settings are manipulated by the physiotherapist in session to target specific limb movements and intensity and also motivates participants to cycle using a leg ergometer. Motion sensors on the ergometer track the participants revolutions per minute. For participants in this study arm, a leg ergometer (DeskCycle) will be provided to them during the study phase alongside the Actigraph and Oculus Quest HMD. During the 30min VR portion of the session, 20 minutes will be dedicated to gaming and exercise, and 10 minutes dedicated for set up, tear down, and rest breaks. During the 20 minutes gaming time, a minimum of 15 minutes will be dedicated to Custom VR, with 5 minutes for 'free play' where the participant can opt to try an off-the-shelf VR game.</description>
