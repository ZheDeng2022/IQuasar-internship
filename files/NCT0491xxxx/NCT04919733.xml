  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CIED implants require different amounts of fluoroscopy; using 3-D mapping systems, these&#xD;
      times could be reduced to near zero fluoroscopy. The investigators aim to describe to what&#xD;
      extent fluoroscopy times are reduced on a routine basis on CIED implants&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with either brady arrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, heart failure or primary prevention&#xD;
      of sudden death receive a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) as a standard of care&#xD;
      based on guideline indications. All implants require X-ray equipment to visualize the&#xD;
      advancement and positioning of leads in different heart chambers. To date only anecdotical&#xD;
      cases have been reported in the literature, of implants without fluoroscopy, mostly pregnant&#xD;
      patients with a CIED indication that could not wait for implant after delivery or some rare&#xD;
      situations where ultrasound was used to guide the leads trough the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two reported experiences using St-Jude Abbot 3-D NavX system; where 35 (ICD and&#xD;
      pacemakers) and 15 (VVI pacemakers only) CIED patients were respectively approached with&#xD;
      times reported to right ventricular lead implant of 18 +/- 22 minutes and atrial lead implant&#xD;
      of 16 +/- 9 minutes, in 89% of cases a final fluoroscopy shot was deemed necessary (in 16% of&#xD;
      patients it was needed to correct final position); in the second report with VVI only&#xD;
      pacemakers, the implant of a single lead was 10.1 +/- 5.4 minutes, and the total procedure&#xD;
      duration was 59.3 +/- 15.16 minutes -one patient needed fluoroscopy-, this last cohort was&#xD;
      compared to previous 15 VVI pacemaker patients implanted under fluoroscopy, with control&#xD;
      times of 51.5 +/- 12.3 minutes6 (p=ns); both studies reported around 10 minutes needed to&#xD;
      obtain right chamber anatomies. There is a little more experience on biventricular implants&#xD;
      with two reports one single center and then the same Italian group with a multicenter study&#xD;
      achieving a significant reduction in fluoroscopy times: from 16 minutes to 4 minutes (ranges&#xD;
      from 11-26 to 0.3-10.4 minutes) compared with a historical control, and with the same success&#xD;
      rates to left lead implants; even in experienced centers (more than 10 previous implants) the&#xD;
      median time was 3 minutes of fluoroscopy when a St-Jude Abbot NavX system was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement on 3-D mapping systems, allows nowadays to reduce and even eliminate the need&#xD;
      of X-rays for most of ablation procedures, where the catheters advancement, positioning and&#xD;
      navigation through the four heart chambers is accomplished with minimal or no irradiation to&#xD;
      the patients and to the health care personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that use of standard 3-D mapping systems to achieve CIED implants is&#xD;
      feasible, safe, and that could be accomplished in a time efficient way. This will be the&#xD;
      first large report for all type of CIED implants and with all available 3-D mapping system&#xD;
      utilization; the investigators will try also to define if a complete reconstructed virtual&#xD;
      anatomy is needed of if a rough anatomy is sufficient to achieve the implant, and speed&#xD;
      procedure times.&#xD;
