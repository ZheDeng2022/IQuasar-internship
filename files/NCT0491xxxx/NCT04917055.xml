  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparing the pain control outcomes for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA)&#xD;
      with either: 1) adductor canal single shot injection plus placebo iPACK injection or 2)&#xD;
      adductor canal single shot injection plus bupivacaine and dexamethasone iPACK injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two surgical approaches for TKA 1) open 2) ROSA robotic assisted. Both follow the&#xD;
      same pain management pathway. We plan to enroll patient undergoing either surgical procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center (UCSD), randomized blinded investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment. Consenting adults undergoing TKA will be offered enrollment. Study inclusion will&#xD;
      be proposed to eligible patients prior to surgery. If a patient desires study participation,&#xD;
      written, informed consent will be obtained using a current UCSD IRB-approved ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures. Following written, informed consent, we will record baseline&#xD;
      anthropomorphic information (age, sex, height, and weight) that is already provided by all&#xD;
      patients having surgery. After consenting and prior to surgery, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      (utilizing sealed envelopes with 1:1 ratio) to either single-shot adductor canal block with&#xD;
      sham iPACK block or single-shot adductor canal block with local anesthetic + dexamethasone&#xD;
      iPACK block. A regional anesthesia fellow, not participating in the study, will open the&#xD;
      sealed envelope and prepare the iPACK solution to be used accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard Care: Currently, all patients undergoing TKA receive preoperative adductor&#xD;
      canal block as well as multimodal pain regimen managed by APS. They all receive&#xD;
      intraoperative intraarticular injections by the surgical team. Spinal vs general anesthesia&#xD;
      is decided at the discretion of the intraoperative anesthesiologist along with patient&#xD;
      preferences and relevant contraindications. The only difference for subjects participating in&#xD;
      the study (vs those not participating) will be that they will be randomized to receive an&#xD;
      additional nerve block for posterior knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adductor canal single shot block + Sham group: In the preoperative holding area, all subjects&#xD;
      in this cohort will have a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard&#xD;
      noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face&#xD;
      mask, and positioned supine. Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient&#xD;
      comfort, while ensuring that patients remain responsive to verbal cues. The area of insertion&#xD;
      will be cleaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol (ChloraPrep One-Step,&#xD;
      Medi-Flex Hospital Products, Inc., Overland Park, KS, USA). A single shot adductor canal&#xD;
      block will be performed under ultrasound guidance with 20 mls of 0.25% ropivacaine with&#xD;
      1:400,000 epinephrine. A sensory level to ice will be confirmed and decided to be adequate if&#xD;
      positive based on the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. A Sham iPACK block will&#xD;
      then be performed under ultrasound guidance, where 20 mls of 0.9% normal saline with&#xD;
      1:400,000 epi (as a vascular marker) is injected between the popliteal artery and the&#xD;
      posterior aspect of the femoral condyle. As is standard for all TKA at our institution, all&#xD;
      patients will additionally receive an intraoperative intraarticular injection by the surgical&#xD;
      team of 50 mls 0.25% bupivacaine + 30 mg Ketorolac + 0.25mg epinephrine, which will occur at&#xD;
      least 60 minutes after preoperative perineural injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adductor canal single shot block + iPACK group: In the preoperative holding area, all&#xD;
      subjects in this cohort will have a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard&#xD;
      noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face&#xD;
      mask, and positioned supine. Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient&#xD;
      comfort, while ensuring that patients remain responsive to verbal cues. The area of insertion&#xD;
      will be cleaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol (ChloraPrep One-Step,&#xD;
      Medi-Flex Hospital Products, Inc., Overland Park, KS, USA). A single shot adductor canal&#xD;
      block will be performed under ultrasound guidance with 20 mls of 0.25% ropivacaine with&#xD;
      1:400,000 epinephrine. A sensory level to ice will be confirmed and decided to be adequate if&#xD;
      positive based on the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. An iPACK block will then&#xD;
      be performed under ultrasound guidance, where 20 mls of 0.25% ropivacaine with 1:400,000&#xD;
      epinephrine and 6mg dexamethasone is injected between the popliteal artery and the posterior&#xD;
      aspect of the femoral condyle. As is standard for all TKA at our institution, all patients&#xD;
      will additionally receive an intraoperative intraarticular injection by the surgical team of&#xD;
      50 mls 0.25% bupivacaine + 30 mg Ketorolac + 0.25mg epinephrine, which will occur at least 60&#xD;
      minutes after preoperative perineural injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Postoperative Pain Interventions: Intraoperatively, spinal anesthesia versus&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be decided at the discretion of the operating room anesthesiologist.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, both groups will be started on the same multimodal oral regimen and followed&#xD;
      by our anesthesiology led acute pain team.&#xD;
