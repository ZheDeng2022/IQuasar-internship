  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, the impact of pessaries was mostly assessed by questionnaires on Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QoL) and sexual dysfunction. This research project primarily aims to objectify the effects&#xD;
      of the currently available pessaries in a different way. To accomplish this, the&#xD;
      investigators choose transperineal ultrasound and uroflowmetry. Additionally, this project&#xD;
      aims to describe the impact of pessaries on the symptoms and QoL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will carry out a small feasibility study with inclusion of 20&#xD;
      patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) already using a pessary to check if it is possible&#xD;
      to perform adequate measurements of the pelvic floor on transperineal ultrasound with the&#xD;
      pessary in situ. By doing this cross-sectional study, the investigators want to refine our&#xD;
      technique to optimize data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed as a monocentric prospective longitudinal study. Patients&#xD;
      presenting to our gynecology outpatient department with symptomatic POP, who choose to try a&#xD;
      pessary after thorough counseling, will be recruited. The follow-up will continue for 1 year&#xD;
      after the insertion of the pessary. Regular check-ups at 2 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months will be&#xD;
      performed to document patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), perform a clinical&#xD;
      examination. Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) and uroflowmetry will be added to the&#xD;
      examinations at the check-up at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>anatomical changes in the pelvic floor after placement of pessary in midsagittal view</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomy of the pelvic floor will be assessed using 3D/4D ultrasound with the patient in a supine (or standing) position.&#xD;
Pelvic organ descent will be assessed in the midsagittal view on ultrasound, documenting: bladder neck descent (mm), bladder descent (mm), uterine/vault descent (mm), rectal ampulla descent (mm), rectocoele depth (mm).&#xD;
Measurements before and after pessary placement will be compared for each patient.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>What changes in QoL are reported by patients?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators aim to evaluate improvements in POP-related symptoms and the Quality of Life (QoL) This will be measured by using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20). Patients will be asked to fill out these questionnaires at the start of the treatment and at 3 and 12 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>What changes in micturition and sexual function are reported by patients?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators aim to evaluate improvements in POP-related symptoms, micturition, and sexual functions. This will be measured by using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Patients will be asked to fill out these questionnaires at the start of the treatment and at 3 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Does levator avulsion influence the success of pessary use?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>The functional anatomy of the pelvic floor will be assessed using 3D/4D ultrasound with the patient in a supine (or standing) position. 3/4D volumes in the axial plane will be rendered to assess levator ani muscle integrity (intact/partial/complete avulsion).&#xD;
Levator integrity will be assessed on eight tomographic ultrasound images in the axial plane with a slice interval of 2.5 mm. Complete levator avulsion is diagnosed if three central slices show an abnormal muscle insertion.&#xD;
The failure to retain the pessary or changes of pessary size will be registered in the patient's file.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Is it possible to choose the best fitting pessary based on the measurements obtained by transperineal ultrasound?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>The functional anatomy of the pelvic floor will be assessed using 3D/4D ultrasound with the patient in a supine (or standing) position. 3/4D volumes in the axial plane will be rendered to assess the levator hiatus area (HA; cm2), and levator hiatal ballooning at rest, during Valsalva maneuvers and during a pelvic floor muscle contraction.&#xD;
The size of the pessary (mm) will be compared with the obtained measurements of the ultrasound.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Does the use of a pessary changes the voiding time?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>Uroflowmetry data will register voiding time(s) with and without a pessary in place. This will be compared for each patient at baseline and after 3 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Does the use of a pessary changes flow rate during voiding?</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/2025</time_frame>
    <description>Uroflowmetry curve data will register Qmax (ml/s) and average flow rate (Qave; ml/s).</description>
