      The investigators propose a phase II single-arm study on using stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy in combination with durvalumab for inoperable/unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will also measure the change in number and intensity of&#xD;
      PD-L1-positive circulating tumor cells before and after stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      and durvalumab and evaluate their correlation with treatment response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest solid malignancies in Asia Pacific&#xD;
      region, primarily because of high incidence of hepatitis B infection in this locality.&#xD;
      Resection or liver transplantation is the standard treatment for operable/resectable disease.&#xD;
      However more than 50% of HCC are inoperable, primarily because of poor liver function,&#xD;
      limited normal liver reserve and advanced disease beyond resectability. Locoregional&#xD;
      treatment including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection&#xD;
      (PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and recently radio-embolization are acceptable options.&#xD;
      However the response rate was just between 30-80% treated with these modalities. Also some&#xD;
      patients are contraindicated to these local therapies. For instance, those who have poor&#xD;
      liver function (Child-Pugh B) or have their tumors showing portal vein invasion/thrombosis&#xD;
      are contraindicated to TACE. Those who had their tumors close to adjacent critical organs&#xD;
      e.g. liver, stomach, duodenum, small bowel and gallbladder, etc were not candidates for RFA&#xD;
      or percutaneous ethanol injection. In addition, those who had tumors &gt;4cm or close to major&#xD;
      vessels have high local recurrence after RFA. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),&#xD;
      with the use of highly conformal and precision radiation techniques with real-time tracing of&#xD;
      patient and tumor position so as to offer a high radiation dose to the tumors while sparing&#xD;
      the adjacent critical organs from necessary radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous preclinical studies suggested synergism of anti-tumor activity between radiation&#xD;
      therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now&#xD;
      comprehensively and extensively tested in combination with radiotherapy (RT) as well&#xD;
      (NCT01935921, NCT01860430). It has been recently known that RT increases the expression of&#xD;
      the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In turn, the MHC class-I restricted tumor&#xD;
      antigen-specific cells elicited by RT will upregulate interferons in the tumors. This&#xD;
      radiation-induced local inflammation and tumor-specific effector T cells will provide an&#xD;
      additional mechanism for tumor control by modification of the tumor vasculature. In addition,&#xD;
      RT will increase dendritic cell surface antigen presentation to T cells and production of&#xD;
      cytokines leading to recruitment and activation of leucocytes from peripheral blood and&#xD;
      extravasation to tumor parenchyma. These are part of the mechanisms of abscopal effect, a&#xD;
      phenomenon where the tumors at the sites far away from the irradiated sites also regress&#xD;
      after localized radiotherapy. Having learnt from the pivotal PACIFIC trial on the use of&#xD;
      consolidation therapy with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) which confirmed the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of combination of chemoradiation and immunotherapy for stage III&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer, it is prime time to consider incorporation of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors into concurrent chemoradiation for other solid tumors like HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the promising activity of SBRT and immune checkpoint inhibitors for HCC, we&#xD;
      propose a phase II single-arm study on using durvalumab in combination with SBRT for&#xD;
      inoperable/unresectable HCC. Recruited patients with receive durvalumab 750mg intravenously&#xD;
      every 2 weeks, starting 1 week before SBRT, for a total of 26 cycles (1 year).&#xD;

                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent&#xD;

             dose area of the intended radiation, a 4 month washout period will be required. The&#xD;
             safety of such treatment will be at discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.&#xD;
