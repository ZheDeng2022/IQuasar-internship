  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the fight against the epidemic, medical personnel need to wear protective equipment, such&#xD;
      as N95 mask, face screen, goggles, latex gloves, waterproof isolation clothing, and have&#xD;
      special requirements. Protection-related skin lesions after the use of protective equipment&#xD;
      will affect the health and comfort of medical workers. In this study, a retrospective study&#xD;
      was conducted on the front-line medical workers in the fight against COVID-19 using&#xD;
      questionnaires, so as to understand the incidence, location and clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      skin lesions caused by the use of protective equipment by medical workers. And analyze the&#xD;
      causes of these skin damage, so as to develop the corresponding prevention and treatment&#xD;
      countermeasures, select 170 cases that meet the research conditions, a randomized controlled&#xD;
      experiment, divided into control group and experimental group: the control group is on the&#xD;
      basis of three-level protection, did not use any preventive measures of health care workers.&#xD;
      In the experimental group, skin related prevention was carried out on the basis of&#xD;
      three-level protection. The specific interventions are as follows :(1) Focus on protecting&#xD;
      exposed skin and making it locally dry. (2) Do a good job of facial moisturizing before work&#xD;
      (at least 1 hour before wearing the mask), use moisturizing ointment, longer lasting and&#xD;
      non-irritating cream or emulsion, such as vitamin E cream, Vaseline, avoid direct contact&#xD;
      with the skin of the mask, choose the appropriate type of protective device; Reduce friction&#xD;
      by sticking foam paste, hydrocolloid accessories, ampute and so on on good hair parts.&#xD;
      However, it should be noted that it must be confirmed that the airtightness is good, and the&#xD;
      primary purpose of the medical staff is to ensure the protective effect. (4) After work,&#xD;
      avoid using irritant (such as hot water, exfoliating cream, etc.) to clean the face, and&#xD;
      massage local skin with skin moisturizer; (5) In case of severe skin damage, treat as&#xD;
      prescribed by the doctor; (6) After finishing the front-line work, &quot;Questionnaire Star&quot; was&#xD;
      used to collect data, and all data were input into the statistical software for analysis to&#xD;
      compare the index differences between the two groups.&#xD;
