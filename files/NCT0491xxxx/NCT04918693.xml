    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective study to be undertaken at University of Oregon,&#xD;
      Portland, USA. The aim is to provide data on the clinical performance of ScanNav Anatomy PNB&#xD;
      for identification of anatomical structures during UGRA scanning, in particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the benefits of the device to intended users when supervising a trainee who is&#xD;
           performing UGRA scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the benefits of the device when intended users perform UGRA scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess risk mitigation by the intended users when performing UGRA scanning.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) has published&#xD;
      evidence-based assessment of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (Neal et al., 2010)&#xD;
      concluding that ultrasound guidance is superior or equal to other non-ultrasound nerve&#xD;
      localization techniques. A subsequent publication from ASRA (Neal et al., 2016), has&#xD;
      strengthened their position of ultrasound guidance being superior than other methods,&#xD;
      including for the reduction of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. However, ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      regional anesthesia (UGRA) is a difficult technique to master. A key activity of UGRA is&#xD;
      ultrasound image interpretation (Sites et al., 2009) which ScanNav Anatomy PNB is designed to&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 participants (anesthesiologists capable of independently performing UGRA) will be&#xD;
      recruited to evaluate the performance and benefit of ScanNav Anatomy PNB device in person, by&#xD;
      scanning 2 healthy models (n=1 BMI&lt;30, n=1 BMI&gt;=30 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device performance and benefits will be ascertained once the scanning session for each&#xD;
      block is complete by use of a structured questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to scan a model with and without the use of ScanNav Anatomy&#xD;
           PNB. The order of with/without the device will be randomized between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to supervise a trainee (another healthcare professional&#xD;
           qualified to perform the UGRA procedure under supervision) while they are scanning&#xD;
           models with and without ScanNav Anatomy PNB aid. The participant will always use the&#xD;
           device first before supervising the trainee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The above will be performed on 2 models from different BMI categories (n=1 BMI&lt;30, n=1&#xD;
           BMI&gt;=30 kg/m2; total scans n=16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The order of models will be randomized between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All 9 supported regions will be evaluated; each region will be scanned/evaluated at&#xD;
           least 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants and trainees will be asked to complete a structured questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      the device performance and clinical benefits at the end of scanning for the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be aggregated and evaluated on safety critical structure type basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative data obtained from the participants will be presented as frequencies and&#xD;
           expressed as percent of total or as mean Â± s.d. where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data and overall performance and benefits of ScanNav Anatomy PNB will be&#xD;
      evaluated and summarized by presence and absence of ScanNav Anatomy PNB assistance, trainee&#xD;
      and stratified by low/high BMI model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent expert evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scans be recorded during the study sessions. These scans will be post processed to&#xD;
           short clips (10 seconds prior to obtaining optimum view) and sent for evaluation to an&#xD;
           independent expert panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The expert panel will be asked to evaluate the scans and the ScanNav Anatomy PNB&#xD;
           highlighting performance independently from the participant. The majority opinion (at&#xD;
           least 2/3) will be obtained to establish the agreement (e.g., yes/yes/no = yes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The answers obtained during the scan session from participants will be compared to&#xD;
           expert panel view. Independent comparisons between performance assessment will be made,&#xD;
           providing that the expert panel view is the 'ground truth'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be evaluated and presented by safety structure on each model and overall&#xD;
           (i.e., total for each class of safety critical structure; nerve, artery etc.).&#xD;
