      The Apple Respiratory Study, a collaboration between researchers at Apple Inc. (the &quot;Study&#xD;
      Sponsor&quot; or &quot;Sponsor&quot;) and the Seattle Flu Study team at the University of Washington (UW)&#xD;
      (the &quot;UW Study Team&quot;), is a prospective, longitudinal cohort, low risk Study to collect&#xD;
      certain data from Apple Watch and iPhone to determine whether such data can detect&#xD;
      physiologic and non-physiologic changes in individuals associated with respiratory illnesses&#xD;
      due to influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens (the &quot;Study&quot;).&#xD;

      Initial Screening and Study enrollment will begin in 2021 among adults residing in the&#xD;
      Greater Seattle area. Participants will be recruited and driven to the online Study Website&#xD;
      managed by UW. If determined to be eligible following completion of the Prescreen Consent and&#xD;
      an initial eligibility assessment via REDCap, potential participants will be asked to review&#xD;
      and, if interested in participation, to complete the Main Study Consent via REDCap, as well&#xD;
      as to engage in enrollment procedures across both REDCap and the Apple Research app. Redcap&#xD;
      will be used for prescreening, enrollment survey, and kit activation survey. Participants&#xD;
      will use the Apple Research app to complete onboarding surveys, weekly symptom surveys,&#xD;
      illness follow-up surveys, and monthly lifestyle surveys. These surveys will help the&#xD;
      investigators learn about onset of respiratory symptoms as well as sick contacts, flu and/or&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination and risk factors for illness. Participants will also receive an Apple&#xD;
      Watch to capture certain sensor data-which, along with iPhone sensor data, will be correlated&#xD;
      with symptom onset and symptom trajectory. If a participant experiences an acute respiratory&#xD;
      illness (ARI), defined as at least one respiratory symptom for at least 24 hours, that&#xD;
      individual will be asked to complete a symptom onset survey and self-collect an anterior&#xD;
      nasal swab, which will be sent to UW Laboratory Medicine for analysis. Participants will be&#xD;
      able to access their COVID swab test results using a secure web portal. Additionally,&#xD;
      individuals who test positive or inconclusive for SARS-CoV-2 will be notified via phone by&#xD;
      the UW Study Team and given instructions as defined by and in accordance with state, local,&#xD;
      and national public health guidance.&#xD;

        70 laboratory confirmed influenza cases and 40 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases based&#xD;
        on estimated event rate incidences.&#xD;
