  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The predictive value of the hypoxia altitude simulation test (HAST) or other baseline values&#xD;
      to predict altitude-related adverse health effects (ARAHE) is not established. To address&#xD;
      this gap, the main goals of this investigation will be 1) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of the HAST in identifying individuals that will experience ARAHE during altitude travel and&#xD;
      2) to establish prediction models incorporating other commonly assessed clinical&#xD;
      characteristics either alone or in combination with the HAST as predictors of ARAHE in&#xD;
      altitude travelers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: In lowlanders with COPD, a PaO2 &lt;6.6 kPa or another cutoff of PaO2 or SpO2 at the&#xD;
      end of the HAST, at rest or during exertion and/or clinical variables including symptoms,&#xD;
      pulmonary function indices, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), either alone or combined to a&#xD;
      multivariable model, will predict ARAHE during a sojourn of 2 days at 3100m with accuracy&#xD;
      greater than chance&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altitude or air travel has become increasingly popular for recreational and professional&#xD;
      reasons. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects up to 12% of adults worldwide&#xD;
      and is associated with progressive hypoxemia, especially during exercise, due to respiratory&#xD;
      mechanical constraints, airway obstruction and increasing pulmonary hypertension (PH). COPD&#xD;
      patients are at increased risk of ARAHE including acute mountain sickness (AMS) and severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia. Factors assessed at lowland that would predict ARAHE of COPD patients exposed to a&#xD;
      hypobaric hypoxic environment at altitude or during air travel would be highly warranted.&#xD;
      During the HAST COPD-patients are exposed to an inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 15.1%&#xD;
      corresponding to an altitude of ≈ 2500m and this test was designed to predict deoxygenation&#xD;
      at altitude. The predictive value of the HAST or other baseline values to predict ARAHE is&#xD;
      not established. To address this gap, the main goals of this investigation will be 1) to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the HAST in identifying individuals that will experience&#xD;
      ARAHE during altitude travel and 2) to establish prediction models incorporating other&#xD;
      commonly assessed clinical characteristics either alone or in combination with the HAST as&#xD;
      predictors of ARAHE in altitude travelers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this diagnostic accuracy study, COPD-patients with an FEV1 40-80% predicted living &lt; 1000&#xD;
      m without severe hypoxemia (SpO2, &lt;92%), hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6 kPa) or comorbidities will be&#xD;
      recruited to traveling to and staying for two nights at 3100 m. At 760 m, the HAST will be&#xD;
      performed, at 760 m and 3100 m symptoms, vital signs, SpO2, pulmonary function tests, 6MWD,&#xD;
      sleep studies will be repetitively assessed. ARAHE will be defined if one of the following&#xD;
      present: AMS with a Lake Louise questionnaire score &gt;4 including headache, or AMSc score&#xD;
      ≥0.7, resting SpO2 &lt;80% &gt;30 min or &lt;75% for &gt;15 min; or exercise SpO2 &lt;75% for &gt;5 min&#xD;
      accompanied by symptoms, any intercurrent illness including infections, hypertension,&#xD;
      neurologic impairments, dyspnea or discomfort at rest requiring oxygen treatment, chest pain&#xD;
      and/or ECG signs of cardiac ischemia.&#xD;

    <description>Normobaric hypoxia at a FiO2 of 15.1% will be generated by the Everest Summit II altitude generator (Hypoxico Altitude Training Systems, Bickenbach, Germany) and delivered to the patients face via tubes and a tightly fitted mask. Patients will be seated comfortably in a chair and fitted with a full-face mask equipped with a one-way valve. After a baseline period of quiet rest of 5-10 min with ambient air breathing and installation of equipment, patients will breath the hypoxic air mixture via a tightly fitted facial mask. They will be monitored with a finger-tip pulseoximetry to continuously assess SpO2 and heart rate. After at least 15' and steady-state values of the SpO2 (±1%) for at least 5' arterial blood gases will be drawn from a radial artery and immediately analyzed (RapidPoint 500, Siemens, Zürich, Switzerland).</description>
