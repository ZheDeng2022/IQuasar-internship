    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III/Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-II (BSID-III/KABC-II) Age-Equivalent Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (BSID-III) is an individually administered test designed to assess the developmental functioning of infants and toddlers. The Bayley-III assesses development in five areas: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior. Children under the age of 3 will be tested for this. The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (KABC-II) is a clinical instrument for assessing cognitive development. Children over the age of 3 will be tested for this. Raw scores will be converted to age- equivalent scores to measure ability, skill, and knowledge, expressed as the age at which most individuals reach the same level (age normÍ¾ range: 0, unbound ). A positive value indicates improvement. The BSID-III and KABC-II age- equivalent scores will be based on the cognitive domain and average non-verbal age-equivalent score, respectively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Age-equivalent Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The age equivalent score represents the age in months of the typical and normal individual who would achieve the same result as the one who was tested.&#xD;
The age equivalent scores are assessed by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Expanded Interview Form, Second edition (VABS-II). The Vineland is designed to measure the adaptive behavior of individuals from birth to age 90.&#xD;
The Vineland-II contains 5 domains each with 2-3 subdomains. The main domains are Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behavior. A positive value indicates improvement in health and cognition.</description>

    <measure>Imaging characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MRI will be used to assess changes in the size of various organs affected by the disease, including the brain, liver, and spleen.</description>

    <measure>Echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>2-D Echocardiography will be used to assess heart valve abnormalities and ventricular hypertrophy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life (ITQoL/PedsQL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Infant Toddler Quality of Life (ITQoL): The ITQoL Questionnaire is a generic, validated health status measure for children including items and scales to measure aspects of physical functioning, development, pain, mood, behavior, general health, and impact on parents. A positive value indicates improvement.&#xD;
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL): Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. Lower scores indicate better functioning.</description>
