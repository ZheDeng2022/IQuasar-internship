  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second-leading cause of death in the world and the leading cause of death in&#xD;
      China. The estimated lifetime risk of stroke for those aged 25 years old and above is 24.9%&#xD;
      worldwide and 39.3% in China. Hypertension is one of the main independent risk factors for&#xD;
      stroke. Studies have shown that the risk of stroke increase at blood pressure (BP) above&#xD;
      115/75mmHg, each increase of 20mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 10 mmHg in diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP) will double the risk of stroke. For those hypertensive patients without&#xD;
      complications, each reduction of 10mmHg in SBP reduces approximately 17% risk of stroke, and&#xD;
      each reduction of 5mmHg in DBP reduces 20%. Therefore, enhancing the primary prevention of&#xD;
      stroke in hypertensive patients without vascular complications is important to reduce the&#xD;
      burden of stroke in the future. However, these patients do not pay enough attention to their&#xD;
      elevated BP and have poor compliance with antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, it is necessary&#xD;
      to explore an economical, convenient and effective non-pharmacological therapy to control BP&#xD;
      in order to reduce the risk of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) triggers endogenous protective effect through&#xD;
      transient and repeated ischemia in the limb to protect remote tissues and organs. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of LRIC involve the regulation of autonomic nervous system, release of humoral&#xD;
      factors, improvement of vascular endothelial function and modulation of immune/inflammatory&#xD;
      responses, which can antagonize the pathogenesis of hypertension through multiple pathways to&#xD;
      lead a drop in BP theoretically. This theory has been preliminarily confirmed by several&#xD;
      small sample-size studies. Therefore, this study intends to conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to further reveal the antihypertensive effect of LRIC and explore its potential&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
