    <description>Restrata® is a sterile, single use device intended for use in local management of wounds. Restrata® is a soft, white, conformable, non-friable, absorbable matrix that provides a moist environment for the body's natural healing process to occur. Restrata® is made from synthetic biocompatible materials and was designed to include a fibrous structure with high porosity, similar to native extracellular matrix.</description>
