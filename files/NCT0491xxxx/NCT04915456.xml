    <textblock>
      This study investigate the additive effect of systemic postoperative steroids in patients&#xD;
      with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRSwNP). All patients receive a functional endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery (FESS) followed by topical steroid spray for 3 months. Postoperatively, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to either an additional systemic steroid or a placebo for 1 month. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 2 years. Effect on Nasal Polyp score (NPS), Lund-Kennedy-Score (LKS),&#xD;
      recurrence rates, smell scores, Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI), Short-Form 36 (SF-36)&#xD;
      and mucus/serum biomarkers will be measured.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nasal Polyp Score (NPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Each nostril will be assessed separately. The highest score will be graded. Each nostril will be scored from 0-4 (0=no polyps, 1=polyps confined to the middle meatus, 3=polyps extending beyond middle meatus, 4=large polyps causing almost complete nasal obstruction)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lund-Kennedy-Score (LKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Lund-Kennedy-Scores range from 0-12. Scoring includes the assessment of polyps (0=no polyps, 1=middle meatus, 2= beyond middle meatus), discharge (0=no discharge, 1=thin discharge, 2=edema/scarring/crusting (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=severe)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smell Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Sniffing Sticks Screening-16 test (&quot;forced choice&quot;), graded from 0-16 with a higher score indicating a better sense of smell, anosmia is defined as a score ≤7</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrence rates</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Increase of NPS per side ≥ 2 within 2 year follow-up</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sinonasal Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>nasal congestion, anterior rhinorrhea, posterior rhinorrhea, sneezing, pruritus in the nose, tearing, ear pressure, throat pain, facial pain or pressure, headache, numbness in cheek/lips/teeth. All graded from 0-3 (0=no problems, 1=mild problems, 2= moderate problems, 3= severe problems)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mucus and serum biomarker levels</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Pappalysin-1, Cystatin-SN, Periostin, SerpinE1, SerpinF2 (measured in pg/ml)</description>

    <measure>RSDI (Rhinosinusitis Disability Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>validated 30-item Likert scale instrument containing three subscales that assess the impact of sinusitis on physical, functional, and emotional domains. The Score ranges from 0-120. Higher total and subscale RSDI scores represent a worse impact of sinus disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 (Short Form-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>first visit until 24 months, change is measured between baseline and each follow-up time point up to 24 months (follow-up time points are as follows: 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>There is no single overall score for the SF-36, instead, it generates 8 subscales and two summary scores. The subscales are: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role-limitations due to emotional problems, mental health. The scoring ranges from 0-100. Higher total and subscale scores represent a better health situation.</description>
