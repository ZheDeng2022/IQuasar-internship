      Objective: To observe the effect of different fasting time on neonatal blood glucose in&#xD;
      pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: 122 pregnant women with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus were selected from September 2018 to September 2020 in XX&#xD;
      Hospital for regular prenatal examination, matching of pregnancy and delivery times, and&#xD;
      undergoing elective lower uterine cesarean section to terminate pregnancy. The pregnant women&#xD;
      were divided into 5 groups according to their fasting time before operation and whether they&#xD;
      were given rehydration on the same day before operation, There were 27 cases in group B&#xD;
      (fasting time 12.75 ± 0.48 hours, no rehydration before operation), 20 cases in group C&#xD;
      (fasting time 15.65 ± 0.52 hours, no rehydration before operation), 24 cases in group D&#xD;
      (fasting time 12.75 ± 0.48 hours, intravenous drip of 5% glucose sodium chloride 500ml at&#xD;
      8:00 on the day of operation), 24 cases in Group E (fasting time 15.65 ± 0.52 hours,&#xD;
      intravenous drip of 5% glucose sodium chloride 500ml at 8:00 on the day of operation). The&#xD;
      blood glucose of pregnant women within half an hour before operation, the blood glucose of&#xD;
      newborns after delivery and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia were observed and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
