  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a well-studied technique that has been shown to improve&#xD;
      recovery time and reduce pain and swelling in patients undergoing surgery, including&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery, and has no known negative effects. This study will use two groups with&#xD;
      patients randomly assigned to either the study group, receiving LLLT, or one receiving a&#xD;
      placebo treatment, after they have lower jaw surgery. Measurements will be taken at 24 hours,&#xD;
      1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 4 week, 5 week, and 6 week post-op exams to check pain, swelling and&#xD;
      nerve function, and the two groups will be compared to see if the LLLT group has any&#xD;
      difference&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a well-studied technique to induce biomodulation of pain&#xD;
      and wound healing. The technique has been shown to improve recovery time and reduce pain and&#xD;
      swelling in patients undergoing surgery, including orthognathic surgery, and has no known&#xD;
      negative effects. Previous studies have used split-mouth designs, short follow-up periods or,&#xD;
      often, both. This study aims to have two groups, one receiving LLLT and one receiving a dummy&#xD;
      treatment, at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 4 week, 5 week, and 6 week post-op exams. At&#xD;
      each visit, pain (via VAS), swelling (measured from the midpoint of the chin to the base of&#xD;
      the ear, bilaterally), and nerve function (using a soft and hard sensory test, in 8 regions&#xD;
      of the mandible and lower lip) will be performed, with additional measurements at 8 weeks and&#xD;
      20 weeks. The measurements will be analyzed for statistical differences between the LLLT&#xD;
      intervention group and non-intervention group.&#xD;

The LLLT will be administered to the experimental group at 30 j/cm2. The laser will be applied extraorally, on the skin overlying the mandible. Application will be for 40 seconds per side, with 10 seconds administered in four places along the jawline, 1 cm apart starting from the gonial angle.</description>
