    <textblock>
      Patients who were pathologically diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent distal&#xD;
      gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction between March 2014 and March 2021 were retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzed. The occurrence of RSS was evaluated and examined for correlations with demographic&#xD;
      and clinicopathological data. &quot;R&quot; package was used to build a nomogram.&#xD;

      Patient Selection Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the medical ethics&#xD;
      research committee of Peking University Third Hospital (IRB00006761-2019173).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients who were pathologically diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent&#xD;
      distal gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction between March 2014 and March 2021 at Peking&#xD;
      University Third Hospital were retrospectively selected (the detailed screening process was&#xD;
      shown in Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria for this study were: (1) patients with distant metastasis, (2)&#xD;
      patients with palliative surgery, (3) death occurred within 14 days after operation, (4)&#xD;
      patients with primary malignant disease in other organs besides stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure RY reconstruction was performed after standard distal gastrectomy and D2&#xD;
      lymph node dissection. There are several key steps involved in the RY reconstruction process.&#xD;
      Firstly, the jejunum was dissected at 20.2cm (average value) distal to Treitz's ligament.&#xD;
      Secondly, a side-to-side antecolic gastrojejunostomy was created using a linear stapler&#xD;
      between the gastric stump and the distal segment of jejunum. Finally, an end-to-side or&#xD;
      side-to-side jejunostomy was performed in output limb at about 37.2cm (average value) distal&#xD;
      to the gastrojejunostomy (Figure 2). A cholecystectomy was performed if the patient had&#xD;
      gallbladder-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection We divided these patients into two group depending on whether RSS occurred&#xD;
      and retrospectively analyzed the following items: gender, age, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      operation approach, operation time, cholecystectomy, length of input and output loops,&#xD;
      intestinal anastomosis approach, pathological T (pT) stage, lymph node metastasis,&#xD;
      pathological stage, lymphovascular invasion, nerve invasion and postoperative hospital stay.&#xD;
      According to the standard classification of BMI in China11, we divided patients into three&#xD;
      groups, including underweight group (BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2), obesity group (BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2) and&#xD;
      normal group (18.5 kg/m2 ≥ BMI &lt; 28.0 kg/m2). The cancer stage was defined according to the&#xD;
      8th cancer Edition Cancer Staging System presented by American Joint Committee on Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of RSS We defined RSS as (1) the presence of symptoms such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, or abdominal fullness, (2) refasting after liquid or semi-liquid diets, (3) imaging&#xD;
      methods (X-ray, CT, upper gastroenterography) confirmed without mechanical obstruction. All&#xD;
      three conditions must be met at the same time and should occur within 30 days after&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two gastroenterologists screened each patient one by one according to the RSS definition. The&#xD;
      third gastroenterologist discussed the inconsistent patients and jointly confirmed whether&#xD;
      the patient had RSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS Statistics version&#xD;
      26.0 software program (IBM, USA). Qualitative data were compared using the chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Quantitative data were tested by nonparametric test with Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test. We choose the variables with P &lt; 0.1 in univariate analysis and the variables that may&#xD;
      be related to RSS clinically to be included in multivariate analysis, using Binary logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis (Forward Conditional). Box-Tidwell method was used to verify that the&#xD;
      continuous independent variable and the dependent variable logit transform value to be linear&#xD;
      relationship (p &gt; 0.05). Linear regression was used to verify that there was no&#xD;
      multicollinearity between each independent variable (Tolerance &gt; 0.1, VIF &lt; 10). Based on the&#xD;
      logistic regression results, a nomogram for predicting RSS occurrence after radical&#xD;
      gastrectomy for distal gastrectomy with RY anastomosis was established, and performance was&#xD;
      quantified to determine discrimination and calibration. The model was internally validated&#xD;
      using the 1,000 bootstrapping method to obtain relatively unbiased estimates. Nomogram was&#xD;
      built using the &quot;rms&quot; package in R version 3.5.2.All tests were bilateral, and P &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
