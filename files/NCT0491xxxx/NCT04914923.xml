  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and debilitating anxiety disorder afflicting&#xD;
      about 2% of the population. It is characterized by the presence of recurrent obsessions&#xD;
      and/or compulsions that are time consuming and cause marked distress and/or impairment.&#xD;
      Untreated, OCD runs a chronic and deteriorating course. According to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization, OCD is among the top 10 leading causes of disability worldwide. Examination of&#xD;
      non-medicinal treatments for OCD has focused on two distinct treatments: exposure and&#xD;
      response prevention (ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT), often combined into an integrated&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT). CBT is considered the first line psychological&#xD;
      treatment for OCD, with estimates of response rates of between 70-80%. However, there are a&#xD;
      significant number of treatment non-responders and the majority of responders are still left&#xD;
      with impairing residual symptoms. One area of investigation that has shown potential benefit&#xD;
      for general mood and anxiety disorders has been mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), yet&#xD;
      the potential benefits of MBIs in OCD has been largely unexamined, except for several small&#xD;
      preliminary studies that show clinical promise. The purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      clinical benefits of a standardized MBI treatment for OCD in a large-scale, multi-site&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The results of this study will directly determine whether&#xD;
      Mindfulness can be considered an effective treatment for OCD. If this study can demonstrate&#xD;
      that a short-term mindfulness intervention can significantly reduce the suffering associated&#xD;
      with OCD, then the findings could easily be translated into routine clinical care in and out&#xD;
      of hospital settings. Results of this study will also potentially add to our understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms that drive OCD symptoms, improve our knowledge of psychological treatment&#xD;
      mechanisms, and elucidate how biological factors influence psychological treatment outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a first line psychological treatment for OCD with&#xD;
      estimated response rates of between 70-80%. However, there are still a substantial number of&#xD;
      treatment non-responders and the vast majority of responders are left with impairing residual&#xD;
      symptoms. One new area of investigation that has shown potential benefit for the treatment of&#xD;
      OCD has been mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). This emerging literature provides proof&#xD;
      of principle for the delivery and potential efficacy of MBIs for OCD, particularly as an&#xD;
      adjunct to CBT, with all studies reporting large (d &gt; .80) treatment effects. To date, only&#xD;
      our teams' small, non-controlled pilot study (N=19) has shown promise for a MBI as a&#xD;
      stand-alone treatment for OCD separate from CBT (d = 1.10). However, all results to date for&#xD;
      MBI treatments for OCD must be interpreted with caution as they have utilized small,&#xD;
      underpowered sample sizes, have not included control groups, and failed to control for&#xD;
      potentially confounding variables (e.g., medications, self-initiated exposures). The proposed&#xD;
      four-year, two-site randomized controlled trial at two of Canada's leading OCD treatment&#xD;
      centres (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton) that have&#xD;
      been involved in developing and piloting MBI treatments for OCD will aim to test whether a&#xD;
      structured, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention for OCD is an efficacious&#xD;
      treatment for a large, heterogeneous sample of DSM-5 (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders 5th edition) diagnosed OCD participants. The primary aim of this proposed study is&#xD;
      to examine whether a developed and piloted MBCT treatment for OCD is efficacious when&#xD;
      compared to a waitlist condition and to explore its efficacy compared to CBT treatment for&#xD;
      OCD. A secondary aim of the study is to examine the putative treatment mechanisms of MBCT.&#xD;
      Past research examining treatment mechanisms in CBT for OCD have focused on the reduction of&#xD;
      obsessional beliefs, anxiety sensitivity, and safety behaviours in producing better outcomes.&#xD;
      In contrast, the hypothesized mechanisms in MBI treatments include the development of&#xD;
      mindfulness skills such as acting with awareness, non-reactivity to and non-judging of inner&#xD;
      experience, and reduction in mind wandering. The large-scale, powered RCT (randomized control&#xD;
      trial) design will permit the examination of whether MBCT and CBT include overlapping or&#xD;
      distinct treatment mechanisms. Treatment outcomes will be assessed with standardized measures&#xD;
      of OCD symptomatology, general measures of mood and anxiety, a reliable and valid EEG measure&#xD;
      to assess cognitive changes across treatment. If this study can demonstrate that a short-term&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention can significantly reduce the suffering associated with OCD, then the&#xD;
      findings could easily be translated into routine clinical care in and out of Canadian&#xD;
      hospital settings. Results of this study will also potentially add to our understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms that drive OCD symptoms, improve our knowledge of psychological treatment&#xD;
      mechanisms, and elucidate how genetic/biological factors influence psychological treatment&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
