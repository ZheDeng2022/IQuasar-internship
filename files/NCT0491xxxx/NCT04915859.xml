  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heat-related injuries and other physiological stresses continue to be a significant threat to&#xD;
      the health and operational effectiveness of the US Armed Forces (Armed Forces Health&#xD;
      Surveillance 2011). This is because military personnel are exposed to exertional and&#xD;
      environmental heat-stress factors during both deployment and training at US installations in&#xD;
      hot and humid climates. Cold water immersion (CWI) is considered the gold standard for the&#xD;
      treatment of exertional heat stroke (EHS) and has been shown to increase survival rates to&#xD;
      100% with the implementation of CWI best practices. However, in a field setting other cooling&#xD;
      strategies have been developed to aid in the prevention of EHS and other heat-related&#xD;
      illnesses. One such proposed strategy is a portable hand cooling device that does not require&#xD;
      the use of ice or water. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate&#xD;
      hand and back cooling devices using physiological, cognitive, performance, and perceptual&#xD;
      responses that occur during and following rest, exercise, and cooling in the heat.&#xD;
