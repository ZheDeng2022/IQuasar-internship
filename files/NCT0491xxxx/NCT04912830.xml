  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 5-7 years there has been increasing concern about the use of polypropylene&#xD;
      tapes in female incontinence surgery. There has been a special focus on pain in the vagina&#xD;
      and lower abdomen and pain during sexual intercourse. Some have also asked if the&#xD;
      polypropylene tape could cause impairment of the immune system leading to allergy, connective&#xD;
      tissue disorders etc. There are still only a few publications on complications after sling&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway it is mandatory to register all incontinence surgery in the National incontinence&#xD;
      registry (Norsk Kvinnelig Inkontinens Register (NKIR). In 2019 &gt;99 % of all procedures were&#xD;
      registered in this registry. Data about type and severity of incontinence are registered, as&#xD;
      well as complications at surgery. The same data are entered at a 6 months and 3 years follow&#xD;
      up. Data for the follow up visits are not complete. The NKIR registry and other similar&#xD;
      registries have been criticized for not following the women long enough and therefore missing&#xD;
      important information regarding long-term complications. Few studies have followed the women&#xD;
      for a longer time after surgery. The main aim of this study is to find the prevalence of&#xD;
      women still satisfied with the TVT surgery and the prevalence of long-term complications&#xD;
      after 10 and 20 years.&#xD;
