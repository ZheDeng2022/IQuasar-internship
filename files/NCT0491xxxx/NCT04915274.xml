  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the psychometric properties (validity, reliability and responsiveness) of the&#xD;
      QuestOnco tool, an electronic Remote Toxicity Management System, in adult cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving an active anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a mobile phone-based remote monitoring system (QuestOnco application) was&#xD;
      developed in order to enable the 'real-time' monitoring of patients' symptoms through use of&#xD;
      ePROMs. In order to establish if this new application accurately and reliably identifies the&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatment related symptoms, its psychometric properties (validity, reliability&#xD;
      and responsiveness) have to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The QuestOnco application will be designed as a promising innovative tool with good&#xD;
           psychometric properties in order to detect more rapidly the anti-cancer-related toxicity&#xD;
           in adult cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The QuestOnco application is an accurate and reliable tool for the identification of the&#xD;
           anti-cancer treatment related symptoms as much as current available questionnaires such&#xD;
           as PRO-CTCAE and EORTC QLC-QC30 The evaluation of the psychometric properties of the&#xD;
           QuestOnco application will be made in two phases. First, the patient's cognitive&#xD;
           interviews will allow assessing the content validity of the items. Then focus groups&#xD;
           including patients and professional experts will determine the QuestOnco application&#xD;
           goals regarding the adverse symptoms management (recommendations provided within the&#xD;
           application, connection with General practitioner, medical Oncology team or Emergency&#xD;
           departments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the validity, reliability and responsiveness of the QuestOnco in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients receiving anti-cancer treatments. The external validity will be directly&#xD;
      compared to PRO-CTCAE (Patient-Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events) and to EORTC QLC-QC30 questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>PRO-CTCAE The convergent validity will be evaluated by the correlation between the QuestOnco and the weekly paper form of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire.&#xD;
PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement system developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials. It was designed to be used as a companion to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) External Web Site Policy, the standard lexicon for adverse event reporting in cancer clinical trials.&#xD;
The PRO-CTCAE Item Library includes 124 items representing 78 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE. PRO-CTCAE items evaluate the symptom attributes of frequency, severity, interference, amount, presence/absence. Each symptomatic AE is assessed by 1-3 attributes.&#xD;
PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4 (minimum/maximum).</description>

    <description>Semi-structured cognitive interviews:&#xD;
Interviews will be conducted to evaluate patients' comprehension of the QuestOnco application items. Items will be modified and restested if more than 2 patients manifest cognitive difficulties. The item modifications will be conducted during focus groups gathering experts including Emergency department practitioners, General practitioner, Oncologists, Pharmacists, and Methodologists. This procedure will be repeated 3 times a maximum for a total of 30 patients.</description>

    <description>The patients' quality of life will be assessed using EORTC QLC-QC30 questionnaire The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item core-cancer-specific questionnaire-integrating system for assessing the health-related QOL of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. The questionnaire incorporates five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), a global health and QOL scale, and single items for the assessment of additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (e.g., dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as the perceived financial impact of the disease and treatment. All items are scored on 4-point Likert scales, ranging from 1 ('not at all') to 4 ('very much'), with the exception of two items in the global health/QOL scale which use modified 7-point linear analog scales.</description>
