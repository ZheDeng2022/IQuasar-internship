  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative hyperamylasemia is a known risk factor for specific post-pancreatectomy&#xD;
      morbidity; however, it has never been prospectively compared to post-operative radiologic&#xD;
      findings. For this reason, the present study, in order to characterize postoperative acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis, will compare some early biochemical evidence of pancreatic stump damage to&#xD;
      morphological changes evident at postoperative imaging, because the clinical picture is&#xD;
      invariably covered by postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative evaluation of serum and/or urine pancreatic enzymes and the radiologic&#xD;
      assessment are included in everyday clinical practice. However, the timing and the clinical&#xD;
      relevance of such findings mostly rely on the single-surgeon experience. The present study,&#xD;
      therefore, does not introduce any change to the daily clinical practice and has the only&#xD;
      purpose of systematically compare the biochemical and the radiological picture of patients&#xD;
      undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the incidence of postoperative acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      in patients undergoing PD, using postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      biochemical markers of pancreatic injury.&#xD;

      Acute pancreatitis after pancreatic resections appears in literature as a possible&#xD;
      post-operative pancreatic complication although there is no agreement on its etiology,&#xD;
      definition, and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent literature suggests that post-operative acute pancreatitis after pancreatic resection&#xD;
      may be the clinical manifestation of intraoperative ischemic damage of the pancreatic stump&#xD;
      and may eventually lead to postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and other post-operative&#xD;
      complications. An objective universally accepted definition of POAP after major pancreatic&#xD;
      surgery, however, has not as yet been established. This has resulted in a scientific &quot;gap&quot; to&#xD;
      the point that the consequent absence of protocols of diagnosis and management has precluded&#xD;
      objective comparisons of different surgical experiences. Despite the differences among&#xD;
      studies both biochemical and radiologic features have been considered for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      this entity. Nevertheless, high levels of postoperative serum amylase or lipase are also&#xD;
      reported in the literature as a possible consequence of the mechanical damage related to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure itself. By contrast, they have been rarely reported as a marker of&#xD;
      postoperative acute pancreatitis and they are most frequently considered to be only an&#xD;
      indirect sign of POPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative acute pancreatitis has been recently highlighted, as a specific complication&#xD;
      after pancreatic surgery that may lead to an increased rate of other additional severe&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of ischemic damage of the organ subjected to surgery was also evaluated in&#xD;
      other scenarios, such as for the post-cardiac surgery myocardial infarction (MI) and the&#xD;
      post-neurosurgery stroke. These ischemic complications, besides having well-defined&#xD;
      biochemical features, maybe detected early on post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MR).&#xD;
      The decrease of pancreatic perfusion may, in some instances, lead to an altered signal in&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. DWI MR can&#xD;
      provide information on alterations of tissue cellularity, membrane-cell integrity, and the&#xD;
      extracellular space. This can be analyzed qualitatively, but also quantitatively, determining&#xD;
      an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress in the field of acute pancreatitis even in a not post-operative context is still&#xD;
      controversial and hampered greatly for the use of different definitions. The first Atlanta&#xD;
      definition of acute pancreatitis was often used inappropriately, and although it incorporated&#xD;
      a pathological and morphological description of different complications, it does not provide&#xD;
      any radiologic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its revision has improved the reporting and the diagnosis made with a combination of physical&#xD;
      examination, computed tomography features, and laboratory evaluation. Two criteria, however,&#xD;
      are enough to confirm the onset of acute pancreatitis. the diagnosis of post pancreatectomy&#xD;
      pancreatitis is even more hampered by several issues because the pathophysiology is different&#xD;
      and the confounding factors are innumerable. Its characterization may be difficult because&#xD;
      the clinical picture is hidden by post-operative analgesia and the morphological changes,&#xD;
      evident at radiologic imaging, are not defined in a post-operative setting. It is essential&#xD;
      to point out that the post-operative setting is itself a determinant of anatomical and&#xD;
      biochemical changes. Serum lipase or amylase activity and the measurement of urinary&#xD;
      trypsinogen proved valuable markers of acute pancreatitis. There is uncertainty, however,&#xD;
      about what absolute level of these biomarkers elevation reflects acute pancreatitis after&#xD;
      pancreatic resections. Furthermore, there are little data on whether early postoperative&#xD;
      radiologic evaluation could provide any diagnostic value because transient fluid collections&#xD;
      often occur in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the radiologic criterion, the biochemical one, and the clinical&#xD;
      outcome could better postoperative acute pancreatitis, and therefore prompt further clinical&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition and the early identification of post-operative acute pancreatitis after&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy may allow reaching potential methods of prevention, treatment, and&#xD;
      prediction of severity.&#xD;

    <description>Surgical resection and reconstruction will be carried out according to the Institutional standards. After the surgical procedure, serum pancreatic amylase and lipase activity will be systematically measured two hours after surgery on postoperative day (POD) 0 and every day at 7 a.m. until POD 5 according to our institutional policy. At our institution, the upper limit of normal for serum pancreatic amylase is 52 U/L and for serum lipase is 60 U/L. Postoperative protocols included the routine measurement of inflammatory markers (white blood cell [WBC] count and C-Reactive Protein [CRP]). A urine trypsinogen strip test will be done on POD 1. A trypsinogen-2 concentration of more than 50 µg/l is considered a positive test. As routine clinical practice, a post-operative imaging will be scheduled to check for potential surgical morbidity. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be assessed on POD 3.</description>
