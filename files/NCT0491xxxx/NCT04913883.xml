    <textblock>
      Astigmatism is a condition of the eye where the cornea (clear window in front of the eye) has&#xD;
      2 different curvatures (much like an American football cut in half) so that, instead of being&#xD;
      a single focal point, there ends up being two different focal points, neither of which is in&#xD;
      focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As you can imagine, this makes whatever you are looking at blurred and fuzzy like a camera&#xD;
      out of focus. Both objects up close and far away can look blurred and fuzzy with astigmatism.&#xD;
      Many people with astigmatism also are nearsighted or farsighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several different treatment options if you have astigmatism with or without&#xD;
      nearsightedness or farsightedness. Various treatment options available from an eye specialist&#xD;
      include: Glasses, Contact Lenses and Laser Eye Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Eye Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser eye surgery, or laser vision correction, involves using lasers to reshape the front&#xD;
      surface (cornea) of your eyes so that you can focus better. It can correct short-sightedness&#xD;
      , long-sightedness and astigmatism.There are several different laser eye surgery options that&#xD;
      can be used to help correct vision problems caused by astigmatism.Laser eye surgery corrects&#xD;
      the refractive error in the cornea so that, instead of there being two focal points, there&#xD;
      will be only one focal point that is in focus post-surgery.Laser vision correction can be&#xD;
      used if you have astigmatism with or without nearsightedness or farsightedness.However, what&#xD;
      laser eye procedures you are an ideal candidate for will vary based on your vision correction&#xD;
      needs LASIK( Laser ASsisted In-situ Keratomileusis ),PRK ( Photorefractive Keratectomy ) and&#xD;
      SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction ) . Unlike glasses or contacts, which just address&#xD;
      astigmatism so you can see clearly with assistive devices, laser eye surgery is the only&#xD;
      treatment to potentially resolve astigmatism so you no longer need glasses or contacts. To&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of correcting astigmatism by laser refractive surgery by a&#xD;
      vectorial astigmatism outcome analysis that uses 3 fundamental vectors: target induced&#xD;
      astigmatism vector (TIAT), surgically induced astigmatism vector, and difference vector, as&#xD;
      described by the Alpins method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpins method :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method of astigmatism analysis enables the examination of results of astigmatism&#xD;
      treatment by both refractive and corneal measurements. The approach uses vector analysis,&#xD;
      which is used in this series for examining regular astigmatism. This can be further applied&#xD;
      to irregular astigmatism by separately examining the 2 halves of the cornea by adding a&#xD;
      second analysis between 181and 360 degrees and displaying both together on a 360 degree polar&#xD;
      diagram as they would appear on an eye or topography map drawn between the two points . The&#xD;
      length of this line represents the WTW ( White To White ) value [16].&#xD;
