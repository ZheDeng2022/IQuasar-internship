    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter clinical trial aiming at&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy and safety of combined use of eltrombopag with low-dose rituximab vs.&#xD;
      the best available therapy（BAT）in adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with autoantibodies&#xD;
      fail (due to intolerance or resistance) to first-line treatment. The subjects include ITP&#xD;
      secondary to connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis), primary ITP with positive&#xD;
      antinuclear antibody but not up to the diagnostic criteria of connective tissue diseases,&#xD;
      primary Evans syndrome, Evans syndrome secondary to connective tissue diseases, and primary&#xD;
      ITP with positive Coomb's test but not up to the diagnostic criteria of Evans syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult ITP patients with autoantibodies (18-65 years) will be nonrandomly divided into the&#xD;
      following two treatment groups: 1. combined use of eltrombopag with low-dose rituximab. 2.&#xD;
      the best available therapy（BAT）other than combined use of eltrombopag with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment strategies and possible risks of combined use of eltrombopag with&#xD;
      low-dose rituximab in the treatment of ITP with autoantibodies will be fully introduced to&#xD;
      the patients by the researchers. Then the patients will be divided into one of the two groups&#xD;
      according to the patients' will.&#xD;
