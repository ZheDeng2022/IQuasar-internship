  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) causing&#xD;
      the disease COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) overwhelmed healthcare and brought new&#xD;
      challenges and stressful situations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a short time, the capacities of intensive care units (ICU) were filled in many countries&#xD;
      and regions. Due to the need for an excessive number of patients requiring intensive care,&#xD;
      physicians and nurses who do not routinely provide care to critically ill patients or do not&#xD;
      have the appropriate training (non-ICU clinician) were involved in the care of COVID-19&#xD;
      (Coronavirus Disease 2019) patients. In this context, ICU directly dedicated to the care of&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) were also opened. Non-ICU&#xD;
      clinicians were more or less involved together with the standard ICU staff in palliative&#xD;
      care, including End-of-Life decision (EOLD) making, even in a situation of limited scarce&#xD;
      resources (equipment or personnel). New workplace and scope of work, which did not correspond&#xD;
      to the standard activity or education, most likely led to an increased stress load. EOLD can&#xD;
      also be one of the factors leading to increased stress levels. The aim of the project is to&#xD;
      describe the practice of palliative care for patients with COVID-19 in a situation of&#xD;
      pandemic COVID-19 and to identify factors leading to possible moral distress related with&#xD;
      EOLD.&#xD;
