  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the feasibility continous recording of vital signs in pediatric patients&#xD;
      under chemotherapy for cancer, is studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and are recorded with two different wearable devices (WDs): Everion®, by&#xD;
      Biovotion (now Biofourmis), Zurich, Switzerland and CORE® by GreenTEG, Zurich, Switzerland.&#xD;
      Patients can choose if they want to wear one or both WDs during this study. Those opting to&#xD;
      wear two WDs can choose if they want to wear them in parallel, or sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the two different WDs will be compared. Study duration for each participant is&#xD;
      14 days per device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study (Bern 2019 WD Pilot, NcT04134429) the investigators found that continuous&#xD;
      recording of vital signs with the Everion® is feasible in good quality across a wide age&#xD;
      range (3 to 16 years) of pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. However, the&#xD;
      pre-defined criterion to claim feasibility was not formally reached and low compliance was&#xD;
      the main reason identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to assess the impact of measures aiming to increase&#xD;
      compliance on feasibility for the Everion®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the investigators want to assess the feasibility of a second device, made&#xD;
      commercially available only in October 2020, the CORE® WD by GreenTEG. Results from the two&#xD;
      different wearable devices will be compared. Study duration for each participant is 14 days&#xD;
      per device.&#xD;
