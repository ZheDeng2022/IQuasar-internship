    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in motivation to quit smoking will be assessed using the Contemplation Ladder. This is a validated measure for the assessment of readiness to quit smoking on a scale from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate greater motivation to quit smoking.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in motivation to quit smoking will be assessed using the short form of the smoking abstinence-related motivational engagement (ARME), which is a valid and reliable measure of cessation motivation that includes 5 items related to the smokers' daily experience ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). Higher scores indicate greater motivation to quit smoking.</description>
