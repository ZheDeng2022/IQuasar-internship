      The incidence of lymphoma and anemia is high and the clinical harm is great.However, it has&#xD;
      not yet attracted enough clinical attention, and domestic rHuEPO (trade name: Ebio).Shenyang&#xD;
      Sansheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) for lymphoma and anemia patients are less clinical&#xD;
      studies.Therefore, a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical study of recombinant human&#xD;
      erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia in patients with lymphoma is planned to analyze the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with lymphoma and anemia,&#xD;
      so as to determine the clinical benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma and anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common complication of malignant lymphoma.Approximately 30-40% of lymphoma&#xD;
      patients develop anemia before chemotherapy begins [1].Common clinical manifestations of&#xD;
      anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, depression and&#xD;
      other symptoms.Lymphoma anemia has a complex etiology, including chronic anemia (ACD),&#xD;
      autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), bone marrow infiltration, malnutrition, and blood loss&#xD;
      [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and prevalence of anemia are positively correlated with the severity of the&#xD;
      disease and the chemotherapy cycle.A multi-center survey of anemia in patients with lymphoma&#xD;
      in Shanghai published in 2020 included 501 patients, and the results showed that the&#xD;
      incidence of anemia in patients with lymphoma was 35.5%;The prevalence of anemia was 62.7&#xD;
      percent during the entire 6-month follow-up period.Among the newly treated patients, the&#xD;
      incidence of anemia was significantly higher in patients with Ann Arbor staging from Ⅲ to&#xD;
      normal (P &lt; 0.001), indicating that the incidence of anemia was related to the severity of&#xD;
      the disease.In addition, chemotherapy is also a key factor in the development of anemia&#xD;
      during the course of the disease.In this Shanghai survey, 267 newly treated lymphoma patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy increased the rate of newly diagnosed anaemia from 6.82% in the first&#xD;
      course of chemotherapy to 43.18% in the fourth course of chemotherapy and above [3].The&#xD;
      results of the European Anemia Survey of 15,367 cancer patients (ECAS) conducted in 2004 also&#xD;
      showed a high incidence of anemia in lymphoma patients (2 260 lymphoma patients, 52.5%) [4],&#xD;
      and the cumulative incidence of anemia in patients increased with the increase of&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia can reduce the quality of life of tumor patients, affect the therapeutic effect, and&#xD;
      shorten the survival period of patients [6].A number of studies have shown that anemia is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of patients with diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL) [7, 8].Compared with patients with Hb≥10 g/dL, those with Hb≥10 g/dL were&#xD;
      more likely to have bone marrow involvement before treatment.Patients with lymphoma at 10&#xD;
      g/dL showed a lower event-free and disease-free survival.R-CHOP regimen (rituximab,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) was also an independent predictor of&#xD;
      disease recurrence and an independent predictor of International Prognostic Index (IPI) 6&#xD;
      months after chemotherapy [7].After 3-4 courses of chemotherapy, the efficacy of newly&#xD;
      treated lymphoma patients was evaluated, and it was found that the efficacy gradually&#xD;
      deteriorated with the increase of anemia level [3].Another domestic study found that among&#xD;
      12L patients treated with R-CHOP regimen, 77 patients had grade 2 anemia or above (Hb &lt; 10g/&#xD;
      dL, 63.6%), and the analysis results of the relationship between different Hb grades and&#xD;
      overall survival showed that the greater the degree of anemia, the lower the overall survival&#xD;
      rate of patients [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients with lymphoma have a higher incidence of anemia, most patients do not&#xD;
      receive prompt treatment.ECAS survey showed that anemia treatment rate of lymphoma patients&#xD;
      was low, only 47.4%[4].For patients with tumor-associated anemia, treatment includes red&#xD;
      blood cell transfusions, erythropoiesis stimulants (ESAs), and iron.Before the emergence of&#xD;
      ESAs, blood transfusion was the main treatment.Although blood transfusions can quickly raise&#xD;
      Hb levels, there are risks associated with allergies, viral infection, immunosuppression and&#xD;
      iron overload.So the only Hb&amp;lt;Blood transfusion should be considered at 60 g/L or when&#xD;
      hypoxia is urgently corrected clinically.ECAS survey showed that recombinant human&#xD;
      erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was the main treatment for cancer anemia, but the treatment rate was&#xD;
      low (17.4%) [4].Previous studies have confirmed that rHuEPO has achieved positive efficacy in&#xD;
      the treatment of anemia caused by solid tumors and hematologic tumors.A 2008 study showed&#xD;
      that the response rate of 33 NHL patients receiving chemotherapy treated with rHuEPO was&#xD;
      84.8%, and the earlier the treatment of rHuEPO, the higher the response rate [10].Glossmann J&#xD;
      P et al. investigated the effects of rHuEPO on Hb level, blood transfusion volume and quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with recurrent lymphoma, and found that while rHuEPO increased Hb level,&#xD;
      it reduced the need for blood transfusion and improved the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      [11].However, in recent years, concerns about the safety of rHuEPO in cancer patients have&#xD;
      limited its clinical application.In recent years, large meta-analyses and randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies have not shown that ESAs promote tumor progression [12-15].The &quot;Management&#xD;
      of Anemia and Iron Deficiency in Cancer Patients: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines&quot;&#xD;
      published by the European Society of Physicians of Oncology (ESMO) in 2018 also clearly&#xD;
      pointed out that the standardized use of ESAS would not promote the progression or recurrence&#xD;
      of cancer disease [16].Therefore, the appropriate use of rHuEPO in lymphoma patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy can provide clinical benefits such as reduced need for blood&#xD;
      transfusion and improved quality of life without excessive safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the high incidence of lymphoma anemia and greater clinical harm.However, it has&#xD;
      not yet attracted enough clinical attention, and domestic rHuEPO (trade name: Ebio).Shenyang&#xD;
      Sansheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) for lymphoma and anemia patients are less clinical&#xD;
      studies.Therefore, a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical study of recombinant human&#xD;
      erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia in patients with lymphoma is planned to analyze the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with lymphoma and anemia,&#xD;
      so as to determine the clinical benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma and anemia.&#xD;
