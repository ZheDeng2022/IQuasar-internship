      To see the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on early spontaneous abortions and early&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy in the first trimester&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the research has focused on the complications of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women. There&#xD;
      is no research in the literature that has compared the rates and behavior of miscarriage&#xD;
      during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic to before the time of the pandemic. As described in&#xD;
      the literature, there is an established connection between COVID-19 and stress, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression. There is also an established connection between stress, anxiety, and depression&#xD;
      and rates of miscarriage. We hereby wish to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on&#xD;
      miscarriages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will analyze the number of early missed abortions and number of termination&#xD;
      of pregnancies in the first trimester before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also&#xD;
      analyze the time interval between diagnosis of missed abortion and attendance to E.R in&#xD;
      missed abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we will be comparing the reasons&#xD;
      for termination of pregnancy during this time, as well as analyzing age, religion, and&#xD;
      demographic variables during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to years prior.&#xD;
