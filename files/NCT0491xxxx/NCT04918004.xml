  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although many studies have shown an inverse relationship between blood glucose regulation and&#xD;
      sleep hygiene, recommendations for improving sleep hygiene have not yet been included in&#xD;
      diabetes treatment guidelines. In this study, it was aimed to reveal with a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study whether training on sleep hygiene will have an effect on blood glucose&#xD;
      regulation of Type 2 diabetes patients. Case and control groups will be formed by random&#xD;
      sampling method. Pıttsburgh sleep quality index will be applied face to face and HbA1c values&#xD;
      will be recorded for all patients included in the study. In addition, sleep hygiene training&#xD;
      will be given to the case group. Among the patients included in the study, the second HbA1c&#xD;
      levels of those who came for routine diabetes control within six months will be recorded and&#xD;
      the sleep hygiene education compliance scale will be applied to the case group. Differences&#xD;
      between groups will be evaluated using chi-square and Student's t tests. According to the&#xD;
      results of the research, it will be tried to decide whether sleep hygiene education can be&#xD;
      used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many studies in the literature examining the relationship between diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and poor sleep quality, most of the studies are cross-sectional. While the&#xD;
      relationship between sleep quality and blood glucose regulation was clearly shown in these&#xD;
      studies, very few studies aimed to observe the effect of sleep quality correction on blood&#xD;
      glucose regulation. As a result of this, of the 35 guidelines addressed in a meta-analysis&#xD;
      conducted in 2020 only 14 guidelines included sleep in their recommendations, optimising&#xD;
      sleep duration and quality and the management of sleep disorders were discussed as a&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in 6 guidelines. In these also only 3 guidelines recommended optimal&#xD;
      sleep duration as a therapeutic target of life style intervention and self-management&#xD;
      education with one guideline identifying optimal sleep as a means of achieving glycaemic&#xD;
      targets in T2DM .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised controlled study, it is aimed to provide evidence for the guidelines on&#xD;
      the treatment of diabetes by demonstrating whether the education that includes simple&#xD;
      lifestyle changes to increase sleep hygiene will have an effect on blood glucose regulation&#xD;
      of Type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the power analysis based on the tests to be used, when Type 1 error (α) = 0.05, Type 2&#xD;
      error (1-β) = 0.95, effect size is considered as 0.5; it was calculated that the sample size&#xD;
      should be 210 (105 for each group) in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sleep disorders, language or psychiatric problems known to interfere with&#xD;
      responding to the questionnaire, and patients whose antidiabetic treatment was changed at the&#xD;
      first control examination will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their first visit, the participants will be administered a routine diabetes control&#xD;
      including HbA1c measurements, as well as a sociodemographic data collection questionnaire&#xD;
      prepared by the researchers, a questionnaire consisting of 20 questions including questions&#xD;
      about diabetes and sleep problems, and the Turkish version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality&#xD;
      Index (PSQI) by face-to-face interview technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, each patient included in the case group was given a brochure containing&#xD;
      one-on-one sleep hygiene education and 10 lifestyle changes related to sleep hygiene, the&#xD;
      content of which was created by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations in the sleep hygiene leaflet :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enter the bed when you feel sleepy. If you lie in bed for more than half an hour, get&#xD;
           out of bed. When you feel sleepy, go back to bed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not sleep more than 1 hour during the day time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid heavy and fatty meals in the evening, do not go to bed very hungry or very&#xD;
           satiated. Avoid beverages such as coffee, tea, coke, energy drinks and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise or walk regularly in the evening, but avoid physically strenuous activities 3-4&#xD;
           hours before bedtime&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order for your body clock to work properly, live regularly. Get out of bed at the&#xD;
           same time everyday. Wake up at the time you should wakeup in the morning, even if you&#xD;
           went to bed at a different time of the night. Follow this rule, even on the weekend, and&#xD;
           make it a habit to always get up at the same time. Sleeping and awakening times are&#xD;
           important in maintaining sleep patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use the bed for sleep purposes only. Do not do activities such as eating, watching TV,&#xD;
           reading a book, or planning the next day in bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Make sure your bedroom is quiet and dark&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid exciting activities such as watching horror movies or reading adventure boks&#xD;
           before going to bed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Try to avoid a stressful life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Never take sleeping pills without your doctor's knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the next visit of all participants, a second visit PSQI will be administered in addition&#xD;
      to HbA1c, and a statement-based &quot;sleep hygiene education compliance questionnaire&quot; will be&#xD;
      administered to the case group, questioning whether they have complied with the items in the&#xD;
      sleep hygiene education material recommended at the first interview.&#xD;
