  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common neurological disease, manifested in the sudden abnormal discharge of&#xD;
      neurons leading to short-term brain dysfunction, has become the neurology after headache the&#xD;
      second most common disease. In China, the prevalence of epilepsy is about 4.7-8.5 per 1,000,&#xD;
      and more than 400,000 new cases of epilepsy are developed each year. Of these, 30% of&#xD;
      patients were treated with ineffective medication, developing into a drug-incurable epilepsy&#xD;
      that required surgery and other treatments. The most common type of epilepsy is temporal lobe&#xD;
      epilepsy, while the common complication in temporal lobe epilepsy is hippocampal sclerosis,&#xD;
      which often requires surgical removal. The incidence of inner temporal lobe epilepsy&#xD;
      associated with hippocampal sclerosis is increasing, but its exact cause and specific&#xD;
      pathogenesis are still unclear, so clarifying its pathogenesis will contribute to the&#xD;
      understanding of temporal lobe epilepsy and the improvement of surgical procedures. This&#xD;
      study is intended to get single-cell transcriptome as well as spatial transcriptome data of&#xD;
      temporal lobe and hippocampus samples. By studying gene expression change associated with&#xD;
      epilepsy and hippocampus sclerosis, we intended to find possible prognostic-related molecules&#xD;
      and to deepen understanding of pathological changes in epilepsy at the molecular level.&#xD;
