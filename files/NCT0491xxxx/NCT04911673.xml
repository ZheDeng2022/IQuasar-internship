  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a pain that occurs in the menstrual period without pathological&#xD;
      pelvic disorder. Excessive prostaglandin release causes uterine contraction and leads to&#xD;
      uterine hypoxia and ischemia, which results in extreme abdominal cramps and pain. Music&#xD;
      therapy is one of the complementary treatment methods in the management of pain for PD which&#xD;
      is an intervention that is not expensive and has no side effects. Another complementary&#xD;
      treatment method is for PD is chocolate. In the literature; there have a few studies about&#xD;
      the effect of the music and dark chocolate on the primary dysmenorrhea but no studies have&#xD;
      been conducted to evaluate the effects of the music and dark chocolate on PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is the protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial, where an&#xD;
      experimental group 1 listened to a 30-minute song, an experimental group 2 ate dark chocolate&#xD;
      and a control group had no intervention for the same time and conditions. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effect of dark chocolate and music on PD. This pain measured&#xD;
      through a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in nursing students from the Faculty of Health&#xD;
      Sciences at the Manisa Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey. Additionally, State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess the trait and state anxiety.&#xD;

      Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD) is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen, which occurs&#xD;
      before or during menstruation without pelvic diseases. Contraceptive pills and non steroidal&#xD;
      anti inflammatory drugs are commonly used in the treatment of PD. International (66.5% to&#xD;
      92.5%) and Turkey (87.7% to 80.1%) in the studies among university students show that a high&#xD;
      percentage of dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea negatively affects the school absenteeism of girls,&#xD;
      their academic success and causes a lack of concentration. The rate of using pain medication&#xD;
      due to dysmenorrhea is high among students. Music therapy has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      relaxing the mind and body, relieving anxiety, enhancing security, and increasing pain&#xD;
      thresholds. Dark chocolate contains copper, which is used by the body to synthesize&#xD;
      neurotransmitters called collagen and endorphins. Endorphin hormone is an analgesic and&#xD;
      natural sedative to reduce pain intensity such as menstrual pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial was designed to determine the effect of eating dark chocolate&#xD;
      and listening music on PD, compared to a control group that no intervention in women of 18&#xD;
      years or older from the the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Manisa Celal Bayar University,&#xD;
      Manisa, Turkey.&#xD;
