  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nepal is a low-income country with over 3 million individuals with physical disabilities and&#xD;
      currently no government-run specialist rehabilitation services. The aim of this research&#xD;
      proposal is to work in partnership with a Nepal Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), the&#xD;
      Spinal Injury Rehabilitation Centre (SIRC, Nepal) to achieve the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estimate the rehabilitation needs in individuals after stroke, brain injury and spinal&#xD;
           cord injury in rural communities after discharge from SIRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. hold user and stakeholder workshops to explore the role of multidisciplinary&#xD;
           teleconferencing methods for remote assessment and management and agree systems for&#xD;
           piloting&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. deploy and pilot a novel telerehabilitation system to improve the lives of these&#xD;
           individuals, and evaluate it in terms of feasibility and acceptability&#xD;

      The methods to be used in each of the three work packages of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1: Identifying baseline and context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals discharged from SIRC between January 2018 and December 2019 will be identified&#xD;
      and recruited to the study. Initially, a cross sectional study will capture their experiences&#xD;
      and baseline community outcomes using both standardised quantitative outcome measures and&#xD;
      qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. Recruitment and data collection for this&#xD;
      part of the study will be conducted by partners in Nepal. Analysis and management of this&#xD;
      data will be joint between Nepal and Leeds teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 2: Assessing utility of telerehabilitation to address needs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by previous work package, user and stakeholder workshops will be used to explore the&#xD;
      role of multidisciplinary video teleconferencing, telemedicine follow-up clinics, remote&#xD;
      management using mobile phone camera monitoring and other methods identified to reach&#xD;
      consensus on interventions to address the most pressing clinical challenges. These workshops&#xD;
      will be facilitated by all the researchers and will involve service users, family members,&#xD;
      clinicians, hospital managers, community health providers, NGO representatives and national&#xD;
      policy makers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 3: Pilot and rapid evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telerehabilitation interventions agreed in work package 2 will then be piloted by the&#xD;
      clinical team at SIRC and the participants recruited in work package 1. This will involve&#xD;
      post discharge follow up facilitated by the telerehabilitation system, and may result in&#xD;
      further clinical rehabilitation care as appropriate (advice, provision of equipment, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is followed by a rapid, mixed-methods evaluation which will assess of the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of telerehabilitation interventions by incorporating:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of routinely collected clinical caseload data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standardised quantitative outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  semi-structured interviews with service user participants and focus group discussions&#xD;
           with staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  case studies of exemplar cases including video recording&#xD;
