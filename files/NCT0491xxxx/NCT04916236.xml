      This is a phase I / Ib study in which the safety of the combination therapy of RMC-4630 and&#xD;
      LY3214996 in the treatment of KRAS mutant cancers colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I dose-escalation study is designed to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of the combination regimen of RMC-4630 (SHP2-inhibitor) plus LY3214996 (ERK-inhibitor) in&#xD;
      patients with KRASm CRC, NSCLC or PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase Ib expansion cohort is designed to further characterize the safety of the selected&#xD;
      dose from the first stage of the study and to explore the clinical activity of RMC-4630 in&#xD;
      combination with LY3214996 in patients with metastatic KRASm PDAC.&#xD;
