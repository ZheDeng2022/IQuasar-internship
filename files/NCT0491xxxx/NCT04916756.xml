  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by&#xD;
      dysfunction of the exocrine glands, which results in sicca symptoms in affected patients.&#xD;
      JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated and playing as a key pathway in the differentiation&#xD;
      and activation of many lymphocytes, so that affect the pathogenesis of many autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases including pSS. JAK inhibitors have also been widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have confirmed that JAK/STAT pathway is activated in patients with pSS, and JAK&#xD;
      inhibitor may be effective for pSS. Filgotinib, the selective JAK1 inhibitor, is one of the&#xD;
      &quot;secondary generation&quot; JAK inhibitors developed these years. Lee et al. found that filgotinib&#xD;
      suppressed the IFN-induced transcription of differentially expressed genes and BAFF in human&#xD;
      primary salivary gland epithelial cells. In addition, filgotinib-treated mice exhibited&#xD;
      increased salivary flow rates and marked reductions in the lymphocytic infiltration of SGs,&#xD;
      indicating that JAK inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic approach for pSS. A randomized&#xD;
      phase 2 study is currently in progress to assess the safety and efficacy of filgotinib in&#xD;
      adult subjects with active Sjogren's syndrome. So far, there is no evidence of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of baricitinib in patients with pSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baricitinib, an oral inhibitor of JAK1/JAK2, was the second JAK inhibitor approved for&#xD;
      clinical use in RA. It has been approved for the treatment for moderate to severe active RA&#xD;
      in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or are intolerant to, one or more&#xD;
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The efficacy and safety of baricitinib in RA&#xD;
      have been extensively evaluated in pre-clinical animal models of arthritis, as well as in&#xD;
      clinical studies. There are also some reports of baricitinib used in other autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis and PMR/GCA. In a&#xD;
      double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 24-week phase 2 study across 11&#xD;
      countries, baricitinib treatment at a dose of 4 mg dose significantly improved the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of active SLE, with a high-resolution rate of 67% in SLEDAI-2K arthritis or rash,&#xD;
      and showed a safety profile consistent with previous studies into baricitinib to treat RA.&#xD;
      The study focused on specific organ manifestations, which benefited patients treated with&#xD;
      baricitinib with rash and arthritis. So far, only one study has focused on the potential&#xD;
      efficacy of baricitinib in SS. In that study, Aota et al. demonstrated baricitinib suppressed&#xD;
      IFN-γ-induced CXCL10 expression in human salivary gland ductal cells and suggested its&#xD;
      potential for the treatment of SS. Based on these, we thought that baricitinib might have&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit in patients with pSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to explore the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with pSS in this&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, open label, 24-weeks pilot study. We plan to enroll 11 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed as active pSS in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China. They will&#xD;
      be treated with baricitinib 2mg once a day for 24 weeks. We'll evaluate the disease activity&#xD;
      mainly by ESSDAI and ESSPRI score. And we'll also record the adverse reactions. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is the change of ESSDAI score at 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include: the minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) of ESSDAI, which was defined as&#xD;
      an improvement of ESSDAI of at least three points; the change of ESSDAI score at 24 weeks;&#xD;
      the change of ESSPRI and PGA score at 12 and 24 weeks; and remissions of organ involvement at&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks. The main inclusion criteria include: (1) ≥18 years old, (2) fulfill the&#xD;
      criteria of the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against&#xD;
      Rheumatism (EULAR) classification for primary SS, (3) with moderate or high activity of SS,&#xD;
      which was defined as EULAR primary SS disease activity index (ESSDAI) ≥5, and (4) with&#xD;
      serological activity defined as elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate&#xD;
      (ESR), and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG) level (excluding acute and chronic infection and other&#xD;
      factors). The main exclusion criteria include: (1) patients diagnosed with an active central&#xD;
      nervous system disease or dysfunction of a major organ (heart, liver, kidney); (2) pregnant&#xD;
      or lactating women; (3) current severe infections; and (5) undergoing glucocorticoids or&#xD;
      immunosuppressants treatment with stable dosage for less than 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Baseline information included demographics, SS duration, clinical manifestations, laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, current medications, and disease activity. Laboratory tests, including complete&#xD;
      blood counts, urinalysis, liver and renal function tests, ESR, and IgG test were performed at&#xD;
      each visit. Disease activity was assessed using the ESSDAI, EULAR primary SS patient reported&#xD;
      index (ESSPRI), and physician global assessment (PGA) scores. Patients were followed up at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after the initiation of baricitinib treatment. The concomitant medications&#xD;
      including steroids and immunosuppressants were not changed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to treatment, or minimal clinically important improvement (MCII), was defined as an&#xD;
      improvement of ESSDAI of at least three points23. Remissions of arthritis, cutaneous&#xD;
      involvement, and hematological involvement were defined as no points earned in the&#xD;
      corresponding items of the ESSDAI scoring system. The improvement of interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease (ILD) was determined by evaluating the patient symptoms and radiographic changes in&#xD;
      the pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan.&#xD;
