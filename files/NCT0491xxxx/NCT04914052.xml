  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper management of postoperative pain is an ongoing medical challenge. Inadequate treatment&#xD;
      of pain is associated with significantly worse patient outcomes. However, as pain is a&#xD;
      subjective experience accurate assessment is difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly used methods for pain assessment include the use of self-reports from patients, or&#xD;
      observers assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, both techniques are subjective to bias. Therefore, automatic assessment of pain&#xD;
      based on objective data would enable individualized patient care, optimize provided&#xD;
      anesthesia treatment and analgesic regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While research has shown that facial expressions are valid indicators of pain levels, to date&#xD;
      research has yet to yield a reliable clinical tool which can be easily implemented in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study we intend to assess the feasibility, of facial expression analysis by&#xD;
      using machine learning models of artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict pain&#xD;
      levels of patients experienced in the immediate post operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will take place in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage will include development of an AI algorithm that correlates facial recognition&#xD;
      with pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage will include validation of the algorithm by comparison of to standard pain&#xD;
      assessment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage each assessment of facial expressions will be filmed in a 30 second&#xD;
      segment and will be followed by an immediate pain assessment using two modalities, first will&#xD;
      be pain score assessed by an anesthesiologist attending the patient at that moment, second&#xD;
      will be VAS assessment by the participant patient. Three objective parameters: heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and respiratory rate will be recorded simultaneously from the automated record&#xD;
      keeping system used in every patient in the recovery room (post anesthesia care unit-PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assessments will take place at different time intervals according to the investigator's&#xD;
      decision, throughout the participant's staying in the post anesthesia care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the first stage, the second stage of the study will be done in the same&#xD;
      manner as described above regarding patients enrollment. Pain assessment will be done by VAS&#xD;
      and physician assessment as described above but this time will be correlated with pain&#xD;
      assessment by the algorithm developed in the first stage of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After consenting to participation patients will undergo an explanation on pain assessment&#xD;
      using VAS and then will proceed with surgery, inclusion in the study will not affect&#xD;
      anesthesia or surgery management in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will take place in the PACU. Upon admission to the PACU unit, all study&#xD;
      participants' facial expressions will be videoed by a camera placed in front of the patient's&#xD;
      bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facial expressions will be filmed in 30 second segments. A pain assessment will be&#xD;
      measured immediately following filming of each segment using two modalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain score assessed by an attending anesthesiologist assigned to the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS assessment by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three objective parameters: heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate will be&#xD;
           recorded simultaneously from the automated record keeping system used in every patient&#xD;
           in the PACU The quantity of segments filmed for each of the participants will be decided&#xD;
           by the investigator taking into account participant's cooperation level and VAS levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to engineer an accurate predictive model the dataset will also include participants&#xD;
      reporting a VAS of 0- experiencing no pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data collection, the data will be forwarded in a coded manner, according to&#xD;
      Clalit's data security regulations, to Third Eye systems a facial recognition software&#xD;
      company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For first stage Third Eye systems will analyze and process the data using AI and machine&#xD;
      learning models and develop an algorithm that can predict pain level by watching facial&#xD;
      expressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the first stage, the second stage of the study will be done in the same&#xD;
      manner as described above regarding patients enrollment. Pain assessment will be done by VAS&#xD;
      and physician assessment as described above but this time will be correlated with pain&#xD;
      assessment by the algorithm developed in the first stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study is pilot study to examine whether there is a positive correlation, on&#xD;
      a relatively small sample size analysis, using simple resources and limited data to perform&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a positive hypothesis can be confirmed, a second stage observational study&#xD;
      with a large sample size and an increased data source will be investigated.&#xD;
