  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Five Year programme designed to identify and evaluate human factors interventions&#xD;
      to improve the response to patients deteriorating following emergency surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme comprises four work packages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1: Qualitative interviews and observations to analyse current rescue systems;&#xD;
      Work Package 2: Identify and co-design interventions to improve rescue systems,involving both&#xD;
      staff and patients and carers; Work Package 3: Mixed-methods feasibility trial across 3 sites&#xD;
      in England, Work Package 4: Step-wedge randomised control trial based across 24 hospital&#xD;
      sites in England, evaluating efficacy of interventions in improving response to deteriorating&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient safety researchers study problems in healthcare systems which harm patients. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to study a healthcare situation where system problems are costing lives.&#xD;
      In Emergency General Surgery (EGS), dealing mainly with patients with severe abdominal pain,&#xD;
      the death rate after abdominal surgery to find out what's wrong (called 'laparotomy') is 5&#xD;
      times higher than for similar routine surgery. Studies of serious complications after major&#xD;
      operations show that when patients deteriorate after surgery, their chances of survival&#xD;
      depend on how quickly and how well clinical teams react. The investigators plan to analyse&#xD;
      how EGS teams currently treat deteriorating patients, and help them develop and test better&#xD;
      response systems. Up to 3000 deaths per year could be avoided if these systems were improved&#xD;
      . Human Factors science analyses how complex work systems succeed or fail, and how to improve&#xD;
      them. The investigators will conduct a Human Factors analysis of real life responses to&#xD;
      deterioration in EGS laparotomy patients, examining how staff actually deal with&#xD;
      deteriorating patients (referred to as &quot;work as done&quot;), and how this differs from official&#xD;
      guidelines (referred to as &quot;work as imagined&quot;). A modern approach to Human Factors called&#xD;
      &quot;Safety II&quot; studies both strengths and weaknesses of systems to design solutions. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this method to analyse current EGS rescue systems, and develop a new&#xD;
      system for managing deterioration, including ways of involving patients or carers&#xD;
      effectively. The investigators will test and modify this system until it can be shown that it&#xD;
      improves team performance during rescue. Once it appears stable and effective, the&#xD;
      investigators will test it in a multi-hospital trial. Hospitals will start using the new&#xD;
      system at different dates (decided by chance), and the investigators will compare their&#xD;
      performance before and after they start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and analyse what&#xD;
      worked well and why, to make sure the lessons are learned effectively.&#xD;

A focus group approach will be used in co-designing reform of the system for responding to post-operative deterioration, working with small groups of frontline clinical staff from relevant areas in the three Trusts involved.</description>
