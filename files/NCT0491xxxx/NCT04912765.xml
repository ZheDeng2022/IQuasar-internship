  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study of adjuvant intra-dermal NA DC vaccine combined with&#xD;
      intravenous nivolumab in patients with resectable HCC (group A) or CRLM (group B) planned for&#xD;
      curative surgery (with/without local ablation).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be consented prior to resection of HCC and CRLM. Genomic sequencing of&#xD;
      patient's blood and resected tumour will be performed, followed by tumour NA prediction and&#xD;
      production. Patients will undergo venesection to generate DCs which will be pulsed with&#xD;
      autologous NAs to produce the vaccine. 10 dose of intra-dermal NA DC vaccine will be&#xD;
      administered every 2 weeks together with IV nivolumab (starting from the second vaccine&#xD;
      dose). Patients will subsequently continue on adjuvant nivolumab to complete 1 year of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated based on relapse-free survival (RFS) at 24 months from surgery and&#xD;
      the analyses of specific anti-NA immune responses of autologous peripheral T cells by ELISPOT&#xD;
      and/or ICS assays. Safety data will also be obtained for patients who have received at least&#xD;
      one dose of treatment.&#xD;
