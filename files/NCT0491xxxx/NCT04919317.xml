  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of dexamethasone to non-liposomal bupivacaine in perineural blocks has been&#xD;
      shown to enhance pain control and prolong the time until first request for postoperative&#xD;
      narcotics in the fields of orthopedic, thoracic, and gynecologic surgery. This has not been&#xD;
      investigated in any types of breast surgery. The investigators assessed if the combination of&#xD;
      dexamethasone to bupivacaine in the preoperative field block prior to bilateral breast&#xD;
      reduction surgery resulted in improved pain control relative to bupivacaine alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine whether&#xD;
      the addition of dexamethasone to bupivacaine in a preoperative Pecs II block resulted in&#xD;
      improved pain control, relative to bupivacaine alone, in patients undergoing bilateral&#xD;
      reduction mammaplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a preassigned randomization list, patients were randomized to experimental and control&#xD;
      groups in a ratio of 1:1 upon enrollment. Both groups received PECS II bupivacaine field&#xD;
      blocks in the preoperative holding area, performed by an acute pain fellowship-trained&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. The experimental group received 29mL of 0.5% bupivacaine mixed with 1mL&#xD;
      4mg/mL dexamethasone per side. The control group received 29mL 0.5% bupivacaine mixed with&#xD;
      1mL 0.9 saline solution per side. To maintain the blinded aspect of the study, the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists were given pre-mixed vials labelled uniformly for the trial, regardless of&#xD;
      the patient's treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients all underwent bilateral breast reduction with a single surgeon. Postoperative&#xD;
      pain regimens were standardized. Subjective pain scores, narcotic consumption, 4-hour&#xD;
      interval vital signs, anti-emetic usage, and postoperative quality of life via an sf-36&#xD;
      questionnaire were all recorded per patient.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to the experimental or control groups. Each patient received the same Pecs II perineural block preoperatively with the same volume injected. Experimental group patients received 29mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 1mL of 4mg/mL dexamethasone, while control group patients received 29mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 1mL of 0.9% saline.</intervention_model_description>
