      Investigators aimed to explore the rehabilitation status of children with CP and anxiety of&#xD;
      their caregivers during the covid19 pandemic. Caregivers of children with CP who were under&#xD;
      follow up in the outpatient CP clinic were called up during pandemic period. 206 caregivers&#xD;
      who voluntarily accepted to participate were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      and evaluated about the rehabilitation status of their children. Demographic data, associated&#xD;
      problems of children, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Manual Ability&#xD;
      Classification System (MACS) levels were recorded from their files. For the statistical&#xD;
      analysis, IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (SPSS IBM, Turkey) programs were used. While evaluating the&#xD;
      study data, the suitability of the parameters to the normal distribution was evaluated with&#xD;
      the Shapiro Wilks test. Significance was evaluated at the p &lt;0.05 level.&#xD;
