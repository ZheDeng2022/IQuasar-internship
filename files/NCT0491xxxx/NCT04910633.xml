  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An article to present how cancer patients were taken in charge at Lyon University Hospital&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (France) during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and&#xD;
      May 2020 is under writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will present strategies that were set-up to avoid cross-contamination between patients and&#xD;
      caregivers, patients treatment adaptation (timing, dosage,..) and how consultations,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team meetings, surgical procedures and clinical trials were impacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of this article will also illustrate the characteristics of patients with a solid&#xD;
      tumor(s) that have been hospitalized during this timeframe for the COVID-19. How cancer type&#xD;
      and stage affect Covid severity and mortality.will be described for a small sample of&#xD;
      patients (44). These qualitative figures will be compared to literature current state of the&#xD;
      art.&#xD;

    <description>COVID-19 severity will be determined based on chest X-Ray damage as follow. Low severity : ≤25% of chest X-Ray damage, Middle severity: between 25-50% of chest X-Ray damage, High Severity : above 50% of chest X-Ray damage.&#xD;
A graphic will then be drafted to present the relationship between Covid-19 severity depending on patient age, cancer nature, and cancer stage.</description>
