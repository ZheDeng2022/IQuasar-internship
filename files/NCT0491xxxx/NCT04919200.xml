  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole-body plethysmography (WBP) is the gold standard for measuring lung volume, but its&#xD;
      clinical application is limited because it requires expensive equipment and is complicated to&#xD;
      use. Studies have shown that the single-breath helium dilution (SBHD) method, which is&#xD;
      commonly used in clinical practice, significantly underestimates lung volume in patients with&#xD;
      obstructive lung disease (OLD). Therefore, by comparing the differences in lung volume&#xD;
      measured by the SBHD method and WBP in patients with different severities of obstructive lung&#xD;
      disease, we aim to establish a correction equation for the SBHD method to determine the total&#xD;
      lung volume in obstructive lung disease patients.&#xD;
