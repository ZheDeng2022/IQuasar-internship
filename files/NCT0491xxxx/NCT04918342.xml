  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the impact of physical therapist led telehealth exercise programs on&#xD;
      people with Parkinson disease. Eligible participants will complete this program individually&#xD;
      or in a group of 9 other participants. The impact of participation in this program on motor&#xD;
      function, postural control, gait, quality of life, and self-efficacy for exercise will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program will be delivered 2 times per week for 8 weeks with examination of outcome&#xD;
      measures prior to and after completion. The investigators plan to enroll 20 participants with&#xD;
      10 completing a group program led by a physical therapist and 10 completing an individual&#xD;
      exercise program led by a physical therapist.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in &quot;Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test&quot; Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after the 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14 item outcome measure that examines postural control in standing. The measure includes items that assess anticipatory postural control, reactive postural control, somatosensory integration, and dynamic gait. The scores range from 0-28 points with 28 reflecting the best possible balance performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in &quot;Five Times Sit to Stand&quot; test time</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after the 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>For this outcome the participant is asked to perform sitting to standing transitions 5 times as quickly as possible. The time to complete the task is recorded. A lower time is associated with faster and more agile performance with sitting to standing transitions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10 meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure examines gait speed at comfortable and fast speeds. This will be performed using the Gait Rite mat which will collect information about gait characteristics, including step length, step width, and gait symmetry as well. A faster time is associated with better balance and walking ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Six Minute Walk Test Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome examines gait endurance by measuring the distance walked over 6 minutes on a level surface. A greater number of meters on the test is associated with better walking endurance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 score</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self report quality of life measure designed for individuals with Parkinson disease. There are 8 subsections which can be reported individually and the score can be calculated as a summary score out of 100%. A lower percentage is associated with lower disability related to Parkinson disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self Efficacy for Exercise Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This measures a person's confidence that they will exercise in a variety of situations.The score ranges from 0 to 90 with a higher score associated with a higher self efficacy for exercise behavior.</description>

    <description>The multidirectional exercise program will include cardiovascular training, strengthening, balance training, and flexibility training. This will be delivered 2 times per week for 8 weeks using telehealth and will be delivered by a physical therapist. The exercises will be modified to meet the participants needs. Intensity of exercise interventions will be monitored through patient self report and use of continuous heart rate monitoring.</description>
