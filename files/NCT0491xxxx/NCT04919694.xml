  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination of orbital compression surgery&#xD;
      with strabismus surgery is better than strabismus surgery after orbital compression surgery&#xD;
      in the treatment of moderate-to-severe thyroid associated ophthalmopathy&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a interventional case series. Patients with moderate-to-severe thyroid&#xD;
      associated ophthalmopathy will be randomized to receive combination of orbital compression&#xD;
      surgery with strabismus surgery or strabismus surgery after orbial compression&#xD;
      surgery.Patients will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life ,measured by GO-QoL(quality of life with Grave's Orbitopathy) .</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>All GO-QoL questions were scored as 'severely limited' (one point), 'a little limited' (two points) or 'not limited at all' (three points). The questions 1-8 for visual functioning (VF) and questions 9-16 for appearance (AP)were summed to produce two raw scores from 8 to 24 points and then transformed to two total scores from 0 to 100 by the following formula: total score = [(raw score - 8)/16 9 100]. In both cases, higher total scores indicate better QoL. When there were missing values, total scores were calculated for the remaining completed items. The transformation was then adjusted to total score = [(raw score - *)/(2x*) x100] where * is the number of completed items.</description>
