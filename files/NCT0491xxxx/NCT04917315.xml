  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical condition characterized by urgency (i.e., urinary&#xD;
      urinary urinary urgency that is difficult to delay and unbearable) with or without urge&#xD;
      incontinence, usually associated with frequency and nocturia. The main drug class used is&#xD;
      antimuscarinics, and the clinical utility of antimuscarinic drugs is limited due to its mild&#xD;
      efficacy and poor tolerability due to side effects of mechanisms such as dry mouth and&#xD;
      constipation. In addition to poor tolerability and mild efficacy, recent literature suggests&#xD;
      that long-term use of anticholinergics is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment effect of overactive&#xD;
      bladder symptoms through the change in the average number of urination per day after&#xD;
      administration of JLP-2002, a beta 3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist with an effective&#xD;
      alternative mechanism, for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each micturition. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated as the total number of micturitions that occurred over 3 days during the Base Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary. Baseline was defined as the average daily number of daily micturitions that occurred during the week of placebo run-in prior to Week 0 visit.</description>
