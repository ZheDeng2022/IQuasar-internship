  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual violence (SV) is a significant public health problem particularly among 18-24 year old&#xD;
      populations. A major risk factor for SV is alcohol use, which via its negative impact on&#xD;
      cognitive abilities and decision-making acts as a barrier to intervening in situations&#xD;
      at-risk for a SV. This study has two main goals: (1) to determine the effects of proximal&#xD;
      alcohol use on young (age 21 to 25) men's prosocial bystander behavior in situations&#xD;
      considered at-risk for SV, and (2) to determine the efficacy of an evidence-based, web-based&#xD;
      program called RealConsent, which has been augmented to include alcohol-specific content&#xD;
      within the context of bystander SV (&quot;RealConsent2.0&quot;), on men's prosocial bystander behavior.&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is prosocial bystander behavior and will be assessed via two&#xD;
      modes: (1) a virtual reality (VR) environment (&quot;B-SAVE&quot;) and (2) a validated self-report&#xD;
      measure of bystander behavior that has been modified to include assessment of proximal&#xD;
      alcohol use and presence of alcohol within the context.&#xD;

    <description>Bystander behavior will be assessed by a virtual reality (VR) environment titled, Bystanders in Sexual Assault Virtual Environments (B-SAVE). Participants experience a virtual &quot;house party&quot; and are exposed to 10 situations in which they can either intervene or not. Verbal responses to each situation are recorded and coded to assess for bystander behavior.</description>

    <measure>Self-Reported Bystander Behavior</measure>

    <description>The 30-item Bystander Behavior Scale involves a description of a scenario in which participants are asked if they were exposed to the scenario, did they engage in the behavior (yes/no), if they had been drinking alcohol (yes/no) and if alcohol was present (yes/ no). Response options range from 0 (no) to 1 (yes) for each of the items. A total score for bystander behavior is calculated ranging from 0 (minimum) to 30 (maximum), with higher scores indicating greater bystander behavior in the last three-months. alcohol (yes/no) and if alcohol was present (yes/ no).</description>
