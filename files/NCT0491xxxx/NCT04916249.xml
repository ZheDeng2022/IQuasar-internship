  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Tibetree Pain Relieving Plaster, an herbal&#xD;
      pain relief patch, may be able to reduce this pain. Tibetree Pain Relieving Plaster is&#xD;
      available as an over-the-counter (non-prescription) treatment for the temporary relief of&#xD;
      minor aches and pains in muscles and joints. This study is the first to test this treatment&#xD;
      in people who have had cancer.&#xD;

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory - Measure of Participant Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The short-form BPI will be used to quantify pain severity and pain interference. The BPI contains 4 pain severity items and 7 pain interference items, all rated on a scale from 0 to 10 (higher ratings indicate worse pain intensity/interference). A pain severity subscale score can be computed by taking the average rating of the 4 pain severity items. This subscale will be our primary outcome measure. A pain interference subscale score can be similarly computed for the 7 pain interference items. BPI should be completed prior to removing pain relieving plaster at the end of each day.</description>
