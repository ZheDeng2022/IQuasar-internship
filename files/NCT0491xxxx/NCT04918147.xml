    <textblock>
      This is a two-part multi-center clinical trial in participants with active IgG4-RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Cohort 1a and Cohort 1B) is an open-label, dose escalation phase to determine the&#xD;
      safety of elotuzumab for investigation in IgG4-RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Cohort 2) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded (masked) trial phase to&#xD;
      compare the effects of elotuzumab and prednisone to elotuzumab placebo and prednisone in&#xD;
      participants with IgG4 RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 75 participants with active IgG4-RD will be enrolled in the overall program, 12&#xD;
      in Part 1 and 63 in Part 2. Randomization in Part 2: 2 to 1, with approximately forty-two&#xD;
      participants randomized to elotuzumab plus prednisone taper, and twenty-one participants&#xD;
      randomized to placebo for elotuzumab plus prednisone taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of participant follow-up in this trial will be 48 weeks (11 months).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory condition that&#xD;
      can affect virtually every organ system, including the pancreas, biliary tract, salivary and&#xD;
      lacrimal glands, orbits, lungs, kidneys, meninges, pituitary gland, prostate and thyroid. It&#xD;
      may also involve the retroperitoneum. This multi-organ immune-mediated condition, once&#xD;
      regarded as a group of isolated, single-organ diseases, is now recognized to be an&#xD;
      overarching, single-disease entity linked by common histopathological and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgG4-RD tends to afflict middle-aged to elderly individuals. Although IgG4-RD can affect a&#xD;
      single organ at presentation, it is not uncommon for participants to present with or develop&#xD;
      multi-organ disease. As the disease progresses, additional organs develop lesions and the&#xD;
      cellular inflammation characterizing early disease moves toward a more fibrotic stage,&#xD;
      causing major tissue damage, dysfunction and ultimately organ failure. It is unclear whether&#xD;
      IgG4 itself is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of IgG4-RD treatment are to reduce inflammation and organ swelling and to prevent&#xD;
      or reverse tissue fibrosis. No approved therapy exists for IgG4-RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adult participants who meet the 2019 American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Classification Criteria for&#xD;
      IgG4-RD, and who have active IgG4-RD with disease manifestations in at least two organ&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of the addition of elotuzumab to prednisone in&#xD;
           participants with IgG4-RD, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of the addition of elotuzumab versus placebo to prednisone on the&#xD;
           IgG4-RD Responder Index (IgG4-RD RI), a measure of IgG4-RD disease activity.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy while enrolled in&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. IgG4-RD that is dominated primarily by advanced fibrotic lesions (°)&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Specifically, participants whose disease manifestations consist only of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  retroperitoneal fibrosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  fibrosing mediastinitis,&#xD;

               -  sclerosing mesenteritis, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Riedel's thyroiditis&#xD;
&#xD;
             (°) Participants with these (Exclusion item 16) disease manifestations can be&#xD;
             included, however, only if they have disease in 2 organ systems that is not of an&#xD;
             advanced fibrotic nature and otherwise meet the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Co-enrollment: While participating in AIG01, participants may not be in another&#xD;
             interventional trial, but may be in observational registries or cohorts as long as the&#xD;
             total combined volume of blood to be drawn does not exceed the National Institutes of&#xD;
             Health (NIH) limit of and objectives do not confound the current study.&#xD;
