  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer death in Canada in&#xD;
      2019 [1]. Localized pancreatic cancer may be classified as resectable, borderline resectable,&#xD;
      or locally advanced. To date, radical surgical resection and adjuvant treatment provide the&#xD;
      greatest chance of long-term disease control and overall survival [2,3]. Despite this&#xD;
      favourable group, the five-year survival rates are approximately 20% [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) has been widely accepted for&#xD;
      the management of borderline resectable PC (BRPC) to increase the likelihood of achieving R0&#xD;
      resection [4-7]. However, to date, NAT for RPC is still an area of debate due to the lack of&#xD;
      large prospective randomized controlled trials that compare this technique to surgery plus&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) uses modern radiotherapy planning and&#xD;
      targeting technologies to precisely deliver larger, ablative doses of radiotherapy in 1-8&#xD;
      fractions. The role of SABR in RPC has yet to be fully established. The typical goal of&#xD;
      radiation therapy in the neoadjuvant setting is to improve local control and increase R0&#xD;
      resection rates. However, there are still concerns about the timing of surgery after SABR and&#xD;
      any implementation should be evaluated for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments inherently changes the tumour and can cause immunomodulatory effects. SABR has&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic effects both directly on the tumour and by its interactions with the immune&#xD;
      system. In addition to the direct DNA damage, it is felt that SABR also increases T-cell&#xD;
      priming, antigen production and presentation. Pancreatic cancer's dense, collagen rich stroma&#xD;
      has prevented patients from receiving the same benefits of checkpoint inhibition that have&#xD;
      been achieved in other cancer sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goals: The primary goals of this study are to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant SABR patients with surgical PC. This proposal is specifically intended to&#xD;
      strengthen the correlative sciences evaluating pre- and post-treatment tissue samples and&#xD;
      serial plasma samples evaluating the immunomodulatory effects of neoadjuvant SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patients with upfront resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (RPC) with a plan to&#xD;
      proceed directly to curative surgery or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (BRPC) with a plan for neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy with the hopes of then proceeding&#xD;
      to a curative surgical resection will be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Endpoints: The primary objective is to determine the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant SABR in patients with PC. Secondary objectives include (1) determining the tumor&#xD;
      perfusion with serial dynamic contrast enhanced CT imaging studies; (2) evaluating serial&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples for changes in markers of inflammation or immune activation using&#xD;
      O-link's plasma-based proteomics platform; (3) T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing from RNA&#xD;
      isolated from the buffy coat from serial whole blood samples; (4) Digital spatial profiling&#xD;
      on FFPE samples from pre-treatment biopsy tissue and post-treatment surgical resection&#xD;
      samples to examine CD3, CD8, PD-L1 expression and other markers of immunomodulation; (5) RNA&#xD;
      sequencing (RNA-Seq) will be conducted on pre- and post-treatment samples to examine the gene&#xD;
      expression profile within specific areas of the tumor environment; (6) examining the&#xD;
      influence of SABR on classic biomarkers such as CEA and CA19-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Upfront RPC (n=10) and BRPC (n=20) with the expectation of approximately 10&#xD;
      participants receiving neoadjuvant SABR on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Studies: Patients in both arms will receive both a hybrid PET/MRI scan and a dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced (DCE-CT) scan prior to SABR to define high metabolic regions (using 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET), define the whole tumour border (using MRI), and to define baseline perfusion parameters&#xD;
      such as blood flow, blood volume, permeability surface, and mean transit time (using DCE-CT).&#xD;
      This information will be used to define regions that will receive high doses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. These patients will also receive a DCE-CT scan six hours after the first of three&#xD;
      radiation treatments and 4 weeks following SABR (before surgery) to investigate changes in&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;
