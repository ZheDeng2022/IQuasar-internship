  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the tissue penetration of a broad-spectrum orally bioavailable&#xD;
      carbapenem, tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide (SPR994) (Spero Therapeutics, Inc.), into the&#xD;
      extracellular, interstitial fluid of soft tissue in diabetic patients with lower limb wound&#xD;
      infections. Penetration will be compared with a group of healthy volunteer control&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 10 patients with diabetes who are admitted with a lower limb wound&#xD;
      infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants. The study will take place in an&#xD;
      inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at&#xD;
      Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers. All participants will receive 3 to 7 doses of&#xD;
      tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide (300 mg or 600 mg orally every 8 hours depending on renal&#xD;
      function). A microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc., N. Chelmsford, MA) will be inserted into&#xD;
      the subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the wound (patients) or in the thigh (healthy&#xD;
      volunteers). The microdialysis probe is perfused with normal saline solution and samples are&#xD;
      collected for the 8 hours following the final dose. A peripheral intravenous catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples simultaneously with microdialysis samples.&#xD;
      Concentrations in tissue are compared with blood to determine percent penetration.&#xD;

Venous blood will be obtained via peripheral intravenous catheter immediately before administration of the last dose (pre-dose timepoint), and at 9 time-points post-dose. Dialysate samples of 120μL will be collected in 200µL microvials simultaneously with plasma samples.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria - All patients/participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants in the diabetic wound group or healthy volunteer group will be excluded if any&#xD;
        of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Less than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to tebipenem or its derivatives and any&#xD;
             β-lactam antibiotic&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of hypersensitivity to lidocaine or lidocaine derivatives&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrently receiving probenecid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Males who are not surgically sterilized (with female partners of childbearing&#xD;
             potential) and females of childbearing potential must agree to use two highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception from screening, during this trial, and for 90 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug. A woman is considered of childbearing potential&#xD;
             unless postmenopausal (≥1 year without menses) or surgically sterilized via bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or successful Essure® placement&#xD;
             with a documented confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception is defined as a method of contraception that has a less than&#xD;
             1% failure rate when used consistently and correctly. These methods are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring,&#xD;
                  injectables, and implants).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double-barrier methods of contraception (eg, male condom with diaphragm or male&#xD;
                  condom with cervical cap).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence, in accordance with the lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other documented reason felt by the investigator to potentially affect the&#xD;
             outcomes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Diabetic Patient Study Group&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants likely to require multiple surgical interventions during the study&#xD;
             period, which could affect placement of the microdialysis catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 30ml/min, as calculated by Cockroft-Gault using ideal&#xD;
             body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Volunteer Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 50ml/min, as calculated by Cockroft-Gault using ideal&#xD;
             body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia as defined by hematocrit,&#xD;
             platelet, or white blood cell count &lt; 75% of the lower limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase greater than&#xD;
             five times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Total bilirubin greater than three times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any known active co-morbidity listed on medical history or that becomes apparent&#xD;
             during physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Positive urine drug screen (cocaine, THC, opiates, benzodiazepines, and amphetamines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14&#xD;
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of&#xD;
             hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalence of 5&#xD;
             cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Consumption of caffeine between Study Days -1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;

             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication, with the exception of acetaminophen at doses of ≤ 1 g/day. The use of&#xD;
             hormonal methods of contraception (including oral and transdermal contraceptives,&#xD;
             injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants, progesterone-releasing IUDs,&#xD;
             postcoital contraceptive methods) are permitted.&#xD;
