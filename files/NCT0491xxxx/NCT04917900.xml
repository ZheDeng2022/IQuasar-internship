  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the Pyrotinib in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel and&#xD;
      trastuzumab to neoadjuvant therapy efficacy and safety of Her2-positive early or locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who met the criteria for admission were treated with pyrotinib combined with&#xD;
      albumin-bound paclitaxel and trastuzumab (q3w) neoadjuvant therapy for 6 cycles before&#xD;
      surgery, and DCR and ORR were assessed before surgery.All subjects who are suitable for&#xD;
      surgery undergo surgery and evaluate their pCR rate (pathological complete remission&#xD;
      rate).After the operation, the subjects received adjuvant chemotherapy of epirubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride + cyclophosphamide (q3w) for 4 cycles, and at the same time, according to the&#xD;
      researcher's recommendation, they chose the follow-up anti-HER2 treatment plan: it is&#xD;
      recommended that subjects who have achieved pCR receive preoperative the same anti-Her2&#xD;
      treatment for 1 year; for non-pCR subjects, T-DM1 or trastuzumab and Pertuzumab can be used&#xD;
      for anti-her2 treatment for 1 year.For subjects whose estrogen receptor (ER) and/or&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (PR) are positive, endocrine therapy can be started at the end of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy.If there are clinical indications at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiotherapy can be given.&#xD;
