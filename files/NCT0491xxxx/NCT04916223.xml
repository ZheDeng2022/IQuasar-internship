  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic massage is the most common non-traditional treatment option offered to improve&#xD;
      quality of life, provide comfort and decrease pain in hospice and palliative care settings&#xD;
      outside the hospital. Three systematic reviews of data in general pain, surgical and cancer&#xD;
      populations found massage to be effective for treating pain versus active comparators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the remarkable negative impact on QOL experienced by patients hospitalized with a&#xD;
      serious progressive illness, a nationwide opioid crisis in the setting of public concern for&#xD;
      untreated pain, and patient demand for integrative therapies, we wish to investigate&#xD;
      non-traditional methods of supporting patients in pain and providing clinicians with viable&#xD;
      alternatives. Unfortunately, very little is known about optimal delivery of massage&#xD;
      interventions in the hospital setting, including dosing parameters such as time and frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a single center comparative effectiveness study to evaluate therapeutic massage&#xD;
      &quot;dosing&quot; to improve self-reported quality-of-life in hospitalized patients receiving&#xD;
      palliative care consultation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care (PC) provides expert symptom management and communication skills for patients&#xD;
      and families facing serious life-limiting illness in the hospital. Many such patients&#xD;
      experience lower quality of life (QOL) due to moderate-severe pain or other symptoms and&#xD;
      require strong pharmacotherapies - often controlled substances such as opioids or&#xD;
      benzodiazepines - to alleviate associated distress. A major tenet of quality supportive care&#xD;
      is the combination of many types of therapy, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic.&#xD;
      Patients with serious life-limiting illnesses often rely on the use of nonpharmacologic&#xD;
      therapies to manage pain or other symptoms at home. However, implementing complementary&#xD;
      therapies in the hospital setting can be challenging and thus they are rarely available for&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with serious illness. Patients often request non-drug options, but&#xD;
      medications remain the mainstay of treating pain while hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic massage is the most common non-traditional treatment option offered to improve&#xD;
      quality of life, provide comfort and decrease pain in hospice and palliative care settings&#xD;
      outside the hospital. Nevertheless, there remains limited data describing the impact of&#xD;
      therapeutic massage in hospitalized patients receiving palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in the hospital setting, the logistical challenges of providing massage therapy&#xD;
      include a number of setting-specific factors. A massage therapy session may be interrupted by&#xD;
      care being provided by other members of the team, by personal visitors, or by the activities&#xD;
      of his/her roommate in a semi-private room. Also, the availability of massage therapy may be&#xD;
      such that a patient's session time is limited because of the high demand on the short amount&#xD;
      of time a non-integrated, contracted massage therapist has to see multiple patients. Given&#xD;
      the remarkable negative impact on QOL experienced by patients hospitalized with a serious&#xD;
      progressive illness, a nationwide opioid crisis in the setting of public concern for&#xD;
      untreated pain, and patient demand for integrative therapies, we wish to investigate&#xD;
      non-traditional methods of supporting patients in pain and providing clinicians with viable&#xD;
      alternatives. Unfortunately, very little is known about optimal delivery of massage&#xD;
      interventions in the hospital setting, including dosing parameters such as time and&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of different massage dosing strategies on&#xD;
      QOL, symptom management, and satisfaction in hospitalized patients already receiving PC&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;

    <description>The massage therapists were scheduled on a rotating schedule with two alternates scheduled for each day to ensure adherence to assigned study arm and to avoid &quot;therapist effect&quot; as much as possible. For each enrolled subject, the therapist assessed the subject and created a treatment plan depending on his/her individual needs and preferences. For example, if a subject reported bothersome lower extremity pain, the therapist might focus the massage on that lower extremity or might avoid massaging that lower extremity, depending solely on the preference of the subject. Massage duration was determined by the assigned study arm.</description>
