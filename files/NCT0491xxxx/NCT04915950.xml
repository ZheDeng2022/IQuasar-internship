  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral temanogrel improves digital blood flow&#xD;
      in participants with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc-RP) as a&#xD;
      potential safe and effective treatment for symptoms associated with SSc-RP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 stages: Stage A and Stage B. In both stages, participants&#xD;
      will be equally randomized in a double-blind manner to a 3-period crossover treatment&#xD;
      sequence. Separate cohorts of participants will participate in each stage. In Stage A,&#xD;
      participants will be treated with two dose levels of temanogrel and placebo. Doses in Stage B&#xD;
      will be determined based on the results of Stage A.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Raynaud's phenomenon (defined as a history of digital cold sensitivity associated with&#xD;
             color changes of cyanosis and pallor, with on average at least 5 attacks per week&#xD;
             during the winter period) secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women participants agree to use a highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control if the possibility of conception exists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index 18.0 to 40.0 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2), inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active digital ulcer(s), recent history (within 3 months of Screening) of digital&#xD;
             ulcers, or history of recurrent digital ulcerations that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator increase the likelihood of developing a digital ulcer during the course&#xD;
             of the study. Any history of gangrene, amputations, or other critical digital ischemic&#xD;
             event&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Raynaud's phenomenon due to any cause other than SSc&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe gastrointestinal complications related to SSc that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator could significantly affect study drug absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding or active gastric or duodenal ulcers&#xD;
