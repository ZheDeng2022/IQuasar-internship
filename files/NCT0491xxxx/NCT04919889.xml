  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives were (1) to evaluate the characteristics of the patients referred, and (2) the&#xD;
      effect of a community-based Exercise on Prescription program on their physical capacities and&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consisted in 30 supervised physical activity (PA) group sessions (75 min) over a&#xD;
      4-month period and participant were prescribed the program by their doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants had chronic diseases among type 2 diabetes, mental disorders,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders, childhood and adult obesity and stabilized cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and questionnaires were completed before and after the program. Physical tests were the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test, the timed up &amp; go, the 30-s stand up chair, the single leg support test&#xD;
      and the back scratch and toe-touch tests. Questionnaires were the self-administered Ricci and&#xD;
      Gagnon questionnaire about PA level and the 12-Item Short Form Survey for measuring quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal goal from the participants and medical objective from their doctors were collected&#xD;
      before the program.&#xD;
