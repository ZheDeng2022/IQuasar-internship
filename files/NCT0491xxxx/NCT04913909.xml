  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study evaluated clinically the effects of a probiotic on oral microbiota and&#xD;
      glycemic control in T2 diabetic patients with periodontal disease. The study was designed as&#xD;
      a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled interventional study. At baseline&#xD;
      and at the end of the 30 day- probiotic period, all clinical, microbiological, and&#xD;
      biochemical measurements were tested. Colony counts of oral microbiota, blood fructosamine&#xD;
      levels and CRP were the outcomes of the study.&#xD;

      Objectives: To investigate the effects of an oral probiotic use, containing 4 billion colony&#xD;
      forming unit (CFU/g) Streptococcus Salivarius M18 strain (Dentoblis™), on the quantities of&#xD;
      oral microbiota in saliva and metabolic markers of T2 diabetics such as fructosamine,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The trial was designed as a prospective randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo- controlled interventional study. Participants were selected from type 2 diabetics&#xD;
      with periodontitis and aged 30-65 years, who presented to the Diabetic Center in Istanbul.&#xD;
      Totally 70 patients were randomly assigned to probiotic or placebo groups. At baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of the 30 day-probiotic period, colony counts of oral microbiota and biochemical&#xD;
      measurements of diabetes were assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study.&#xD;
All patients took an oral hygiene education and were invited to give paraffin-stimulated saliva, and blood samples in the Diabetic Center. All patients were examined clinically and the results of the intraoral examination were recorded. During the intervention period of 30 nights, the participants were asked to let one Dentoblis™ or placebo lozenge slowly melt in their mouth for at least one minute before going to bed and after tooth brushing. Dentoblis™, contains 4x 109 CFU/g S. salivarius M18 strain probiotic isolated from a healthy oral microbiota.&#xD;
Neither the investigators nor the subjects were aware of the contents of the lozenges except for the research nurse, who was also responsible for keeping the codes and information confidential until after the statistical calculations. At baseline and at the end of the 30 day- intervention period, all measurements were retested.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The participants were randomized to the interventional groups, probiotic or placebo, by the diabetes nurse. During the intervention period of 30 nights, the participants were asked to let one Dentoblis™ or placebo lozenge slowly melt in their mouth for one minute before going to bed and after tooth brushing. Dentoblis™, as a test lozenge, contains 4x109 CFU/g S. salivarius M18 strain isolated from a healthy oral microbiota and has been utilized as oral probiotic inhibiting dental caries-causing pathogens.&#xD;
The placebo is indistinguishable in form, size, color, and taste from the probiotic lozenge, but contains no bacteria.
