  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) is widely used as an indirect technique for treatment&#xD;
      of moyamoya disease. Nevertheless, this indirect surgery tends to establish insufficient&#xD;
      collateral circulation in most adult MMD patients. Nowadays, there is a lack of adjuvant&#xD;
      therapies for improving collateral circulation induced by indirect revascularization. This&#xD;
      study aims to explore whether remote ischemic conditioning can improve the collateral&#xD;
      circulation after indirect revascularization.&#xD;

      Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) is widely used as an indirect technique for treatment&#xD;
      of moyamoya disease. Nevertheless, this indirect surgery tends to establish insufficient&#xD;
      collateral circulation in most adult MMD patients. Nowadays, there is a lack of adjuvant&#xD;
      therapies for improving collateral circulation induced by indirect revascularization. Remote&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a noninvasive approach protecting the brain by inflating and&#xD;
      deflating blood-pressure cuff placed on the upper limbs. It has been confirmed to improve&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion by promoting angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in ischemic animal brain. In&#xD;
      addition, daily remote ischemic conditioning is a promising technique to ameliorate chronic&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease like intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, small-vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to explore whether remote ischemic conditioning can improve the&#xD;
      collateral circulation after indirect revascularization.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who are allocated into RIC group will undergo the first EDAS surgery combined 3-month remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) treatment. The opposite operation will be performed at 3 months after the first operation.&#xD;
RIC is a non-invasive therapy that performed by an electric auto-control device with cuff placed on arm. RIC procedures consist of five cycles of 5-min inflation (200 mmHg) and 5-min deflation of cuff on one arm.&#xD;
EDAS involves placement of an external carotid artery branch beneath the dura in the ischemic territories. The superficial temporal artery (STA) was commonly used.</description>

    <description>Patients who are allocated into the control group will accept EDAS surgery twice. The second operation will be performed at 3 months after the first operation.&#xD;
EDAS involves placement of an external carotid artery branch beneath the dura in the ischemic territories. The superficial temporal artery (STA) was commonly used. Under certain circumstances, depending on the territory at risk, the occipital artery was also used. The donor vessel with the strip of galea (the arterial bridge) was detached from the pericranium or the fascia below, and two burr holes are made beneath the proximal and distal ends of the arterial bridge. The burr holes, with an average size of 3.0 × 8.0 cm, were connected by mill to make an oval bone flap and the dura was exposed. The target artery was then sewn to the dura using 10-0 Prolene suture. The bone flap was closed after cutting out the entry and exit sites for the target artery.</description>
