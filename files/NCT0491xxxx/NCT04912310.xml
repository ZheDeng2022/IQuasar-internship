  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the changes of angle structure and intraocular pressure after argon laser&#xD;
      peripheral iridoplasty in patients with acute angle closure glaucoma patients whose&#xD;
      intraocular pressure could not be controlled by drug therapy during the major attack period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate intraocular pressure and anterior segment optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      measurement parameters at baseline and each follow-up. Each patient was followed up for 6&#xD;
      weeks for 9 times. Visit 1st was baseline examination, visit 2nd was 1 hour after argon laser&#xD;
      peripheral iridoplasty treatment, visit 3rd was 2 hours after argon laser peripheral&#xD;
      iridoplasty treatment, visit 4th was 1 week after argon laser peripheral iridoplasty&#xD;
      treatment, visit 5th was 2 week after argon laser peripheral iridoplasty treatment, and visit&#xD;
      6th was 1 month after argon laser peripheral iridoplasty treatment, visit 7th was 6 week&#xD;
      after argon laser peripheral iridoplasty treatment.&#xD;
