  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical Radiculopathy is a clinical disorder of nerve root, and often is due to compressive&#xD;
      or inflammatory pathology. There are number of different procedures which have been suggested&#xD;
      for decreasing pain and disability in patients but manual therapy has been validated the&#xD;
      effective technique. The objective of current research was to assess the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Manual Cervical Traction and the Natural Apophyseal Glides on pain and&#xD;
      disability among Cervical Radiculopathy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel design, randomized controlled trial was performed on 72 patients in physiotherapy&#xD;
      department, Mayo Hospital Lahore. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups after&#xD;
      baseline testing. Group A received natural apophyseal glides and baseline treatment and group&#xD;
      B received manual cervical traction and baseline treatment. Treatment period was of 3 weeks&#xD;
      with 3 weekly sessions on alternate basis. Assessment was done before treatment at baseline&#xD;
      and then by second and third week using numeric pain rating scale and neck disability index.&#xD;
      SPSS version 25 was used to analyzed the data.&#xD;

      72 patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Written informed&#xD;
      consent was taken from every subject participating in this study. Allocation of subjects in&#xD;
      two groups has been done by random number table as per CONSORT guidelines 2010. Group A was&#xD;
      treated with Natural Apophyseal Glides and group B with Manual Cervical Traction. Both groups&#xD;
      received the conventional therapy along with the manual techniques. The conventional therapy&#xD;
      included hot pack, Neck range of motion exercises, neck strengthening and stabilization&#xD;
      exercises. The hot pack is a form of thermo therapywas applied for 10 to 15 minutes and was&#xD;
      applied at each visit during 3 sessions per week for total 3 weeks. The strengthening and&#xD;
      stabilization exercises are form of therapeutics exercise are prescribed at 15 to 20 times&#xD;
      per session for total 3 weeks. Intensity of exercise may rise gradually according to patient&#xD;
      tolerance and muscular strength.The conventional or baseline therapy remained same throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A received conventional therapy and NAGS with 2-3 hertz (less than 6 repetitions) in 3&#xD;
      sets for 3 weeks. Group B received MCT along with traditional therapy. Treatment frequency&#xD;
      was 3 sessions per week for total three weeks duration. MCT applied was intermittent type&#xD;
      traction.8 to 10 kg force was applied at an angle of 20 to 25 degree from horizontal. 5sets&#xD;
      of cervical traction are performed. In every set traction is given for 1 minute with rest&#xD;
      period of 20 seconds. The total time of session was 10 minute.Pain intensity was measured by&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Functional ability was appraised by Neck Disability Index. All the&#xD;
      information was collected by using standardized questionnaire of NPRS and NDI. Confounding&#xD;
      variables are controlled by randomization and restriction methods. All treatment was given by&#xD;
      single handed to control the biasness.Proforma of the patients which dropout during study was&#xD;
      filled through intention to treat analysis method which was set as 15%.&#xD;
