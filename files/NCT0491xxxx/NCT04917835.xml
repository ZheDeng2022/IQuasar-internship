    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of argon-and nitrogen-&#xD;
      non-thermal, atmospheric-pressure plasma (NTAPP) for reduction of sebum excretion in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with oily facial skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive secretion of sebum contributes to several skin diseases associated with sebum&#xD;
      glands, including acne. Excessive sebum secretion can damage the skin barrier function by&#xD;
      changing the composition of skin surface lipids, leading to the abnormal keratinocyte&#xD;
      differentiation and hyperkeratosis in the follicular ostia. Follicular hyperkeratosis can&#xD;
      create anaerobic environment, leading to the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several energy devices targeting sebaceous glands have been developed, but there is&#xD;
      still a need for an effective and safe therapeutic tool for hyperseborrhea. Non-thermal,&#xD;
      atmospheric-pressure plasma (NTAPP) has various biological effects. A recent study&#xD;
      demonstrated NTAPP-induced microscopic tissue reactions in the sebaceous glands from rat skin&#xD;
      in vivo, suggesting that the potential effect of NTAPP on the human sebaceous gland&#xD;
      physiology, but the relevant data are lacking. In this study, investigators aim to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of argon- and nitrogen-NTAPP for reduction of sebum excretion in oily&#xD;
      human facial skin.&#xD;

    <description>The change in the casual sebum level is determined by measuring Sebumter® (SM815) from the German company Courage-khazaka. The measurement is performed in the three facial areas: forehead (mid-glabella), right and left cheeks (over the zygoma at the mid-pupillary line).</description>

    <description>Among subjects who completed the study, 2-mm skin punch biopsy specimens were obtained from zygomatic area of two volunteered subjects before and 2 weeks after argon- and nitrogen- non-thermal, atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment.</description>

    <description>Three sessions of argon- and nitrogen- NTAPP treatment at 1-week interval. Two passes of argon-NTAPP treatment and two passes of nitrogen-NTAPP treatment were sequentially performed in each session. Argon plasma at a pulse energy of 0.8 J/pulse with a 12 msec of pulse duration and nitrogen-plasma at a pulse energy of 0.75 J/pulse delivered with a 7 ms of pulse duration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Persons aged 19 to 40 years who are determined to have oily skin type. Skin types were&#xD;

             manufacturer's guidelines as follows: &gt; 220 μg/cm2 on forehead and &gt; 180 μg/cm2 on&#xD;
             cheeks, oily type; 100-220 μg/cm2 on forehead and 70-180 μg/cm2 on cheeks, normal&#xD;
             type; &lt; 100 μg/cm2 on forehead and &lt; 70 μg/cm2 on cheeks, dry type.&#xD;
