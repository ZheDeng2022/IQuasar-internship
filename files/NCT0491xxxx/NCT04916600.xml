  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled, superiority&#xD;
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of the NET device in treating persons with Opioid Use&#xD;
      Disorder (OUD) without use of Medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) for persons who have&#xD;
      expressed a desire to be opioid abstinent without use of MOUD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to determine whether use of the NET device increases illicit&#xD;
      opioid abstinence without use of MOUD, relative to sham treatment given under the same&#xD;
      experimental conditions, in persons meeting DSM-5 criteria for OUD. The NET device is an&#xD;
      investigational Non-Significant Risk device that delivers alternating current via surface&#xD;
      electrodes placed transcranially on the mastoid regions. All participants will be screened&#xD;
      and undergo evaluation at Isaiah House, a treatment center located in Willisburg, KY.&#xD;
      Individual participant treatment (duration of the active/sham device use) is 1 hour and&#xD;
      extendable by participant choice, but not to exceed 7 days, delivered at the inpatient&#xD;
      facility (typically 28 days duration), with weekly follow-up assessments (efficacy and safety&#xD;
      endpoints) following discharge (by video) for a 12-week outpatient study period. Total&#xD;
      elapsed time will typically be 16 weeks. The primary endpoint is each participant's overall&#xD;
      percentage of weekly abstinence from illicit opioid use without use of MOUD, based on&#xD;
      negative oral fluid samples and self/pharmacy reports of illicit opioid, methadone,&#xD;
      buprenorphine, and naltrexone use per week (unit of analysis) during the 12-week outpatient&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled and superiority in design. Study enrollees will be assigned in equal proportions (1:1) to one of two groups: active or sham treatment. Group assignment will be stratified on the presence of any current non-opioid Substance Use Disorder (SUD), i.e., differentiation of &quot;pure OUD&quot; group (no other SUD) vs. &quot;OUD + polysubstance group&quot;, and by sex. (Note: given the exclusion of severe non-opioid SUD in this study, polysubstance use would only include those individuals with mild- or moderate-severity non-opioid SUD). The biostatistician will perform stratified randomization to maintain balance between active and sham groups. The biostatistician will maintain the blinding so that the study sponsor, PI, research assistants, treatment staff, and the participants remain blinded. No interim analysis is planned.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Sham controls for placebo effects, and is designed to minimize sham recognition by participants, research, and treatment personnel. Active and sham arms will receive identical device care and use instructions, equipment, and attachment locations. Visual cues from the device &quot;heartbeat&quot; indicator (light-emitting diode) indicate the device is working. Sham and active both use the NET device without alteration. Sham uses a lead wire rendered non-conductive beforehand, preventing electrical stimulation. The biostatistician will randomly and uniquely assign a pre-printed Study Device Number (SDN) to each lead wire by overlaying a heat shrink tube, pre-printed with a unique SDN, recording the active and sham assignments. Lead wires are inserted into the device. The biostatistician will keep the data in a secure database and will not be involved in recruitment or study procedures. Unblinding will only occur when necessary for treating an adverse event.</masking_description>
