  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a response to problems with Cardiovascular Disease in Colombia, where&#xD;
      circulatory system diseases are the first cause of mortality in the adult population, making&#xD;
      them a critical issue for the country. It is known that around 70% of cardiac arrests occur&#xD;
      outside health institutions, generally at home or on public roads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce these high mortality rates, international recommendations were issued to establish&#xD;
      strategies to train the general population in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, especially&#xD;
      school-age children. This constitutes a key stage for initiating learning. This condition&#xD;
      significantly favors learning and preserving the acquired knowledge for the rest of their&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the reasons above, this pilot project seeks to be the first approach at the national&#xD;
      level to train second-grade elementary school children in Basic Life Support. This training&#xD;
      will describing the step by step experiences of the participants, focusing on: project&#xD;
      viability related to recruitment and follow-up, acceptability, the experience of&#xD;
      participation from the educational community, and the effects of implementing the&#xD;
      intervention on the knowledge and skills in the child population. A virtual protocol will be&#xD;
      implemented (adapted to the current situation generated by the Coronavirus pandemic), and&#xD;
      will be developed through didactic methodologies in three 60-minute educational sessions,&#xD;
      during regular class hours.&#xD;

      1. Research question What are the viability, acceptability, and potential effects of&#xD;
           implementing the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja version intervention in two schools in&#xD;
           the city of Tunja in 2021?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the viability, acceptability, participation experience, and potential&#xD;
           effects of implementing the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja version intervention, in two&#xD;
           schools in the city of Tunja in 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific objectives To carry out the characterization of the child population under&#xD;
           study. To describe the viability of the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja version&#xD;
           intervention in terms of recruitment and follow through.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the acceptability of the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja version intervention&#xD;
           for the child population that receives it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the experience of participating in the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja&#xD;
           version intervention for the academic community.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the effects of the UN Lifeguard Kids in the Tunja version intervention on&#xD;
           theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the child population that receives it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A sample population of 70 children was determined as appropriate for the study. Two&#xD;
           second-graded classes were selected to fulfill this requirement. Children were assigned&#xD;
           to a control or test group using simple random sampling. Finally, five additional&#xD;
           children were added to reduce sample attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Biases control&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Selection bias: It will be controlled in this study by strictly complying with the&#xD;
                inclusion and exclusion criteria. Likewise, by applying the random blocks&#xD;
                methodology for the allocation of the intervention and control group, guaranteeing&#xD;
                an equitable distribution of children. Another measure is the application of the&#xD;
                double-blind method so that neither the participants nor the research assistants&#xD;
                responsible for measuring response variables, know which group they belong to or&#xD;
                which intervention they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Detection biases: It will be controlled by including five nursing professionals who&#xD;
                are not part of the study to carry out the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attrition biases: There are two steps to control attrition. Firts, children will be&#xD;
                motivated in each session through playful methodologies and novel didactic&#xD;
                material, encouraging continued participation. Second, sessions will be within the&#xD;
                usual class schedule to prevent abandonment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Notification bias: It will be controlled through an ethical commitment by the&#xD;
                researcher when publishing the complete results of the interventions. Additionally,&#xD;
                these results will be publically available through the clinicaltrial.org portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confusion biases: it will be controlled by randomization; distributing the known&#xD;
                and unknown confounding variables equally between the groups and therefore,&#xD;
                avoiding possible biases in the analysis. Subsequently, a comparison of the&#xD;
                confounding variables will be made between the experimental and control groups&#xD;
                before analyzing the response variables to identify the equivalence of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used for the analyses of the&#xD;
           qualitative variables, through the distribution of frequencies and proportions. For&#xD;
           continuous quantitative variables, descriptive statistics will be used with measures of&#xD;
           central tendency (i.e. average and SD), dispersion, and 95% confidence intervals. For&#xD;
           the intra- and inter-group comparisons of the continuous quantitative response&#xD;
           variables, adjustment tests will be performed using the Kolgomorov Smirnov Gaussian&#xD;
           model. If the adjustment is satisfactory, the comparisons will be made with paired&#xD;
           Student's T-tests for intragroup and unpaired Student's T-tests for the intergroup&#xD;
           analyses. Otherwise, Wilcoxon and Man Whitney U signed-rank tests will be performed,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
