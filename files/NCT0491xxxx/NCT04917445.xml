  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the utilization of the SPIKES protocol for&#xD;
      delivering bad news is perceived to be more compassionate and effective than the current&#xD;
      standard of care for IVF patients receiving negative pregnancy test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, nurses at Boston IVF (BIVF) and Weill Cornell Medical Center Division of&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine (Cornell) do not have a scripted method to deliver negative pregnancy&#xD;
      tests to in Vitro Fertilization (IVF) patients. This study will invite clinic nurses to&#xD;
      assist in the research protocol; half of the nurses will be randomized to be trained on a&#xD;
      compassionate way to deliver bad news following the SPIKES protocol, while the other half&#xD;
      will continue with the current standard of care of news delivery. The patients who receive&#xD;
      the negative test phone calls from participating nurses will be surveyed to see if the method&#xD;
      of which the news was delivered was scored as more compassionate, as well as if it was&#xD;
      associated with reduced participants reported level of distress and depression.&#xD;

    <description>We revised the Communicating Bad News questionnaire which follows the SPIKES protocol, published by Gonzales-Cabrera et al. Their questionnaire had 25 items, Internal consistency was 0.816. The content validity was established via the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (KMO) with a score of 0.683 and the Bartlett test of sphericity was p&lt;0.001. The principal component analysis supported a four dimension construct. There are 22 items rated 1, 2, 3 with a scoring range of 22-66. For the Compassion Assessment, there are 19 slots for the 5 categories so the scoring range is 5-95.
