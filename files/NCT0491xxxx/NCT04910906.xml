      The goal of this multi-centre, prospective, open label, single arm, observational post-market&#xD;
      clinical follow-up study (§23b of the MPG (German Medical Act) MDD 93/42/EEC and&#xD;
      ISO14155:2020) is to investigate and evaluate the clinical efficacy of Ectoin® Vaginal gel&#xD;
      (EIC01) to retain/restore the natural moisturization in the vaginal lumen and to alleviate&#xD;
      vaginal atrophy symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, prospective, open label, single arm, observational post-market clinical&#xD;
      follow-up study according to §23b of the MPG (German Medical Act) and conforming to MDD&#xD;
      93/42/EEC and ISO14155:2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will be offered to patients with symptoms of vaginal atrophy for which&#xD;
      Ectoin® Vaginal Gel is indicated. Screening period might take up to 14 days. If the patient,&#xD;
      at the screening visit, complies with all the inclusion criteria (except inclusion criterion&#xD;
      No. 4 which is to be confirmed at the Baseline Visit) and she has signed the informed&#xD;
      consent, she will be enrolled, and baseline visit will be performed on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ectoin® Vaginal Gel will be used for 20 days and in accordance with the IFU . Visits are&#xD;
      scheduled on day 1, 5, and 20, at which the treatment is ended (End of treatment - EoT).&#xD;
      Follow-up (FU) visit is planned on Day 23. Patient will record her symptoms and number of&#xD;
      applied doses in the patient diary on daily basis, preferably around a specific time which&#xD;
      has to be followed throughout the entire study period. Overall, participation will take at&#xD;
      least 23 (+2) days and 37 (+2) days at maximum. The enrolment period will take 2 months. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of Ectoin® Vaginal Gel (EIC01) in the alleviation of vaginal atrophy&#xD;
      symptoms will be evaluated in this study. Efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement&#xD;
      of Vaginal Atrophy symptoms at post-treatment measurements as compared to baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of the EIC01 product by analysing the difference&#xD;
      in the sum scores of Vaginal Health Index (VHI) indicating both subjective and objective&#xD;
      improvement in the vaginal atrophy condition after multiple application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in individual and sum score of VAS for vaginal atrophy symptoms (feeling of&#xD;
           dryness, itching, burning, pain during sexual intercourse) after single (immediate&#xD;
           effect) and multiple applications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of vaginal atrophy impact on life through Q/A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of product acceptance and overall satisfaction through Q/A (on 20 day - V2) •&#xD;
           Long-term treatment effect based on rate of improvement compared to baseline condition&#xD;
           determined by subjective and objective assessments (5 days, 20 days and 23 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-lasting effect assessed during follow-up by subjective and objective assessments on&#xD;
           day 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment safety will be assessed by observation and documentation of adverse events&#xD;
           and device deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local tolerability will be assessed both by physician and patient using five-point scale&#xD;
           (excellent, good, moderate, poor, bad).&#xD;

        post-menopausal women of 50 years or above with no menstruation &gt; 12 months and&#xD;
        self-reporting/complaining of vaginal atrophy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vaginal atrophy (VA) is a condition occurring due to the deteriorating structural and&#xD;
        functional integrity of the vulvovaginal epithelium. It is commonly observed in menopausal&#xD;
        and post-menopausal women and associated with an increased feeling of vaginal dryness and&#xD;
        frequent/persistent irritation (burning sensation and pruritus) and pain on penetration&#xD;
        (dyspareunia) in the vagina. VA also results in cytomorphological changes of the vaginal&#xD;
        mucosa; however, it is the vulvovaginal symptoms associated with VA which are considered&#xD;
        most bothersome, such as dryness, itching, burning sensation, and dyspareunia (pain during&#xD;
        sexual penetration).&#xD;
