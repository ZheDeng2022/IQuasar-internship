  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability with various long-term impairments, restrictions in&#xD;
      social participation and decreased quality of life among adults worldwide. The new Swedish&#xD;
      stroke guidelines has recently recommended that structured follow-up should be provided to&#xD;
      all patients with stroke. It results in enormous financial and personnel demands on the&#xD;
      already time- and resource-constrained healthcare. To meet these challenges, a novel digital&#xD;
      graphic follow-up tool, Rehabkompassen® has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rehabkompassen® is based on a number of well validated and reliable patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome measurements (PROMs) that provides an easy-to-understand and comprehensive picture of&#xD;
      the stroke patient's multidimensional problems in real-time. With the instrument, the patient&#xD;
      responds to PROMs questionnaires at home via Health Care Guide 1177.se before the clinical&#xD;
      visit. Healthcare professionals can thereafter smoothly interpret responses graphically in&#xD;
      the out-patient clinic. The tool can be used as decision support for initial triage before&#xD;
      the clinical visit and/or as a communication platform during the clinical visit and/or during&#xD;
      the patient's transfer between different care levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aims of the study are to determine whether Rehabkompassen® with a usual&#xD;
      out-patient visit, in comparison with a usual out-patient visit alone, improves daily and&#xD;
      social activities and quality of life for patients discharged from hospital after stroke, and&#xD;
      is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study starts with a pilot to evaluate the feasibility of the study. The single-center&#xD;
      pilot study with allocation ratio 1:1 will be carried out during years 2020-2021 in&#xD;
      University Hospital of Umeå. The main study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      will be carried out under 2021-2026. All patient participants (n =1024) will be randomized&#xD;
      according to permuted block design. At 3-month out-patient visit, participants will have a&#xD;
      usual out-patient visit without (Control group, n = 512) or with (Intervention group, n =&#xD;
      512) Rehabkompassen®. The effectiveness of the tool on daily and social activities, quality&#xD;
      of life and its health-economic effects will be compared at 12-month out-patient visit post&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that a digital tool, Rehabkompassen®, in combination with the&#xD;
      usual out-patient visit will provide a patient-tailored rehabilitation that improve recovery,&#xD;
      independence, and quality of life among people with stroke in a cost-effective way.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary research question: Does the usage of a digital Rehabkompassen® together with the&#xD;
      usual out-patient visit at 3-month after stroke follow-up, in comparison with the usual&#xD;
      out-patient visit alone, improve the patients' daily and social activities at 12-months after&#xD;
      stroke?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions will focus on the various challenges related to effectiveness,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, functional aspects and satisfaction, technical development and&#xD;
      implementation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison with a usual out-patient visit alone,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does an additional Rehabkompassen® at 3-month follow-up improve the patients'&#xD;
           health-related quality of life at 12-month after stroke?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does an additional Rehabkompassen® influence other stroke impacts at 12-month post&#xD;
           stroke?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is Rehabkompassen® cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does Rehabkompassen® improve the triage, clinical assessments, decision-making,&#xD;
           generating a rehabilitation plan, referral and outcome-evaluation for the healthcare&#xD;
           professionals?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How can Rehabkompassen® be further improved based on feedback from the end-users&#xD;
           (patients and health care professionals)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and patient selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention group (a usual out-patient&#xD;
      visit Rehabkompassen®) or the control group (a usual out-patient visit without&#xD;
      Rehabkompassen®) with otherwise identical procedure as that described in the formal RCT&#xD;
      below. The aim of the pilot study is to collect information on feasibility of the instrument,&#xD;
      key metrics for the formal RCT; and to obtain preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the formal RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be identified by participating outpatient clinics. All study participants&#xD;
      will be followed-up at 3- and 12-months after stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-month follow-up after stroke (control and intervention groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria receive an invitation to the study, together&#xD;
      with the appointment for a doctor's visit, around 2 months after the stroke onset. Patients&#xD;
      who give their informed consent are contacted by the research staff at the local clinic via&#xD;
      telephone in order to provide oral information about the study. Study participants in both&#xD;
      the control and intervention groups then receive a message in their inbox at Health Care&#xD;
      Guide 1177.se with information about the Rehabkompassen® questionnaires. At home, study&#xD;
      participants will be able to fill in the questionnaires concerning their health by clicking&#xD;
      on the links in their e-mail inbox at Health Care Guide 1177.se. The questionnaires must be&#xD;
      answered no later than one week before the 3-month out-patient visit. In order to facilitate&#xD;
      the usage of the digital Rehabkompassen®, research staff will offer technical support via&#xD;
      telephone and in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A usual out-patient visit consists of the recording of the patient's medical history, the&#xD;
      physical examination when necessary and the rehabilitation treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (The usual visit + Post-Stroke Checklist):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants in the control group will only fill in Simplified modified Rankin&#xD;
      Scale questionnaire (smRSq), Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS)-participation (SIS-p) and EuroQoL&#xD;
      5-dimension (EQ-5D) via Health Care Guide1177.se prior to a usual out-patient follow-up. The&#xD;
      Post-Stroke Checklist (PSC) will be used at the usual out-patient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group (The usual visit + Rehabkompassen®):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants in the intervention group will fill in the Rehabkompassen®&#xD;
      questionnaires (including smRSq, SIS, EQ-5D-5L, Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)). The patient's own graphic Rehabkompassen® will be&#xD;
      utilized at the usual out-patient follow-up with otherwise identical procedures as the&#xD;
      control group. The replies from the Rehabkompassen® questionnaires (intervention group) will&#xD;
      be used by doctors / healthcare personnel before doctors´ visits / team assessment as a basis&#xD;
      for triage, and during doctors´ visits / team assessment as a basis for assessing the&#xD;
      patient's rehabilitation needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate the patient's transfer between levels of care, regular referral&#xD;
      meetings will be conducted with representatives from the clinics, primary care and the&#xD;
      municipality (preliminary once / month) in the study with (Intervention) or without (control)&#xD;
      Rehabkompassen® functions as a discussion platform for referring patients between caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather end-user feedback regarding users' experiences and to evaluate effectiveness of&#xD;
      Rehabkompassen® and the satisfaction of the user process experience, a survey will be&#xD;
      conducted among all study participants immediately after the 3-months visit. Healthcare&#xD;
      professionals will fill in an evaluation questionnaire after using Rehabkompassen® for 5-10&#xD;
      patients and two regular referral meetings. The survey includes questions concerning the&#xD;
      background of the healthcare staff, computer experience, user experience and the use of the&#xD;
      tool in patient visits, as well as the evaluation on the implementation process. In order to&#xD;
      assess costs, the time required for staff education, planning and visits by different&#xD;
      occupational groups will be recorded and the use of medical resources in outpatient visits&#xD;
      will be documented in detail by research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12-month follow-up after stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants in both control and intervention group will fill in the&#xD;
      Rehabkompassen® questionnaires via Health Care Guide 1177.se at home one week prior an&#xD;
      out-patient visit. The patient's own graphic Rehabkompassen® will be utilized at the usual&#xD;
      out-patient follow-up for intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter pragmatic RCT with allocation ratio 1:1 between the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups. The permuted block randomization with stratification at each clinic will&#xD;
      be used. Random block sizes between 2-8 will be utilized to ensure participants randomly&#xD;
      assigned to intervention respectively control group. The randomization list will be created&#xD;
      centrally by the Study-Randomizer system, and handled by an investigator who will not be&#xD;
      involved in outcome assessment or the patient's treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample size and power&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit 1024 patients to the study (512 in each group). This dimensioning was&#xD;
      based on assumptions of a 3.7% absolute mean improvement in percentage with mRS 0-2 with&#xD;
      Rehabkompassen at an 80% power, a standard deviation of 0.2 and a significance level of 0.05&#xD;
      (n = 920). The number needed is 1024 with estimation of approximately 10% lost to follow-up.&#xD;
      A sample size of 920 patients provides a near to 100% power to detect a difference of 15&#xD;
      points on the SIS-p assuming a standard deviation of 27.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted in consistence with the intention-to-treat principle. The plan&#xD;
      is to use the multiple imputation method for handling of missing data. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics for each of the two trial arms will be described as mean (SD), median (IQR)&#xD;
      and counts (%) with corresponding confidence intervals when appropriate. A statistical&#xD;
      significance level of p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed) will be applied to all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outcomes where the mean value can be assumed as approximately normally distributed,&#xD;
      groups will be compared using an unpaired Student's t-test. Otherwise, groups will be&#xD;
      compared with the non-parametric test Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test if the assumptions for the&#xD;
      test are suitable for the outcome variable. Subgroup analysis will also be conducted, e.g.&#xD;
      based on age (&lt; 65 years, 65-80 years and &gt; 80 years), gender (male and female), stroke&#xD;
      severity (mild NIHSS 1- 8 moderate 9-15 and severe &gt; 15), stroke type (ischemic vs.&#xD;
      haemorrhagic), treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (Yes or No), and geographical&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of co-primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dichotomous outcomes smRSq between the trial arms will be compared, thereby complicating&#xD;
      the interpretation of odds ratios as a measure of relative risk, with respective 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI). In addition, differences in the distribution of patients across mRS&#xD;
      categories at the 12-month follow-up between the two trial arms will be quantified using&#xD;
      ordinal logistic regression (&quot;shift analysis&quot;) and presented together with a stacked bar&#xD;
      graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIS-p will be reported as the difference in the medians with 95% CI. The effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on the co-primary outcome SIS-p will be carried out by the aforementioned&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study started in October 2020. The main study will start in 2021 with 9-months&#xD;
      set-up time and 24-month for participant recruitment, followed by 12-month follow-up. Data&#xD;
      (collected to answer the secondary research questions 4-6) analysis will be started when the&#xD;
      3-month follow-up is completed. The primary outcome and the rest of the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be analyzed after 12-month follow-up is completed, estimated to be in June 2025. It'll&#xD;
      be followed by data summarizing and publishing in 2026.&#xD;

    <description>The simplified modified Rankin Scale questionnaire (smRSq) will be used to measure daily activities and functional status. The smRSq is based on the yes/no responses to five questions, which in turn results an ordinal data of seven categories (0-6) of the modified Rankin Scale. A favorable outcome will be defined as mRS score of 0-2 (no symptoms to independent but with minor disability). A poor outcome will be defined as mRS score of 3-5 (disability but able to walk to bed-bound and in need of full nursing care) or 6 (death).</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured by five-level EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ- 5D-5L) at both follow-ups in all participants. EQ-5D is a validated instrument that has often been used in RCTs. It consists of two parts: a visual analogue scale and a descriptive system covering five dimensions of health (mobility, hygiene, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five response alternatives (ranging from no problems to extreme problems). The latter can be translated to index value with anchor points 0 (death) and 1 (full health), which corresponds to a QALY score.</description>

SIS is a patient-reported, stroke-specific, outcome measurement containing 59 questions with eight domains, namely strength, memory/ cognition, feelings/ emotions, communication, personal activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL, mobility, and motor impact. Each question is answered using the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Also, the SIS includes a visual analogue scale where 0 represents no perceived stroke recovery and 100 represents full recovery.</description>
