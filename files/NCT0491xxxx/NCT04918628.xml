      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody combined with&#xD;
      CCRT in patients with stage IIIC2-IVB cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the feasibility of administration of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody as&#xD;
      a adjuvant therapy with chemoradiation (CRT) therapy in patients with stage IIIC2-IVB&#xD;
      cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody as&#xD;
      a adjuvant therapy with chemoradiation (CRT) therapy in patients with stage IIIC2-IVB&#xD;
      cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the changes in T cell receptor (TCR) clonality, diversity, and frequency in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and tissue and correlate this with clinical outcomes, such as the&#xD;
      exploratory response assessment on the post-treatment positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scan and 2-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the predictive value of baseline and on-treatment PD-L1 expression in the&#xD;
      tissue in each treatment arm for clinical outcomes using post-treatment PET-CT scan and&#xD;
      2-year PFS as the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore baseline and on-treatment blood and tissue biomarkers that could predict&#xD;
      response to the combination therapy and 2-year PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the response assessment on the exploratory and the clinical 2-year&#xD;
      Progression-Free Survival (PFS).&#xD;
