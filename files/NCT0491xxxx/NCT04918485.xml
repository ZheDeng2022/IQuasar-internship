  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients in the experimental group received the relevant knowledge education in the&#xD;
      recovery period 30 minutes before anesthesia. The operation time, anesthesia time,&#xD;
      cooperation degree score, total cooperation rate and patient satisfaction were observed and&#xD;
      recorded. Results: there was no significant difference in operation time and anesthesia time&#xD;
      between the experimental group and the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of patients&#xD;
      in the experimental group was 20.12% and 70.89% respectively, while that in the control group&#xD;
      was 40.32% and 20.73% respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The total cooperation rate was 95.00% in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 77.00% in the control group. There was significant difference between&#xD;
      the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The satisfaction of patients in the experimental group was 95%.&#xD;
      65% of the patients in the control group were satisfied (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: preoperative&#xD;
      psychological intervention for patients with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      can significantly reduce the restlessness and uncooperative phenomenon during extubation, and&#xD;
      improve the cooperation rate and satisfaction of patients.&#xD;
