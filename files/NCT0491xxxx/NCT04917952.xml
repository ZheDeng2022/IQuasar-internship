  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance training of knee extensor muscles is being used in physiotherapy management in&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (OA) to improve pain and physical function. Blood flow restriction (BFR)&#xD;
      has been suggested to improve pain and increase muscle strength in healthy subjects and&#xD;
      certain diseases. Although there are clinical studies suggesting improvements in knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis symptoms after 4-12 weeks of exercise with BFR, the acute effects of the&#xD;
      intervention have not been known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of low load exercise therapy combined with BFR on&#xD;
      acute pain reduction and within 24 hours post-intervention on people with knee OA compared to&#xD;
      a placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in Athens, Greece, as part of the postgraduate MSc program of the&#xD;
      Physiotherapy department of the University of West Attica.&#xD;

      A double-blinded randomised clinical trial with a total of 42 participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention (n=21) or the control group (n=21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will complete a single exercise session with BFR 80%, 30% 1RM, while&#xD;
      the control group will have sham BFR, 30% 1RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) will be assessed with the use of a digital pressure&#xD;
      dynamometer.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise: Bilateral knee extension at range 90ο-0ο&#xD;
Load: 30% 1RM&#xD;
BFR: Yes, 80% at both legs&#xD;
Sets: 4&#xD;
Reps: 30-15-15-15&#xD;
Rest: 30'' between sets&#xD;
Tempo: 2-0-2-0&#xD;
Participants of the intervention group will receive an exercise protocol with blood flow restriction once and will be measured for changes in PPT by the use of a digital dynamometer.&#xD;
Exercise protocol will be four sets of bilateral knee extension 90ο-0ο, reps per set 30-15-15-15, tempo 2-0-2-0 and rest 30 sec between sets.&#xD;
In order to determine the training load 30% of 1RM, participants will perform bilateral knee extension in range 90ο-0ο with pain-free maximum resistance. The derived 1RM will be used to determine the 30% 1RM load.&#xD;
Blood flow restriction will be applied at 80% by using pressure cuffs. The cuffs will be applied to the proximal thigh. Cuff pressure needed for a 100% vascular occlusion will be determined for each individual at a seated and relaxed position.</description>
