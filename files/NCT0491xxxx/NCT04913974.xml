    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the functional and clinical outcome after&#xD;
      medial unicompartmental knee replacement using the Aesculap AG Univation X knee prosthesis&#xD;
      compared to pre-operative data and a healthy control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All potential medial uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty patients from consultant orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital (GJNH) will be screened in relation to the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Invitation letters and participant information sheets (PIS)&#xD;
      will be sent out to suitable patients who have been referred to the GJNH for a knee&#xD;
      replacement (allocated patients) prior to their pre-operative consultation with their&#xD;
      surgeon. They will be approached at their consultation visit to seek consent to take part in&#xD;
      the study. Patients who have been referred to the GJNH for assessment for a knee replacement&#xD;
      (see and treat patients) will be approached only if they are deemed eligible for&#xD;
      uni-compartmental knee replacement by their consultant, and will be given a copy of the&#xD;
      participant information sheet along with the invitation letter. They will be approached for&#xD;
      consent to take part in the study at their pre-operative assessment. All patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone around a day after receiving the participant information sheet to ask&#xD;
      for verbal consent. This is necessary to arrange the pre-operative CT scans and biomechanical&#xD;
      testing. All patients will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the study before&#xD;
      signing the consent form. Consent will be taken by the chief investigator or their delegate,&#xD;
      using a signed form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients will be recruited to the study. They will have their surgery performed by one&#xD;
      of the participating consultants using the study implant, the Univation X unicondylar knee&#xD;
      system manufactured by Aesculap AG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive their standard in-patient care and rehabilitation. Standard&#xD;
      hospital care for knee arthroplasty patients is for them to return to the hospital for a&#xD;
      post-operative review at 6 weeks and then 1 year after operation. Study participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to attend the GJNH for one additional research specific appointment at two&#xD;
      years post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the standard care appointments, patients will be reviewed by a member of the&#xD;
      arthroplasty team who will collect routine data on the clinical and functional outcomes and&#xD;
      implant stability. These data include the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EURO Quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire (EQ-5D 5L), patient satisfaction and standard radiographic assessment of the&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed radiographic analysis will be carried out on radiographs collected as standard&#xD;
      practice and computed tomography (CT) scans taken specifically for the study. Radiographs&#xD;
      will be taken pre-operatively, post-operation at day one (standard), 1 year (standard) and&#xD;
      the 2 year (study) time points. Patients will have a CT scan pre-operatively and 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively. The post-operative scan will be performed instead of the radiographs&#xD;
      usually take at this time point. The pre-operative scan will be performed in addition to the&#xD;
      pre-operative radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will also have two sessions of specialised functional assessment using&#xD;
      clinical movement analysis before surgery and 1 year after surgery during their standard pre-&#xD;
      and post-operative visits. Biomechanical movement analysis will be carried out in an on-site&#xD;
      movement analysis laboratory. Study participants will be required to wear suitable clothing&#xD;
      (e.g. tee shirt and shorts) and be barefoot. A number of reflective markers will be attached&#xD;
      to specific locations on the body (using suitable double sided tape) which will be tracked by&#xD;
      a number of infrared cameras. Participants will be asked to perform the following tasks;&#xD;
      level walking, incline walking, decline walking, stand-to-sit-to-stand, step ascent and&#xD;
      descent and single leg balance. Each task will be performed at least three times to enable&#xD;
      the collection of three good sets of data. In addition, the two stepping tasks will be&#xD;
      repeated for each limb. The single leg balance will be performed once for each leg and data&#xD;
      will be collected for 30 seconds per limb. A motion capture system will collect limb and&#xD;
      torso movements during the task performances while force plates will collect ground reaction&#xD;
      forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two year follow-up appointment the patients involvement in the study will be&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

        Male and female participants aged between 45 and 75 inclusive under the care of one of the&#xD;
        study surgeons who have been listed for uni-condylar knee replacement surgery. They must&#xD;
        live locally enough to be intending returning to the hospital for follow-ups rather than&#xD;
        opting to be followed-up locally. They should have a BMI of under 40 otherwise skin&#xD;
        artifacts would be an issue for the accuracy of the biomechanical analysis. They must have&#xD;
        had no previous lower limb arthroplasty in the previous 12 months or conditions which could&#xD;
        influence their mobility other than the condition for which they are having arthroplasty&#xD;
        for.&#xD;
