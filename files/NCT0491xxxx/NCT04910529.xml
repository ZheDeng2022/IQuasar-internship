  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effect of yoga practice on&#xD;
      pain intensity, menstruation symptoms and quality of life in nursing students with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea. The hypothesis of this study is that yoga reduces pain and menstrual symptom&#xD;
      severity and improves quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, 52 students will be randomly assigned to intervention (yoga) and control&#xD;
      groups. The researcher will provide information about the purpose of the study and the study&#xD;
      process by interviewing all the students in the sample online. All students participating in&#xD;
      the study, who are in the yoga or control group of the study, will be given a data collection&#xD;
      form as a pre-test by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hatha yoga will be applied to the students (n = 26) in the yoga group in the study.&#xD;
      Considering the studies conducted with these students, it is planned to practice Hatha yoga&#xD;
      for 60 minutes twice a week for three menstrual cycles (12 weeks). Yoga practice will be done&#xD;
      online by the researcher Aslıhan Aksu (A.A.), who has a Yoga Alliance-approved yoga&#xD;
      instructor certificate, on the determined days and times using appropriate platforms. In the&#xD;
      control group (n=26), no intervention will be made for 12 weeks. The results will be&#xD;
      collected through data collection forms before the yoga practice and after the 12-week yoga&#xD;
      practice is completed. The data collection forms applied to all students in the yoga and&#xD;
      control groups at the beginning of the study will be applied to the control group again at&#xD;
      the end of 12 weeks. The primary expected result of the study is the effect of yoga on&#xD;
      students' menstrual pain intensity. The secondary expected results of the study are to&#xD;
      determine the effect of yoga on students' menstrual symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain will evaluate using The The Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation and 12th week of practice</time_frame>
    <description>The main component of the The Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe. In this section, sensory (0-33 points), affective (0-12 points) and total (0-45 points) pain quality scores are obtained. The increase in the total pain scores indicates an increase in the perception of pain. The SF-MPQ also includes the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) Index of the Standard MPQ and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual symptoms will evaluate using the Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation and 12th week of practice.</time_frame>
    <description>Menstruation Symptom Scale was developed to evaluate menstrual pain and symptoms. Participants in the scale give a value between 1 and 5 (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = occasionally, 4 = often, 5 = always) to symptoms they experience about menstruation. Scores ranging from 20 to 80 points are obtained in the scale. Increasing the average score indicates that the severity of menstrual symptoms increased.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life will evaluate using SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation and 12th week of practice</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire covers many concepts related to general health and is used frequently today. SF-36 consists of 8 sub-dimensions (physical function, physical role restriction, emotional role restriction, bodily pain, general health perception, energy / vitality, social function, mental health) and 36 questions in total. In the scale, eight sub-dimensions can be evaluated separately as well as in two main dimensions, physical and mental dimensions. Subscales evaluate health between 0 and 100 points (0 point = bad health, 100 points = good health).</description>

    <description>Hatha yoga, which is one of the most basic yoga methods, will be applied to the students in the study. During each practice within the scope of Hatha yoga, students; breathing exercises, relaxation techniques and warm-up exercises will be applied respectively. In addition to these, asanas (yoga postures) with balance, stretching, relaxation and strengthening components will be applied to the students. This application includes the most basic yoga exercises and does not pose any health risks for practitioners. During the yoga practice in the online environment, the cameras of the students in the yoga group will be turned on and the researcher who has the application will be able to see each student. Yoga will be applied to this group twice a week for 60 minutes each for three menstrual cycles (12 weeks).</description>
