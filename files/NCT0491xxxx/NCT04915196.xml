      Telephone surveys of female patients using liposomally-bound iron and traditional iron&#xD;
      sulphate preparations for the management of iron deficiency anemia to determine&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tolerability.&#xD;

      1. Rationale and Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) affects women worldwide. In high income countries, heavy&#xD;
           menstrual bleeding (a subset of AUB) is the most common cause of iron deficiency (ID)&#xD;
           and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Although estimates vary, it appears that 20-30% of IDA&#xD;
           is a result of heavy menstrual bleeding. Oral iron replacement is a common treatment&#xD;
           modality among patients diagnosed with IDA. However, traditional oral iron preparations&#xD;
           commonly result in significant gastrointestinal side effects due to the metabolism of&#xD;
           the complex that the iron is bound to. Gastrointestinal side effects related to iron&#xD;
           therapy, including: metallic taste, nausea, flatulence, constipation, diarrhea,&#xD;
           epigastric distress, vomiting, and melena. Therefore, liposomally bound iron is thought&#xD;
           to provide a better side effect profile due to avoiding these traditional complexes. In&#xD;
           theory, this will lead to higher rates of compliance and treatment efficacy if patients&#xD;
           are not experiencing these side effects. Although we have limited data on the efficacy&#xD;
           of this iron preparation, the literature suggests that other types of liposomally bound&#xD;
           medications have similar efficacy as traditional preparations. Therefore, we believe&#xD;
           that liposomally bound iron will provide an effective and well tolerated option for&#xD;
           women suffering from IDA secondary to AUB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Question and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           How does a novel liposomally-bound iron therapy compare to ferrous sulphate in women&#xD;
           with anemia secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding? 2a. Determine if it has less&#xD;
           gastrointestinal side effects than ferrous sulphate 2b. Determine if it has similar&#xD;
           efficacy to ferrous sulphate in correcting anemia secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-menopausal women, diagnosed with anemia secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding&#xD;
      Recruitment via physician offices of gynecologists in Calgary, AB Two treatment arms, n=10&#xD;
      per arm Ferrous sulphate compared to treatment arm (liposomally bound iron) Baseline&#xD;
      hemoglobin prior to iron therapy initiation Pre-op hemoglobin to compare efficacy of iron&#xD;
      therapy Phone interview with patients using standardized, validated questionnaire to collect&#xD;
      information regarding gastrointestinal side effects&#xD;
