  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2014, the armed forces have been offering injured military personnel the opportunity to&#xD;
      rebuild their lives through sport. Sport, considered as the &quot;DNA&quot; of the military, thus&#xD;
      becomes a vector of socio-professional reintegration for physically and psychologically&#xD;
      injured soldiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In its 2019-2024 national Sport-Health strategy and in the Ministry of the Armed Forces'&#xD;
      &quot;Sport 2025&quot; plan, rebuilding injured military personnel through sport is becoming a major&#xD;
      focus of the new sports policy for the armed forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the well identified physiological benefits, sports are recognized as a way to&#xD;
      encourage social relationships, fight stress and isolation, and promote solidarity. Sport&#xD;
      thus contributes to the physical and mental reconstruction of the injured, promoting the&#xD;
      phenomenon of resilience well described in the Anglo-Saxon world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of the Reconstruction through Sport Program (&quot;PRS&quot;) is based on the&#xD;
      coordinated actions of the assistance units for the wounded, the French Armed Forces Health&#xD;
      Service and the National Center for Defense Sports (CNSD), which have set up a complete&#xD;
      sports program (discovery, leisure, competitions), adapted and evolving, regardless of the&#xD;
      physical and/or psychological after-effects and the disability secondary to the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, there are an increasing number of PRS-labeled sports events, such as the Military&#xD;
      Injury and Sports Meetings, the Ad Victoriam Challenge, and internationally, the Invictus&#xD;
      Games and the Military World Games. It should also be noted that this pathway leads some&#xD;
      injured people to high-level competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has yet evaluated the path of reconstruction through sport for French injured&#xD;
      military personnel initiated in 2014.&#xD;
