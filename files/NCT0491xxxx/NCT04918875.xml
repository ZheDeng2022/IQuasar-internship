      This observational cohort study will enroll patients in LMICs with suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 on oxygen or deemed to require oxygen therapy based on objective criteria.&#xD;
      Demographics and risk factor information will be collected from participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for 7 days or until outcome (hospital discharge or death). Facility level&#xD;
      metrics on oxygen availability will also be collected at the beginning of site enrolment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted, more than ever, the acute need for scale up of oxygen&#xD;
      therapy. WHO has provided an inventory tool to quantify facility-level provision of&#xD;
      infrastructure to deliver oxygen therapy. However, data on the use of oxygen therapy at the&#xD;
      patient-level remains lacking. This observational cohort study will enroll patients in LMICs&#xD;
      with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on oxygen or deemed to require oxygen therapy based on&#xD;
      objective criteria. Demographics and risk factor information will be collected from&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be followed for 7 days or until outcome (hospital discharge&#xD;
      or death). Facility level metrics on oxygen availability will also be collected at the&#xD;
      beginning of site enrolment.&#xD;

    <description>Daily oxygen use measured in liters.&#xD;
For nasal cannula, facemask, and non-rebreather FiO2 is assumed to be 1.0 and flow rates are adjustable in liters per minute. Liter per day consumption of O2 = device flow rate L/minute x 60 minutes/hr x 24 hr/day For high flow nasal cannula FiO2 is adjustable (defaulted to 1.0) and flow rate is adjustable in liters per minute.&#xD;
Liter per day consumption of O2 = device flow rate L/minute x 60 minutes/hr x 24 hr/day; flow rate in LPM = device flow rate x (FiO2 - 0.21)/0.79 For ventilator, CPAP, BIPAP/NIPPV FiO2 is adjustable (defaulted to 1.0) and flow rate is adjustable in liters per minute and dependent on multiple factors. Liter per day consumption of O2 = device O2 consumption rate L/minute x 60 minutes/hr x 24 hr/day Device O2 consumption rate in LPM = (Minute ventilation + (bias flow x RR x expiratory time/60) + leak) x (FiO2 - 0.21)/0.79</description>
