      The new competence of paramedics to administer opioid analgesics in acute trauma patients&#xD;
      without presence or phone-call consult with an emergency medical doctor will be assessed in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration and indication of an opioid analgesics is carried by a medical doctor in&#xD;
      most European emergency services. However, trips to majority of less serious traumas are&#xD;
      realized by ambulances with paramedic crews without a medical doctor present on site. In this&#xD;
      study will be assessed the new competence of paramedics to administer opioid analgesics&#xD;
      without presence or phone-call consult with an emergency medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the safety and efficacy of sufentanil administered by the paramedics&#xD;
      in the field to patients with acute trauma without any consultation with medical doctors.&#xD;
