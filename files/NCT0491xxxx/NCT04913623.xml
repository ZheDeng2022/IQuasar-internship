      Evaluation of the level of histamine, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocytes formula, IL1b,&#xD;
      TNF alpha, IL6 and the reflection of changes of these parameters in the intra-operative&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of total endoprosthesis is a very common surgical procedure and is performed&#xD;
      with and without bone cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases during cementation of the femoral component there are changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure, SpO2, heartbeat and other vital parameters which can cause complications during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing the system parameters between the two groups and deriving these results will help&#xD;
      the medical staff to be more professionally prepared to resolve possible complications.&#xD;
