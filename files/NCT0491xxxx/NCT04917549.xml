  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has appeared and caused an unprecedented&#xD;
      pandemic which is considered as an urgent threat to health authorities worldwide. Several&#xD;
      symptoms are observed which are fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, runny nose,&#xD;
      muscle pain, fatigue, arthralgia, sputum production, conjunctivitis, diarrhea.&#xD;
      Susceptibility, genetics, systematic diseases, population, gender, and age are crucial&#xD;
      considerations for the onset and progression of the viral infection. The patients suffering&#xD;
      from asthma or pulmonary deficiency are at high risk of mortality. A metallopeptidase,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered as the functional receptor for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and it was isolated from a COVID-19 patient. ACE2 was recognized in type I and&#xD;
      type II alveolar epithelial cells in both nasal and oral mucosa, in the nasopharynx, in the&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells and endothelium of vessels in the stomach and the skin, distinctly in the&#xD;
      basal cell layer of the epidermis extending to the basal cell layer of hair follicles, and in&#xD;
      the basal layer of the non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. In order to study the possible&#xD;
      routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the oral mucosa, we investigated whether oral lesions&#xD;
      mainly affect the tongue mucosa due to higher ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion&#xD;
      more than that in other oral tissues. Moreover, appearance of oral lesions were as a result&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection or as a side effect of certain drugs for COVID-19 treatment was&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
