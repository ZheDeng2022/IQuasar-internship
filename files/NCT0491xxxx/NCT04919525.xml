      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of gamified sensory perceptual&#xD;
      training in people with fibromyalgia. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      at-home somatosensorial training for people with fibromyalgia. The researchers are&#xD;
      determining the feasibility of using this device to decrease chronic neuropathic pain in&#xD;
      people with fibromyalgia. The secondary aim is to survey participants' subjective report of&#xD;
      clinical change after this program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome characterized by central sensitization, and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to nociceptive stimuli. In people with fibromyalgia, objective measures of sensory perception&#xD;
      are often impaired. For example, somatosensory temporal discrimination thresholds are&#xD;
      elevated, and this correlates with increased widespread pain and severity of other symptoms&#xD;
      including fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive symptoms, somatic symptoms and decreased&#xD;
      functional status. Sensory-Cognitive training may reduce symptoms by improving attentional&#xD;
      modulation of somatosensory signals, improving precision of sensory discrimination, and&#xD;
      altering affective processing of somatosensation. The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of the TrainPain program as a somatosensory therapy for people with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia.. This study plans to enroll 30 participants between the ages of 18 and 65 who&#xD;
      are diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have been experiencing chronic pain with an NRS rating of&#xD;
      4/10 for at least 3 months. All participants who agree to participate in this study will&#xD;
      answer a set of baseline questionnaires (PEG, FAS) about their symptoms at the time of&#xD;
      inclusion. Participants will also receive the device, and view a demonstration of how to use&#xD;
      the technology. The technology consists of two components; (1) an application downloaded to&#xD;
      the participants' smartphone and (2) two vibrational devices to be placed on the body of the&#xD;
      participant, connected to the application via bluetooth. Participants will use this&#xD;
      technology once daily for 28 days. Participants will complete a 15 minute sensory training&#xD;
      session using the provided technology; additionally, participants will receive daily text&#xD;
      messages to promote pain self-management, and program adherence. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete the PEG questionnaire once weekly. After 28 days study team members will conduct a&#xD;
      virtual follow-up visit. In that visit, participants will complete the same questionnaires as&#xD;
      at baseline (PEG, FAS), as well as a question on their perception of clinical change (PGIC).&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete the system usability scale and provide a net&#xD;
      promoter score. Finally, participants will complete a subjective feedback questionnaire where&#xD;
      they will rate whether participating in this program was time well spent and enjoyable. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to determine the feasibility of at-home somatosensorial training for people&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia. The secondary aim is to survey participants' subjective report of clinical&#xD;
      change after this.&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Feedback Questionnaire asks participants to rate the acceptability, enjoyment, and perceived usefulness (0-10) of the program as a measure of opinion on the feasibility on using the device. Higher score indicates higher enjoyment. There are also 12 subjective yes/no questions asking participants to report their opinions of the program and its affect on their pain and quality of life. Finally, there are two open-ended questions that give participants the opportunity to provide feedback on the program.</description>
