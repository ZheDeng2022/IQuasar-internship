  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare efficacy of Kinesio taping against a conventional tape in&#xD;
      a patient with cervical musculoskeletal pain. For this, a double-blind controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial be carried out in patients with musculoskeletal neck pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the months of May to July 2021, a research assistant will contact potential&#xD;
      participants who will be invited to participate in this study. Once they agree to&#xD;
      participate, it will schedule for a face-to-face consultation at the university, where the&#xD;
      main researcher will inform the study participants. Once the information sheet and informed&#xD;
      consent will be a sign, an investigator will carry out the measurements of the variables for&#xD;
      initial data collection in the first session. In another room, an expertise physiotherapist&#xD;
      with experience in applying Kinesio taping will perform interventions on patients on the same&#xD;
      day as the initial evaluation. It this way, the investigator that will assess outcomes will&#xD;
      be blind to the treatment that each patient will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second consultation, 4 days after the first, the same physiotherapist who applied the&#xD;
      bandage will remove it from the patients who received it and any remains of the bandage on&#xD;
      the skin were cleaned. For patients in the control group (nothing apply), it will be the same&#xD;
      protocol to alter, not the double-blind. The principal investigator will perform the&#xD;
      evaluations and data collection without knowing the intervention the patient will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a third consultation, as a follow-up (30 days after the second consultation), the&#xD;
      collection of the same measurements and clinical variables from the patients who completed&#xD;
      the process will repeat by the same investigator that did the outcomes' assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Baseline Pressure pain threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by pressure algometry. Assesses the minimum pressure necessary to trigger an uncomfortable sensation associated with pain(8). This method is valid and reliable to measure the sensitivity of an MTP if three consecutive measurements are made and allowing a rest time between 30 seconds to 1 minute between measurements.Algometer has demonstrated an inter-examiner reliability range of 0.91(95% Interval coefficient CI)), showing adequate reliability for research if performed by inexperienced evaluators (9). The PPT is expressed in kPa (kilopascal), for an accurate evaluation, the force to be applied with algometer must be perpendicular to the point to be measured, without the skin sliding over the subcutaneous tissue. And a constant force must be applied, currently the application of a constant force with an acceleration of 5kPa is advocated (8). The PPT was measured in the MTP 2 of the upper trapezius, taking three measurements and taking the arithmetic mean of the three.</description>
