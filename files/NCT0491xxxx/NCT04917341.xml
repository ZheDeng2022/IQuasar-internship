  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many studies comparing preoperative and postoperative histological&#xD;
      diagnoses in the literature, there are no studies evaluating the compatibility of&#xD;
      preoperative histological diagnoses obtained from different centers with postoperative&#xD;
      histological diagnoses.Therefore, in our study, we aimed to determine whether preoperative&#xD;
      pathological specimens need to be re-evaluated in the referenced hospitals by comparing the&#xD;
      compatibility of endometrial specimens in secondary care and tertiary centers with their&#xD;
      final pathologies.In our study, we aimed to reveal the under and overdiagnosis rates of the&#xD;
      preoperative histological diagnoses of our hospitals compared to the final pathology.&#xD;

      Medical data of 960 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer by endometrial biopsy between&#xD;
      2002 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Of these patients, 41 were excluded from the&#xD;
      study due to non-surgical treatment, 254 patients having biopsy only in one center&#xD;
      preoperatively, and lack of medical data in 52 patients.The study included 613 patients who&#xD;
      had preoperative endometrial biopsy specimens evaluated by two different centers, diagnosed&#xD;
      with endometrial cancer and treated surgically. Our study was conducted in the gynecological&#xD;
      oncology department of our university after obtaining the approval of the ethics committee&#xD;
      numbered 430-2019.The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were evaluated by&#xD;
      examining the hospital records of age, gravida, parity, BM (body mass index), menopausal&#xD;
      status and systemic diseases. Histopathological and clinical features of endometrial cancer&#xD;
      were reviewed.In this study, endometrial biopsy samples taken in the second stage state&#xD;
      hospital were re-evaluated by the gynecopathologist working at the university hospital and /&#xD;
      or the evaluation process was carried out in two steps by examining the repeated endometrial&#xD;
      biopsy sampling.Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer were treated surgically in our&#xD;
      clinic. Endometrial sampling results based on uterine cancer risk groups; While&#xD;
      histologically endometrioid and nonendometrioid were evaluated in two groups, the greade1-2&#xD;
      (low risk), greade3 (high risk) of uterine cancer were evaluated in four groups as those&#xD;
      without malingnancy (benign and premaling lesions).By comparing these preoperative&#xD;
      histological diagnoses with postoperative surgical final pathology, the accuracy rates for&#xD;
      histological type and greade were determined. In addition, lower diagnosis, comorbidity and&#xD;
      higher diagnosis rates compared to final pathology were examined for two different centers.&#xD;
