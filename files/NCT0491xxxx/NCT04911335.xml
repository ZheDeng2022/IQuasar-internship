    <textblock>
      Oral health is crucial for palliative patients' quality of life. The evidence on effective&#xD;
      interventions and measures of oral mucositis in palliative care is sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, uncontrolled open label Phase 2 non-profit study, aimed&#xD;
      at evaluating a propolis-based product (FARINGEL PLUS) added to basic oral hygiene safety,&#xD;
      acceptability and activity in preventing and treating oral mucositis in patients in&#xD;
      palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-step design was adopted according to Simon's Optimum approach, with an overall sample&#xD;
      of 77 evaluable cases (step1_26 cases; step2_51 cases).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative Care with has primary objective of the best possible quality of life for patients&#xD;
      with advanced illness. Oral health is crucial for quality of life. Oral disorders such as&#xD;
      hyposalivation, mucositis, erythema, ulceration and viral and fungal infections, can cause&#xD;
      annoying symptoms such as dry mouth, dysphagia, dysgeusia, orofacial pain and speech&#xD;
      difficulties, which negatively affect nutrition, verbal communication, social interaction and&#xD;
      sleep. An Italian study of advanced cancer patients in palliative care found a prevalence of&#xD;
      oral mucositis of 22%, of dysphagia of 15% and of dry mouth of 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on interventions aimed at preventing and treating oral mucositis in palliative care&#xD;
      are scarse and no standard oral protocol can be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there are no known scales specifically developed and validated for the evaluation&#xD;
      of mucositis and other disorders of the oral cavity in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propolis has historically been used as folk medicine due to multiple biological properties,&#xD;
      such as anesthetic, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for the oral&#xD;
      and pharyngeal mucosa. Propolis is effective in reducing the severity of radiation-induced&#xD;
      oral mucositis in animals, is associated with a significant reduction in the number and size&#xD;
      of oral ulcers in patients diagnosed with recurrent stomatitis and with complete recovery&#xD;
      from denture-related stomatitis, and is found safe, acceptable and with promising efficacy in&#xD;
      preventing oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, an oral suspension based on propolis (Faringel) and containing aloe vera gel,&#xD;
      calendula, chamomile and sodium alginate, has been found to be well accepted, safe and&#xD;
      promising in the prevention of severe oesophagitis from radiotherapy in patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer. Hyaluronic acid (Faringel plus) has recently been added to this suspension with a&#xD;
      re-epithelizing function on the mucous membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we planned this single-center, prospective, uncontrolled open label Phase 2&#xD;
      non-profit study aimed at evaluating whether the addition of a propolis-based product&#xD;
      (FARINGEL PLUS) to a basic oral hygiene protocol can be safe, acceptable and active in the&#xD;
      protection of the oral cavity in patients in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify this hypothesis, a two-step design was adopted according to Simon's Optimum design&#xD;
      approach. An overall sample of 77 evaluable cases was defined (step1_26 cases; step2_51&#xD;
      cases).&#xD;
