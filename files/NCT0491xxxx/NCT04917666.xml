  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Horticultural therapy (HT) &quot;is the engagement of a client in horticulture activities&#xD;
      facilitated by a trained therapist to achieve specific and documented treatment goals&quot;&#xD;
      (American Horticultural Therapy Association, 2012). People's interactions with plants,&#xD;
      through goal-orientated horticultural activities in the form of active gardening, as well as&#xD;
      the passive appreciation of nature, could be therapeutic to people with mental or&#xD;
      intellectual disabilities in many ways (Eling, 2006; Parkinson, Lowe, &amp; Vecsey, 2011). This&#xD;
      study aims to conduct evaluation studies of HT group programmes for care home residents with&#xD;
      severe mental illness.&#xD;
