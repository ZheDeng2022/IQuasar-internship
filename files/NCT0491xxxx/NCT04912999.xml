  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are&#xD;
      characterized by lifelong relapsing-remitting gastrointestinal inflammation, with symptoms of&#xD;
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding during active disease. Medical therapy reduces&#xD;
      intestinal inflammation and ameliorates symptoms. Clinical remission is defined when symptoms&#xD;
      are resolved. In these periods, patients are able to perform daily activities more freely and&#xD;
      lead a normal lifestyle. Biochemical remission (normalization of CRP and fecal Calprotectin)&#xD;
      and endoscopic remission (no visual signs of inflammation of the mucosa in endoscopy) are the&#xD;
      goals of IBD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 30-40% of patients will relapse during 6 months from achieving remission. Risk&#xD;
      factors for disease exacerbation are still unknown, and no guidelines exist as to the&#xD;
      prevention of relapse and maintenance of remission in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, sleep disturbances and disturbances in the circadian rhythm can be&#xD;
      a potential cause of flare-up. Sleep disorders cause changes in immune function, which later&#xD;
      affect the course of the disease in IBD. This back affects the sleep pattern, so that a cycle&#xD;
      is created, which may perpetuate the inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interactions between sleep and inflammation are complex. An effective immune system&#xD;
      affects sleep, and sleep disorders affect the functioning of the immune system. Furthermore,&#xD;
      changes in the biological clock and sleep deprivation have been directly shown to worsen&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis in laboratory animals. In people with sleep disorders, high levels of&#xD;
      inflammation were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is difficult to dissect the cause and effect for these associations, given their&#xD;
      complex interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we are planning to conduct a prospective study to assess variety of factors that&#xD;
      might be associated with the activity of IBD.&#xD;

      Prospectively follow IBD patients in remission (both clinical and biochemical) until disease&#xD;
      exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect risk factors and early signs for disease exacerbation in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect predictors of disease exacerbation from environmental and behavioral&#xD;
           characteristics of patients, clinical and biochemical characteristics of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether changes in circadian rhythm are associated with improvement in&#xD;
           clinical and biological disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective cohort study. Eligible patients will be follow up for at least one year or&#xD;
           until relapse time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting: prospectively collect clinical, behavioral, dietary and environmental data of&#xD;
           IBD patients currently declared in an endoscopic remission according to the criteria in&#xD;
           Israel. Data will be collected according to a uniform standardized protocol specifically&#xD;
           adapted to the needs of the study. The team will include members of the IBD clinic at&#xD;
           the Tel Aviv Medical Center, run by Dr. Nitsan Maharshak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible IBD patients treated at the IBD clinic in the Tel Aviv Medical Center participating&#xD;
      in the study, which have signed an informed consent form and answered to all the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Patients will be informed of the study by their treating physician,&#xD;
      recruited and followed throughout the follow-up period by study co-ordinators.&#xD;
