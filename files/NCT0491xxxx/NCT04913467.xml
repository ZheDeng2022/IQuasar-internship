  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if the Groningen Anti-Inflammatory Diet and the ileocolonic delivery&#xD;
      of vitamin B2, B3 and C can positively influence the course of Crohn's disease and can&#xD;
      positively alter the gut microbiome of Crohn's disease patients as well as healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is becoming increasingly more well known that diet and the microbiome have a pivotal role&#xD;
      in the development and course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Strict exclusive enteral&#xD;
      nutrition (EEN) can induce remission in Crohn's Disease (CD) and is the standard treatment in&#xD;
      paediatric CD. Implementing a restrictive diet in adults is difficult; adult patients do not&#xD;
      tend to adhere to EEN. Recently, the CD-exclusion diet (CDED) combined with partial enteral&#xD;
      nutrition demonstrated to be effective in CD-patients with flares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that intake of vitamins can influence disease&#xD;
      course, mainly by beneficially modulating the gut microbiota and gut redox potential,&#xD;
      especially if the vitamins can be delivered to the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, no dietary guidelines are available to physicians and patients. Due to&#xD;
      complaints of certain foods and patients' eagerness to postpone new flares, patients start&#xD;
      experimenting with their food. As patients with CD are already often malnourished, this&#xD;
      poorly substantiated experimenting puts them even more at risk for malnutrition and could&#xD;
      have a potential negative effect on their disease outcomes. Next, quality of life of patients&#xD;
      decreases and healthcare costs will rise. Therefore, both patients and physicians are in&#xD;
      desperate need of evidence for an anti-inflammatory dietary advice in CD. As compliance to a&#xD;
      diet increases when they are supported by family members, their household members will also&#xD;
      be asked to participate in the study. Simultaneously studying their healthy family members&#xD;
      will also provide information of the effect of this anti-inflammatory diet or intake of&#xD;
      lieocolonic-delivered vitamins on their microbiome and markers of inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
