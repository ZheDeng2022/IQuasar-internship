  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and study aims The ability to move is important for general well-being. Ageing and&#xD;
      chronic health conditions can lead to a loss of mobility and a loss of independence. In order&#xD;
      to treat mobility loss, tools are needed that can detect and accurately measure mobility.&#xD;
      Existing measures of mobility (based on self-reporting and one-off tests) are highly limited.&#xD;
      Wearable digital technology (a small device worn on the body) that can be used in the home&#xD;
      and the community can provide a simple, accurate and low-cost measure of mobility. The&#xD;
      researchers have validated a wearable mobility monitor which can accurately measure how well&#xD;
      a person walks by measuring aspects of mobility such as speed and symmetry. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the ability of the mobility monitor to measure and predict outcomes&#xD;
      in proximal femoral fracture (PFF) patients. The digital assessment of mobility developed in&#xD;
      this study will be used in clinical trials and in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to include patients in two groups, both acute (during hospital stay after hip&#xD;
      fracture) and subacute (up to 6 months post hip fracture from waiting lists). With this&#xD;
      strategy, it is possible to have the life-course of PFF (first 12 months and the time after).&#xD;
      Acute phase inclusion is defined as inclusion start on first days after surgery and will be&#xD;
      completed within the first 14 days. Subacute phase inclusion is defined as inclusion from&#xD;
      waiting lists, where baseline will be conducted up to 6 months after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear of falling will be tested using a single question during the acute phase and the short&#xD;
      form of the fall efficacy scale international (Short FES-I) for all other assessments. For&#xD;
      the acute recruited group of patients (2/3 of included participants), sensor recordings will&#xD;
      be made on patients from hospital stay (attached on day 2 after surgery) and continue after&#xD;
      discharge (until day 9 depending on battery capacity of the sensors) to be able to monitor&#xD;
      and describe DMOs from about 2 days during hospital stay and several days after discharge to&#xD;
      be able to evaluate improvement during the acute rehabilitation process. For all other&#xD;
      assessments, sensor recordings will be collected for a minimum of 7 full continuous days in&#xD;
      line with the core data collection manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip fracture patients will be tested for sarcopenia according to the updated definitions of&#xD;
      the European and US-American working groups. In centers where bioimpedance measurements are&#xD;
      possible, participants will receive this measurement as part of the core data collection.&#xD;

        The investigators will recruit two groups, both acute (during hospital stay after hip&#xD;
        fracture) and subacute (up to 6 months post hip fracture from waiting lists). With this&#xD;
        strategy the investigators will not only have one segment of the disease, but the&#xD;
        life-course of PFF (first 12 months and the time after). Acute phase inclusion is defined&#xD;
        as inclusion start on first days after surgery and will be completed within the first 14&#xD;
        days. Subacute phase inclusion is defined as inclusion from waiting lists, where baseline&#xD;
        will be conducted up to 6 months after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
