    <textblock>
      To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of XEN496 in pediatric subjects with KCNQ2&#xD;
      developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2-DEE) who had participated in the primary&#xD;
      study (XPF-009-301).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term extension study of XEN496 for the treatment of seizures in&#xD;
      subjects with KCNQ2-DEE, that will be open to eligible subjects who participated in the&#xD;
      primary study, XPF-009-301. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety of&#xD;
      XEN496. A double-blind transition/titration period will be used to maintain blinding to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation in the primary study (XPF-009-301). After completion of the blinded&#xD;
      transition/titration period, subjects will receive the open label study drug at their optimal&#xD;
      dose for approximately 11 months.&#xD;

    <description>24-day blinded transition/titration period. Subjects who received XEN496 in the preceding study will continue to receive XEN496 at the same dose, in a blinded manner, without any further titration. Subjects, who were allocated to placebo in the preceding study, will be titrated to a tolerated dose up to a maximum dose of 21 mg/kg/day. To maintain the blinded aspect of the study, placebo will be dispensed to all subjects during the transition/titration period to ensure the total number of capsules are consistent across all subjects.&#xD;
Subjects who discontinue will be required to taper off study drug over a period of up to 15 days</description>

             will be considered as having completed participation in the primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The caregiver is willing and able to be compliant with diary completion, visit&#xD;
             schedule, and study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's caregiver achieved a minimum of 85% compliance with daily diary completion&#xD;
             during both baseline and the double-blind period of the primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s) during the primary study XPF-009-301,&#xD;
             which in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor, would preclude&#xD;
             the subject's entry into the OLE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A clinically significant condition or illness, or symptoms other than those resulting&#xD;
             from KCNQ2-DEE, present at screening/baseline that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would pose a risk to the subject if s/he were to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any conditions that were specified as exclusion criteria in the primary study,&#xD;
             XPF-009-301.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is anticipated that the subject will require treatment with at least 1 of the&#xD;
             disallowed medications during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any change in cardiac rhythm or atrioventricular conduction in the primary study that,&#xD;
             in the investigator's opinion, is a significant risk to subject safety.&#xD;
