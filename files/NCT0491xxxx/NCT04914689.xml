  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee injuries, especially those to the ACL, are common among physically active people.&#xD;
      Preventing these injuries from happening is critical to limiting the long-term pain,&#xD;
      disability, and arthritis associated with these injuries. Our study is going to examine new&#xD;
      ways to provide feedback about the way people move to determine if these are better at&#xD;
      modifying movement patterns to prevent injury than current standard treatments. If you&#xD;
      participate, you will be asked to undergo a movement analysis in a research laboratory while&#xD;
      you perform tasks such as landing from a box and running and cutting. After this initial&#xD;
      assessment, you will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment groups. Each treatment group&#xD;
      will perform 4 weeks (3x/week) of exercises to change the way people land from a jump.&#xD;
      Participants will then report for follow-up movement analysis testing 1- and 4-weeks after&#xD;
      completing the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the popularity of injury prevention programs, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      injuries continue to occur at a rate of 250,000 per year in the United States. It is believed&#xD;
      that 75% of these injuries are preventable, thus alternative strategies to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      injury are necessary. One reason current prevention strategies are not wholly successful may&#xD;
      be their reliance on internal focus of attention (InFOCUS) feedback, which constrains&#xD;
      movement and increases injury risk. Our project will examine an alternative approach, testing&#xD;
      two different modes of external focus of attention (ExFOCUS) feedback to remove constrains on&#xD;
      the way people move to reduce injury risk. We will also examine cortical activity to&#xD;
      determine if there are differences in neuroplasticity that occur following each form of&#xD;
      feedback to better understand how each works. Collectively, the knowledge gained from this&#xD;
      study will inform the development of programs to reduce injury risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine ExFOCUS's ability to reduce the risk of noncontact ACL injury by&#xD;
      retaining improved biomechanics compared to InFOCUS. Hypothesis 1.1: the combined auditory&#xD;
      and visual ExFOCUS groups will demonstrate greater improvements in biomechanics and will&#xD;
      retain these improvements 1 month after cessation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine differences in the ability of the two modes (visual and auditory)&#xD;
      of ExFOCUS to change biomechanics. Hypothesis 2.1: Auditory ExFOCUS feedback will elicit&#xD;
      superior results compared to visual ExFOCUS feedback immediately following the intervention.&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To quantify differences in cortical activity following external focus of&#xD;
      attention and internal focus of attention feedback. Hypothesis 3.1: External focus of&#xD;
      attention feedback will increase cortical activity in both groups while there will be no&#xD;
      changes in cortical activity during internal focus of attention feedback Hypothesis 3.2:&#xD;
      Auditory feedback will elicit greater changes in auditory regions of the brain, while visual&#xD;
      feedback will elicit greater changes in regions of the brain responsible for processing&#xD;
      visual information.&#xD;
