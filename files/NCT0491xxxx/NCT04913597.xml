  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) represent a highly effective and well-tolerated&#xD;
      second-line ITP treatment that provides excellent responses.If there is cross-resistance&#xD;
      between 2 drugs for the treatment of adult ITP is still unkonwn.The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching avatrombopag and rh-TPO in adults with&#xD;
      ITP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists (TPO-RAs) are novel treatments for patients with chronic&#xD;
      Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). According to the findings of mechanism-based studies,&#xD;
      rhTPO competes with endogenous TPO for binding to TPO-R while avatrombopag has an additive&#xD;
      effect with endogenous TPO, indicating that the treatment mechanism and side-effect profiles&#xD;
      could be somewhat different between these drugs. If there is cross-resistance between 2 drugs&#xD;
      for the treatment of adult ITP is still no answer. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of switching avatrombopag and rh-TPO in adults with&#xD;
      ITP.This is a non-interventional study. Patients who fail previous steroids and receive&#xD;
      rh-TPO and then switch to avatrombopag or vice versa will be enrolled. The reason for switch&#xD;
      will be recorded. The efficacy, safety, and patient/physician preference will be assessed and&#xD;
      compared between the two agents.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who fail previous steroids and avatrombopag and then switch to Rh-TPO will be enrolled. The reason for switch will be recorded. Patients will be given rh-TPO 300 U/kg once daily for 14 days as initial treatment. After initial treatment, maintenance therapy were performance. At initial therapy, rhTPO will be suspended when platelet counts ≥100×10^9 / L. During maintenance therapy, patients with platelet counts &gt;150×10^9 / L will suspend treatment until platelet counts drop to ≤150×10^9 / L. Dosing interval will be prolonged when platelet count is ≥100×10^9 / L to ≤150×10^9 / L. Dose modification is not required when platelet count is ≥30×10^9 / L to &lt;100×10^9 / L. The efficacy, safety, and patient/physician preference will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Patients who fail previous steroids and rh-TPO and then switch to avatrombopag will be enrolled. The reason for switch will be recorded. Patients will be given avatrombopag 20mg once daily as initiate treatment, and adjust the dosage according to the count of platelets. The maximum dose of avatrombopag is 40mg daily.Avatrombopag will be terminated any time the platelet counts increased above 250×10^9/L. Dose adjustment of avatrombopag will be allowed to maintain platelet counts between 30×10^9/L and 150×10^9/L. The efficacy, safety, and patient/physician preference will be assessed.</description>
