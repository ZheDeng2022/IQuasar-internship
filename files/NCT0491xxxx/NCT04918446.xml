  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a technology-based brief educational intervention for hospitalized&#xD;
      patients that will be discharged with an opioid prescription. The Investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a small randomized clinical trial of T-POSE to determine whether it improves patients:&#xD;
      knowledge and reduces the incidence of Non-Medical Prescription Opioid Use (NMPOU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMPOU) can be generally defined as not taking&#xD;
      opioids as prescribed, which could occur unintentionally or intentionally. In 2014, 4.3&#xD;
      million adults in the United States (U.S.) were estimated to engage in NMPOU (Center for&#xD;
      Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2014). Some patients may take a dose more frequently&#xD;
      than prescribed because they were not receiving adequate pain relief from the prescribed&#xD;
      dosage. While others may continue to take opioids longer than prescribed because their pain&#xD;
      is persistent and/or they like the euphoric effects of opioids. According to a recently&#xD;
      released Truven Health Analytics-NPR Health Poll, the majority (57%) of Americans have taken&#xD;
      a prescription opioid and 35% of those had concerns (e.g., addiction, effectiveness, side&#xD;
      effects) about prescription opioids. These findings suggest that while Americans are aware,&#xD;
      some even concerned, of the potential dangers associated with prescription opioids that their&#xD;
      utilization patterns continue to increase (Boddy 2017). Because opioids are prescribed by a&#xD;
      physician, patients may believe that these medications are safe and they may be unaware of&#xD;
      the risks associated with misuse and abuse of opioids. NMPOU may lead to increased risk of&#xD;
      drug overdose, addiction, diversion and use of heroin. Many individuals with opioid use&#xD;
      disorders initiated NMPOU before transitioning to heroin (Banerjee et al. 2016; Cerda et al.&#xD;
      2015) and report that their first exposure to an opioid was prescribed by a physician. This&#xD;
      underscores the need for empirically-tested educational interventions that can potentially&#xD;
      reduce NMPOU and diversion. Prescription opioids have an important role to play in health&#xD;
      care and blanket policies to restrict access to prescription opioids are not appropriate,&#xD;
      rather the hypothesis is that harm can be reduced by fundamentally changing our approach to&#xD;
      opioid medication safety.&#xD;
