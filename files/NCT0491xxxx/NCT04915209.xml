      The researchers wish to determine what are patients/care partners priorities in terms of care&#xD;
      delivery based at home/community and define the envisioning care delivery model that support&#xD;
      both social care and medical care from the perspective of people living with Parkinson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrative interviews and workshops are conducted to obtain information on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Everyday life, living with PD (perception and consequences of PD in everyday life)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Care delivery priorities from the perspective of PwPs &amp; Care Partners&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Factors influencing care delivery (facilitators &amp; barriers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Needs and expectations about social care and medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Role playing by eHealth technologies in a care delivery model based at home/community&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narratives are stories that are based on the unfolding of events or actions from the&#xD;
      perspective of a patient's life experience. Patients and care partners tell their stories of&#xD;
      illness and how they live with illness over time. They are encouraged to share their personal&#xD;
      stories of living with PD, using health services, community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher could focus on the care priorities, the support needed, the information needed&#xD;
      and the challenges faced. The narrative interview will be used to get an overview of the&#xD;
      patient's trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the workshop, the participants will collectively create a common representation of the&#xD;
      patient journey and co-design the envisioning care delivery model that support both social&#xD;
      care and medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient journey map gives a common picture of the process and the way patients experience&#xD;
      their care delivery. Understanding the patients' experiences of their journey is essential in&#xD;
      order to co-design the future care delivery model based at home/community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Journey map proposes a visual representation of the relationship between patients and the&#xD;
      healthcare services. They also help to visually externalize patient experience by placing&#xD;
      them at the heart of the modelling process. The journey map is an effective tool that reduces&#xD;
      the complexity of health services to a comprehensible representation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the workshop, patients' needs and care priorities will be discussed considering&#xD;
      the different phases of the patient journey, and the participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      envisioning the future care delivery model based at home/community.&#xD;
