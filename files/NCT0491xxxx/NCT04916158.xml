  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, prosthetic replacement for osteoarthritis of the knee is a frequent surgery. In&#xD;
      France, nearly 100,000 knee arthroplasties are performed each year . Over the last two&#xD;
      decades, there has been growing interest in performing single compartment knee replacement&#xD;
      (SKR) surgery in patients with isolated single compartment osteoarthritis. The explanation&#xD;
      lies in faster recovery, less postoperative pain and less morbidity compared to total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKR) . Pain control is one of the major elements of outpatient management of&#xD;
      CKD . Prosthetic knee surgery is very painful, the median pain is rated at 5 out of 10 and on&#xD;
      average we use 32 milligrams of morphine . The efficiency of the adductor canal block is&#xD;
      effective in this context, it avoids the motor block obtained by the femoral block, therefore&#xD;
      interesting for ambulatory management in view of a resumption of the fast walking foreseen&#xD;
      for the patient. The IPACK (interspace between popliteal artery and the capsule posterior&#xD;
      knee) is designed to block the small sensory branches of the sciatic nerve that pass through&#xD;
      this space without affecting the motor components. The IPACK block provides analgesia only&#xD;
      for the posterior knee and would probably be ineffective alone for postoperative analgesia It&#xD;
      is therefore often performed with an adductor canal block for multimodal analgesia. This&#xD;
      block is performed in several facilities, and data are increasingly emerging on its&#xD;
      effectiveness .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, based on the recommendations of the French Society of Anesthesia and Resuscitation, on&#xD;
      improved rehabilitation after heavy orthopedic surgery on the lower limb published in 2019&#xD;
      the objective of this study is to evaluate the relevance of a protocol concerning prosthetic&#xD;
      knee replacement (PUC) in ambulatory care, based on optimized pain control.&#xD;

      In France, nearly 100,000 knee arthroplasties are performed each year . Knee prostheses&#xD;
      generate a functional benefit demonstrated in the literature and limited perioperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in the&#xD;
      use of single-compartment knee arthroplasty (SKR) in patients with isolated&#xD;
      single-compartment osteoarthritis (OA). The explanation lies in faster recovery, less&#xD;
      postoperative pain and less morbidity compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKR) Improvements&#xD;
      in perioperative care with regard to analgesia, anesthesia, but also nursing care and&#xD;
      rehabilitation have led to a significant reduction in length of stay. Effective pain&#xD;
      management is essential and is a necessary condition for early mobilization and a reduction&#xD;
      in length of stay. Cross et al. and Berger et al. have shown that reducing the length of stay&#xD;
      of patients hospitalized after knee arthroplasty can be achieved not only without&#xD;
      compromising patient safety, but also without compromising patient satisfaction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipating pain control represents a major asset for ambulatory management. As early as the&#xD;
      end of the 1990s, it was demonstrated that pain control is the main parameter in ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery .prosthetic knee surgery is a very painful surgery. The efficiency of the adductor&#xD;
      canal block is effective in this context. It reduces the motor block obtained at the level of&#xD;
      the femoral block, which is particularly interesting for ambulatory management with a view to&#xD;
      the patient's planned fast walking. The IPACK (interspace between popliteal artery and the&#xD;
      capsule posterior knee) is designed to block the small sensory branches of the sciatic nerve&#xD;
      that travel in this space without affecting the motor components. The IPACK block provides&#xD;
      analgesia only for the posterior knee and would probably be ineffective alone for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia,so it is often performed with an adductor canal block in a multimodal&#xD;
      analgesic pathway. Although this block is performed in several institutions, data is still&#xD;
      emerging on its effectiveness. For example, a randomized trial in a single institution&#xD;
      involving 86 patients undergoing GPT revealed that the combination of IPACK, adductor canal&#xD;
      block and periarticular infiltration improved postoperative analgesia and reduced opioid&#xD;
      consumption compared to periarticular injection alone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, based on the SFAR recommendations on improved rehabilitation after heavy orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery on the lower limb published in 2019 , we set up a protocol for a feasibility study of&#xD;
      prosthetic knee replacement (PUC) on an outpatient basis, based on optimized pain control.&#xD;
