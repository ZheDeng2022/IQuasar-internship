  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study to investigate the effect of muscle energy techniques on functional&#xD;
      abilities of patients with chronic discogenic unilateral sciatica and to explain it from a&#xD;
      physiological and functional point of view&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disability and emotional distress among patients with lumbar spondylosis has a negative&#xD;
      impact on well-being. Anxiety and depression are common emotional problems among patients&#xD;
      with LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience of pain interferes with different aspects of the patient's life, negatively&#xD;
      affecting their daily activities, physical and mental health, family and social&#xD;
      relationships, and their interactions in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This problem also affects the health care system and what is known as economic well-being,&#xD;
      the strong burden associated with Chronic Pain not only deriving from healthcare costs but&#xD;
      also from the loss of productivity and from compensatory payments to patients as a result of&#xD;
      the disability that pain produces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement research has vast implications for muscle energy techniques for individuals with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain and sciatica, the thoracolumbar normal range of motion plays an&#xD;
      essential role in transferring the body weight and performing daily activities. Poor spinal&#xD;
      range of motion and tightness of paraspinal muscles have previously been noted in individuals&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain and sciatica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the previous studies focused on dealing with chronic low back pain and sciatica&#xD;
      through using different medications and physical therapy modalities for the symptoms such as&#xD;
      TENS. Since muscle energy techniques can decrease the tension of the muscles of the lumbar&#xD;
      spine and gives a real chance to improve the flexibility of those muscles which might inhibit&#xD;
      the severity of sciatica with low costs so it's recommended to study its effect on the&#xD;
      functional abilities of the patients so that it can be the main part of physical therapy&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
