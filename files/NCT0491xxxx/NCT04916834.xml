      Prospective study in a group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pulmonary and heart dysfunction, fibrosis-related markers and antibodies as&#xD;
      well as the search for risk factors for an unfavorable course and possible complications in&#xD;
      patients after pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of approx. 100 patients assessed shortly after pneumonia and followed up,&#xD;
      investigated after 3 and 6 months with possible prolongation to 12 months.&#xD;
