    <textblock>
      This study evaluates blood samples and compares levels of metabolites (levels of vitamins,&#xD;
      carbohydrates, proteins, etc., that are in the blood), before and after the plasma exchange&#xD;
      in patients scheduled to receive immunotherapy for their ovarian cancer. The information&#xD;
      gained from this study may help researchers better understand the side effects from each&#xD;
      treatment and possibly lessen those side effects for future treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the extent to which PARP inhibitor (PARPi) treatment reduces systemic levels&#xD;
      of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived cancer support factors in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples prior to drug initiation, weekly thereafter for&#xD;
      the first month of therapy, monthly for the first month, and at disease progression or after&#xD;
      cessation of treatment to monitor for toxicity. Blood samples are analyzed. Patients' medical&#xD;
      charts are also reviewed to determine outcomes after PARP inhibition.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived cancer support factors</measure>
    <time_frame>At four weeks post PARP inhibitor treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of MSC-derived cancer support factors will be compared to baseline (i.e. pre-PARPi therapy) at each collection time point by Student's t test. In addition, outcomes by Cox proportional hazards will be compared between designated responders (i.e. patients whose MSC-derived cancer support factors decreased after PARP inhibition) and non-responders (i.e. patients whose MSC-derived cancer support factors did not decrease after PARP inhibition)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Stratified by extent of MSC-derived cancer support factor reduction. Will also compare levels at progression and/or after discontinuation of therapy.</description>
