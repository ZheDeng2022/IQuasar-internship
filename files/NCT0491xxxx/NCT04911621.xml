  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood aggressive gliomas are rare brain tumors with very poor prognosis. Due to the&#xD;
      tumor's location and infiltrative nature, surgical removal is not always possible, and even&#xD;
      when resection is performed and combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy, tumor cells&#xD;
      frequently persist, eventually giving rise to tumor recurrence. A promising strategy to&#xD;
      eradicate persisting tumor cells is vaccination with dendritic cells (DC). DC are immune&#xD;
      cells that play an important role in organizing the body's defense against cancer. The goal&#xD;
      of DC vaccination is to activate these natural anti-tumor defense mechanisms to delay or&#xD;
      prevent tumor progression or recurrence. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that DC&#xD;
      vaccination is well-tolerated, safe and capable of eliciting tumorspecific immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical study including 10 pediatric patients (aged ≥ 12 months and &lt; 18 years at the time&#xD;
      of signing the informed consent) with brain (stem) tumors is initiated at the Antwerp&#xD;
      University Hospital to investigate intradermal vaccination with WT1 mRNA-loaded autologous&#xD;
      monocyte-derived DCs, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or&#xD;
      administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies. The general objective of this&#xD;
      phase I/II clinical study is (1) to demonstrate that WT1-targeted DC vaccine production and&#xD;
      administration in pediatric patients with HGG and DIPG, either combined with first-line&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies, is&#xD;
      feasible and safe, (2) to study vaccine-induced immune responses, (3) to document patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and clinical outcome for comparison with current patients' outcome allowing&#xD;
      indication of the added value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Overview of the study treatment scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG patients (stratum A)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be screened and registered in the study following diagnosis, which is&#xD;
           based on either histological confirmation or radiographic criteria. Maximal safe&#xD;
           resection prior to study entry is strongly recommended, but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis prior to temozolomide-based chemoradiation&#xD;
           and subsequent chemo-immunotherapy with maintenance temozolomide and autologous WT1&#xD;
           mRNA-loaded DC vaccination. Chemoradiation with subsequent maintenance temozolomide is&#xD;
           considered best available treatment and therefore not considered investigational. The&#xD;
           investigational treatment, i.e. adjuvant DC vaccination, is administered in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an induction phase, consisting of 3 weekly (-1 day, +2 days) DC vaccines, which is&#xD;
                initiated after chemoradiation, but before maintenance temozolomide therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a booster phase, consisting of 6 4-weekly (±3 days) DC vaccines, which are&#xD;
                administered during temozolomide maintenance cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Non-treatment naïve HGG and DIPG patients (stratum B)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who have undergone previous anti-glioma treatments can be included in the&#xD;
           study, provided they are eligible according to the in- and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The decision to start, continue or re-initiate conventional anti-glioma treatment,&#xD;
           including radio- and/or chemotherapy, and, if applicable, the treatment dose and scheme,&#xD;
           are at the Investigator's discretion. The backbone DC immunotherapy scheme for the&#xD;
           induction and booster phase will be maintained with minor modifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the induction phase, 3 DC vaccines will be administered on a weekly (-1 day,&#xD;
                +2 days) basis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  during the booster phase, 6 DC vaccines will be administered at regular intervals.&#xD;
                It is recommended that the time between subsequent vaccinations is no longer than 4&#xD;
                weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Continuation of DC vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
           While the study treatment schedule consists of 9 DC vaccinations (i.e. 3 induction and 6&#xD;
           booster vaccines), continuation of DC vaccination after the booster phase is allowed, on&#xD;
           the conditions that (1) the Investigator judges that the participant's clinical&#xD;
           situation justifies additional vaccinations, (2) consent for continuation of DC&#xD;
           vaccination of the parents/guardian and the participant (if aged 12 years or older) has&#xD;
           been obtained, and (3) residual vaccine aliquots are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Response assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disease evolution will be assessed radiologically according to the Response Assessment&#xD;
           in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. In addition, blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
           immunomonitoring purposes on the day of the first, fourth and seventh DC vaccine. Tumor&#xD;
           resection or biopsy specimens, if available, will be used for local immunological and&#xD;
           biomarker analysis. At regular time points throughout the study scheme, parents and&#xD;
           participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires on general and disease-specific&#xD;
           quality-of-life, as well as on executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up until 90 days after administration of the final DC vaccine or 24&#xD;
      months after study entry, whichever occurs later.&#xD;
