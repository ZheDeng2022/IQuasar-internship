      Login Fibromyalgia (FM) is a non-articular, chronic rheumatic disease of unknown etiology,&#xD;
      characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and the&#xD;
      presence of multiple tender points (1). Diagnostic criteria were defined by the American&#xD;
      Rheumatism Association (ARA) in 1990 (2). In order to diagnose FM, there should be widespread&#xD;
      pain and sensitivity in 11 or more of 18 specific points (3). The etiopathogenesis of FM is&#xD;
      still unknown, but factors such as physical trauma, surgical intervention, infections, acute&#xD;
      or chronic emotional stress may play a triggering role (4). Various findings such as muscular&#xD;
      symptoms, cognitive complaints, depression, insomnia and fatigue accompanying chronic pain&#xD;
      have been described in patients with FM (5). Various psychopathological disorders have been&#xD;
      reported in FM. It is estimated that 1/3 of his patients have minor depression or anxiety.&#xD;
      However, it is not known whether anxiety and depression in FM cause chronic pain or&#xD;
      contribute to the severity of symptoms (3). Despite the various complaints of patients with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, the fact that no significant impairment was found in physical examination and&#xD;
      laboratory tests suggests that the symptoms may be psychologically induced (6). Since the&#xD;
      etiology of fibromyalgia syndrome is unknown, pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment methods should be used in patient-specific combinations according to the prominent&#xD;
      symptoms and their severity (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health as well as the physical health of FMS patients is frequently investigated. It&#xD;
      has been observed that depressions accompany FMS in the majority of patients (7 -11).&#xD;
      Likewise, FMS patients frequently get various psychiatric comorbidities such as panic&#xD;
      disorder and anxiety (12,13). In addition, studies consistently point to an increased rate of&#xD;
      designed suicide after the development of fibromyalgia in this patient group due to the&#xD;
      burden of the disease and the high prevalence of depression (14-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of psychological factors in fibromyalgia is a controversial issue. However, many&#xD;
      studies have shown that these patients experience deterioration in personality patterns,&#xD;
      increased stress levels, anxiety, depression, or other psychological symptoms (17,18).&#xD;
      Although psychological factors are not considered to be the primary cause of fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      there are findings that depression is a very important predictor of the development of FMS&#xD;
      (12,19). On the other hand, researchers have pointed out that fibromyalgia and depression&#xD;
      generally have two-way relationships by overlapping (18,20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta gets its name from Teta brain waves. Generally, at night, while sleeping, during deep&#xD;
      meditation , and experiencing oneness in the universe, situations occur at the theta&#xD;
      wavelength. So the Theta state is a very deep state of relaxation . While in this wavelength&#xD;
      , we can easily connect with the brain so that our haunted beliefs here can be controlled.&#xD;
      This condition is associated with strong theta rhythmic activity patterns. Theta activities&#xD;
      occur in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between the client and the practitioner at a&#xD;
      wavelength of 4-7 Hz (21). ThetaHealing® (Vianna Stibal, Kalispell, MT) is a spiritual&#xD;
      healing method in which practitioner and client participate in joint meditations during&#xD;
      several subliminal sessions. Thetahealing is practiced by people who are internationally&#xD;
      trained in this field. It is claimed that these meditation periods are characterized by a&#xD;
      &quot;theta state&quot; in which the presence of theta waves in the electroencephalograph (EEG)&#xD;
      frequency spectrum of both the practitioner and the client is assumed (21) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Located above the psychological and physiological bases for fibromyalgia origin information&#xD;
      in light of the Fibromyalgia Patients Group Exercise ii and Thetahealing Pain and e on&#xD;
      quality of life TKİ designed this study to determine n.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Our research is planned to be conducted entirely on an online platform in order not to&#xD;
      risk the participants due to the Covid-19 measures. The study will be carried out on a&#xD;
      voluntary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;

      changes mei&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of our study will be analyzed with the SPSS (version 22.0) computer program.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics techniques will be used to reveal the averages of all values of the&#xD;
      data obtained in the research (percentage and descriptive statistics, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation values , t test, nonparametric tests if necessary ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it will be a volunteer-based study, the volunteer can leave the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation parameters to be used in research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The socio-demographic information of the individuals who agreed to participate in the study&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be used 2 times, with all evaluation parameters before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pg-36 will be used to evaluate the quality of life of the participants, the numerical pain&#xD;
      scale will be used to evaluate the pain levels, and the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate the effect level of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers participating in our study will be randomly divided into 2 groups. In the&#xD;
      randomization of the groups, the assignment to the groups will be made with the randomizer&#xD;
      program using a computer. R astgel created in one of two exercise group (control group), the&#xD;
      other is exercise additional thetahealig (experimental group) group will have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thetahealing will be administered by the researcher who is an internationally trained&#xD;
      specialist physiotherapist (Appendix 1 Certificate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise group ha in FTAs 2, each session will be 30 minutes of evil sown in stretching ,&#xD;
      which made combining relaxation and strengthening exercises therapeutic exercise program for&#xD;
      6 weeks from the online platform will be implemented in the form of group exercise form is&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise and Thetahealing treatment group, on the other hand, is planned for 6 weeks , 1&#xD;
      session per week, 30 minutes per session, in addition to the exercise sessions, the first and&#xD;
      last sessions to be individual and personalized .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications will be carried out on the online platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation methods to be used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scale; It measures 10 different characteristics: physical function, feeling unwell,&#xD;
      absenteeism, difficulty at work, pain, fatigue, morning fatigue, stiffness, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Except for the sense of well-being, lower scores indicate improvement or less&#xD;
      affected by the disease. FEA is filled by the patient. The maximum possible score for each&#xD;
      subtitle is 10. Thus, the total maximum score is 100. While an average FM patient scores 50,&#xD;
      more severely affected FM patients usually score above 70 (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Form-36: SF-36 was developed to evaluate the quality of life. Its validity and&#xD;
      reliability study has been carried out in Turkey. SF-36 is used to compare general and&#xD;
      specific populations, to demonstrate the health benefits of different treatments, and to&#xD;
      monitor patients. The last 4 weeks are taken into account in the evaluation of SF-36, which&#xD;
      consists of 36 items ( 2-4 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerical Pain Scale s : D eg flood analogue scale on 0 (I have no pain) to 10 (I have a pain&#xD;
      in the degree intolerably) at the desired point is marked by giving a score between acquaint&#xD;
      feel the pain severity of patients (5 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to be used in the research are used routinely.&#xD;
