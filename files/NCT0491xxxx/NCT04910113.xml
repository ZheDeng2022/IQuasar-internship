      bronchiectasis is achronic inflammatory lung disease. It is defined by the presence of&#xD;
      permanent and abnormal dilatation of the bronchi. which leads to chronic sputum production&#xD;
      and impaired bacterial clearance. The affected parts of the lungs develop a vicious cycle of&#xD;
      failed pathogen clearance leading to frequent infections, chronic inflammation and ongoing&#xD;
      structural damage. The main symptoms are daily cough, daily sputum production and frequent&#xD;
      respiratory infections. There is low frequency of non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis The&#xD;
      prevalence rate of NCFB in the general population was calculated to be 39.9 cases per&#xD;
      100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing prevalence of bronchiectasis in the elderly, affecting approximately&#xD;
      10 patients per 1,000 population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study of health claims between 1999-2001 in the US suggested the&#xD;
      prevalence of bronchiectasis to be 4.2 per 100,000 population aged 1834 years and 271.8 per&#xD;
      100,000 population aged &gt;75 years . This usually occurs in the context of chronic airway&#xD;
      infection causing inflammation. The main clinical manifestation is a productive cough.&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis is currently nearly always diagnosed using high-resolution computed tomography&#xD;
      (HRCT) scanning. The main diagnostic features are: 1) internal diameter of a bronchus is&#xD;
      wider than its adjacent pulmonary artery; 2) failure of the bronchi to taper; and 3)&#xD;
      visualization of bronchi in the outer 12 cm of the lung fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, and&#xD;
      single-stranded RNA viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In late December 2019, an outbreak of an unknown disease called pneumonia of unknown cause&#xD;
      occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.1 The outbreak has spread substantial to infect 9720&#xD;
      people in China with 213 deaths and to infect 106 people in 19 other countries up to 31&#xD;
      January 2020 . A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was&#xD;
      identified as a novel coronavirus (nCoV) by several independent laboratories.2-4 The&#xD;
      causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively. According to the daily report of&#xD;
      the World Health Organization, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 so far registered 78630 cases and&#xD;
      2747 deaths in China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of 3664 cases by 27&#xD;
      February 2020 . COVID-19 epidemic has become a global health threat. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are&#xD;
      a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA viruses.5 They&#xD;
      cause several diseases involving respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems with&#xD;
      vary severity among humans and animals.6,7 The envelope spike (S) protein is important for&#xD;
      CoV.19 The S protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion and is crucial for&#xD;
      determining host tropism and transmission capacity.8,9,10 The final etiologic diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19 is nessary can be farther further confirmed with a positive real-time RT-PCR assay&#xD;
      for COVID-19 using respiratory or blood samples or by means of viral gene sequencing of&#xD;
      respiratory or blood samples that are highly homologous with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical chest CT findings include multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with&#xD;
      patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally subpleural distribution, and posterior part or&#xD;
      lower lobe predilection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 remain to be investigated, although several publications&#xD;
      have reported a fibrotic phase with reticulation characteristics, interlobar septal&#xD;
      thickening, and traction bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset and development of bronchiectasis during the follow-up of COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia are under-reported.&#xD;
