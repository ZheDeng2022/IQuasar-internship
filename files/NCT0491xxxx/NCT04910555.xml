  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls have multifactorial etiologies in older people. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are&#xD;
      one of those, with an increase prevalence over years (30% of people over 75 years old have&#xD;
      overactive bladder [OAB]). Previous studies showed that older women with OAB with or without&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (UI) are prone to have gait disorders (decrease of gait speed and step&#xD;
      width and increase of number of step). Besides UI, it is more likely the strong desire to&#xD;
      void (SDV) that seems to impact gait and balance control. In older women with UI, balance on&#xD;
      stabilometric parameters have been affected with an increase of the center of pression (COP)&#xD;
      sway range, COP area and rambling trajectory. SDV seems to act like an additional cognitive&#xD;
      task. A similar and increased reaction time has been observed in comparing with a distracting&#xD;
      task in healthy volunteers. In older people who are susceptible to distracting task, SDV may&#xD;
      alters balance and gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this prospective study is to assess the impact of SDV on&#xD;
      stabilometric parameters (center of foot pressure (COP) area, the distance travelled made by&#xD;
      COP, the mean X-axis displacement and the mean Y-axis displacement) compared to the &quot;empty&#xD;
      bladder&quot; condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of a cognitive task (verbal fluency) on&#xD;
      stabilometric parameters in comparison with the &quot;no cognitive task condition&quot; and the &quot;SDV&#xD;
      condition&quot;; to assess the impact of &quot;SDV condition&quot; on balance and gait clinical evaluation&#xD;
      (Timed up and go test, unipedal stance test, Berg scale, 10m walking speed, 5 chair stand)&#xD;
      Thus, showing that SDV may impact balance in geriatric population will lead to the importance&#xD;
      to identify and LUTS as potential fall risk factor in order to decrease falls incidence in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;

      alters balance and gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this prospective study is to assess the impact of SDV on&#xD;
      stabilometric parameters (center of foot pressure (COP) area, the distance travelled made by&#xD;
      COP, the mean X-axis displacement and the mean Y-axis displacement) compared to the &quot;empty&#xD;
      bladder&quot; condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are assessing the impact of a cognitive task (verbal fluency) on&#xD;
      stabilometric parameters in comparison with the &quot;no cognitive task condition&quot; and the &quot;SDV&#xD;
      condition&quot;; and assessing the impact of &quot;SDV condition&quot; on balance and gait clinical&#xD;
      evaluation (Timed up and go test, unipedal stance test, Berg scale, 10m walking speed, 5&#xD;
      chair stand) This prospective study will take place in a rehabilitation department during a&#xD;
      2hours-consultation. The eligible criteria are: women over 65 years old, with OAB with or&#xD;
      without UI, able to walk without mobility equipment without neurologic pathology or spine&#xD;
      surgery, without severe cognitive impairment (MMSE &gt; 24) or legal protection, and who agree&#xD;
      to be involved in the study. OAB was defined by urinary urgency, usually with urinary&#xD;
      frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included women will first have a standard urinary consultation in which comorbidities,&#xD;
      treatments and urinary symptoms will be recorded. Participants will also have questionnaires&#xD;
      on urinary symptoms (Urinary Symptom Profile and Incontinence Consultation Incontinence&#xD;
      Questionnaires) and the Mini Mental Status Examination (assessing cognitive functions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, participants will be evaluated on balance and gait clinical and instrumental parameters&#xD;
      under &quot;SDV&quot; and &quot;empty bladder&quot; conditions. The order of these evaluations (SDV/empty&#xD;
      bladder) is randomized by computer. The clinical evaluations are the Timed up and go test,&#xD;
      the unipedal stance test, the Berg scale, the 10m walking speed test and the 5-chair-stand&#xD;
      test. The stabilometry evaluation (recording the center of foot pressure (COP) area, the&#xD;
      distance travelled made by COP, the mean X-axis displacement and the mean Y-axis&#xD;
      displacement) will be on a force platform under 4 conditions: SDV with and without verbal&#xD;
      fluency and empty bladder with and without verbal fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stabilographic parameters will be analyzed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. The&#xD;
      repeated factors are the SDV and empty bladder condition and with or without verbal fluency.&#xD;
      Four testing combinations of these factors will be used: SDV/with verbal fluency, SDV/without&#xD;
      verbal fluency, empty bladder/with verbal fluency and empty bladder/without verbal fluency.&#xD;
      The ANOVA results will be used to calculate the F statistics for each main effect and&#xD;
      interaction. The post-hoc comparisons will be performed using the Bonferroni test. The level&#xD;
      of statistical significance was set in all tests at P≤0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, if we show that SDV may impact balance in geriatric population it will lead to the&#xD;
      importance to identify and treat LUTS as potential fall risk factor in order to decrease&#xD;
      falls incidence in this population.&#xD;
