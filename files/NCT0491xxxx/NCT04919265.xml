  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mother-infant cohort study aims to determine the geographic differences in the microbial&#xD;
      profiles in breast milk from mothers living in Malaysia and China that are potentially&#xD;
      important determinants of infant development. It also aims to determine the impact of gut&#xD;
      microbiome on infant health (temperament, gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema symptoms, and&#xD;
      asthma symptoms).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota plays a critical role in children's developmental pathways especially in the&#xD;
      first 1000 days of life. A number of pre- and post-natal factors were known to affect gut&#xD;
      microbiota in infants during their first year of life including mode of delivery, infant&#xD;
      feeding practices, dietary intake, and human milk composition. However, there is no&#xD;
      mother-infant cohort study comparing gut microbiota profile and breastmilk composition of&#xD;
      mothers living in Malaysia and China. Recent studies showed that gut microbiota was&#xD;
      associated with infant health including temperament, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, and&#xD;
      asthma. However, little is known about the gut microbiome and the factors that contribute to&#xD;
      microbial variation in the gut of South East Asian children. Increased awareness on the&#xD;
      importance of gut health helps establish pre-natal and post-natal factors that promote&#xD;
      healthy development and functioning of immune system, gastrointestinal health, and metabolism&#xD;
      in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective cohort study involving pregnant women in the first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Data will be collected from the eligible pregnant women during their first&#xD;
      trimester (8-12 weeks of gestation), second trimester (24 weeks of gestation), third&#xD;
      trimester (34 weeks of gestation) and follow-up infants and mothers postnatally after birth&#xD;
      (1-5 days after delivery), at 10-15 days, 1 month, 4 months and 12 months of age with a total&#xD;
      of 8 follow-ups of mother-infant biological samples and related research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be interviewed on socio-demographic background and information on pre-natal and&#xD;
      post-natal factors such as obstetric history, exposure to antibiotics/prebiotics/probiotics/&#xD;
      paracetamol, pre-pregnancy body BMI, gestational weight gain, GDM, physical activity, food&#xD;
      security, smoking during pregnancy/second-hand exposure, dietary intake, stress during&#xD;
      pregnancy, home settings, pet keeping, and post-natal depression. Mothers will also be&#xD;
      interviewed on their infants' sex, birth order, gestational age, mode of delivery, body&#xD;
      weight, length, and head circumferences, second hand smoke exposure, exposure to&#xD;
      antibiotics/prebiotics/probiotics/paracetamol, infant feeding practices, dietary intake, and&#xD;
      dietary diversity. Anthropometric measurements of mothers and infants will be conducted at&#xD;
      every visit. Blood, fecal, saliva, and urine samples of mothers and infants will also be&#xD;
      collected. All bio-specimens are stored at -80°C until they are transported to National&#xD;
      Engineering Center of Dairy for Maternal and Child Health, Beijing, China for further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temperament</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Infant temperament is assessed using Revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ-R) (Gartstein &amp; Rothbart, 2003). It consists of 91 items with 14 subscales, including activity level, distress to limitations, high pleasure, low pleasure, soothability, falling reactivity, cuddliness, perceptual sensitivity, sadness, approach, and vocal reactivity. Mothers are requested to report their infants' behaviors during specific events in the past week using a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always). Total scores of each dimensions range from 1 to 7, with a higher dimension score indicates higher tendency towards the dimension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>from birth to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers are required to complete the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire for Pediatric Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders-Toddler (R4PDQ-toddler) about their child's GI symptoms (Van Tilburg et al., 2016). Those who fulfill criteria for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis are considered as having gastrointestinal problem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eczema symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>from birth to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of eczema in infants will be determined based on five questions of the UK Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis (Williams et al., 1994) with response options &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Total scores range from 0 to 5. Higher score indicates presence of eczema. Eczema in infants will be identified by the presence of an itchy skin condition plus 2 or more of the followings: (1) History of involvement of skin creases such as folds of elbows, behind the knees, fronts of ankles cheeks, or around the neck, (2) A history of atopic disease in a first-degree relative, (3) A history of a general dry skin, and (4) Visible flexural eczema.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>from birth to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Predictive Index (API) (Castro-Rodríguez et al., 2000) is used to determine the likelihood of infants who may develop asthma. A positive API score requires recurrent episodes of wheezing during the first 3 years of life and 1 of 2 major criteria (physician-diagnosed eczema or parental asthma) or 2 of 3 minor criteria (physician-diagnosis allergic rhinitis, wheezing without colds, or peripheral eosinophilia ≥4%). A loose index (&lt;3 episodes/y and 1 of the major or 2 of the minor criteria) and a stringent index (≥3 episodes/year and 1 of the major or 2 of the minor criteria) are available.</description>
