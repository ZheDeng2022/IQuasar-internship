      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the causative organism of&#xD;
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19); infects primarily the lungs leading to more than 100&#xD;
      million COVID-19 cases around the world, resulting in almost three million deaths. Covid-19&#xD;
      spectrum of symptoms expanded from upper respiratory tract infection to extensive viral&#xD;
      pneumonia and respiratory failure. Covid-19 patients are highly susceptible to superimposed&#xD;
      secondary infection especially fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is one of the most aggressive forms of sinusitis that&#xD;
      is commonly present in immunocompromised patients and frequently leads to significant&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Mucormycosis a life threatening AIFS characterized by hyphal&#xD;
      invasion and massive destruction of maxillofacial structures. Histological characters include&#xD;
      mycotic infiltration of vessels with propensity to tissue infarction. In addition to other&#xD;
      fungi such as Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Aspergillus and Candida that&#xD;
      frequently lead to secondary fungal infection in Covid-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-existence of Covid-19 and AIFS is due to immune dysregulation in Covid-19 patients as&#xD;
      both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are suppressed thus impair patients' innate immunity. In&#xD;
      addition to the extensive use of steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics and monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies may contribute in fungal infection. Covid-19 patients with pre-existing conditions&#xD;
      such as untreated HIV, organ transplantation, un controlled diabetes and malignancies are&#xD;
      more susceptible to AIFS on the contrary Covid-19 patients with underlying chronic disease&#xD;
      such as hypertension, chronic kidney and chronic heart disease usually are not associated&#xD;
      with more risk of AIFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking in consideration raised incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with AIFS and&#xD;
      on the other hand limited studies available especially in middle east region raised the&#xD;
      importance of studying the incidence and the behaviour of AIFS in Covid-19 patients. This&#xD;
      study aims to To assess the occurrence of AIFS superinfections in patients with Covid-19.&#xD;
