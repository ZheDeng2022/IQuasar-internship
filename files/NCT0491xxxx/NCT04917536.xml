  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show if there is any speed difference of functional recovery for&#xD;
      people with humeral fracture, treated by an anterograde nail, which will be inserted through&#xD;
      the rotator cuff (the common way) or through the rotator interval split.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study will be randomized to one of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery will be evaluated by the Constant score over time, for a year. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is the rotator interval split approach allows a faster functional recovery after&#xD;
      humeral nailing, by avoiding opening the rotator cuff.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Humeral fractures are the third most common fractures over 65 years and represent 8% of all&#xD;
      fractures. The anterograde nailing is known to be an efficient way to treat humeral upper&#xD;
      extremity fractures and humeral diaphysis fractures. The main complications of this nailing&#xD;
      are pain, shoulder stiffness, rotator cuff tendinitis and impingement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have proven these problems can be due to the entry portal of the nail. Indeed, it is&#xD;
      inserted through the supra-spinatus tendon, which means an opening of the rotator cuff even&#xD;
      if it is closed at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the rotator interval split in the shoulder can allow to insert the nail through it&#xD;
      without opening the cuff or damaging the cartilage. It is located between the anterior side&#xD;
      of the supra-spinatus tendon and the posterior side of the long part of the biceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the speed of functional recovery according to the entry&#xD;
      portal, which are through the rotator cuff or through the rotator interval split, in humeral&#xD;
      fractures treated by anterograde nailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cutaneo-muscular approach will be the same in both groups, namely a trans-deltoid&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will be included in the study after an enlightened and signed consent, afterward they&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the primary outcome, the Constant Score will be used to measure the kinetic of&#xD;
      the recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are residual pain (measured by the VAS an evaluation of complications&#xD;
      and a radiological review (two different reviewers) to follow the healing and search any side&#xD;
      effects, the sick leave and rehabilitation durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients need to be available for a one-year follow-up. Each assessment will be checked&#xD;
      at 21 and 45 days, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery.&#xD;
