  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare functional and clinical outcomes of partial knee joint replacement&#xD;
      using the Persona Partial Knee (PPK) and a standard care total knee replacement. Reported&#xD;
      benefits of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) compared to total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) are less invasive surgery, less post-operative pain, quicker recovery, shorter&#xD;
      inpatient stay, preservation of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), better knee function&#xD;
      and lower risk of complications. Also, the PPK more closely matches the anatomy of knee and&#xD;
      has more sizing options. These aim to allow the surgeon to reconstruct the knee to better&#xD;
      match the native knee and achieve natural function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little data exists which investigates biomechanical function of patients after UKA or&#xD;
      comparisons between UKA and TKA and none investigating the PPK. Available data focuses on&#xD;
      level walking which is not particularly challenging for these patients and is unlikely to&#xD;
      highlight biomechanical differences between UKA and TKA. The investigators will investigate&#xD;
      biomechanical differences between UKA and TKA during more challenging activities. These will&#xD;
      mirror activities of everyday life: sitting into/rising from a chair, stepping, walking on a&#xD;
      slope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate level walking as all studies of this nature report these&#xD;
      data. Unlike TKA, UKA retains the ACL. The soft tissues of the knee play a role in balance&#xD;
      control and the investigators will assess this with single leg balancing. Biomechanical&#xD;
      differences will be assessed using 3D motion analysis before and after surgery (6 and 12&#xD;
      months). Comparisons will be made within and between groups and between the patient groups&#xD;
      and existing healthy data. Radiographic and patient reported outcomes (satisfaction, pain and&#xD;
      functional abilities) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be recruited and randomised to undergo TKA or UKA. Only patients who are&#xD;
      suitable for UKA will be recruited. Data for 25 healthy, matched controls from the&#xD;
      investigator's existing healthy control database will be extracted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients identified as possible participants for the study will be given a &quot;consent to be&#xD;
      approached for research&quot; form on arrival at the clinic by the unit co-ordinator. On this,&#xD;
      patients can indicate their willingness or otherwise to have the study explained to them. The&#xD;
      completed form will be given to their consultant prior to their appointment. Patients who&#xD;
      have indicated willingness, and who are deemed suitable for the study following the&#xD;
      consultation, will have the study introduced to them by their consultant, who will then ask a&#xD;
      member of the research team to fully explain the study. These patients will be given a copy&#xD;
      of the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) to take away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a later date (at least a day after receiving the PIS), these patients will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone to ask for verbal consent. Patients will also have the opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
      about the study. Verbal consent will not be binding, but is necessary to give the research&#xD;
      team time to arrange pre-operative study interventions. Written consent will be taken when&#xD;
      the patient arrives for the pre-operative biomechanical testing session, once the researcher&#xD;
      is happy that the patient is fully informed. Consent will be sought by the principal&#xD;
      investigator or one of his delegates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care for knee arthroplasty patients at the GJNH has them completing the Oxford Knee&#xD;
      Score (OKS) and the EQ-5D pre-operatively and at six weeks post-operatively. In addition,&#xD;
      satisfaction is measured on a five point Likert scale six weeks post-operatively. Study&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to complete these three measures at six and 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively. Two additional questionnaires will be used in the study. The UCLA Activity&#xD;
      Score will be used pre-operatively and at six weeks, six months and 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively. The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) will be used at the three post-operative&#xD;
      time points (six week, six months and 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months post-operatively, study participants will have two radiographs taken (short AP&#xD;
      and lateral views) which are additional to the standard care radiography protocol. The six&#xD;
      and 12 month post-operative visits are additional to standard care and, as such, participants&#xD;
      will be offered the reimbursement of reasonable travelling costs. Biomechanical assessment&#xD;
      using clinical movement analysis (CMA) in the movement analysis laboratory (MAL) at the GJNH&#xD;
      will be carried out on three occasions (pre-operatively and at six and 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively). The MAL is a purpose built facility with restricted access for privacy.&#xD;
      Changing facilities are provided within the laboratory for participants to change from their&#xD;
      outdoor clothes into a T-shirt and shorts for the testing. They will also be asked to perform&#xD;
      the testing barefoot. At this point a health care support worker will apply a bandage to the&#xD;
      operated knee covering the wound to maintain the blinding of the person collecting the&#xD;
      biomechanical data. During these assessments, participants will have a number of small&#xD;
      reflective markers attached to their body using toupé tape. The movements of these markers&#xD;
      will be tracked by a number of infrared cameras connected to a computer. The data collected&#xD;
      in this manner can generate dynamic angles of the joints during the study tasks. In addition,&#xD;
      force plates embedded in the floor will measure forces generated during the study tasks which&#xD;
      can be converted to forces at each of the joints. During the assessment, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to perform a number of activities of daily living; level walking, incline and decline&#xD;
      walking, stand-to-sit-to-stand, step ascent and descent and single leg balance. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to perform each task a minimum of three times to ensure that three&#xD;
      representative samples of each task are obtained; except for the single leg balance, which&#xD;
      will be performed once for each limb. Pre-operative testing will determine baseline function&#xD;
      while post-operative assessment will highlight any changes in function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, participants will be randomised to receive the PPK unicondylar knee&#xD;
      implant or the total kneeimplant routinely used in the GJNH. Surgery will be performed as per&#xD;
      the surgeons' standard practice using the implant the participant was randomised to receive.&#xD;
      After their 12 months follow-up, the participants' involvement in the study will be over.&#xD;
