        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female Chinese participants must be 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at the&#xD;
             time of signing the ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Refer to Appendix 4 for reproductive criteria for male (Section 10.4.1) and&#xD;
                  female (Section 10.4.2) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chinese participant is defined as individuals currently residing in mainland&#xD;
                  China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female Chinese participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (except&#xD;
             for TG levels), and 12-lead ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fasting TG ≥ 90 mg/dL at Screening (up to 1 repeat allowed for TG and the second TG&#xD;
             value will be used for the eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. BMI of 17.5 to 35.0 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, syphilis, hepatitis B, or&#xD;
             hepatitis C; positive testing for HIV, syphilis, HBsAg, or HCVAb. Prior Hepatitis B&#xD;
             vaccination is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 4 months or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             preceding the first dose of study intervention used in this study (whichever is&#xD;
             longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least&#xD;
             5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the&#xD;
             BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used&#xD;
             to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Baseline 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTc&#xD;
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or&#xD;
             third-degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the&#xD;
             baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected&#xD;
             using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making&#xD;
             and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST or ALT level ≥1.25 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study&#xD;
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1&#xD;
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 400 mL or more within 60&#xD;
             days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of substance abuse within 12 months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Investigator site staff or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
             study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective&#xD;
             family members.&#xD;
