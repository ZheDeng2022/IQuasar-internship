      This phase 2, open label, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety of administering high&#xD;
      dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation therapy on days 1-3 of each cycle, as compared to&#xD;
      standard administration on days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle, in patients 61 years and older&#xD;
      with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject and the subject agrees to comply&#xD;

             contraindicates the use of protocol therapy or that might affect the interpretation of&#xD;
             the results of the study or that puts the subject at high risk for treatment&#xD;
             complications, in the opinion of the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;

             compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness&#xD;
&#xD;

             electronic medical record (e.g., if patient was followed by their local oncologist&#xD;
             between chemotherapy cycles and labs/transfusions/clinic notes, etc. are not&#xD;
