  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of peripheral blood lymphocyte decline in COVID-19 patients is not yet clear.&#xD;
      However, one theory demonstrated that in the whole progression of COVID-19, the extensive&#xD;
      activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) may reduce the cellular NAD+ and dampen the&#xD;
      adaptive immune system. So investigators presume that replenishing the NAD+ using&#xD;
      nicotinamide as the precursor may improve the lymphocyte counts and boost the adaptive immune&#xD;
      system. As a result, the study using nicotinamide as a kind of supportive therapy provide&#xD;
      further evidence of their efficiency and safety in treating lymphopenia in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

The upgraded oxygen therapy, improvement of nursing level, and ward rounds of superior physicians for changes of conditions would be combined to the composite endpoint in percentage (%). The upgraded oxygen therapy was defined as upgrading of ge neral high-volume oxygen intake from oxygen intake, ventilator using from high-volume oxygen intake or transference to intensive care unit from ventilator using.</description>
