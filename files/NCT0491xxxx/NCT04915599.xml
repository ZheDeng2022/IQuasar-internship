  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the use of the Cooral ® standardized CyT device to achieve a&#xD;
      constant and reproducible cooling of the oral mucosa to prevent OM in patients undergoing RT&#xD;
      in the head and neck region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe oral mucositis (SOM) is a major side-effect during (chemo)-radiation of malignancies&#xD;
      of the head and neck. There is no standard management of SOM. Previous studies have shown an&#xD;
      effect of cryotherapy (CyT) on the incidence and duration of SOM in chemotherapy patients.&#xD;
      Especially in palliative cases it is necessary to keep treatment related morbidities low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the difficulties and possible side effects of ice chips (IC), a closed system, such as&#xD;
      an intra oral mouth cooling device (MCD) might help to fully unfold the efficacy of CyT in&#xD;
      the prevention of radiation therapy (RT)-induced oral mucositis (OM), without putting the&#xD;
      patient at risk for infections.The Cooral ® system, provided by a Swedish medical technology&#xD;
      company free of charge, is composed of two parts: 1) the Cooral ® system itself, which is a&#xD;
      portable thermostat allowing to adjust temperatures , ranging between 6 and 22°C. 2) the&#xD;
      mouthpiece composed of flexible plastic material (polyolefin polymer compound based on&#xD;
      ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) that is connected via two flexible plastic hoses to the&#xD;
      Mouth Cooling Device (MCD). The water cooled inside the thermostat then circulates through&#xD;
      the mouthpiece, allowing the mucosa to be cooled continuously and keep the desired&#xD;
      temperature for any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to investigate the use of the Cooral ® standardized CyT device to achieve a&#xD;
      constant and reproducible cooling of the oral mucosa to prevent OM in patients undergoing RT&#xD;
      in the head and neck region.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Feasability Questionnaire (regarding Patient reported tolerance of cryotherapy with Cooral ®). On this questionnaire provided to the patients at each session, they are asked to enter the break intervals and to choose a reason for the interruption from a list or to enter another reason in a provided text field. On the form there are additional question regarding the comfort of handling and wearing the device on a four scale questionnaire (the lower the score, the better the comfort of handling and wearing the device).</description>

    <description>Patients are assigned to using the Cooral® MCD after radiotherapy for 60 min. along with general oral care (GOC). The MCD will be placed into the subjects' mouth and remain intraorally for 60 minutes. After each fraction, i.e. session of RT, the subjects insert the MCD inside their mouth and can start the Cooral ® thermostat system themselves when they feel comfortable. The stopwatch will be started by the patient as soon as thermostat is running. The patient is asked to write down the starting and the stopping time of the 60-minute procedure. Thereafter the subject will receive a questionnaire to record the tolerance for the device. Patients will be also informed about standard of care (SOC) that should be regularly performed.</description>
