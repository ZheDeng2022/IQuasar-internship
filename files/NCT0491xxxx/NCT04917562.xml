      The aim of this study is to evaluate the anatomical and refractive parameters following a&#xD;
      single-step transepithelial photo-refractive keratectomy (T-PRK) without the addition of&#xD;
      mitomycin-C for the treatment of high myopia of 6 diopters or more.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective study, 69 high myopic eyes of 6 diopters or more were treated in 38&#xD;
      patients by Trans-PRK with the SCHWIND Amaris 500E® excimer laser platform without the use of&#xD;
      mitomycin-C. Several outcomes are measured in treated patients, such as postoperative&#xD;
      uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and predictability of the procedure, as well as corneal haze measurement. The patients&#xD;
      are followed-up for 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>The safety of the procedure was defined as the proportion of eyes that lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity compared to the best preoperative corrected visual acuity.&#xD;
The safety index was defined as the ratio between the best corrected visual acuity 3 months postoperatively and the best corrected visual acuity preoperatively. An 80% threshold was chosen to consider the procedure safe.</description>
