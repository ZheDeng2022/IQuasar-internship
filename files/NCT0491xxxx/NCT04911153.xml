  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease and diabetes are leading causes of death and disability in the US, especially&#xD;
      among Veterans. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling condition that also&#xD;
      affects many Veterans. New research suggests that PTSD further increases the risk of&#xD;
      developing heart disease and diabetes. What causes this increased risk is unknown. However,&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD are often less physically active and make more unhealthy dietary&#xD;
      choices than individuals without PTSD. Maintaining a physically active lifestyle, staying&#xD;
      physically fit, and eating a healthy diet may be important for reducing the PTSD related risk&#xD;
      for heart disease, diabetes and disability. The proposed research seeks to assess how&#xD;
      important these lifestyle factors are for reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes and&#xD;
      disability in Veterans with and without PTSD. A better understanding of these lifestyle&#xD;
      factors and cardiometabolic health in Veterans will help to clarify how lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions can best be applied to the prevention and treatment of long-term disability in&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine physical activity participation as a mechanism linking PTSD to&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans. This study will longitudinally&#xD;
      assess associations between PTSD diagnosis, physical activity, cardiometabolic health, and&#xD;
      functioning over time in 250 TRACTS participants. H1-1: Total self-report physical activity&#xD;
      will mediate the effects of PTSD on cardiometabolic health and functioning over time, such&#xD;
      that lower physical activity will increase the detrimental effect of PTSD on cardiometabolic&#xD;
      health and functioning. H1-2: physical activity intensity will moderate the effect physical&#xD;
      activity has on cardiometabolic health and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine diet quality as a mechanism linking PTSD to cardiometabolic health and&#xD;
      functioning in post-9/11 Veterans. This study will longitudinally assess associations between&#xD;
      PTSD diagnosis, diet quality, cardiometabolic health, and functioning over time in 200 TRACTS&#xD;
      participants. H2: Self-report dietary intake will mediate the effects of PTSD on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health and functioning over time, such that a poor diet will increase the&#xD;
      detrimental effect of PTSD on cardiometabolic health and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental Aim: To validate the use of a self-report clinical measure of physical activity&#xD;
      against objective measure obtained via accelerometry. Objective measurement of physical&#xD;
      activity is not often accessible or feasible for VA providers (e.g., time constraints). It is&#xD;
      essential that quick self-report physical activity measures accurately reflect the physical&#xD;
      activity of Veterans. This study will compare data from a self-report clinical physical&#xD;
      activity measure to objectively measured physical activity/sedentary time (i.e.,&#xD;
      accelerometry), cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic health, functioning, and PTSD&#xD;
      symptom severity in 100 post-9/11 Veterans. H1A-1: Self-report and objective measurement of&#xD;
      physical activity will be significantly correlated. H1A-2: Both self-report and objectively&#xD;
      measured physical activity/sedentary time will be associated with cardiorespiratory fitness,&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health, functioning, and PTSD symptom severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease) is a leading cause&#xD;
      of disability and mortality in the United States, and especially so among Veterans.&#xD;
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a salient health concern for many Veterans and their&#xD;
      families - is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and premature mortality.&#xD;
      The precise mechanisms of this relationship are not fully understood. However, recent&#xD;
      research suggests that a diagnosis of PTSD increases the risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia&#xD;
      and obesity, all of which are known predictors of cardiometabolic disease. A better&#xD;
      understanding of what modifiable factors (e.g., lifestyle) influence the link between PTSD&#xD;
      and cardiometabolic health and functioning will aid in the development of novel&#xD;
      rehabilitative nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise) for cardiometabolic disease&#xD;
      and disability in Veterans with PTSD. Physical activity and diet are promising examples of&#xD;
      modifiable lifestyle factors. For instance, regular physical activity and a healthy diet&#xD;
      strongly reduce the risk for cardiometabolic disease through numerous pathways, such as&#xD;
      reductions in blood pressure, blood lipids, adiposity, and by promoting blood glucose&#xD;
      control. Simply put, 80% of all new cases of type 2 diabetes are attributed to physical&#xD;
      inactivity and poor diet. Low cardiorespiratory fitness is also a critical factor in the risk&#xD;
      for disability and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Despite the clear value and&#xD;
      potential impact, there is little research examining relationships between physical activity&#xD;
      and diet, cardiometabolic health, and functioning in Veterans with PTSD. This is a critical&#xD;
      research gap. Physical inactivity and poor diet increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease&#xD;
      and PTSD likely compounds this risk. Veterans with PTSD often lead sedentary lives and make&#xD;
      unhealthy dietary choices placing them in a perfect storm for developing cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disease and related disability. The purpose of this project is to examine the influence of&#xD;
      several modifiable yet understudied lifestyle factors (i.e., physical activity and diet&#xD;
      quality) on indicators of cardiometabolic health, and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans. The&#xD;
      aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will examine physical activity participation as a potential mechanism linking PTSD to&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans from the TRACTS longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort study. This study uses self-report physical activity data that is part of the standard&#xD;
      TRACTS assessment battery (see below for details). Measurement of self-report physical&#xD;
      activity was added to the TRACTS assessments in October of 2018. At this time, physical&#xD;
      activity data has been collected from a total of 55 participants at their first Follow-up.&#xD;
      Based on past recruitment and current retention rates, there will be about 250 cases with&#xD;
      complete physical activity data by the end of the third year of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 examines diet quality as a potential mechanism linking PTSD to cardiometabolic health&#xD;
      and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans from that TRACTS longitudinal cohort study. Similar to&#xD;
      Aim 1, data that is being collected by TRACTS to accomplish this aim. A self-administered&#xD;
      web-based 24-hour dietary recall will be used to capture dietary intake and assess diet&#xD;
      quality (see below for details). There will be approximately 200 cases with complete dietary&#xD;
      intake data by the end of year 4 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental Aim, consecutively enrolled TRACTS participants will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in this pilot study separately from their standard TRACTS visits. This pilot study will&#xD;
      consist of two onsite visits at VABHS, approximately 1-2 weeks apart. In Visit 1,&#xD;
      participants will complete a physical activity questionnaire, several mental and physical&#xD;
      health assessments, and receive training on how to properly wear an accelerometer.&#xD;
      Participants will then be instructed to wear an accelerometer for at least 7 days before&#xD;
      returning to VABHS for Visit 2, approximately 9-14 days later. In Visit 2, participants will&#xD;
      return the accelerometers, complete a physical activity questionnaire, and a&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness test. The goal is to recruit at least 25 participants a year for&#xD;
      this study and aim to obtain 100 participants with complete data by the end of year 4 of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2 Data Analytic Plan. This aims will use regression-based methods for mediation&#xD;
      analysis to explore whether physical activity and/or diet quality mediates the relationship&#xD;
      between PTSD and cardiometabolic health and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans. Given the&#xD;
      modest sample size, the investigators will use bootstrapped standard errors to reduce&#xD;
      potential bias. The investigators will conduct these analyses using the SAS statistical&#xD;
      platform. Importantly, the procedures for conducting the proposed analyses using SAS has been&#xD;
      previously established. Below, the investigators propose a hypothesized model to test (i.e.,&#xD;
      physical activity/diet quality as a mediator). However, there are many plausible alternative&#xD;
      models (e.g., physical activity/diet quality as a moderator), as well as numerous potential&#xD;
      confounders (e.g., age, gender, past or current mental illness, combat exposure, and TBI&#xD;
      history). As such, in addition to this proposed model the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      potential alternative models in exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure (E). PTSD diagnosis at Baseline as a categorical exposure variable (Time 1). PTSD&#xD;
      diagnostic status will be operationalized as the three previously defined categories (i.e.,&#xD;
      PTSD, Subthreshold PTSD, or No PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediator (M). Aim 1: Total self-report physical activity expressed in MET-min/week will be&#xD;
      modeled as a continuous mediator. Subsequent analyses will be conducted to explore total&#xD;
      weekly sedentary time (i.e., seated or laying down), and the type (e.g., exercise or&#xD;
      occupational) or intensity (i.e., light, moderate and vigorous) of physical activity as&#xD;
      potential mediators. Physical activity is retrospectively assessed at the first Follow-up to&#xD;
      represent physical activity patterns between Baseline and first Follow-up (Time 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Overall diet quality will be modeled as a continuous mediator using the HEI-2015&#xD;
      calculated from the ASA24. Dietary intake over the past year is retrospectively assessed at&#xD;
      first Follow-up, representing dietary patterns between Baseline and first Follow-up (Time 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome (O). Cardiometabolic health and functioning will be examined as outcome variables in&#xD;
      separate analyses. The data collected at the first Follow-up of these variables will be&#xD;
      operationalized as current cardiometabolic health and functioning (Time 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiometabolic health: As described above, TRACTS measures multiple indices of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health. In the primary analysis, the investigators will model a diagnosis of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (yes/no) as the outcome. Additionally, the investigators will model&#xD;
      individual risk factors (e.g., waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose, and blood&#xD;
      pressure) as outcome variables in exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functioning: The WHODAS2 total score will be modeled as an outcome variable for total&#xD;
      functioning and disability (i.e., the combination physical, social and emotional&#xD;
      functioning). Similar to the cardiometabolic health analyses, the investigators will explore&#xD;
      potential alternative models focusing on the individual domains of functioning as measured by&#xD;
      the WHODAS2 (i.e., cognition, physical mobility, self-care, social, domestic/occupational,&#xD;
      and participation in society).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model Assumptions and Confounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting the mediation analyses, the investigators will carry out several&#xD;
      preliminary analyses to identify confounders to be controlled for in the primary analyses.&#xD;
      This step is critical and will ensure the model assumptions are satisfied. The model&#xD;
      assumptions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control for exposure-outcome confounding. Control for mediator-outcome confounding. Control&#xD;
      for exposure-mediator confounding. No mediator-outcome confounder that is affected by the&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure-mediator Interaction. As part of my evaluation of alternative models, the&#xD;
      investigators will also explore the potential for exposure-mediator interaction (i.e.,&#xD;
      moderation). While interaction between PTSD symptoms and physical activity is not explicitly&#xD;
      one of my hypotheses, it is plausible. Allowing for exposure-mediator interaction in the&#xD;
      mediation model is currently recommended, as ignoring the potential for interaction can lead&#xD;
      to a biased model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity Analyses. With any study the potential for unmeasured confounding (i.e.,&#xD;
      confounders not measured by the present study) is present regardless of how carefully the&#xD;
      study is planned. Sensitivity analyses attempt to account for the bias of unmeasured&#xD;
      mediator-outcome confounding by quantifying the amount of confounding needed to invalidate&#xD;
      the results. As such, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses to determine to&#xD;
      what extent the findings are biased by unmeasured confounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental Aim Data analytic plan. Hypothesis 1A-1: The investigators will examine&#xD;
      agreement between the accelerometry data, the EVS questionnaire for total weekly physical&#xD;
      activity, using the Bland-Altman method. Specifically, the investigators will plot the limits&#xD;
      of agreement based the mean difference between objective and self-report physical activity,&#xD;
      using a 95% confidence interval. The investigators will also code dichotomous variables&#xD;
      representing the recommended dose of total weekly physical activity (i.e., &lt;150 minutes, and&#xD;
      150 minutes of physical activity). These dichotomous variables will then be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of the EVS for identifying if the recommended dose of weekly&#xD;
      physical activity is met. The investigators will use the accelerometry data as the criterion&#xD;
      in this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1A-2: The investigators will conduct a series of cross-sectional exploratory&#xD;
      multiple linear regression models to assess whether physical activity (i.e., frequency,&#xD;
      intensity, duration, and total amount) and sedentary time are significantly associated with&#xD;
      handgrip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic health, functioning, and PTSD&#xD;
      symptom severity in post-9/11 Veterans with PTSD. Prior to the primary analyses, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the data with Pearson correlations for continuous measures and&#xD;
      point-biserial correlations for dichotomous measures, to look for potential confounders.&#xD;
      Following these preliminary analyses, the dependent variables (handgrip strength,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic health, functioning, and PTSD symptom severity)&#xD;
      will be regressed on physical activity while controlling for any previously identified&#xD;
      confounder. The initial threshold for significance will be set at p&lt;.05. However, I intend to&#xD;
      conduct multiple univariate comparisons, and will correct the p-values using a false&#xD;
      discovery rate method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables. PTSD symptom severity: PCL total score. Handgrip strength: pounds of&#xD;
      force as measure by a handgrip dynamometer. Cardiorespiratory fitness: VO2peak and VT&#xD;
      measured during the cardiorespiratory exercise test will serve as the primary measures of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiometabolic health: Body mass index, abdominal obesity, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      assessed as measures of cardiometabolic health in this pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functioning: The WHODAS2 total score will represent total functioning and disability (i.e.,&#xD;
      the combination physical, social and emotional functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variable. Total weekly physical activity and sedentary time: Accelerometry data&#xD;
      (physical activity and sedentary time) and EVS will each be explored in separate regression&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
