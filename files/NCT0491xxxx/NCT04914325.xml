      Research question For patients in a need for anterior crown, does the use of Milled BioHPP&#xD;
      PEEK copings veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin offer better patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      marginal adaptation and biocompatibility when compared Milled BioHPP PEEK copings veneered&#xD;
      with manual layering? Statement of the problem PEEK exhibits a unique modulus of elasticity&#xD;
      close to human bone/dentine so it acts as a shock absorber with stress reducing effect.&#xD;
      Moreover from a biologic point of view, PEEK is highly compatible with surrounding tissues&#xD;
      and it has very promising surface properties . The use of peek in anterior area is limited&#xD;
      due to its opaque nature and grayish color, this drawback has been overcome by the use of&#xD;
      composite layering material . PEEK restorations can be veneered with manual or CAD/CAM&#xD;
      techniques. Information is lacking regarding the influence of the veneering technique on the&#xD;
      patient satisfaction , precision of fit and biocompatibility of these restorations which will&#xD;
      in turn influence their performance in patient's satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale To achieve high esthetics when using PEEK it must be veneered by esthetic material&#xD;
      3 . It is available to be used manually or to be milled by CAD/CAM. The manual veneering of&#xD;
      the PEEK coping with composite might affect the marginal integrity and the surrounding&#xD;
      gingival tissues leading to decrease in the patient satisfaction, while the CAD/CAM veneering&#xD;
      technique is proposed to have better patient satisfaction , marginal adaptation and an&#xD;
      excellent biocompatible effect on the surrounding tissue. The importance of this trial lies&#xD;
      in providing an alternative solution to the manual veneering technique, which will, in-turn,&#xD;
      provide better restoration longevity results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the patient satisfaction ,marginal adaptation and&#xD;
      biocompatibility of milled BioHPP PEEK copings veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin and&#xD;
      compare them to milled BioHPP PEEK copings veneered with manual layering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the patient satisfaction, marginal adaptation and biocompatibility&#xD;
      between milled BioHPP PEEK copings veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin and milled BioHPP&#xD;
      PEEK copings veneered with manual layering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: - The Primary outcome: : patient satisfaction of the two groups will be&#xD;
      assessed by rating score 0 unaccepted , 1 good , 2 excellent - Secondary outcome: Marginal&#xD;
      adaptation of the two groups will be assessed using the modified Ryge criteria. - Tertiary&#xD;
      outcome: Biocompatibility (Bleeding). Signs of inflammation and bleeding of the two groups&#xD;
      will be recorded after clinical examination and probing using periodontal probe Trial design:&#xD;
      - Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;

      Intervention: Examination and diagnosis: - Selection and examination of the patients&#xD;
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Diagnosis of the patients' chief complaint and&#xD;
      teeth that will be involved in this study will be done then performing proper scaling and&#xD;
      polishing procedure, Primary impression will be taken to produce study cast. The patients&#xD;
      will be asked to maintain good oral hygiene measures by using tooth brush twice daily. -&#xD;
      Taking a pre-operative professional photo, Tooth preparation procedure: Recording the sulcus&#xD;
      depth and gingival condition prior to preparation, Conservative tooth preparation will be&#xD;
      prepared after local anesthesia has been given as required., Full coverage preparation will&#xD;
      be carried out , After tooth preparation, adequate 2ry Impression using non aqueous&#xD;
      elastomeric impression materials and bite registration will be taken., Fabrication of the&#xD;
      temporary restoration using composite resin temporary material and cemented using non Eugenol&#xD;
      Zinc Oxide temporary cement, Fabrication and cementation of restoration: Bio-HPP will be&#xD;
      supplied in the form of discs to fabricate crown core by CAD/CAM technology then veneered&#xD;
      with two veneering techniques; the CAD/ CAM and the manual technique using the visio.lign&#xD;
      system of appropriate shade. The finished Bio HPP crown will be cemented by adhesive resin&#xD;
      cement according to manufacturer instruction, Criteria for discontinuing: Restoration will be&#xD;
      removed when there are any signs of leakage, fracture or severe post-operative pain due to&#xD;
      pulpal response and replaced by a temporary restoration cemented with Ca (OH) cement in order&#xD;
      to alleviate pain, Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol: - ''In the first&#xD;
      visit, a Face to Face adherence session will be held in which the patient should be informed&#xD;
      about the study steps and how to maintain oral hygiene measures. Further sessions will occur&#xD;
      at the follow-up visits.8 Participant patients will be asked about any problems they are&#xD;
      having. Patients will be recalled every three months for one year for follow up visits.&#xD;
      Permitted or prohibited interventions: Oral hygiene measures are permitted for enhanced&#xD;
      results while using hard tooth brushes or abrasive containing tooth paste after intervention&#xD;
      are prohibited.&#xD;
