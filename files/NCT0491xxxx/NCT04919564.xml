  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease associated&#xD;
      with increased mortality rate during cardiac surgery in proportion to the kidney function.&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease is defined by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as classified&#xD;
      by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO). Deterioration of kidney function has a&#xD;
      complex and multifactorial pathophysiologic derangement. In order to counter kidney injury&#xD;
      associated with cardiac surgery, several pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions&#xD;
      have been studied to prevent perioperative deterioration of kidney function. Diuretics as&#xD;
      pharmacologic measure are often used post-cardiac surgery to treat fluid overload and&#xD;
      managing patient with acute kidney injury by preventing anuria. Loop diuretics (furosemide)&#xD;
      may improve renal blood flow, decrease reabsorption in renal tubules, decrease oxygen demand&#xD;
      and energy consumption (blocking potassium/sodium/2cloride co-transport in loop of Henle),&#xD;
      and prevent hypoxic injury of renal medulla. Low dose continuous furosemide hypothetically&#xD;
      has a protective effect on cardiac surgery patients with kidney dysfunction, measured&#xD;
      improved glomerular filtration rate, decreased indication for therapeutic furosemide&#xD;
      infusion, and decreased need of renal replacement therapy. On the other hand, administration&#xD;
      of furosemide is rather harmful in severe kidney dysfunction. Therefore, the objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the protective effect of low-dose continuous furosemide&#xD;
      perioperative in cardiac surgery patients with mild to moderate kidney dysfunction.&#xD;

      The study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine the protective effect&#xD;
      of low-dose continuous furosemide perioperative in cardiac surgery patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate kidney dysfunction. Ethical clearance for the study was approved by Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita. Patients eligible for the study&#xD;
      was recruited and written informed consent was obtained after clear explanation of the study.&#xD;
      Allocation of furosemide and control group was done using simple computer randomization by&#xD;
      staff who was not involved in the study. Furosemide infusion and normal saline was prepared&#xD;
      by independent pharmacist blinded to the study. Furosemide solution was prepared to contain&#xD;
      40 mg of furosemide diluted with normal saline to a total volume of 40 cc (1 mg / 1 cc) and&#xD;
      control solution was prepared to contain only 40 cc of normal saline. Both solution was&#xD;
      packaged in 50-cc syringe and prepared in similar fashion. The solution was administered&#xD;
      after induction of anesthesia with rate of 2 cc per hour for 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline participant were collected before surgery. All cardiac surgery procedure was done in&#xD;
      concordance to hospital standard operating procedure. The primary outcomes of the study were&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate, need of diuretic infusion dose after intervention, need of renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy and the secondary outcomes were ICU length of stay and in hospital&#xD;
      mortality. The calculated sample size estimated was 41 participants per group, accounting for&#xD;
      drop-out rate, expected sample size was 45 participants per group (90 participants in total).&#xD;
