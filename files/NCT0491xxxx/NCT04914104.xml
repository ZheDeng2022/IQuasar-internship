  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the surgical trainee experience by&#xD;
      exacerbating the difficulty of this notoriously stressful training, while limiting access to&#xD;
      traditional avenues of mental health support. The investigators propose the application of a&#xD;
      mobile app-based mindfulness program to address stress and burnout in the surgical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective randomized, observer-blinded study including surgical&#xD;
      trainees at the University of Ottawa in their first and second years of training. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive free access to the mobile app Headspace and will be&#xD;
      encouraged to access the app three times a week for 15 minutes.&#xD;

      The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the surgical trainee experience. The personal&#xD;
      risks and uncertainties of this environment have compounded the difficulty of this&#xD;
      notoriously stressful training. Burnout in the medical profession is prolific, and health&#xD;
      care workers are not immune to the adverse mental health effects of the pandemic. Of all&#xD;
      health professionals, surgical trainees frequently report the highest rates of burnout and&#xD;
      severe stress. In particular, high burnout is associated with profoundly increased rates of&#xD;
      depression and suicidal ideation in these trainees. In addition to the adverse effects of&#xD;
      burnout and stress on the mental health wellbeing of trainees, excessive stress in the&#xD;
      operating room can threaten patient safety and slow motor skill acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, many organizations have sought out methods to mitigate the negative mental&#xD;
      health effects of surgical training. One promising intervention is mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction. The perception of stress in surgical trainees is mediated by both cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioural factors, which demonstrates an opportunity for mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      (MBSR) interventions to modulate the perceived stress. In-person MBSR has been investigated&#xD;
      in previous randomized trials of first year surgical residents. These pilot reports describe&#xD;
      promising feasibility and adherence to mindfulness practice, with improved stress and&#xD;
      cognitive control in the interventional arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness techniques lend themselves to self-guided instruction provided by mobile apps and&#xD;
      are a widely available resource. Mobile app-based mindfulness practice demonstrates&#xD;
      comparable improvements in self-reported well-being when compared with in-person mindfulness&#xD;
      sessions. When time is a scarce commodity, participant adherence is crucial to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of any intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions have typically boasted&#xD;
      strong adherence exceeding an average of 16 minutes per day after 3 months, particularly when&#xD;
      self-directed. Specifically, adherence to optional online mindfulness-based practice is&#xD;
      promising in medical trainees, with over half of trainees voluntarily adhering to regularly&#xD;
      scheduled online mindfulness meditation after 8 weeks. In Canadian medical students, a pilot&#xD;
      study demonstrated improved self-compassion from mindfulness-based interventions with an&#xD;
      average adherence of only 20 minutes per week. When compared with a traditional weekly&#xD;
      8-session intensive mindfulness program, an abbreviated 4-session program demonstrated&#xD;
      comparable improvements in perceived stress and empathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ironically during a pandemic when stress levels at their highest, traditional wellness&#xD;
      programs such as in-person counselling are not available due to the social distancing&#xD;
      protocols. The investigators propose mindfulness-based therapy in the form of a mobile app to&#xD;
      fill this void in high risk health professionals. This study investigates the effectiveness&#xD;
      of mindfulness therapy delivered by a mobile app in surgical residents to reduce burnout and&#xD;
      associated repercussions during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this investigation is to determine if access to mindfulness therapy&#xD;
      delivered by a mobile app is effective in improving the mental well-being in surgical&#xD;
      trainees, when compared with the current standard of care. Mental well-being encompasses a&#xD;
      variety of factors including stress, burnout, depression and anxiety. Additional secondary&#xD;
      objectives include adherence to mindfulness therapy and subject satisfaction.&#xD;
