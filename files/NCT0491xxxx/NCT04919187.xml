  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness, loss of balance, and unsteadiness of gait are common symptoms reported by&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) patients. The incidence of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is&#xD;
      increasing and reaches 2-4% of ED visits. In the ED of the Paris Saint Joseph Hospital Group,&#xD;
      its incidence was 5% during the year 2019 and 2% during the year 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency medicine is based on a dichotomous principle for any acute pathology in the initial&#xD;
      phase. For AVS, the diagnostic dilemma for emergency physicians is usually to differentiate a&#xD;
      benign vestibular cause from a potentially serious cerebral cause such as ischemic stroke of&#xD;
      the vertebro-basilar territory. The majority of AVS are related to acute vestibulopathies,&#xD;
      yet it is necessary to recognize and distinguish a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo&#xD;
      (BPPV) from a vestibular neuritis, a vestibular migraine, or a labyrinthine hydrops, to&#xD;
      exclude with certainty a cerebral involvement. However, posterior fossa strokes mimic 5% of&#xD;
      BPPV and 25% of vestibular neuritis. Among these strokes, about 20% are therefore revealed by&#xD;
      a VAS without associated localizing neurological sign. In the absence of a clear neurological&#xD;
      sign, the emergency physician must therefore decide whether to treat the patient as an&#xD;
      outpatient when he or she suspects a AVS of &quot;peripheral&quot; origin (otolaryngology), or as an&#xD;
      inpatient when he or she suspects a &quot;central&quot; origin, in particular a stroke.&#xD;

      Unfortunately, the diagnostic evaluation of an isolated AVS is often frustrating because&#xD;
      patients with vertigo tend to be uncertain and imprecise when describing their symptoms.&#xD;
      Examination of the vestibulo-ocular pathway, by assessing eye movements in different head&#xD;
      positions, is an essential step in the clinical examination to reliably and quickly predict&#xD;
      the origin of a AVS. The 3-step clinical rule &quot;HINTS&quot; (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew)&#xD;
      was developed in 2009 by &quot;neuro-ophthalmologists&quot; in the USA. It evaluates the&#xD;
      vestibulo-ocular reflex by the Head Impulse Test (pathological with the presence of ocular&#xD;
      saccades for a peripheral AVS), the characteristics of the nystagmus (multidirectional and/or&#xD;
      vertical for a central AVS), and looks for ocular misalignment (Test of Skew with cover-test,&#xD;
      pathognomonic of a central involvement). In patients at high cardiovascular risk, HINTS is&#xD;
      100% sensitive and 96% specific in predicting posterior fossa stroke within 2 minutes at the&#xD;
      bedside, compared with the Gold-Standard. The &quot;STANDING&quot; (SponTAneous, Nystagmus, Direction,&#xD;
      head Impulse test, STANDING) clinical rule is a structured bedside diagnostic algorithm in&#xD;
      four clinical steps. It is based on the evaluation of two eye movements (Head Impulse Test&#xD;
      and nystagmus), an evaluation of gait (search for ataxia) and the search for positional&#xD;
      nystagmus (Dix Hallpike test for the posterior canal and Panigni test or &quot;supine and roll&#xD;
      test&quot; for the lateral canal). In the ED, with patients at heterogeneous cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      the STANDING is more interesting than the HINTS. Indeed, it allows the detection of BPPV in&#xD;
      pauci-symptomatic patients at the time of their clinical evaluation (i.e., those without&#xD;
      spontaneous nystagmus). It had also shown excellent performance (sensitivity:95%,&#xD;
      specificity:87-96%) in diagnosing any central cause of VAS in the hands of emergency&#xD;
      physicians. However, the 2017 validation study of STANDING had an audit bias. The gold&#xD;
      standard test, brain imaging, had only been performed when deemed appropriate (ie, in 34% of&#xD;
      peripheral diagnoses, and for only 5% of these by brain MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the EYE-ECG study conducted at the GhPSJ SU from October 2019 to January 2021, the&#xD;
      invesitgators determined the diagnostic performance of these two clinical rules performed by&#xD;
      emergency physicians to 300 patients with isolated VAS, comparing it to the Gold-Standard.&#xD;
      The article resulting from this study is submitted to the journal Annals of Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine. Its originality was to evaluate the performance of the tests in the hands of&#xD;
      emergency physicians and on a population not selected for its risk of stroke. The&#xD;
      investigators showed that the HINTS and STANDING tests had excellent sensitivities (97% and&#xD;
      94% respectively) and negative predictive values (99% and 98% respectively) for predicting&#xD;
      any central cause of VAS on brain MRI. They thus allowed emergency physicians to exclude a&#xD;
      central cause in a rapid manner (on average 5Â±3 minutes) with very acceptable false-negative&#xD;
      rates (3% and 6%, respectively), and with a potential impact on the reduction of unnecessary&#xD;
      brain imaging (-33% and -32%, respectively). For predicting MRI normality, STANDING was more&#xD;
      specific than HINTS (75% vs. 67%). This is explained by the addition of a clinical item&#xD;
      dedicated to positional nystagmus in the STANDING, and by the high prevalence of BPPV among&#xD;
      VAS of ENT origin in SU patients (40%). Indeed, among the false-positives of the HINTS test&#xD;
      (erroneously predicted as a central cause for benign vestibular disease), one third of the&#xD;
      diagnoses were BPPVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major limitation of the EYE-ECG study was that it did not assess interindividual&#xD;
      variability of the HINTS and STANDING tests between different emergency physicians. The&#xD;
      STANDING validation study was the only study that assessed global and individual agreement of&#xD;
      the algorithm item scores in a binary &quot;central or peripheral&quot; mode between two senior&#xD;
      emergency physicians. The inter-observer agreement of the STANDING was good globally (K=0.83)&#xD;
      and also at each step of the algorithm (distinction between spontaneous and positional&#xD;
      nystagmus: K=0.83, interpretation of a multidirectional or vertical nystagmus: K=0.95, normal&#xD;
      Head Impulse Test: K=0.74, recognition of a walking ataxia: K=0.81)18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each semester, an average of 7 medical students in general medicine and one in emergency&#xD;
      medicine complete an internship at the GhPSJ. In routine practice, the medical students&#xD;
      interview and examine their patients alone. They document their clinical examination in the&#xD;
      patient's medical record and then present the patient's clinical record to a senior emergency&#xD;
      physician. In a second step, the patient is clinically reassessed by the senior emergency&#xD;
      physician who becomes responsible for the patient's diagnostic and therapeutic strategy. The&#xD;
      accuracy of the vestibulo-ocular examination performed by medical students has never been&#xD;
      described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that after standardized theoretical training and with&#xD;
      the clinical experience gained during their semester in the ED, medical students should be&#xD;
      able to examine and interpret the vestibulo-ocular examination of patients with isolated AVS&#xD;
      as accurately as seniors.&#xD;
