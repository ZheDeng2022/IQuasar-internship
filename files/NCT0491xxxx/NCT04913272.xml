  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney diseases are a global public health problem that affects over 200 million people&#xD;
      worldwide. It is estimated that about 30 million adults in the United States have Chronic&#xD;
      Kidney Disease (CKD) and most are undiagnosed. In addition, CKD represents the ninth leading&#xD;
      cause of death in the United States. Kidney diseases also represent great socio-economical&#xD;
      cost worldwide. In the United States, treating Medicare beneficiaries with CKD costed over&#xD;
      $79 billion, and treating people with End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) costed an additional&#xD;
      $35 billion in 2016. To date, there is no cure for CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important CKD risk factors in adults include diabetes and high blood pressure. Other&#xD;
      risk factors include heart disease, obesity, a family history of CKD, past damage to the&#xD;
      kidneys, and old age. Having CKD increases the chances of also having heart disease and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. Depending on&#xD;
      the kidney function measured with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) CKD can be classified into&#xD;
      several stages (I, II, III, IV and V). CKD Stage V, also known as End Stage Kidney Disease&#xD;
      (ESKD), is a very advanced stage of kidney disease where the kidneys have lost nearly all&#xD;
      ability to do their job effectively, and eventually dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed&#xD;
      to live. Treatment may slow the decline in kidney function and failure. However, not everyone&#xD;
      with CKD develops ESKD, and in some cases ESKD develops even with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is accompanied by altered pathogenic gut bacteria, inflammation, and accumulation of&#xD;
      uremic toxins in the blood. These blood uremic toxins can diffuse passively into the bowel.&#xD;
      Scientific research has shown that probiotic bacteria could metabolize various uremic toxins&#xD;
      such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine. In addition, by supplementing the gut microbiome&#xD;
      with probiotic bacteria, it is possible to metabolize the nitrogenous waste products and&#xD;
      other toxins which diffuse into the gut, and thus lower levels of inflammation and blood&#xD;
      uremic toxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-APR2020 is a live biotherapeutic (LBT) intended to restore the gut microbiome to improve&#xD;
      the removal of uremic toxins in the bowel in CKD patients. The aim of this Phase 2 study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the US-APR2020 in the management of patients with CKD&#xD;
      Stage IV.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of US-APR2020 in patients with CKD Stage IV.&#xD;
Following Screening and Enrollment, patients will be Randomized to either Group US-APR2020 or Placebo. In Group US-APR2020, the drug US-APR2020 will be administered orally at 2 capsules per day (one capsule in the morning and one capsule in the evening, after meals, for a total daily dose of 90 Billion CFUs) for six months. Subjects will be followed for 6 months. Patients in Placebo Group will be administered Placebo tablets in similar routine.</intervention_model_description>
