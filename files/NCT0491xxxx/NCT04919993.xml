  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test an empirically supported psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in primary brain tumor&#xD;
      patients. Researchers hope to better understand the feasibility and acceptability of this&#xD;
      intervention in neuro-oncology, as well as the preliminary potential benefits of this&#xD;
      intervention on brain tumor patients' sleep, fatigue, mood, quality of life, and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. This may lead to improvements in treating insomnia in primary brain tumor&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study design is a pilot within-subjects pre-/post-evaluation of feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia&#xD;
      (CBT-I) intervention for primary brain tumor patients. In this study, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meet with a trained interventionist six times (biweekly) for group CBT-I sessions via&#xD;
           Zoom, lasting 90 minutes each. Participants will be asked to only use first names and&#xD;
           will complete weekly sleep diaries as part of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete ~20-minute online surveys before the program, immediately after the program (6&#xD;
           weeks), and at follow-up (3 months). Questions will ask about subjective sleep, fatigue,&#xD;
           mood, and quality of life. The follow-up time point will also ask about the patient's&#xD;
           satisfaction with the CBT-I program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a brief (15 minute) cognitive evaluation before and immediately following the&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear a wrist-worn actigraphy monitor one week prior to the 6-week CBT-I intervention and&#xD;
           one week following completion of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients currently receiving regular blood draws as part of their care at Massey Cancer&#xD;
           Center will have an IL-6 added to their regular blood draw. THose who are not receiving&#xD;
           regular blood draws as part of their standard of care OR those who are not patients at&#xD;
           Massey Cancer Center will forego this part of the intervention.&#xD;
