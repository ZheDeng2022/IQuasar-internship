      ABSTRACT Background The current management on rectal cancer based on TNM staging has some&#xD;
      limitations. In early rectal cancer T stage can be not sufficient to predict the nodal status&#xD;
      and, in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy the persistence of a&#xD;
      complete response to therapy cannot be accurately predicted by the simple tumor regression&#xD;
      grade. For both cases the current guidelines recommend the complete rectal resection with a&#xD;
      total mesorectal excision. The implications for patients' quality of life are evident even in&#xD;
      case of sphincter sparing surgery. Moreover, in both cases the cancer sample available for&#xD;
      the analysis can be small or inexistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The main hypothesis underlying our research is that the aggressiveness of rectal&#xD;
      cancer is determined by the complex interactions between the malignant cells and their immune&#xD;
      microenvironment. The second hypothesis is that relevant trace of this cross talk between&#xD;
      tumor cells and immune microenvironment can be detected in the normal mucosa surrounding the&#xD;
      cancer according to the concept of field cancerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aim of this project is to analyze the healthy rectal mucosa surrounding the cancer&#xD;
      to identify traces of immunosurveillance mechanisms and of field cancerization and to use&#xD;
      them to obtain a composite prognostic test to predict nodal metastasis in early rectal cancer&#xD;
      and recurrence after complete response at neoadjuvant therapy in case of locally advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design This prognostic test will be constructed on the combinatory analysis of&#xD;
      the transcriptome, immune and epithelial cells cross-talk, immune checkpoints and miRNA&#xD;
      expression in normal rectal mucosa surrounding cancer. The aim is to predict the presence of&#xD;
      nodal metastasis in patients with early rectal cancer. In step A, we will retrospectively&#xD;
      analyze archival tissue samples in order to identify the most performing biomarkers; in step&#xD;
      B, we will validate the prognostic performance of the markers identified in phase I through a&#xD;
      prospective analysis of rectal mucosa specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results The anticipated outcome of this project is to generate one or different&#xD;
      combination of markers to optimize rectal management and to predict rectal cancer patients&#xD;
      outcome more accurately than traditional TNM staging or tumore regression grade. We expect to&#xD;
      obtain a prognostic test from normal tissue that accurately predicts rectal cancer behavior&#xD;
      even in case when the tumor samples are scarce (early rectal cancer) or absent (complete&#xD;
      response to therapy) to avoid unnecessary total rectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact On Cancer An immunoscore specific for rectal cancer may predict tumor progression and&#xD;
      clinical outcome more accurately and may contribute to better design a personalized&#xD;
      therapeutic algorithm. Moreover, nowadays patients with early rectal cancer without nodal&#xD;
      involvement and patients with potential complete response to neoadjuvant therapy still&#xD;
      undergo total rectal excision which is a risky procedure that impairs quality of life. The&#xD;
      use of this new prognostic test may make possible to adopt a minimally invasive approach or&#xD;
      even simple observation if nodal involvement or residual disease are reasonably excluded.&#xD;

      Background The introduction of new technologies for diagnosis and screening programs led to&#xD;
      an increasing rate of early detection of colorectal cancer [9]. This, combined to the&#xD;
      evolution of techniques of local excision, led to the development of new strategies to reduce&#xD;
      treatment related morbidity, especially for early rectal cancer. In fact, transanal local&#xD;
      excision has recently received attention as an alternative to radical surgery for early&#xD;
      rectal cancer [10]. Nevertheless, the definition of early rectal cancer and its staging and&#xD;
      treatment algorithm are still under debate [9]. In, fact, to minimize the recurrence rate&#xD;
      after local excision of rectal cancer, the false-negative rate of nodal staging should be&#xD;
      minimized [11]. MRI can be helpful to better identify candidates suitable for local excision&#xD;
      of early stage rectal cancer. However, strict MRI criteria for oncologic safety might result&#xD;
      in considerable false-positive cases and limit the application of local excision [11].&#xD;
      Therefore, different markers are warranted to overcome this critical point in early rectal&#xD;
      cancer management. A recent Swiss study on 126 rectal biopsies analyzed with microarray aimed&#xD;
      to investigate whether immunoprobing might help in predicting lymph node involvement in this&#xD;
      subgroup. Their results suggested that in early rectal cancers absence of CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      infiltration helps in predicting patients' nodal involvement [12]. Last but not least, a&#xD;
      recent systematic review provided data suggesting that selected patients with T1/T2N0M0&#xD;
      rectal cancer may undergo local excision without compromising the oncological outcome&#xD;
      otherwise conferred by total mesorectal excision [13]. High risk patients (i.e. those with&#xD;
      low CD8 infiltrate) might benefit of chemoradiation. In fact, while guideline-concordant&#xD;
      adoption of local excision for treatment of low-risk stage I rectal cancer is increasing, its&#xD;
      use is also increasing for higher-risk rectal cancers that do not meet guideline criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with local alone is associated with poorer long-term OS and additional studies are&#xD;
      warranted to understand risk factor of poor outcome after local excision [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The clinical question is how to predict the presence of nodal metastasis in&#xD;
      patients with early rectal cancer. These patients may potentially benefit of a minimally&#xD;
      invasive treatment, a trans anal resection, provided that the nodal status can be considered&#xD;
      negative for metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Tissue samples will be obtained from cancer tissue (if possible) and from normal&#xD;
      rectal mucosa adjacent to the cancer at surgery. The very large number of patients need to&#xD;
      answer the two questions imply a multicentric design. Complete medical record and follow-up&#xD;
      will be collected from each center. The analysis will be centralized mostly in Azienda&#xD;
      Ospedaliera di Padova. The study will be articulated in two parts each of them aiming to&#xD;
      answer to one of the above described questions. Each part of the study will be articulated in&#xD;
      a retrospective and exploratory step (A) and in a prospective validation step (B).&#xD;

        STEP A Taking into account a 15% of early rectal cancer patients with nodal metastasis and&#xD;
        a maximum of 5 prognostic factors (including markers and clinical factors) in the model, we&#xD;
        aim to enroll 334 patients in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STEP B The sample size was calculated to demonstrate a non-inferiority of AUC with respect&#xD;
        to an area of 0.80, assuming an AUC of 0.90 and a non-inferiority margin of 0.05. With a&#xD;
        type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.20, we aim to analyze 66 patients with lymph&#xD;
        node metastasis (N+) and 66 patients without lymph node metastasis (N0). Given an expected&#xD;
        proportion of 15% of N+ patients among early rectal cancer, we estimate to enroll a total&#xD;
        number of 66/0.15=440 patients with early rectal cancer. However, we will perform flow&#xD;
        cytometry, transcriptomic analysis, mRNA microarray and mutational profiling only in 132&#xD;
        patients (66 N+ and 66 N0) in order to test the non-inferiority of AUC.&#xD;
