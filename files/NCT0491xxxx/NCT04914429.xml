    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severity. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=)90 percent (%) improvement in PASI score.</description>
