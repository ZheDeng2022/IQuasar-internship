  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, observational, single-center study to determine the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      have or will develop changes in biological markers of immunity during immunotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will run for 12 months with a 6-month follow-up at the inclusion of the last&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included from the initiation of immunotherapy treatment regardless of the&#xD;
      line.The routine immunological workup will be performed before the first immunotherapy&#xD;
      infusion in order to analyze a certain number of immunological markers (autoantibodies, RF,&#xD;
      LDH, complement (C3 C4), anti-tissue antibodies, lymphocyte immunophenotyping). This&#xD;
      assessment will then be performed at progression, at the appearance of side effects requiring&#xD;
      the immunotherapy to be stopped, or at 6 months of follow-up in case of continuation of the&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the response to the treatment, the progression via&#xD;
      re-evaluation assessments performed in standard practice (every 3 to 4 courses depending on&#xD;
      the type of immunotherapy) as well as the appearance of side effects throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      will be evaluate.&#xD;
