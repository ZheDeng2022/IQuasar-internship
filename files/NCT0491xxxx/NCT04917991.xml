  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to investigate if extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or palm oil enriched&#xD;
      chocolate spread snacks consumption lead to differential insulin resistance status in young,&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Such effect includes difference in a) plasma ceramides, b) glucose&#xD;
      metabolism markers, c) lipid profile, d) inflammatory markers, e) hunger/satiety hormonal&#xD;
      markers and visual analogue scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exceeding intake of foods high in palmitic acid, abundant in Palm Oil, has been associated&#xD;
      with lipotoxicity, a condition featured by high toxic lipids in the body such as ceramides,&#xD;
      which ultimately can lead to insulin resistance and therefore to diabetes and increased&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk through the promotion of atheroma plaque formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, foods high in oleic acid, rich in extra virgin olive oil EVOO and typical&#xD;
      of the Mediterranean diet, has been related to reduced insulin resistance and inflammatory&#xD;
      state, with proved protective effects against metabolic diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this clinical trial aims to assess potential metabolic differences in relation to&#xD;
      daily consumption of EVOO-enriched chocolate spread in comparison with a Palm oil-enriched&#xD;
      chocolate spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, therefore, aimed to evaluate the impact of fourteen days consuming the two&#xD;
      different oils added to the same chocolate spread in terms of the composition of plasma&#xD;
      ceramides as the primary outcome; and as secondary outcomes, changes in glucose metabolism&#xD;
      markers (Glucose, Insulin, HOMA-IR), in LDL, total cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL levels, in&#xD;
      inflammation Markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-a) and in the appetite-regulating hormones (Leptin,&#xD;
      Adiponectin, GLP-1, Ghrelin, PYY and Oxyntomodulin) and in the visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both chocolate spreads have an identical composition with the exception of fat content (EVOO&#xD;
      vs. Palm Oil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility will be assessed through screening and medical anamnesis, twenty healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized based on a double-blind, controlled, crossover&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will undergo a 1-week &quot;run-in diet&quot; phase before the randomization (V1) and the&#xD;
      inception of a 14-day interventional diet phase 1. A compliance visit (V2) will be performed&#xD;
      on day-7 to ensure that daily compliance is available from each participant (i.e., that the&#xD;
      chocolate spread provided is eaten daily). On day 14, the participants will undergo a meal&#xD;
      Challenge (V3), consuming the chocolate spread jar (challenge meal) and, serial blood&#xD;
      withdrawals will be performed at times 0 ', 30', 60 ', 90', 120 'and 180 ' and, at the same&#xD;
      time points, subjects will be required to complete a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for&#xD;
      monitoring hunger and satiety. Subsequently, the subjects will undergo another week of run-in&#xD;
      diet, identical to the previous run-in diet, to be then allocated to another fourteen days of&#xD;
      the opposite treatment to the previous one, with the same described methods. Also, in all the&#xD;
      visits physical examination with the collection of anthropometric data and body composition&#xD;
      analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be provided structured meals, according to isocaloric diets designed by&#xD;
      nutritionists based on subjects' energy requirements. Meals will be prepared by specific&#xD;
      canteens and consumed on-site or collected daily in individual meal boxes. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill daily food diaries, in order to ensure all of the daily food is ingested&#xD;
      (including the chocolate spread), as well as to assess any leftovers.&#xD;
