    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled clinical study. After the Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture repaired , patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, and the rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol was traditional rehabilitation protocol and accelerated rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
      under ultrasonic monitoring , respectively, to study the difference in efficacy between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled clinical study is designed to compare the treatment&#xD;
      outcomes of different rehabilitation protocols by dividing the patients into two groups-based&#xD;
      on the traditional rehabilitation protocol and accelerated rehabilitation protocol under&#xD;
      ultrasonic monitoring after a similar suture technique. The inclusion criteria are patients&#xD;
      with an acute closed single-legged complete Achilles tendon rupture, and an age of 18 to 60&#xD;
      years. The exclusion criteria are patients with prior Achilles tendon rupture or other&#xD;
      situations that affect their lower limb functions or tendon healing (e.g., autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, diabetes mellitus, systemic corticosteroid treatment). Other exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      an inability to complete our suture technique (e.g., the distance from the rupture site to&#xD;
      the Achilles tendon insertion is less than 3.5 cm), or those without rehabilitation or&#xD;
      follow-up outcomes. All patients will be treated surgically with the same suture technique.&#xD;
