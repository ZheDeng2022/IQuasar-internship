  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a clinical telehealth intervention and test the&#xD;
      feasibility of integrating telehealth within a police opioid county diversion program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in a police opioid diversion program will receive information about the research&#xD;
      opportunity; those interested will be administered informed consent and randomized to either&#xD;
      the (1) diversion program treatment as usual condition or (2) the enhanced condition,&#xD;
      receiving the telehealth video call intervention with motivational interviewing and substance&#xD;
      use treatment appointment reminders during the 12-week intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assertive Referrals Data</measure>
    <time_frame>during the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Assertive referrals data will provide evidence supporting participant utilization of the app and the coaching support model. Coach will report service type and provider name via on-line survey for every scheduled and unscheduled telehealth video session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Initiation Data</measure>
    <time_frame>These data will be collected for analysis at the end of the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers will obtain scheduled treatment dates and treatment initiation dates for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment to create a dichotomized (yes/no) treatment initiation from agency records to evaluate the differences between study arms on the proportions of missed initial appointments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Use Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>TCUDS 5 data are collected for analysis at the end of the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Texas Christian University Drug Screen 5 (TCUDS 5) is a 19-question survey that gauges substance use during the past 12 months. Interpretation of the TCU Drug Screen 5 score corresponds with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, and is based on a single disorder measured on the following continuum from mild to severe: mild disorder (presence of 2-3 symptoms); moderate disorder (presence of 4-5 symptoms); and severe disorder: (presence of 6 or more symptoms).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinalysis Test Data</measure>
    <time_frame>These data will be collected for analysis at the end of the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers will obtain urinalysis results from treatment providers agency records to compare the proportion of positive drug test results for opioid use between the two groups. The results will be dichotomized into yes for a positive test and no for a negative test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Retention Data</measure>
    <time_frame>These data will be collected for analysis at the end of the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers will obtain agency records of appointment attendance dates during the 3-month post enrollment period and combining attendance frequency into a single 3-month measure of retention, with the dichotomized variable defined yes as having attended at least 2 scheduled appointments subsequent to the initial appointment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Texas Christian University (TCU) Client Evaluation of Self and Treatment (CEST) Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>CEST data is collected for analysis at the end of 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant responses on the TCU Client Evaluation of Self and Treatment (CEST) forms provide measures of motivation for treatment and psychosocial functioning to examine differences between study arms. CEST Scales are based on a 5-point Likert response set with higher scores reflecting a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Opioid Overdose</measure>
    <time_frame>TCU Opioid Supplement data are collected for analysis at the end of the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Texas Christian University (TCU) Opioid Supplement is a 17 question survey that measures multiple types of opioids and self-reported use during the past 30 days and in the past 12 months. Self-reported frequency of overdose history in the past 12 months will evaluate the differences in the proportion of overdoses between study arms.</description>
