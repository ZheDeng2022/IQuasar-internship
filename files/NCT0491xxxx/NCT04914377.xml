  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to assess safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Total TQ Formula (3 g daily dose of Nigella Sativa Oil) capsules versus&#xD;
      placebo in treating patients who have tested positive for novel Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19)&#xD;
      in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated at a dose of 500 mg, 3 capsules, two times a day for 14 days from&#xD;
      date of randomization. Quantitative viral load as measured by RT-PCR will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and on days 7 and 14. Covid-19 symptoms will be measured throughout the study using&#xD;
      Modified FLU-PRO Plus.&#xD;
