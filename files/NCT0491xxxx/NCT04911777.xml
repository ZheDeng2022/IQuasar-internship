  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, PK, viral shedding and efficacy of&#xD;
      PentarlandirTM UPPTA as a treatment for patients with early COVID-19. Approximately 90&#xD;
      ambulatory subjects with mildly symptomatic early COVID-19, who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19 within the prior 48 hours, will be enrolled in the proof of principle study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon signing informed consent and evaluating medical history, concomitant medications, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SaO2) at room air and vital signs, a focused physical examination of the heart&#xD;
      and lungs will be performed. Subjects will be randomized into High-Dose, Low-Dose, and&#xD;
      Placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio at the final sample, but the enrollment will be staggered. In&#xD;
      the first phase, 45 study subjects will be randomized at 2:1 ratio to Pentarlandir™ UPPTA low&#xD;
      dose or placebo. After all the forty-five (45) subjects have completed the Day 21 assessment&#xD;
      or early terminated (14-day dosing and 7 days of followed-up), DSMB will review the safety&#xD;
      from the cohort and provide concurrence with proceeding with the higher dose cohort. If DSMB&#xD;
      deems that the study is safe to proceed, another 45 subjects will be randomized at 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      to Pentarlandir™ UPPTA high dose or placebo in the second phase. Both staggered cohorts will&#xD;
      have the same stopping rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both phases of study, specimens for quantification of the viral genome, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and safety laboratory tests will be collected. The IP will be dispensed to the study&#xD;
      subjects and the subject will take the first dose of the study treatment at the clinic. Study&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed (and provided) to use a device for ePRO for how to complete the&#xD;
      patient-reported diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will take the IP orally. Subjects in the low-dose group will take from each&#xD;
      bottle of the active drug and placebo every 8 hours (q8h); for the high-dose group, from each&#xD;
      of the two bottles of active drug; and for the placebo group, from each of the two bottles of&#xD;
      placebo for 14 days. The first treatment dose should be taken within 4 days of COVID-19&#xD;
      diagnosis. Physical examination, specimen collection, laboratory evaluations and urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test, vital signs, pulse oxygen saturation and clinical symptom and status&#xD;
      determination will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized. All subjects who fail to meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are considered screen failures and are exited from the study without&#xD;
      further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Randomization (V1, Day 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the eligibility, the study subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Pentarlandir™&#xD;
      UPPTA (either low or high dose) or placebo. The IP for treatment period will be dispensed to&#xD;
      the study subjects and the subject will take the first dose of the study treatment at the&#xD;
      study site. Study subjects will be instructed (and provided) how to complete the electronic&#xD;
      patient reported outcome (ePRO) on a device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period (V2 - V14 (EOT), Day 2 - Day 14):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will continue to document the daily diary of ePRO. Total 13 visits are included&#xD;
      in this period. Except 4 in-persons visits (V3, V7, V10, and V14), no in-person visit is&#xD;
      expected during the study. Subjects will return to the clinical study sites to collect&#xD;
      specimens for quantification of viral genome, inflammatory markers, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      safety laboratory tests as well as record the SaO2, oral temperature, heart and respiratory&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, symptoms and concomitant medications, to document clinical status and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), and IP accountability will be monitored. In addition, clinical symptom&#xD;
      assessments and 7-category ordinal scale will be evaluated as well along with safety&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations to determine whether the subject will continue to take the IP or stop&#xD;
      the clinical trial. The subject will return the study treatment bottles at EOT visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for the in-person visits, subjects will be phone-called once every day between 8:00 AM&#xD;
      and 7:00 PM on the visits to record concomitant medications and to document clinical status&#xD;
      and 7-category ordinal scale as well as adverse events (AEs) to determine whether the subject&#xD;
      will be taken of the IP and/or stop the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Follow-Up Period (V15 - V20, Day 15 - Day 56):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Day 15 to 28, subjects will perform the ePRO diary daily. In addition to ePRO, study&#xD;
      subjects will be called every 7±2 days after EOT visit to document final outcome and AEs up&#xD;
      to Day 56. AE/SAEs, hospital and ICU lengths of stays, and mortality in hospitalized subjects&#xD;
      will be documented.&#xD;
