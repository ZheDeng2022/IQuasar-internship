    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check if patients' exercise during their dialysis sessions&#xD;
      can improve the blood parameters which affect the heart disease and osteoporosis, so that we&#xD;
      can help patients live longer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis patients suffer from a number of problems, one of which is reduced ability,&#xD;
      decreased functional capacity, and consequently reduced physical capability. Forced&#xD;
      inactivity due to immobility in dialysis sessions and the need to rest and relieve fatigue&#xD;
      for a few hours after each session cause patients to become more inactive day by day, and&#xD;
      according to various studies, inactivity in these patients along with reduced physical&#xD;
      capabilities increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a risk factor for&#xD;
      mortality in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, inactivity is an independent predictor of hospitalization and mortality in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality rate of dialysis patients is much higher than that of healthy people, to the&#xD;
      extent that it is reported to be about 10 to 30 times higher. The life expectancy of these&#xD;
      patients is between 30 and 50 percent lower than that of people without the same age and sex.&#xD;
      Dialysis patients suffer from many CVDs such as high blood pressure, vascular disease,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. CVDs in patients are related to traditional risk&#xD;
      factors such as diabetes, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle and non-traditional risk factors&#xD;
      such as anemia, inflammation, abnormal calcium metabolism and phosphorus and oxidative&#xD;
      stress. Studies have shown that high levels of calcium, phosphorus , calcium- phosphorus&#xD;
      product and parathyroid hormone are associated with fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events&#xD;
      and all-cause mortality in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common complications of chronic kidney disease is hypophosphatemia. Phosphate&#xD;
      metabolism is regulated by the interaction of the kidneys, bones and intestines. This balance&#xD;
      is impaired in kidney patients and the calcification process occurs through disturbances in&#xD;
      the regulation of calcium, phosphate, and hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is&#xD;
      considered as one of the aggravating causes of anemia as well as resistance to erythropoietin&#xD;
      treatment in hemodialysis patients. Due to the effect of parathyroid hormone in the&#xD;
      regulation of calcium and the anabolic and catabolic role of the bones, the regulation of&#xD;
      this hormone is essential for all people, especially dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human studies have shown that the regulation of parathyroid hormone and calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorus metabolism are dependent on physical activity, and they have introduced exercise&#xD;
      as an effective way to regulate this hormone. Considering the various effects of exercise on&#xD;
      dialysis patients, a study has been designed to investigate the effect of concurrent exercise&#xD;
      during dialysis on changes in calcium levels, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, and&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will do concurrent exercise (a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training) for 30-60 minutes during the second hour of their routine hemodialysis sessions. To determine the intensity of the prescribed exercise, maximum heart rate is used for aerobic workout and 5 Repetitions Maximum (5RM) for resistance protocols. Exercises will be performed at a moderate exercise intensity (12-14 on the Borg RPE Scale). All protocols are tailor-made based on each individual's needs and physical abilities.</description>
