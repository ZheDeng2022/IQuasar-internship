    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and effects&#xD;
      of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN-C) in healthy adults, 18-65 years of age. The effects&#xD;
      will be studied over the course of 30 days in a repeated-dose study through the collection of&#xD;
      blood and urine samples, and administration of surveys and questionnaires.&#xD;
