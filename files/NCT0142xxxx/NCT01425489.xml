      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Krabbe&#xD;
      Disease from blood&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Krabbe disease is a rare, hereditary degenerative disorder of the central and peripheral&#xD;
      nervous systems. It is characterized by the presence of globoid cells (cells that have more&#xD;
      than one nucleus), the breakdown of the nerve's protective myelin coating, and destruction of&#xD;
      brain cells. Krabbe disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called the&#xD;
      leukodystrophies. These disorders impair the growth or development of the myelin sheath, the&#xD;
      fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers, and cause severe deterioration&#xD;
      of mental and motor skills. Myelin is a complex substance made up of at least 10 different&#xD;
      enzymes. Each of the leukodystrophies affects one (and only one) of these substances. Krabbe&#xD;
      disease is caused by a deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, an essential enzyme for myelin&#xD;
      metabolism. The disease most often affects infants, with on-set before age 6 months, but can&#xD;
      occur in adolescence or adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms include irritability, unexplained fever, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding&#xD;
      difficulties, vomiting, and slowing of mental and motor development. Other symptoms include&#xD;
      muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, and blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall calculated European frequency is 1 case per 100,000 populations, with a higher&#xD;
      reported incidence in Sweden of 1.9 cases per 100,000 populations. An unusually high&#xD;
      incidence, 6 cases per 1000 live births, is reported in the Druze community in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize in the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of affected patents specific metabolic alterations that allow to diagnose in the future the&#xD;
      disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of the&#xD;
      study to develop new biochemical markers from the plasma of the affected patients helping to&#xD;
      benefit the patient by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of mass-spectometry 10 ml EDTA&#xD;
      blood and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct Krabbe diagnosis in&#xD;
      those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,&#xD;
      sequencing of Krabbe will be done as routine diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be done at the Centogene AG Am Strande 7 18055 Rostock Germany&#xD;
