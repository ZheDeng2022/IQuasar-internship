      This study will examine the efficacy of mailed distribution of free Nicotine Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy to smokers. Telephone numbers will be randomly selected from across Canada in order&#xD;
      to recruit adult smokers interested in completing a smoking survey and willing to be&#xD;
      interviewed again in 8 weeks and 6 months time. Study participants will be asked about their&#xD;
      smoking history and a hypothetical question: would they be interested in receiving the&#xD;
      nicotine patch if this were to be provided to them free of charge? Participants expressing&#xD;
      interest will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to actually receive a program of 5 weeks of the nicotine patch for free right&#xD;
      away and the other group will not be offered the free nicotine patches. The proportions of&#xD;
      smokers in the two groups who quit smoking by the 6-month interview will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. Considerable public health efforts&#xD;
      are ongoing Canada-wide to reduce the prevalence of smoking in the general population. From&#xD;
      1985 to 2005, smoking rates among adults reduced from 35% to 19%. However, since that time,&#xD;
      this steady rate of decline plateaued at around 18-19%. What else can be done to continue to&#xD;
      significantly reduce the number of smokers at the population level? One option is to&#xD;
      translate interventions that have demonstrated clinical efficacy into population level&#xD;
      initiatives. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) has a considerable research base&#xD;
      demonstrating its efficacy. Public health initiatives are underway to distribute NRT widely&#xD;
      through mass distribution efforts. For example, over 58,000 NRT treatments have been&#xD;
      distributed in the province of Ontario alone, and other provinces in Canada are considering&#xD;
      adopting mass distribution procedures. However, one important question remains unanswered -&#xD;
      do smoking cessation programs that involve mass distribution of free NRT work? Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence consisting of before-after smoking status data from participants of mass NRT&#xD;
      campaigns yielded promising results. However, such data cannot be used to make causal&#xD;
      statements about the impact of NRT distribution. To answer this question, a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blinded, panel survey design with random assignment to an experimental and a control&#xD;
      condition will be used in this study. A two-stage recruitment process will be employed, in&#xD;
      the context of a general population survey with two follow-ups (8 weeks and 6 months). Random&#xD;
      digit dialing of Canadian home telephone numbers will identify households with adult smokers&#xD;
      who are willing to take part in a smoking study that involves three interviews, with saliva&#xD;
      collection for 3-HC/cotinine ratio measurement at baseline and saliva cotinine verification&#xD;
      at 8-week and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the baseline survey, eligible subjects will be identified for the second&#xD;
      recruitment - randomization of smokers into experimental and control conditions to receive&#xD;
      versus not receive nicotine patches. Eligibility will be determined by a series of questions&#xD;
      regarding hypothetical interest in nicotine patches to quit smoking (including willingness to&#xD;
      have nicotine patches sent to their home) and having no contraindications for using NRT. A&#xD;
      randomized half of the eligible subjects will be assigned to the experimental condition and&#xD;
      asked for their permission to have nicotine patches sent to their home. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed-up at 8 weeks and 6 months. Subjects in the control condition will not be offered&#xD;
      nicotine patches. Interviewers will be blind to subjects' condition because they will be&#xD;
      using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology and as the first parts of&#xD;
      the 8-week and 6-month follow-ups are identical for experimental and control conditions, they&#xD;
      will not know the intervention condition to which a subject belongs until questions specific&#xD;
      to the use of NRT are asked near the end of the surveys (i.e., after the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are assessed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that subjects who receive nicotine patches at baseline will display&#xD;
      significantly higher quit rates (as assessed by 30 day point prevalence of abstinence from&#xD;
      tobacco) at 6-month follow-up as compared to subjects who do not receive nicotine patches at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
