  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FB-8 study is designed as an open label, single arm, Phase I dose-escalation study&#xD;
      evaluating the combination of weekly paclitaxel with neratinib and trastuzumab in women with&#xD;
      metastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the three-drug combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive concurrent therapy with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      a 28-day cycle), trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 2 mg/kg IV weekly), and&#xD;
      neratinib. The neratinib dose-escalation will include 4 dose levels (120 mg, 160 mg, 200 mg,&#xD;
      and 240 mg) as a daily oral dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neratinib dose-escalation for the study will proceed on the basis of dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 1 or more of the&#xD;
      following events during cycle 1: any grade diarrhea that is associated with fever or&#xD;
      dehydration; grade 3 diarrhea lasting more than 2 days on optimal medical therapy; grade 4&#xD;
      diarrhea of any duration; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with fever; grade 4 neutropenia&#xD;
      lasting more than 7 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity;&#xD;
      or any toxicity-related delay of more than 2 weeks to initiate cycle 2. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the next dose level when all evaluable patients at the same dose level have&#xD;
      completed the first treatment cycle. Enrolled patients will remain on the assigned dose level&#xD;
      treatment until toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;

             metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method&#xD;
             of contraception during therapy and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ECOG performance status must be 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be documentation that the patient has evidence (measurable or&#xD;
             non-measurable) of metastatic breast cancer. Histologic confirmation of metastatic&#xD;

             weeks prior to study entry must be met: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to&#xD;
             1.5 x ULN; AST and ALT must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab or less&#xD;
             than or equal to 5 x ULN if liver metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry must be less than or&#xD;
             equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The LVEF assessment by 2-D echocardiogram or MUGA scan performed within 90 days prior&#xD;
             to study entry must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the facility's LLN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapy with neratinib for any malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or brain metastases requiring chronic steroids to control&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;

             the stomach or small bowel, or other disease or condition significantly affecting&#xD;
             gastrointestinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent greater than or equal to grade 2 diarrhea regardless of etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensory or motor neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI&#xD;
             CTCAE v3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions that would prohibit intermittent administration of corticosteroids for&#xD;
             paclitaxel premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic daily treatment with corticosteroids with a dose of greater than or equal to&#xD;
             10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent (excluding inhaled steroids).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of any&#xD;

             enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LV function;&#xD;
             history of documented CHF; and documented cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving&#xD;
             study treatment or would prevent required follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of study entry. (Note: Pregnancy testing should be&#xD;
             performed within 14 days prior to study entry according to institutional standards for&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator should assess the patient to determine if she has any psychiatric or&#xD;
             addictive disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             preclude her from meeting the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
