  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system of a patient can attack the liver or the kidney received from a donor&#xD;
      (organ rejection). This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to&#xD;
      prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection).&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow,&#xD;
      namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system&#xD;
      and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to&#xD;
      investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The&#xD;
      present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after&#xD;
      liver or kidney transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of third party MSC&#xD;
      administration after liver or kidney organ transplantation. Ten patients undergoing liver&#xD;
      transplantation and 10 patients undergoing kidney transplantation will be included in the&#xD;
      experimental arm to receive a single infusion of MSC. The outcome of each of these 2&#xD;
      subgroups will be compared with that of similar control patients undergoing liver or kidney&#xD;
      transplantation but who will not receive MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver and kidney transplanted patients will receive standard immunosuppressive therapy,&#xD;
      TAC-MMF-steroïds and TAC-MMF-steroïds plus an IL-2-R antibody respectively. Patients enrolled&#xD;
      in the experimental arms will be infused with a single dose of 1,5-3,0 10E6 MSC/kg, 3(+/-2)&#xD;
      days after the transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning of immunosuppression will be attempted from month 6 in liver transplant patients who&#xD;
      did not present a rejection episode and show normal graft function and graft biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplant patients will continue standard immunosuppressive therapy indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female (&gt;18 years) individuals unrelated to the recipient or the graft donor will be&#xD;
      MSC donors. MSC donors need to fulfill generally accepted criteria for allogeneic HSC&#xD;
      donation.&#xD;
