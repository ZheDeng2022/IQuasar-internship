      Ginger contains constituents with pharmacological properties similar to the novel class of&#xD;
      dual-acting NSAIDs. Compounds in this class inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism via the&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LOX) pathways. These compounds have notably fewer&#xD;
      side effects than conventional NSAIDs and now are being investigated as a novel class of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory compounds. Although ginger has potentially strong anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      components, its efficacy on acute inflammation was not assessed before. The common&#xD;
      postoperative sequelae of surgical removal of impacted teeth are pain, trismus and swelling,&#xD;
      related to local inflammatory reaction, with cyclooxygenase and prostaglandins playing a&#xD;
      crucial role. NSAIDs (e.g. Ibuprofen) are effective in the management of postoperative dental&#xD;
      pain, likely through blockage of prostaglandin synthesis and are commonly used. The efficacy&#xD;
      of Ibuprofen in the treatment of postoperative dental pain has been evaluated in several&#xD;
      clinical trials. However, NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      ulcers, bleeding disorders, and renal dysfunctions. Therefore, there is a need for an&#xD;
      effective, oral analgesic with a more favorable safety profile. The primary aim of this study&#xD;
      was to investigate the ability of Ginger powder (Zintoma, Goldaru) to reduce postoperative&#xD;
      swelling, pain and trismus in an acute pain model.&#xD;

      Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, has a long history of medicinal use. In&#xD;
      traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, ginger has been used to treat a wide range of&#xD;
      ailments including stomachache, diarrhea, nausea, asthma, respiratory disorders, toothache,&#xD;
      gingivitis, and arthritis. Subsequent studies revealed that ginger contains constituents with&#xD;
      pharmacological properties similar to the novel class of dual-acting NSAIDs. Compounds in&#xD;
      this class inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase&#xD;
      (LOX) pathways. These compounds have notably fewer side effects than conventional NSAIDs and&#xD;
      now are being investigated as a novel class of anti-inflammatory compounds. Different animal&#xD;
      studies revealed that oral dried ginger or ginger extract reduced inflammation in paw and&#xD;
      joint swelling induced by different chemical agents, lung inflammation induced by&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and arthritis induced by collagen . Several clinical studies&#xD;
      support the value of ginger for the treatment of osteoarthritis . In addition to alleviating&#xD;
      pain, ginger extract has been reported to decrease joint swelling. In some of these trials it&#xD;
      was reported that ginger relieved pain and swelling to varying degrees in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis as well as those with muscular pain without causing&#xD;
      any adverse effects during a period ranging from 3 months to 2.5 years . In one recent trial&#xD;
      ginger was tested in primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with Ibuprofen and mefenamic acid and&#xD;
      no significant differences was found between the three study groups in relief, stability, or&#xD;
      aggravation of symptoms . The common postoperative sequelae of surgical removal of impacted&#xD;
      teeth are pain, trismus and swelling, related to local inflammatory reaction, with&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase and prostaglandins playing a crucial role. NSAIDs (e.g. Ibuprofen) are&#xD;
      effective in the management of postoperative dental pain, likely through blockage of&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis and are commonly used. The efficacy of Ibuprofen in the treatment of&#xD;
      postoperative dental pain has been evaluated in several clinical trials . However, NSAIDs are&#xD;
      contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding disorders, and renal&#xD;
      dysfunctions. Therefore, there is a need for an effective, oral analgesic with a more&#xD;
      favorable safety profile. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the ability of&#xD;
      Ginger powder (Zintoma, Goldaru,Iran) to reduce postoperative swelling, pain and trismus&#xD;
      after third molar surgery.&#xD;
