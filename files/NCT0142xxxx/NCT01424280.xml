        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential must have had a prior&#xD;
             vasectomy or agree to use adequate contraception from the time of the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug until three months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A female patient is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant)&#xD;
                  defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or&#xD;
                  hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
                  [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating&#xD;
                  hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is&#xD;
                  confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
                  status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
                  defined in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four&#xD;
                  weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this&#xD;
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their&#xD;
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
                  of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test during the Screening&#xD;
                  Period, and agrees to use adequate contraception from Screening until four weeks&#xD;
                  after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. BMI within the range of 19-32 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Documented history of bronchial asthma that is British Thoracic Society guideline step&#xD;
             1-3, diagnosed at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Patient should be on a fixed regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. The&#xD;
             following asthma medications are permitted: i. Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) per day&#xD;
             use: &lt;=800mcg of Beclomethasone Dipropionate or budesonide, 320mcg ciclesonide or&#xD;
             500mcg of Fluticasone propionate - or equivalent doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Intermittent short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist therapy (SABA). A minimum of 8&#xD;
             hours washout from SABA is required prior to Screening or study methacholine challenge&#xD;
             tests or FEV1 assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist (LABA) therapy is not permitted during the&#xD;
             study. If deemed appropriate by the investigator, patients usually managed with LABA&#xD;
             can be switched to SABA in order to comply with requirements for washout. A minimum of&#xD;
             24 hour washout after last dose of LABA is required prior to Screening methacholine&#xD;
             challenge tests or FEV1 assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iv. Therapy with montelukast is allowed provided that administration is separated by&#xD;
             at least 12 hours from study drug dosing (see Section 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Best FEV1 of &gt;70% predicted normal value during Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Hyper-responsive to methacholine such that a baseline methacholine PC20 is &lt;= 4 mg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Increase in PC20 of at least 2 dilutions compared to baseline in the presence of&#xD;
             inhaled beta-agonist in response to a methacholine challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are currently non-smokers or who have not used any inhaled tobacco&#xD;
             products in the previous 6 months prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Average QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in patients with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;

             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
