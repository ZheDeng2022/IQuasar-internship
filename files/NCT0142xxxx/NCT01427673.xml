  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of disability and death&#xD;
      worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), in particular, serve as marker of an&#xD;
      accelerated disease course and thus herald an increased risk of not only repetitive AECOPD&#xD;
      episodes but also deteriorating pulmonary function and death (2). Obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA), when it occurs in combination with COPD, is an increasingly recognized contributor to&#xD;
      AECOPD episodes. OSA consists of repetitive sleep-related partial loss of airway caliber&#xD;
      arising from increased transmural pressures which favor luminal collapse. OSA is estimated to&#xD;
      afflict 4 to 9% of the populations, a prevalence which is anticipated to climb hand-in-hand&#xD;
      with the rising incidence of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the two disorders, which has been arbitrarily labeled as Overlap Syndrome&#xD;
      (OS), has been linked with greater elevations in arterial carbon dioxide tensions and&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance and lower arterial oxygen tensions than is seen with either of&#xD;
      its component disorders in isolation. Elevated pulmonary artery pressures may progress to&#xD;
      cause cor pulmonale, a process whereby compensatory right ventricle remodeling, hypertrophy,&#xD;
      and eventually, florid heart failure. In the setting of OSA, the therapeutic gold standard is&#xD;
      nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Essentially, CPAP machines function by&#xD;
      administering a single continuous positive pressure airflow to the person's airway via an&#xD;
      appropriately fitted nasal mask. The applied pressure stents open partially occluded airway&#xD;
      segments during sleep. Though effective in OSA and OS, it is increasingly realized that for&#xD;
      OS patients there may exist a reduction not only in airway patency but also in ventilatory&#xD;
      drive when sleeping such that means to augment per breath volumes may attain incremental&#xD;
      benefits to the use of CPAP alone. Although CPAP is ineffective in COPD, Bipap has shown&#xD;
      benefit suggesting that patient with OSA and COPD may derive an improvement in health-related&#xD;
      outcomes by using a ventilation modality which addresses both of the underlying conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipap functions by combining the single flow in CPAP with a second inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      assist which not only overcomes sleep-related airway resistance but also increases the&#xD;
      magnitude of each breath resulting in lower diurnal carbon dioxide tensions and pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressures. Bipap may harbor a mortality benefit in COPD; but the study results are&#xD;
      conflicting. It is unclear if Bipap is more effective at treating OSA than usual CPAP.&#xD;
      However, it is in the setting of OS that Bipap may assume a prominent role through its&#xD;
      ability to address both disorders; CPAP for the OSA portion and an inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      assist to ameliorate the COPD piece. Thus far no study has been conducted to address whether&#xD;
      OS may derive a particular benefit from Bipap or, more specifically, examine whether Bipap&#xD;
      may diminish the risk of AECOPD, or heart failure-related hospitalizations.&#xD;
