  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biomarker study with the goal of measuring changes in proteins and gene&#xD;
      methylation. This study is not intended for use in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing,&#xD;
      or preventing disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) alone and in&#xD;
      combination with celecoxib (Celebrex, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID), to&#xD;
      decrease breast cancer risk by their effect on certain biological indicators (biomarkers) of&#xD;
      breast cancer risk (called PGE2, COX-2, and 15-PGDH) and cell changes in the breast.&#xD;

      This is a biomarker study with the goal of measuring changes in protein and RNA expression.&#xD;
      This study is not intended for use in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing, or preventing&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      66 women at high risk for breast cancer (gail risk &gt;/= 1.66% for 5 year risk, or personal or&#xD;
      family history)will be recruited and enrolled. 22 women will be randomized into each arm,&#xD;
      with anticipation of 2 women in each group will not be evaluable, leaving 20 in each group&#xD;
      for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of vitamin D and celecoxib act synergistically to decrease breast cancer risk&#xD;
      by decreasing cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium through their action on&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women at increased breast cancer risk, determine the effect of vitamin D, with or without&#xD;
      celecoxib, on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PG synthesis and metabolism, through the measurement of 15-PGDH, COX-2, and PGE2 in the&#xD;
           breast&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale: 1,25(OH)2D, the active form of vitamin D, has been shown in vitro to decrease&#xD;
           PGE2 both by interfering with its production and by increasing its breakdown, leading to&#xD;
           lower cell proliferation. Celecoxib potentiated the antiproliferative effect, allowing a&#xD;
           much lower dose of each agent when used in combination than in isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proliferative activity in the breast, as measured by Mammary Ductoscopy (MD) cell&#xD;
           morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rationale: Both MD and Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) contain ductal epithelial cells, but&#xD;
           MD samples contain more cells for cytologic review than NAF. Findings on MD cytology&#xD;
           correlate with likelihood of breast cancer (2), NAF cytology relates to breast cancer&#xD;
           risk and improves risk stratification (3), and bioactive food components can alter NAF&#xD;
           cytology (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Circulating levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and celecoxib, and determine if the levels of&#xD;
           these compounds correlate with response to markers of PG synthesis and metabolism or&#xD;
           cell proliferation.&#xD;
