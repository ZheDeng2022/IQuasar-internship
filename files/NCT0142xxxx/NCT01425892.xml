      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Sjogren s syndrome is a disease that affects about 1-4 million Americans. It is more common&#xD;
      in women. It mainly affects the glands that produce saliva and tears, leading to dry eyes and&#xD;
      dry mouth. The cause of Sjogren s syndrome is unknown, but inflammation plays an important&#xD;
      role. The purpose of this study is to learn more about Sjogren s syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To better understand how Sjogren s syndrome begins and how it affects patients so that we&#xD;
      can develop better ways to treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be 16 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must have a diagnosis of Sjogren s syndrome or have at least two symptoms of&#xD;
           Sjogren s syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People taking part in the study will come to the NIH Clinical Center for at least three&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During these visits, participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They&#xD;
           will have oral and dental assessments, and saliva collection. Lab tests (blood and&#xD;
           urine) and dry eye exams will be done. Participants will answer questionnaires and have&#xD;
           salivary scintigraphy (adults only unless required for diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other optional tests may also be done. Participants may have to come in for additional&#xD;
           visits if they have these optional tests or if their disease changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The only treatment provided as part of this study is for medical emergencies or&#xD;
           complications that occur while you are at NIH for evaluation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      involving the exocrine glands. Salivary and lacrimal glands are predominantly affected&#xD;
      leading to dry mouth and dry eyes but other exocrine organs are also frequently involved. It&#xD;
      is one of the most common rheumatic autoimmune diseases, which effects between 1-4 million&#xD;
      Americans, predominantly women with a female to male ratio of 9:1. Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s&#xD;
      syndrome may occur alone (primary SS), or may coexist with other systemic connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders (secondary SS). In many cases systemic manifestations, such as fatigue, arthritis,&#xD;
      vasculitis, lung disease, peripheral or central neuropathy and autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      dysfunction accompany glandular involvement. Patients with systemic manifestations are at&#xD;
      higher risk of lymphoma, the incidence of which is increased in SS. The treatment of sicca&#xD;
      symptoms is mainly symptomatic, whereas management of extraglandular manifestations is&#xD;
      similar to other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause and pathogenesis of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome is still largely unknown. In&#xD;
      a genetically predisposed individual various environmental factors, such as viral infections,&#xD;
      may lead to epithelial cell activation and a protracted inflammatory response with features&#xD;
      of autoimmunity. Autoreactive lymphocytes and autoantibodies are considered important in this&#xD;
      process although the pathogenic role of any particular autoantibody is still undefined.&#xD;
      Although inflammation may contribute to the exocrinopathy of SS, the relationship between&#xD;
      inflammation and exocrine dysfunction is poorly understood. Moreover, the model does not&#xD;
      explain many of the extraglandular manifestations of SS patients, such as fatigue. Further&#xD;
      studies are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to enable the collection of longitudinal clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data and biologic specimens to identify pathogenetic mechanisms of SS by careful&#xD;
      clinical phenotyping of SS patients and Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s-like conditions over time&#xD;
      and collection of biologic samples for concurrent and future laboratory studies related to&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome. Another objective of the study is to&#xD;
      identify biomarker candidates associated with the diagnosis, severity, prognosis, or organ&#xD;
      involvement in SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will enable the study of the genetic basis and the mechanistic aspects of&#xD;
      immunologic and non-immunologic abnormalities of SS and their associations with various&#xD;
      clinical phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 300 subjects with Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome or&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s-like conditions. Subjects aged 16- years or older fulfilling&#xD;
      European American Consensus Criteria for Primary or Secondary Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s&#xD;
      syndrome are eligible for the study. Selected subjects with incomplete Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren&#xD;
      s syndrome or who are excluded from the European American criteria may also be eligible.&#xD;
      Screening will be done on the Characterization of Diseases with Salivary Gland Involvement&#xD;
      protocol (15-D-0051) prospectively or on the previous screening protocol (84-D-0056).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal observational study. All subjects will have at least three core&#xD;
      evaluations (approximately biannually) during a 4-5 year period. Additional evaluations may&#xD;
      be required if there is a significant change in the clinical condition of subjects likely&#xD;
      related to SS or sicca syndrome or to provide additional research samples or clinical data&#xD;
      for the pathogenesis studies. Clinical data will be collected through questionnaires,&#xD;
      personal interviews, physical examination, laboratory testing and imaging studies. The core&#xD;
      evaluation will include a complete medical history and physical examination and a complete&#xD;
      oral and dry eye evaluation. Research studies include salivary scintigraphy for functional&#xD;
      assessment of salivary gland function, testing of the autonomous nervous system and may&#xD;
      include an ultrasound guided parotid core needle biopsy. Blood, saliva and biopsy samples&#xD;
      will be stored and used for laboratory research studies aimed at the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome. Samples labeled with a code without any personal&#xD;
      identifiers may be shared with researchers in and outside the NIH. DNA will be collected for&#xD;
      genetic studies related to Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and related conditions.&#xD;
