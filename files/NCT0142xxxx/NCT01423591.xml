  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatic Polymyalgia(PMR) is a relatively common chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown&#xD;
      origin which predominantly develops in elderly subjects and presents with severe pain and&#xD;
      stiffness in the neck, shoulder and pelvic girdles, along with increased acute phase&#xD;
      reactants. Systemic manifestations such as fever, anorexia and weight loss are characteristic&#xD;
      signatures of PMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids (CS) constitute the standard treatment of PMR. Although in most patients the&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease disappear after one or two years of treatment, a proportion of&#xD;
      patients remain CS-dependent with the subsequent CS toxicity. Open label studies have&#xD;
      suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists lead to sustained improvement and CS&#xD;
      sparing effect in patients with refractory PMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial with&#xD;
      infliximab in CS-dependent patients with PMR. Patients with CS-dependent PMR (defined as&#xD;
      requiring ≥ 5 mg/day after at least 2 years of treatment to maintain remission or ≥ 7.5&#xD;
      mg/day after at least 6 months) were randomly assigned to receive Infliximab (5 mg/kg i.v) at&#xD;
      0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 weeks (n = 12) or placebo (n = 11) together with CS that were reduced&#xD;
      according to a predefined schedule. The primary outcome was the proportion of responder&#xD;
      patients -defined as individuals with both complete clinical and analytical remission without&#xD;
      receiving CS for at least three months- at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were cumulative CS&#xD;
      doses and adverse events proportion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The duration of the study will be 1 year, and it will be divided in several phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Initial phase (double-blind trial): Between week 0 and week 24. Placebo or Infliximab at a&#xD;
      dose of 3 mg/kg/day at weeks 0, 2 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening process, patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      protocol will be randomized to receive three infusions of placebo or infliximab as previously&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first infusion (week 0), the prednisone dose will be tapered according to the&#xD;
      following schedule: Prednisone (or equivalent) should be decreased at a rate of 1.25 mg per&#xD;
      week until complete withdrawal of corticosteroids. In case of relapse, the dose of prednisone&#xD;
      will be increased up to the previous dose that controlled the symptoms of PMR, and after 4&#xD;
      weeks of stable dose, prednisone will be again tapered but with a slower schedule: 1.25 mg&#xD;
      every 2 weeks until complete withdrawal of corticosteroids. In case of a new relapse, the&#xD;
      dose of prednisone will be managed according to the physician criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Extension phase (open trial): Between week 24 and week 48. Infliximab at a dose of 3&#xD;
      mg/kg/day at weeks 24, 26 and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24 weeks, all the patients included into the trial and still on corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      with or without clinical manifestations of PMR, will receive three infusions of infliximab&#xD;
      according to the previous described schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first infusion (week 24) the dose of prednisone will be decreased according to the&#xD;
      same schedule previously described in the initial phase of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule therapy proposed in the extension phase is going to be for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (GROUP A) To evaluate time response to Infliximab in responders concerning active&#xD;
           treatment group in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (GROUP B). To incorporate patients placebo- treated to treatment who have showed&#xD;
           efficacy (in case of favorable results in the interim analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (GROUP C). To offer maintenance treatment to patients who have showed complete response&#xD;
           during phase 1 and this treatment is associated to a significant corticosteroid tapering&#xD;
           dose or maintenance response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (GROUP D). Discontinuation of the treatment in patients who have been receiving active&#xD;
           treatment during phase 1 and have not showed response in any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first infusion (week 24), it will be reduced prednisone dose following same regimen&#xD;
      described in the clinical phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Study will be administrate for 24 + 24 weeks. In the end of the study the patient will&#xD;
      continue treatment the most efficacy in the investigator opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Proportion of responders (complete remission without corticosteroids) at&#xD;
      24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of responders at 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of relapses / recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative dose and side effects of steroids at 24 and 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients that should be re-treated with infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of Infliximab in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum cytokine analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) CLINICAL ASSESSMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will be performed at screening, baseline, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months&#xD;
      of treatment and monthly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded at each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A structured questionnaire on symptoms of PMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global evaluation of disease activity by the patients and physicians (visual analogue&#xD;
           scale, 0-100).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global evaluation of pain by the patients (visual analogue scale, 0-100).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute phase reactants: ESR (Westergren) and CRP (nephelometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood cell count, glucose (glycosylated hemoglobin in case of diabetes), blood&#xD;
           urea and creatinine, liver enzymes and albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steroid dosage. Cumulative steroid dosage during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects, with special emphasis in infections and corticosteroid side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a PPD test and chest X-rays performed at screening following the&#xD;
      current recommendations for anti-TNF therapy (50-52). Those patients with a positive PPD test&#xD;
      (induration ≥ 5 mm) or with chest X-ray images showing lesions consistent with latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection, will have prophylactic treatment with isoniazid, 300 mg daily during&#xD;
      9 months (in case of isoniazid toxicity: rifamycin, 600 mg/day during four months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the patients will be instructed to the possible development of infections and&#xD;
      other side effects, and new manifestations of GCA, which should be immediately reported to&#xD;
      the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) SERUM CYTOKINE STUDY During the study period and after informed consent, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a serum sample (around 200 ml) at 7 different time points (week 0 or&#xD;
      pre-treatment, and weeks 2, 6, 24, 26, 30 and 48). The blood will be obtained at the same&#xD;
      time that the scheduled venipuncture for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be done using a Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) methodology. The investigators&#xD;
      will use the CBA Flex Set system (Becton Dickinson) that includes the following cytokines:&#xD;
      IL-1, IL-6, TGF-beta, TNF-alfa, IL-10, IL-12, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma. Following acquisition of&#xD;
      sample data using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), the sample results are&#xD;
      generated in graphical and tabular format using the CBA Analysis Software (Becton Dickinson).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab 5 mg/kg. i.v. at week 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infliximab Placebo i.v. weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase (weeks 24-48):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Responders at week 24: Treatment discontinuation (GROUP A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No-responders at week 24:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo group: infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 24, 26, 30, 36 y 42 (GROUP B).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Infliximab group:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who have lost response during phase 1 before week 24 will receive&#xD;
                infliximab (5 mg/kg) at weeks 30, 36 and 42 (GROUP C).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who never have fulfilled response criteria during Phase 1: will not&#xD;
                receive treatment in extension phase. (GROUP D)&#xD;
