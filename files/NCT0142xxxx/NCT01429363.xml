  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospective Clinical Series (CS) aims to prove the hypothesis that Targeted Disc&#xD;
      Decompression (TDD) reduces the pain in patients suffering from radicular leg pain secondary&#xD;
      to a contained focal disc protrusion (Lumboradicular Syndrome). Secondary objective will be&#xD;
      to prove that the treatment Group will have less disability and better quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a prospective clinical series (CS) in which 20 patients after&#xD;
      careful selection will be treated with TDD, followed by a standardized rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. After the diagnosis Lumboradicular syndrome the patient will first receive an&#xD;
      transforaminal epidural injection at the site and level of the herniated disc, proven on MRI.&#xD;
      Two weeks after the epidural injection the patient is evaluated. When the response is&#xD;
      negative (a decrease less than 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale) TDD can be performed.&#xD;
      Patient outcome will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the study&#xD;
      intervention. End point of this study is 3 months after TDD treatment. A positive response is&#xD;
      defined as a minimal decrease of 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale compared to the VAS&#xD;
      score at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive response in at least seven patients and acceptable side-effects and complications&#xD;
      will lead to the start of a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the response is positive &lt; 7 out of 20 patients, the decision to proceed with a RCT&#xD;
      following the prospective CS is made after evaluation of the CS by a team of experts. The&#xD;
      results from this prospective study will be published.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mono radicular leg pain for at least 6 weeks as a result from a lumbar contained&#xD;
             herniated disc. Leg pain must be of greater impact then concomitant back-pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failing conservative treatment; analgesics and/or physical therapy ( WHO 1-3). Failing&#xD;
             means persisting pain leading to problems with daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI: must be performed &lt; 6 weeks before start treatment. On MRI signs of contained&#xD;
             herniated disc, maximum 33% obliteration of the spinal channel. No signs of other&#xD;
             significant spine pathology (see exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative response to a transforaminal epidural injection. Injection must be performed&#xD;
