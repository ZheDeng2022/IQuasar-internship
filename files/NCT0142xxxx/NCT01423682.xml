  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy make up a large part of the population in&#xD;
      physiotherapy practice. The rotator cuff, a shoulder muscle group, plays an important role in&#xD;
      causing pain. Tendons suffer large compression and friction, which can lead to degeneration&#xD;
      of these tendons. Rehabilitation often leads to unsatisfying results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Achilles and patella tendinopathy, a new training program called eccentric training has&#xD;
      shown very good results. Eccentric training contains exercises during which a force has to be&#xD;
      resisted while the muscle lengthens instead of shortens. This would have a larger influence&#xD;
      on tendon tissue. Some small studies also show promising results of eccentric training in&#xD;
      patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy but the mechanisms behind these results remain&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this, 30 patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy and 30 healthy subjects will&#xD;
      be evaluated before and immediately after performing the exercise. Three measurements will be&#xD;
      done: ultrasonographic measurement of tendon thickness, power Doppler imaging and measurement&#xD;
      of microcirculation around the tendon with Oxygen to see. All measurements are non-invasive,&#xD;
      pain free and without risks for the human body.&#xD;
