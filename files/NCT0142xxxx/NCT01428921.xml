  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorders associated with excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and cardiovascular disease. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is&#xD;
      an effective standard treatment and is widely prescribed for patients with OSA. Successful&#xD;
      CPAP treatment has also been shown to improve cognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      function. Sustainable CPAP treatment would alleviate the substantial cost burden of&#xD;
      health-related consequences of untreated OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of CPAP for such patients is disappointingly low and limits the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment. Early CPAP education and follow up have shown to be very&#xD;
      important in helping subjects to handle side-effects or problems associated with the use of&#xD;
      CPAP. Good education program at the initial phase of using CPAP is essentially affected the&#xD;
      acceptance and adherence of CPAP therapy. Good CPAP adherence is not only medically essential&#xD;
      to patients' health but also economically importance to society by alleviating the&#xD;
      substantial cost burden of health-related consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no randomized clinical trial (RCT) to prove the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of extended education program on improving continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure use and its treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy of our on-going RCT&#xD;
      which is an extended education program on improving CPAP compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the application of both MI technique and SCT-based&#xD;
      extended education program at the initial phase of using CPAP also would enhance CPAP&#xD;
      adherence even after one year of attending education class.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease characterized by recurrent episodic&#xD;
      collapse of the upper airway during sleep. It affects 4-5% of the middle-aged population.&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment to relieve the&#xD;
      repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep, and to improve cognitive, cardiovascular&#xD;
      and metabolic function. However, compliance to CPAP treatment has been less than ideal which&#xD;
      limits its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained CPAP treatment would alleviate the substantial cost burden of health-related&#xD;
      consequences of untreated OSA. Early CPAP education and follow up have been shown to be very&#xD;
      important in helping subjects to handle side-effects or problems associated with the use of&#xD;
      CPAP. However, all current randomized controlled trials only evaluated its short-term&#xD;
      efficacy for not more than 6months. Only one retrospective observational study assessed the&#xD;
      longer term (1 year) effect of an education program by assessing patients' re-attendance rate&#xD;
      of CPAP clinic. However, this study suffers from the residual effects of confounders.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators need long term assessment of education program on CPAP&#xD;
      compliance based on properly conducted randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has developed a theory-based behavioral education program to improve CPAP&#xD;
      compliance. It utilizes social cognitive theory (SCT) and motivation interviewing (MI) which&#xD;
      are popularly used theory-based education strategies and have been widely adopted and shown&#xD;
      to be more effective than the traditional approach in health education programs. However,&#xD;
      such programs have not been examined the longer term effect of education program in OSA&#xD;
      patients. The investigators have recently started a RCT that assesses the 3-month effect of&#xD;
      the program. To date, the investigators have recruited 36 subjects in 5 months. The subject&#xD;
      recruitment is conservatively expected to be completed by July 2011. By the time when the&#xD;
      review process of this proposal is completed, most of these subject should have been on&#xD;
      treatment by 1 year. Hence, it is very timely for us to catch up this group of subjects for&#xD;
      assessing the long-term effect of our education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In additional, our team is highly experienced in the management of OSA patients. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently demonstrated that the use of CPAP on the improvement&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic functions. Currently, the investigators are conducting a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial &quot;Education and CPAP&quot; (IRB no. UW10-177)(NCT01173406), which is to&#xD;
      assess the short-term (3-months) efficacy of extended education program, which uses the&#xD;
      concepts of SCT and MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no randomized study from other investigators on the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of CPAP education intervention (either using traditional or theory-based&#xD;
      education strategy). This proposed study is to assess the long-term efficacy of our current&#xD;
      on-going extended education program on improving CPAP compliance on Chinese subjects with&#xD;
      OSA.&#xD;
