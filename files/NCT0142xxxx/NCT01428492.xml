    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical activity of GSK2110183 dosed in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) subjects who have&#xD;
      failed at least one line of systemic treatment. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose(s) (MTD) of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1, Schedule A will assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of GSK2110183 administered&#xD;
      once daily with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) given biweekly. It is&#xD;
      estimated that up to 35-45 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part 1. Part 2 will explore&#xD;
      further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of&#xD;
      the MTD(s) identified in Part 1. A minimum of 15 and maximum of 40 subjects will enroll in&#xD;
      Part 2 Safety/Clinical Activity Cohort for each Schedule explored. The Part 2 PK/PD cohort&#xD;
      will enroll up to 18 subjects. This pharmacokinetic cohort will explore whether exposure to&#xD;
      GSK2110183 at the MTD is similar when GSK2110183 is administered alone or in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone. The same relationship will be explored for bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone when the two drugs are given by themselves or in combination with GSK2110183.&#xD;
      The identified MTD(s) and pharmacodynamic results in this study will inform the doses for&#xD;
      future development of the regimen of GSK2110183 dosed in combination with bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM.&#xD;

Subjects will be enrolled in this cohort to explore whether exposure to GSK2110183 at dose identified in Part 1 is similar when GSK2110183 is administered alone or in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

    <description>Enrolment into the safety/clinical activity cohort in Part 2 will begin prior to enrollment in the PK/PD cohort. Subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who are either bortezomib sensitive or naive after failing one line of prior systemic therapy will be enrolled in the Safety/Clinical Activity cohort. &quot;Bortezomib sensitive&quot; is defined as having a response (PR or better) to the last bortezomib-containing therapy lasting at least 60 days beyond the end of therapy. A minimum of 15 subjects and a total of 40 subjects will be enrolled.

             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  transplant was &gt; 100 days prior to study enrolment&#xD;
