  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEK112111 is a dose-escalation, Phase IB, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended dose and regimen for the&#xD;
      orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      subjects with solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled using a dose-escalation procedure in which the initial cohort&#xD;
      receives a fraction of the GSK1120212 dose that achieved a dose limiting toxicity in a&#xD;
      previous study and the recommended dose of gemcitabine. Escalation will proceed until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated doses are identified. These doses will be selected based on emerging safety&#xD;
      data. Confirmation of the tolerability of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be&#xD;
      explored in approximately 12 subjects. Subjects will continue on treatment until treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria are met (disease progression, intercurrent illness, adverse event or&#xD;
      consent withdrawal).&#xD;

             (ECOG) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy that&#xD;
             is either relapsed or refractory, or potentially responsive to gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor Type criteria as listed in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential as&#xD;
             defined in the protocol or postmenopausal as defined in the protocol. If of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential, she agrees to use protocol specified contraceptive methods&#xD;
