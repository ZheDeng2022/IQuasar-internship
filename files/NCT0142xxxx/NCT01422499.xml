  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed or progressive solid tumors and leukemias have a very poor prognosis in children&#xD;
      despite intense multimodal treatment protocols involving polychemotherapy, surgery, and&#xD;
      radiation. Therefore, innovative treatment strategies targeting specific molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      are urgently required. A novel class of compounds with promising anti-tumoral activities is&#xD;
      histone deacetylase (HDAC)-inhibitors. HDACs are key enzymes involved in regulation of&#xD;
      chromatin-structure and function of several proteins, and aberrant activities of HDACs are&#xD;
      found in many cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibition of HDACs causes cell cycle arrest,&#xD;
      apoptosis, differentiation, inhibition of clonogenic growth, and anti-angiogenic effects in&#xD;
      numerous cancer cells. In addition, promising anti-tumoral activity has been shown in several&#xD;
      pre-clinical pediatric tumor models such as neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma,&#xD;
      retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, ATRT, and acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia. Several HDAC inhibitors are now in Phase I-III clinical trials in&#xD;
      adult patients demonstrating a good safety profile and promising anti-neoplastic activity.&#xD;
      The first of these compounds, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat, Zolinza),&#xD;
      was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      Vorinostat showed linear pharmacokinetics, good oral bioavailability and a broad range of&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in a Phase I clinical trial including 73 adult relapsed tumor patients.&#xD;
      The determined peak plasma levels were in the range of 658±439 ng/ml (corresponding to&#xD;
      2.5±1.7 µM). At these concentrations, anti-tumoral effects on pediatric cancer cells and&#xD;
      leukemias have been documented in vitro. Furthermore, vorinostat passes the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier in mice, thus making it a suitable compound for the treatment of brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to define a dose recommendation of vorinostat in pediatric oncology,&#xD;
      to determine pharmacokinetics of vorinostat in children, determine response rates, safety and&#xD;
      feasibility. The design is an open, multicenter Phase I/II trial. Children and adolescents&#xD;
      (3-18 years) with relapsed or therapy-refractory solid tumor, lymphoma or leukemia following&#xD;
      standard treatment protocols in pediatric oncology will be included. 50 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited over 2 years. Vorinostat will be taken orally once per day on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      and the dose will be escalated until the individual maximum tolerated dose is established.&#xD;
      This dose will then be applied for 3 months, when tumor response will be evaluated. Patients&#xD;
      without progression at first response evaluation will continue treatment for a maximum of 9&#xD;
      months. After end of treatment (EOT) follow-up evaluations will be performed for 3 months.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed in plasma, and in optional cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      samples. Biomarkers (BMP4, IL-6, IL10 induction following Vorinostat treatment, basal histone&#xD;
      acetylation, HDACs and H23B in archived tumor samples) will be determined and correlated with&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>After finding the individual MTD this dose will be applied for 3 months. Patients without progression at first response evaluation will continue treatment for a maximum of 9 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A SDR is defined as the highest dose with no ≥ grade 3 toxicity according to CTC criteria (Dose Limiting Toxicity) in no more than 1/50 patient in this study.&#xD;
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as any grade 3 or 4 toxicity according the CTCAE version 4.0 and judged by the investigator as definitely, probably or possibly related to the study drug.&#xD;
However, all DLTs will be subject to a second assessment by the Coordinating Investigator or a designated person.</description>
