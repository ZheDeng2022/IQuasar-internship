    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) in multiple myeloma (MM) remains a&#xD;
      controversial topic because of a high risk of relapse and a significant transplant-related&#xD;
      mortality (TRM). In an effort to reduce the TRM, most allogeneic transplants in MM are now&#xD;
      performed after reduced-intensity conditioning regimens. In these conditions, TRM usually&#xD;
      range from 10 to 20%. However, reducing the intensity of the conditioning invariably&#xD;
      increases the incidence of relapse to 45 to 60%. As a consequence, post-transplant strategies&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence of relapse after reduced-intensity Allo-SCT should be considered and&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lenalidomide has a significant clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory MM&#xD;
      and in patients relapsing after Allo-SCT. The mechanisms of action involve immunomodulation,&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis activity, direct anti tumor activity and effects on microenvironment. So&#xD;
      far, the experience with lenalidomide after Allo-SCT has been limited to patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease. In such patients, some responses are observed but most of them are&#xD;
      transient with median progression-free survivals of less than one year. Lenalidomide used as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in patients with persistent rather than progressive disease might be a&#xD;
      better approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is interesting in the Allo-SCT setting also because some recent studies focusing&#xD;
      on its immunological properties have suggested that the molecule could stimulate the graft&#xD;
      versus myeloma effect. First, it has been demonstrated in vitro that lenalidomide can inhibit&#xD;
      the proliferation and the suppressor function of regulatory T cells. Secondly, a clinical&#xD;
      study using lenalidomide as salvage therapy after Allo-SCT demonstrated an increase of&#xD;
      activated T cells and NK cells. Finally, a case report described a patient's response to&#xD;
      lenalidomide associated with the development of an acute graft versus host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these data suggest that patients with MM who have a persistent disease after&#xD;
      a reduced-intensity Allo-SCT might benefit from a post-transplant maintenance strategy with&#xD;
      lenalidomide by a direct anti-tumor effect and a stimulation of the graft versus myeloma&#xD;
      effect. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of such a strategy.&#xD;
