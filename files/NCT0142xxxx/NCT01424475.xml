  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is implicated in autosomal dominant Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PKD). An inhibitor for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is in pre-clinical&#xD;
      development for potential use in treating Parkinson's disease. Patients with PKD have&#xD;
      cognitive impairments which develop alongside the typical motor symptoms but a full&#xD;
      characterisation of the neurocognitive phenotype of PKD patients with LRRK2 mutation is&#xD;
      currently lacking. This observational study conducted on a single visit will assess the&#xD;
      phenotypic neurocognitive abnormalities of PKD patients with the LRRK2 mutation with the aim&#xD;
      of identifying potential PD endpoints related to the LRRK2 mutation for future Phase I or II&#xD;
      clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors.&#xD;

      The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is implicated in autosomal dominant Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PKD). An inhibitor for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is in pre-clinical&#xD;

      of identifying potential PD endpoints related to the LRRK2 mutation for future Phase I or II&#xD;
      clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 subjects with PKD bearing one of the known LRRK2 mutations will be&#xD;
      investigated. Approximately 20 healthy subjects without the LRRK2 mutation who are matched&#xD;
      with PKD patients will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects are not expected to be taking medications for PKD. Subjects with PKD may&#xD;
      continue their medications for PKD treatment throughout the study, Testing will take place&#xD;
      within 30 days of screening, depending on the subject's availability.&#xD;
