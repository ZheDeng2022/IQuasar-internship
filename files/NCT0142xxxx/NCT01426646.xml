  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there has been some progress in chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer, no&#xD;
      standard regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy is available, and many clinical trials have&#xD;
      produced contradictory results. The majority of randomized clinical trials studying adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in gastric cancer have been underpowered, involved low-volume centers, or used&#xD;
      ineffective chemotherapy regimens. As a result, well-designed multicenter trials are still&#xD;
      needed. The ACTS-GC trial, which demonstrated the efficacy of S-1 for stage II-III gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients who underwent curative resection with extended lymph-node dissection (D2),&#xD;
      may be valid in countries where D2 surgery is considered the standard of care. S-1 improved&#xD;
      the 3-year overall survival from 70.1% for surgery alone to 80.1%. However, 3-year overall&#xD;
      survival in stage IIIA and stage IIIB patients receiving S-1 were 77.4% and 63.4%,&#xD;
      respectively, which are less satisfactory compared to the rate for stage II (90.7%). Based on&#xD;
      the unsatisfactory outcome among later stage patients in the ACTS-GC adjuvant trial, further&#xD;
      investigation is needed for more effective postoperative treatment of patients with stage&#xD;
      IIIB and IV (M0) cancer. Therefore, the researchers investigated the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy in patient with curatively resected&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

      This controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 on survival compared with&#xD;
      S-1 plus cisplatin. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either surgery followed by&#xD;
      treatment with S-1 plus cisplatin or surgery followed by treatment with S-1 within 42 days&#xD;
      after curative resection. To assess the efficacy, data on recurrence and survival will be&#xD;
      collected from the time of enrollment until 5 years after surgery. To evaluate safety, data&#xD;
      on adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
