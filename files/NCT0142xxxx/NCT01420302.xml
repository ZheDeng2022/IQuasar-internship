  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LOGIC-Insulin computerized software algorithm will be compared with a nurse-directed&#xD;
      protocol, both targeting a blood glucose level of 80-110 mg/dL, in critically ill patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical illness typically causes elevated blood glucose concentrations, which have been&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality. Strictly normalizing these blood glucose levels by&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy, called tight glycemic control, decreased morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in well-controlled single-center clinical studies. However, multi-center pragmatic trials&#xD;
      failed to reproduce those effects, proving that the implementation of tight glycemic control&#xD;
      in daily clinical practice is rather difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computerized algorithm, amongst others, may help the nurses in the titration of insulin to&#xD;
      reach normal blood glucose levels and to avoid the particularly worrisome hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LOGIC-1 study is a single blinded randomized controlled trial. On admission patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either tight glycemic control (80-110 mg/dL) by the computerized&#xD;
      LOGIC-Insulin 3.0 algorithm or to tight glycemic control (80-110 mg/dL) by the nurse-directed&#xD;
      protocol. Written informed consent will be asked from the patient in the case of elective&#xD;
      surgery requiring post-operative ICU-admission. Proxy informed consent from the closest&#xD;
      family member will be asked when the patient was admitted to the ICU in emergency. As blood&#xD;
      glucose control by itself is essential in the management of critical illness, random&#xD;
      allocation will be done on admission and written informed consent from the closest family&#xD;
      member can be deferred to a maximum of 24 hours after randomization. The patient or family&#xD;
      member can at all times withdraw from the trial without impact on his treatment. Allocation&#xD;
      will be done in blocks (block size is unknown to the care givers responsible for treatment&#xD;
      allocation), stratified into cardiac surgery and other reasons for ICU admission, by central&#xD;
      computer randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time window for the study will be 14 days starting from admission to the ICU or when one&#xD;
      of the following stop criteria will be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient starts eating or drinking sugar containing liquids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is discharged from the ICU (including ICU deaths)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Removal of arterial line or central venous line&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the following conditions the study investigator/treating physician will be contacted&#xD;
      and, if necessary, patients will be switched from LOGIC-Insulin to nurse-directed blood&#xD;
      glucose control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrent severe hypoglycemia (&lt;40 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refractory hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any change in condition that compromises the safety of the patient, as judged by the&#xD;
           investigator or treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common strategy for blood glucose control in both groups involves blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements from arterial blood by a blood gas analyzer and the administration of insulin&#xD;
      through a central line with a syringe pump.&#xD;
