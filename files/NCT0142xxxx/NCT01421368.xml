    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of two contraceptive methods and the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of tenofovir 1% gel and the effect&#xD;
      of the contraceptive methods on markers of mucosal safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each woman will be seen in 6 visits and will be contacted by two scheduled follow-up&#xD;
      telephone calls/visits. Volunteers will be consented at Visit 1 and undergo procedures to&#xD;
      assess whether they are eligible to continue in the study. At Visit 2 (cycle days 20-25),&#xD;
      after it has been confirmed that the participant meets all of the inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria, genital samples will be taken and she will be given 2 applicators&#xD;
      of tenofovir 1% gel to insert two hours apart. She will be instructed to return for Visit 3,&#xD;
      approximately 3 or 11 hours after insertion of the second gel, as determined by&#xD;
      randomization. The participant will retain this sampling assignment throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (cycle days 20-25), blood and genital samples will be collected. The participant&#xD;
      will again be given 2 applicators of tenofovir 1% gel to insert two hours apart. She will be&#xD;
      instructed to return approximately 3 or 11 hours after insertion of the second gel for Visit&#xD;
      4 (cycle days 5-10) and blood and genital samples will be taken. The participant will then&#xD;
      start the contraceptive method that she has chosen from the two methods being evaluated in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be contacted about 4-5 weeks after Visit 4 to confirm the next visit&#xD;
      date (Visit 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 will take place about 6 weeks after starting contraception and will not have an&#xD;
      associated gel use. Follow-up genital samples will be collected at Visit 5. The participant&#xD;
      will be given 2 applicators of tenofovir 1% gel to insert two hours apart prior to Visit 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 will take place about 10 weeks after starting contraception. Follow-up blood and&#xD;
      genital samples will be collected approximately 3 or 11 hours after insertion of the second&#xD;
      gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant also will have a follow-up call or visit approximately 1-2 weeks after Visit&#xD;
      6 to confirm that there have been no adverse experiences. If necessary, she may be seen in an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit for follow-up. She will then be exited from the study.&#xD;
