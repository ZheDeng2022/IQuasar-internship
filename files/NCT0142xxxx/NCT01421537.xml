      OVERVIEW:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thromboembolisms represent a serious and feared complication in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several factors make the ICU patient population at increased risk of venous&#xD;
           thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high incidence of thromboembolic events is starting to emerge from recent medical&#xD;
           literature in the burn patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actual guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in burn care patients are based on multiple&#xD;
           non-burn patient trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Burn patient physiology is radically different than that of general ward hospitalized&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since the actual chemical thromboprophylaxis have not been evaluated in the burn&#xD;
           patient, it is of interest to assess their efficacy in patients with severe burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hence, the pharmacokinetic characterization of heparins (a well accepted mode of&#xD;
           thromboprophylaxis) in burn patients could guide future quality of care for this&#xD;
           subclass of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal is based on the conviction that anti-Xa activity of low-molecular-weight&#xD;
      heparins in the burn patients do not correlate with levels described to prevent&#xD;
      thromboembolic events in the general hospitalized population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of low-molecular-weight heparins&#xD;
           (enoxaparin), with anti-Xa levels in severely burned patients receiving&#xD;
           thromboprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the correlation between antithrombotic activity of heparins and the&#xD;
           different metabolic phases of the thermally injured patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has taken a prevalent place in medical literature over the past&#xD;
      decades. In an attempt to decrease its impact on hospitalized patients, multiple trials have&#xD;
      tried to better define its frequency and consequences on a very broad range of patients. The&#xD;
      differences between these sub populations of ill individuals influence greatly the occurrence&#xD;
      of venous thrombotic events (VTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients are predisposed to VTEs. The nature of the disease may have an&#xD;
      important impact on the risk for DVT. Mechanical ventilation, central line placement,&#xD;
      surgery, vasopressors and immobilization are some of the realities of ICU patients. They&#xD;
      contribute to the enhanced chance for thromboembolic complications in this population, either&#xD;
      by venous stasis (immobilization), endothelial injury (surgery…) or hypercoagulability.&#xD;
      Trauma patients represent a subclass of critical care patients with a high incidence of DVT.&#xD;
      It has been evaluated as high as 44,1% even in patients with thrombotic prophylaxis with&#xD;
      low-dose unfractioned heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burn patient are also at increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.&#xD;
      Recent prospective trials in burn patients have described an incidence of thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications in the range of 6 to 60%. Autopsy evaluations are also in favor of an elevated&#xD;
      incidence of thrombotic events in thermally injured patients(37 to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, no trial has evaluated the efficacy of the pharmacologic methods used&#xD;
      for thromboprophylaxis in burned patients. Comparative efficacy between different patient&#xD;
      populations (including thermally injured patients) has never been undertook. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators have to question the adequacy of present thromboprophylactic measures in burn&#xD;
      patients? Are the actual method of DVT and PE prophylaxis sufficient in severe burns?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiology of moderate to severe burns makes us believe it is not. In the early post burn&#xD;
      period, a massive fluid reanimation is initiated. The Starling forces are destabilized in&#xD;
      favor of an increased capillary leak to the interstitial space. The net effect is the&#xD;
      increase in free water in the interstitium and formation of important edema. The distance&#xD;
      between the epithelium and the vascular space is then potentially increased. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      central intravascular compartment of such individuals becomes very difficult to access. This&#xD;
      leads us to reconsider the efficiency of the subcutaneous route. In cases of severe&#xD;
      accumulation of interstitial fluid, can the subcutaneous administration of medications lead&#xD;
      to the desired therapeutic effect?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to compare the levels of anti-Xa levels between 3 patient populations:&#xD;
      severely burned patients (&gt; 20%), medical ICU patients and general medical ward patients.&#xD;
