      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that puts individuals at risk for serious health&#xD;
      problems like heart disease, kidney failure, vision problems, and stroke. A major way that&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes occurs is through insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that insulin&#xD;
      (an important hormone in the body to keep blood sugar normal) isn t working as well as it&#xD;
      should, which can lead to problems with high blood sugar. Insulin resistance has been linked&#xD;
      to mood problems, stress, and depression, especially in women. To determine if group programs&#xD;
      can help reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes, researchers want to look at teenage girls who&#xD;
      are at risk for developing the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether a group program designed to improve mood also can help improve insulin&#xD;
      resistance in teenage girls who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes, or whether a&#xD;
      group program that teaches healthy living skills is just as helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teenage girls between 12 and 17 years of age who are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two screening visits to find out if they are eligible to take&#xD;
           part in the study. The first visit takes about 3 hours and will involve a physical exam,&#xD;
           medical history, questionnaires and an interview about mood problems and possible&#xD;
           depression. The second visit takes about 6 hours and will involve a full body scan to&#xD;
           measure muscle and fat, blood draws and a glucose test to determine insulin resistance,&#xD;
           questionnaires about general well-being and eating habits, eating meals and snacks, and&#xD;
           an exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will join one of two group programs at the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
           One group focuses on learning skills to help with bad moods and stress. The other group&#xD;
           covers topics that are important for teens to lead a healthy life. The groups will meet&#xD;
           for 1 hour once a week for 6 weeks during after-school hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the groups, participants will have three follow-up visits. The first visit&#xD;
           will be 6 weeks later, the second will be 6 months after the start of the group program,&#xD;
           and the third will be 1 year after the start of the group program. Each visit will take&#xD;
           about 6 hours. These visits are similar to the second screening visit before the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have extra tests to study stress at the second screening visit&#xD;
           and the 6-week, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits. Participants will give samples&#xD;
           of DNA, saliva to measure stress hormones, and they will take part in a brief stress&#xD;
           test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The alarming rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      poses an enormous public health burden. Insulin resistance (IR) is a major physiological&#xD;
      precursor to T2D. Depressive symptoms are associated with IR in adolescents and adults,&#xD;
      predict adult-onset T2D, and contribute to increased risk for T2D mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms theoretically induce IR by promoting stress-induced behaviors (altered&#xD;
      eating, lowered fitness) and upregulating physiological stress mechanisms (cortisol, NPY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychotherapy for depression improves IR in adults, but it is unknown if ameliorating&#xD;
      depressive symptoms prevents progression of IR in adolescents at risk for T2D. The aims of&#xD;
      this protocol are: 1) to assess the effects of a 6-week cognitive-behavioral (CB) depression&#xD;
      prevention group (the Blues Program) vs. a 6-week standard-of-care health education (HE)&#xD;
      group on reducing depressive symptoms and improving IR in adolescent girls at risk for T2D;&#xD;
      2) to assess the stress-related behavioral and physiological factors that mediate the&#xD;
      relationship underlying decreases in depressive symptoms and improvements in IR; and 3) to&#xD;
      test if genotypic variation in NPY is related to severity of depressive symptoms and IR and&#xD;
      moderates the efficacy of the CB intervention. The proposed study will permit a rigorous test&#xD;
      of the degree to which depressive symptoms contribute to IR. The Blues Program is brief,&#xD;
      easy-to-administer, cost-effective, and efficacious for reducing depressive symptoms among&#xD;
      adolescent girls. If the Blues Program also improves IR, it would have the potential to have&#xD;
      a major impact on T2D prevention in a considerable subset of youth.&#xD;
