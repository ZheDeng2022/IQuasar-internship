  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find an optimal dose of Imiquimod (IMQ) in the first part (Phase I) and test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the combination treatment of IMQ, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) in patients with skin metastases from breast cancer in the second part&#xD;
      (Phase II). Currently this trial is in its Phase II part.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By harnessing the cytocidal and immunostimulatory properties of two local treatment&#xD;
      modalities, RT and IMQ, an effective, adaptive immune response can be generated, resulting in&#xD;
      systemic control of metastatic breast cancer after local treatment of cutaneous metastases.&#xD;
      Additionally, based on investigators' recent preclinical data, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      estimate in patients with metastatic breast cancer, if the addition of immunomodulatory&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide can increase anti-tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial originally had one treatment arm IMQ/RT(patients were treated with IMQ and RT).&#xD;
      Recent evidence has emerged that the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide (CTX)&#xD;
      increased anti-tumor responses, therefore the IMQ/RT arm is closed and the trial will&#xD;
      continue with two additional cohorts (CTX/IMQ/RT and CTX/RT) which include cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
