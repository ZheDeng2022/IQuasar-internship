      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the treatment groups in the reduction of pain score by at least 30 mm on a&#xD;
      visual pain scale (VAS) at 60 minutes after study medication intake, compared to the baseline&#xD;
      score (obtained before the study medication intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the proportion of patients with more than 50% pain relief, according to the&#xD;
           VAS score at 45 minutes after study medication intake compared to baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the following aspects in the timing of study medication intake:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to the first perception of pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to onset of meaningful pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduction of pain at 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 240 minutes after study medication&#xD;
                intake, to be evaluated as the difference between the scores on VAS in each period&#xD;
                and baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pain according to the five items of Headache Relief Rating - HRR (0:&#xD;
           strong worsening 1: slight worsening 2: no change 3: slight improvement 4: strong&#xD;
           improvement) at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after study medication intake, according to&#xD;
           the diaries completed by the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the proportion of the patients requiring the third tablet of study medication&#xD;
           within 24 hours of starting the study treatment and when it occurred&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check the timing and frequency of rescue medication intake, as well as the proportion&#xD;
           of patients who used these medications within 24 hours of starting the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessment.&#xD;
