  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To facilitate the development of a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      major depression, this study is designed to elaborate the clinical and neurobiological&#xD;
      phenotype of depressed patients with increased inflammation. The data obtained in this&#xD;
      proposal will allow the investigators to test the hypothesis that depression and inflammation&#xD;
      interact to elaborate a relatively discreet phenotype that warrants an individualized&#xD;
      approach to diagnosis and treatment of patients with depression. Moreover, the identification&#xD;
      of specific environmental risk factors for inflammation will foster the elaboration of&#xD;
      preventative strategies for patients at risk.&#xD;

      One hundred and thiry-five patients with major depression diagnosed based on DSM-IV TR&#xD;
      criteria between the ages of 21 and 65 (males, females and minorities) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Forty-five patients with high inflammation as defined by a CRP &gt;3 mg/L will be enrolled along&#xD;
      with 45 depressed patients with medium inflammation (CRP=1-3mg/L) and 45 depressed patients&#xD;
      with low inflammation (CRP&lt;1mg/L) will complete a 2 night inpatient stay in Emory University&#xD;
      Hospital's research unit, the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI).&#xD;
      Participants will undergo psychiatric and neurocognitive assessments, sleep studies and blood&#xD;
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sampling.&#xD;
