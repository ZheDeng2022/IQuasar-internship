  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), most notably polycythemia vera (PV), essential&#xD;
      thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are a diverse but inter-related suite&#xD;
      of clonal disorders of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (Tefferi et al., 2008). The MPN&#xD;
      share a range of biological, pathological, and clinical features including the relative&#xD;
      overproduction of one or more cells of myeloid origin, growth factor independent colony&#xD;
      formation in vitro, marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, spleno- and&#xD;
      hepatomegaly, and thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses (Tefferi et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in&#xD;
      two phases: a dose-escalation phase (Part 1), to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      momelotinib (CYT387), and to identify a therapeutic dose for the expanded cohort; and a&#xD;
      dose-confirmation phase (Part 2), which will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of&#xD;
      momelotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Part I dose-escalation phase of the study, subjects will be assigned to dose levels in&#xD;
      successive cohorts starting with a dose in the first cohort of 200 mg BID (twice daily with&#xD;
      doses taken approximately 12 hours apart). Doses will be escalated by 50 mg BID per cohort&#xD;
      until dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose level at which ≥2 of 6 subjects develop&#xD;
      a first cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the DLT level. The maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below the DLT level. New dose levels may begin&#xD;
      accrual only if all subjects at the current dose level have been observed for a minimum of 28&#xD;
      days from the first day of treatment. The dose level chosen for study in the dose&#xD;
      confirmation phase of the study will be the MTD or a lower dose shown to have significant&#xD;
      clinical activity (efficacy) as determined by the safety review committee. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated weekly for the first cycle, every 2 weeks during cycle 2, then monthly for 4 cycles&#xD;
      for a total of 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-confirmation phase of the study, approximately fifty (50) subjects will be&#xD;
      treated at the MTD or at a lower dose shown to have significant clinical activity (efficacy)&#xD;
      as chosen by the Safety Review Committee. In the dose confirmation phase of the study&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks during the first treatment cycle, and then monthly&#xD;
      for 5 cycles for a total of 6 cycles.&#xD;
