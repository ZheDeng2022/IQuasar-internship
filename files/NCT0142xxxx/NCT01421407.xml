  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),&#xD;
      including those who are undergoing long-term haemodialysis treatment. sHPT is characterized&#xD;
      by persistently elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and major disturbances in&#xD;
      phosphorus and calcium metabolism. When glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls, the&#xD;
      phosphorus clearance decreases significantly, leading to phosphorus retention. The resulting&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia is thought to be one of the principal causes of secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism which is a very early complication of patients with CKD. Its diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment is crucial in the management of such patients.The treatment of the sHPT of&#xD;
      CKD's patient includes dietary phosphate restriction, the use of phosphate binders,&#xD;
      correction of hypocalcaemia, the use of vitamin D and its derivatives. The calcimimetic agent&#xD;
      cinacalcet hydrochloride may be also used in combination with vitamin D. While the majority&#xD;
      of patients can be controlled in this way, medical therapy is not always successful in&#xD;
      achieving adequate control of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Oral medications (calcimimetics,&#xD;
      recently developed phosphate binders, and active vitamin D derivatives amount to very high&#xD;
      monthly costs, and have efficacy limitations as well as side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU may become a valuable alternative treatment that help control secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism in selected patients presenting with enlarged parathyroid gland(s)&#xD;
      visible at ultrasonography,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIFU treatment in chronic&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism presenting with enlarged&#xD;
      parathyroid gland(s) which are visible at ultrasonography and for whom medical therapy has&#xD;
      been unsuccessful.&#xD;
