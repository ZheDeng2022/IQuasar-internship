  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OPB-51602 is safe and tolerable when given&#xD;
      daily by mouth to subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on data that support a role for the signal transducer and activator of&#xD;
      transcription (STAT) family of proteins in oncogenesis. One of the mechanisms of action of&#xD;
      OPB-51602 includes inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Therefore OPB-51602 is expected to be&#xD;
      active as an anti-cancer drug. This first-in-human study will characterize the safety profile&#xD;
      of OPB-51602, evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OPB-51602, identify a recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose, and obtain preliminary efficacy data, in subjects with advanced cancers for whom there&#xD;
      is no standard treatment available.&#xD;
