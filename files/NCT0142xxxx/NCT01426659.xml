      The preterm children have more difficulty minor neurological developmental than the general&#xD;
      population even without cerebral palsy. Their oral language difficulties of language and&#xD;
      writing have been little studied. The investigators propose to study spoken language has 3&#xD;
      years 1/2 and stimulate or not (depending on randomization) children with phonological&#xD;
      weaknesses notemment language. The investigators will evaluate stimulation protocol implied&#xD;
      short and precise language in a re-education &quot;say and do&quot; in 20 sessions. A new evaluation of&#xD;
      language (BILO and N-EEL), sensorimotor and cognitive constraints (KABC) will be performed at&#xD;
      4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early intervention on the basis of precise language before closing the window developmental&#xD;
      (&lt;5 years) is expected to improve as a result of language and cognitive development of&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very premature babies born before 32 weeks gestation have developmental problems more&#xD;
      important than the rest of the population. The study reported 40% Epipage neuromotor&#xD;
      difficulties of varying severity. Children with cerebral palsy are down 9% to 6%. However the&#xD;
      rate of minor neurological problems and school failure is increasing. Neurocognitive&#xD;
      difficulties are many, visuospatial dyspraxia, attention disorders, language impairment. The&#xD;
      latter is fairly described in the literature and seems often seen in this population in&#xD;
      relation to overall cognitive difficulties. Cognitive assessments of the overall K-ABC of&#xD;
      former premature study Epipage are nevertheless often normal. Oral language is fundamental to&#xD;
      the written language and learning at school and follows a mature development stages according&#xD;
      to specific sensorimotor well known. The investigators hypothesize that minor sensorimotor&#xD;
      disorders in the population of premature infants without CP can change structurally and early&#xD;
      oral language, including phonology. Accurate assessment of the components of language at 3&#xD;
      years of premature children without CP or neurosensory disorder found (blindness, deafness)&#xD;
      has already allowed us to observe weaknesses in the structural components of language. These&#xD;
      early failures may correspond to a particular neurological architecture of language observed&#xD;
      in functional MRI in the same population of children aged 8 and 12 years (Schaer 2009,&#xD;
      Petterson 2002) and may be sensitive to a specific stimulation early before the developmental&#xD;
      window architecture of the spoken language is closed (Newport 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the interest of accurate and early stimulation implied short (&quot;say and&#xD;
      do&quot;) on areas of weakness in the language 3ans1 / 2 of the former preterm infants without CP&#xD;
      spotted by BILO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This is a prevention trial national, multicenter, prospective randomized two arms. In&#xD;
      this study, 296 patients with premature frailty of oral language without CP, with or without&#xD;
      minor neurological disorder, and without proven pathology of oral language will be included&#xD;
      in 5 hospitals and will be randomized to receive or not a specific stimulation (say and do &quot;&#xD;
      ). The assessment of oral language by a Computerized Assessment BILO1 (Khomsa 2008) Â½ to 3&#xD;
      years will be offered to all parents of children with CP followed without neurosensory&#xD;
      disorder or current fact. After obtaining consent, and results BILO, directed by a therapist&#xD;
      trained in order to define the criteria for frailty, randomization will be done centrally.&#xD;
      Early stimulation precise and short (20 therapy sessions per week) on these areas of&#xD;
      weaknesses of language drive will be compared to the absence of specific stimulation.&#xD;
      Evaluation at 6 months results will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion is scheduled 24 months for the inclusion of patients with results defining areas of&#xD;
      weakness in BILO1dans one of the components of language: an item &lt;10th percentile and / or&#xD;
      two items &lt;25th percentile). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluding children with pathological scores BILO1 (&lt;3rd percentile for at least one&#xD;
      criterion) will not be included Primary endpoint: difference from baseline and after six&#xD;
      months of phonology BILO score (score from 0 to 16 listed) Number of subjects and statistical&#xD;
      power: 170 children a year born very preterm live out the CHU of Rouen. One hundred are&#xD;
      followed and accept the studies conducted in the service as in other centers who collaborated&#xD;
      in the study EPIPAGE (Lancet 2008). According to our preliminary work half the present&#xD;
      language problems at 3 years. Thus, 50 children per year would be candidates for the study&#xD;
      but 10% are pathological oral language and therefore excluded from the study. 296 children&#xD;
      were included in five centers and according to their follow-up rate according to these&#xD;
      proportions. Three centers have follow-up of very preterm and 80/an a regional 30/an.&#xD;
      According to preliminary data, and assuming a moderate correlation of 0.5 between BILO scores&#xD;
      at baseline and after six months, the standard deviation of the primary endpoint was 4.7&#xD;
      units of phonology BILO score. Thus, to test the risk of first kind of b = 5% in bilateral&#xD;
      formulation, the total of 296 children included and evaluated (or 148 children per group) to&#xD;
      detect with a statistical power of 90%, size effect of 0.379, a difference of 1.8 units&#xD;
      average score BILO groupes. Ainsi between the two, the number chosen to detect with a high&#xD;
      power low difference between the two groups for the primary .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The means of the primary endpoint will be compared between groups by&#xD;
      one-tailed t test at the usual 5%. This test will be completed by comparing adjusted based on&#xD;
      multiple linear regression model taking into account possible prognostic factors (duration of&#xD;
      gestation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurological disorders minors, socio-economic status&#xD;
      ...), the center and the initial value ( to 3 years) score phonology. The difference in means&#xD;
      between two groups and its confidence interval 95% will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outlook: Creating a cohort followed to analyze the impact of early stimulation specific to&#xD;
      the age of 6 and assess our level of prevention of disorders of oral and written language.&#xD;
