      The purpose of this study is determine if high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves&#xD;
      clinical outcomes related to lung function and immunity in patients with Cystic Fibrosis who&#xD;
      are admitted to the hospital with an acute lung infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have a shorter life span than the general population due&#xD;
      to complications with lung infections, which eventually progress to lung failure. New&#xD;
      research has suggested that high levels of vitamin D may be protective against lung&#xD;
      infections and may promote the action of anti-bacterial proteins needed to ward off&#xD;
      infections. Research has also suggested that high vitamin D levels are linked to lower&#xD;
      mortality rates; however these hypotheses have not been adequately studied in patients with&#xD;
      CF. An investigation of the effects of vitamin D supplementation is of particular interest in&#xD;
      this population because patients with CF generally have high rates of vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
      The investigators have preliminary data from a previous study suggesting that vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in patients with CF lowers markers of inflammation, promotes anti-bacterial&#xD;
      proteins, and reduces mortality. In this proposed multi-center study the investigators will&#xD;
      examine the effects of a high dose vitamin D supplementation on patients with CF who are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for lung infection. The investigators will use a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial design to determine if mortality and infection rates over 1 year are&#xD;
      reduced in patients who receive the high-dose vitamin D supplementation compared to those who&#xD;
      receive placebo. The investigators will also determine if vitamin D affects markers of&#xD;
      inflammation and anti-bacterial proteins, as well as CF-related clinical outcomes, such as&#xD;
      lung function. The investigators plan to recruit 280 adults and adolescents with CF (ages &gt;&#xD;
      16yrs), with approximately 150 subjects recruited at Emory (Emory University Hospital and&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta). Participants will initially be seen by the study&#xD;
      researchers during the first week of in-patient hospitalization, and they will be followed&#xD;
      over the course of one year during their regularly-scheduled out-patient CF clinic visits.&#xD;
      The treatment group will receive an initial oral bolus dose of 250,000 IU vitamin D, and at 3&#xD;
      months follow-up they will receive 50,000 IU vitamin D every other week. Current CF&#xD;
      Guidelines for vitamin D supplementation recommend a daily intake of 800 IU of vitamin D per&#xD;
      day, therefore in addition to the vitamin D or placebo they receive at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and at 3 months, all participants will receive 800 IU of vitamin D daily. If our&#xD;
      hypotheses are correct, this study has potential for reducing infection and promoting&#xD;
      survival in patients with CF using vitamin D, a relatively inexpensive supplement.&#xD;
