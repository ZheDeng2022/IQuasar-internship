  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the trochanter in the elderly have a terrible prognosis both vital and&#xD;
      functional. It is certainly possible to reduce the medical and economic impact of this&#xD;
      disease by reducing surgical trauma, by means of minimally invasive osteosynthesis material&#xD;
      adapted to this approach. This minimally invasive approach should, however, guarantee a&#xD;
      result at least equal to the standard approach. The goal is to have a technique, easily to&#xD;
      transmit, using a percutaneous approach, but which may be converted to conventional surgery&#xD;
      in case of difficulty, and with implants appropriate for trochanteric fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, the dynamic hip screw MISS® (Minimally Invasive Screw System) was&#xD;
      developed and has already demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of anatomical results. It&#xD;
      is as effective than the PHS® hip screw design for standard approach. The two implants have&#xD;
      the same plate and screw and differ only by the system for fixing the screw on the plate to&#xD;
      allow minimal invasive approach.&#xD;

      Fractures of the trochanter in the elderly have a terrible prognosis both vital and&#xD;
      functional. It is certainly possible to reduce the medical and economic impact of this&#xD;
      disease by reducing surgical trauma, by means of minimally invasive osteosynthesis material&#xD;
      adapted to this approach. This minimally invasive approach should, however, guarantee a&#xD;
      result at least equal to the standard approach. The goal is to have a technique, easily to&#xD;
      transmit, using a percutaneous approach, but which may be converted to conventional surgery&#xD;
      in case of difficulty, and with implants appropriate for trochanteric fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, the dynamic hip screw MISS® (Minimally Invasive Screw System) was&#xD;
      developed and has already demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of anatomical results. It&#xD;
      is as effective than the PHS® hip screw design for standard approach. The two implants have&#xD;
      the same plate and screw and differ only by the system for fixing the screw on the plate to&#xD;
      allow minimal invasive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to show that the use of dynamic hip screw MISS is&#xD;
      associated with lower morbidity (in terms of bleeding) in comparison with the material PHS&#xD;
      standard (Pertrochanteric Hip Screw) implanted by standard approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the quality of reduction and stability of osteosynthesis with the MISS are&#xD;
           equivalent to those of the PHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the economic impact on the duration of use of operating rooms and the length&#xD;
           of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized trial with multicenter parallel group with collection of blinded&#xD;
      endpoint : PROBE Study (Prospective Randomized Blinded Endpoint), comparing two techniques :&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach versus standard approach, Apart from the incision, and the system&#xD;
      fixing the screw to the plate, all other periods of the operation will be identical.&#xD;
      Operation is done on table fracture with X-rays control with C arm. Associated therapies will&#xD;
      be identical in both groups and follow the protocols of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients : 54 in each group = 108 patients Duration of the research Duration of the&#xD;
      inclusion period: 21 months Duration of participation for each patient: three months Total&#xD;
      duration of the study: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected effects :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients: intervention better supported, postoperative more simple, shortened length of&#xD;
      stay and faster rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the hospital: intervention shorter and simpler, lower occupation time of block, decreased&#xD;
      average length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For society: reduced cost of care of these patients by society&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome measure :&#xD;
It is defined by the perioperative blood loss which is assessed between day 0 and day 5 by the following formula:&#xD;
PBL = BVT x ΔHt + 150 x PRBC where: PBL = Perioperative Blood Loss (mL) between day 0 and day 5 BVT = Blood Volume Theorical (mL) = 70ml/kg humans, 65ml/kg in non-obese women ΔHt = (preoperative hematocrit at D0) - (Hct on day 5 postoperative) 150 (ml) = average volume of unit of Packed Red Blood Cells PRBC = number of Packed Red Blood Cells administered to the patient</description>
