      This study aims to determine the causal relationship between regulating urine pH levels&#xD;
      between 7.0 and 7.5 and decreasing chronic joint pain. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      maintenance of an alkaline urinary pH will result in a decrease in personally reported levels&#xD;
      of chronic joint pain using a citrate treatment regimen.&#xD;

      STUDY SYNOPSIS / Literature Review Inflammation is a local immune response to injury,&#xD;
      infection and foreign molecules. Notwithstanding the provoking cause, inflammation is thought&#xD;
      to have evolved as an adaptive response for restoring tissue homeostasis. The local&#xD;
      inflammatory response causes acidosis and pain has been associated with induced acidosis of&#xD;
      various origins - diet, injury, exercise, stress, medications, disease state or aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases are major causes of chronic pain. In general,&#xD;
      inflammatory causes (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, RA) are more common in younger individuals,&#xD;
      while degenerative causes (e.g. osteoarthritis, OA) are more often seen in the elderly&#xD;
      [Schaible et al, 2009]. Pain perception is extremely complex and a perceived connection has&#xD;
      been noted between the level of pain felt by individuals and bodily fluid hydrogen ion&#xD;
      concentration, i.e. pH; oral water-soluble alkaline components containing K, Ca, Mg and Cl&#xD;
      salts have been used for reducing bodily fluid and tissue acid concentrations. Urine pH is&#xD;
      now considered to reflect the bodily acid-base balance and is directly related to the dietary&#xD;
      acid-base load [Welch et al, 2008].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, potassium citrate (Kcit, 45-60 mEq daily) has been widely used in urology for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with uric acid and cystine stones [Sterrett et al, 2008; Spivacow et&#xD;
      al, 2010]. Aside from the use of Kcit in the treatment of kidney stones, there have been&#xD;
      isolated reports about the anti-inflammatory and hypoalgesic systems effects of Kcit.&#xD;
      Alkalinization by diet alone has also been effective for removing uric acid from the body,&#xD;
      though its effects on urine pH levels are weaker [Kanbara, Hakoda &amp; Seyama, 2010]. It is&#xD;
      considered that alkalinization of urine reflects body fluid alkalinization. This has the&#xD;
      perceived effects of increased bone density, improved muscle function, and a speculative&#xD;
      decrease in insulin resistance [Pizzorno, Frassetto &amp; Katzinger, 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Project Question/Theme The investigators aim to determine causal relationship&#xD;
      between regulating urine pH levels between 7.0 and 7.5 and decreasing chronic joint pain. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that maintenance of an alkaline urinary pH will result in a&#xD;
      decrease in personally reported levels of chronic joint pain using a citrate treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from local physician's practices, primarily at TTUHSC clinics, by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and the Co-Investigators. Subjects who report a presence of joint&#xD;
      pain for more than six months, and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be eligible&#xD;
      for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored by the Principal Investigator and&#xD;
      Co-Investigators, and reported by the Study Coordinator to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects for the study will be identified by the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators&#xD;
      from local TTUHSC clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the subject agrees to participate and informed consent has been given, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will explain the study procedures and baseline measurements will be assessed&#xD;
      using diagnostic imaging and lab testing. All subjects will be asked to obtain and/or provide&#xD;
      a copy of recent X-rays or an MRI of the affected joint and lab tests (CBC, liver and kidney&#xD;
      panels). Images and tests must be recent and taken within the past 6 months of enrollment in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline measurements have been established, instructions on the urine&#xD;
      alkalinization treatment regimen will be distributed to the subject and treatment solution&#xD;
      will be obtained. This treatment will vary from person to person and is easily modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will measure, report, and take the treatment for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on the treatment, all subjects will be asked to report and/or measure the following&#xD;
      values on a daily basis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report when and how much treatment was taken that day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure urine pH levels daily at 10 A.M. using a pH strip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate their pain 3X daily using a modified pain rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report daily food and beverage intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the physician investigator for monthly a follow-up visit to review the pain&#xD;
           ratings and pH values noted during the past month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the SAS System, the investigators calculated the minimum number of enrolled subjects&#xD;
      that is required to achieve statistical results is 21. The investigators estimated that a&#xD;
      minimum number of 16 subjects must complete the study in order to achieve sufficient,&#xD;
      statistically powerful results. In order to ensure successful completion of the statistical&#xD;
      data analysis, the investigators decided to enroll twice the minimum number of subjects&#xD;
      required (16x2) and will enroll a total of 32 subjects.&#xD;
