      This study will determine the following: the response rate (including pathological CR rate),&#xD;
      TTP, and complications of treatment in patients with rectal cancer treated with FOLFOX&#xD;
      bevacizumab, the alteration of tumor blood flow (assessed by DCE-MRI as percentage change in&#xD;
      Ktrans) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab therapy compared to baseline value in patients treated&#xD;
      with FOLFOX alone and those treated with bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg., the degree of hypoxis&#xD;
      (measured by tumor uptake of the 2-nitroimidazole EF5) induced by bevacizumab treatment and&#xD;
      its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow, and the degree of apoptosis (measured by&#xD;
      tumor uptake of di-annexin V) induced by bevacizumab treatment and its relationship to&#xD;
      changes in tumor blood flow.&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this study will determine the following: the response rate&#xD;
      (including pathological CR rate), TTP, and complications of treatment in patients with rectal&#xD;
      cancer treated with FOLFOX bevacizumab, the alteration of tumor blood flow (assessed by&#xD;
      DCE-MRI as percentage change in Ktrans) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab therapy compared to&#xD;
      baseline value in patients treated with FOLFOX alone and those treated with bevacizumab at 5&#xD;
      mg/kg., the degree of hypoxis (measured by tumor uptake of the 2-nitroimidazole EF5) induced&#xD;
      by bevacizumab treatment and its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow, and the degree&#xD;
      of apoptosis (measured by tumor uptake of di-annexin V) induced by bevacizumab treatment and&#xD;
      its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow. The secondary objectives of this study is to&#xD;
      determine in an exploratory fashion the relationship between tumor blood flow, hypoxia&#xD;
      induction, and apoptosis induction , and time to progression in patients continuing on to&#xD;
      receive Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, to analyze archival tumor from the patients treated in this&#xD;
      trial for mutations in the MKK7 and SEK1 genes, and by semi-quantitative IHC for these and&#xD;
      other relevant proteins, to determine the relationship between vascular proliferation as&#xD;
      measured by DCE-MRI and markers of endothelial cell proliferation, and to obtain pilot data&#xD;
      on whether assays that measure vascular endothelial cell mitogenic stimulation and mitogenic&#xD;
      activity may predict response to therapy, time to progression and overall survival in&#xD;
      patients receiving bevacizumab 5 mg/kg.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically documented advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             the rectum, T3 or T4, N any, M0 or M1. Patients must have available and identified&#xD;
             tissue for immunohistochemical analysis and agree to submit it for the correlative&#xD;
             endpoints. When available, formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded tissue from previous&#xD;
             biopsy or surgical resection will suffice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must measurable disease as defined by the RECIST criteria as at least one&#xD;
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to&#xD;
             be recorded) as ≥ 20mm with conventional techniques on either CT, MRI, or EUS. marker&#xD;
             (CEA) elevation alone is in sufficient for entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had prior adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. The prior treatment&#xD;
             regimen must not have included bevacizumab but may have included oxaliplatin and the&#xD;
             last dose of chemotherapy must have been &gt; 6 months prior to study entry. Patients&#xD;
             with prior radiotherapy are acceptable. It must be at least 2 weeks since&#xD;
