    <description>Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate is administered on Day 0 and Day 7 (+/- 2 days). If the treating ophthalmologist notes any leakage from CNV in the study eye on a fluorescein angiography during the study or an increase in subretinal fluid on an optical coherence tomography measurement, retreatment with Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate is recommended with up to 3 additional treatments. The retreatment visit(s) could occur during a scheduled visit or at an additional visit 1 week after a regular study visit. A post-retreatment follow-up visit is necessary.</description>
