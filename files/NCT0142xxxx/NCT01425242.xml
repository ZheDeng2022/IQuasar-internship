  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the blood vessel plays an important role in the development and growth of a&#xD;
      dilated abdominal aorta. An elevated blood pressure leads to an increase in inflammation,&#xD;
      therefore blood pressure lowering is an important part of the treatment of patients with a&#xD;
      dilated abdominal aorta who also have an elevated blood pressure. In the investigators study&#xD;
      the investigators compare the anti-inflammatory effects of 2 different blood pressure&#xD;
      lowering strategies. The investigators hypothesize that both strategies will decrease&#xD;
      inflammation, however the investigators believe the total decrease of inflammation depends on&#xD;
      the type of blood pressure lowering medication used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy of small AAAs currently consists of &quot;watchful waiting&quot; strategy with&#xD;
      aggressive blood pressure control &quot;Watchful waiting&quot; includes an Ultrasound (more recently CT&#xD;
      or MRI scan) every 12 months (for AAAs between 3.5 - 4.4 cm) or every 6 months (for AAAs&#xD;
      between 4.5 and 5.5 cm) to observe. A growth rate of &gt;7 mm/ 6 months has been suggested as a&#xD;
      threshold for proceeding to aneurysm repair irrespective of aneurysm size. Clearly, there is&#xD;
      need for a more sensitive method to evaluate the progress of AAA growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications have shown that evaluation of AAAs using FDG-uptake with PET-scan may&#xD;
      identify small AAAs that are more prone to grow and/or rupture, as these AAAs as compared to&#xD;
      normal aorta's show increased inflammatory activity , which is considered the major&#xD;
      pathophysiological pathway. Evaluation of FDG-uptake is also sensitive enough to observe the&#xD;
      short-term effects of endovascular intervention of large AAAs, as unpublished data show a&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction in aneurismal FDG-uptake only 6 weeks after endovascular&#xD;
      repair of large AAAs. Therefore, the change in aneurismal FDG-uptake may also be a very&#xD;
      promising and sensitive method to evaluate treatment effects of medical interventions within&#xD;
      a relatively short period of time (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just as pressure unloading may represent an anti-inflammatory mechanism in endovascular&#xD;
      repair of more advanced aneurysms, so may milder pressure unloading in moderately&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals with smaller aneurysms display similar anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
      Such a mild form of pressure unloading may be attainable with adequate anti-hypertensive drug&#xD;
      therapy. In this context, however, a possible additional benefit may be that some&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drug classes have been proposed to exert specific anti-inflammatory effects&#xD;
      relevant to aneurysm inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local activation of multiple components of the renin angiotensin system has been implicated&#xD;
      in both the development of aneurysms, as well as in their inflammatory component. In&#xD;
      accordance, preliminary evidence from murine studies suggest that ACE inhibitors, for&#xD;
      example, may reduce inflammatory activity in aneurysmatic vessel walls. However, since ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors block the renin angiotensin system halfway it's path, and non-ACE conversion of&#xD;
      angiotensin I occurs, a rationale exists to block the renin angiotensin system upstream of&#xD;
      ACE. Upstream blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may have additional advantages in&#xD;
      antagonising direct pro-inflammatory effects of renin itself, which have been identified in,&#xD;
      for example, kidney tissue and retinal microvessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case can thus be made for renin inhibition as a potential optimal strategy for reducing&#xD;
      aneurysm inflammation in hypertensive patients with aortic aneurysms. In the proposed pilot&#xD;
      trial, the direct renin inhibitor Aliskiren will be evaluated. As a control condition, an&#xD;
      antihypertensive agent without postulated specific anti-inflammatory effects is appropriate.&#xD;
      Calcium channel blockers represent such a class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will explore what the size and variability of the effect of aliskiren&#xD;
      monotherapy, the combination of aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine monotherapy, or the&#xD;
      combination of amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide on FDG-uptake is (if at all measurable on top&#xD;
      of the effect of antihypertensive and statin therapy). This will allow more accurate power&#xD;
      calculation of larger future studies aiming at prevention of AAA-progression (diameter and&#xD;
      rupture).&#xD;
