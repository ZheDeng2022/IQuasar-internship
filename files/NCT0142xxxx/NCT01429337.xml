  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international study was to assess the effect of varying degrees of&#xD;
      impaired hepatic function compared to a normal hepatic function (Child-Pugh classification)&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetics and safety of midostaurin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midostaurin was developed for the treatment of patients with hematological and&#xD;
      nonhematological malignancies. However, disease complications and various co-medications made&#xD;
      it difficult to perform a hepatic impairment study in the targeted patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolism and elimination of midostaurin predominantly occurs in the liver. Patients with&#xD;
      impaired hepatic function may have a higher risk to have a decreased elimination or&#xD;
      metabolism of midostaurin which may lead to increased systemic exposure or toxicity, hence&#xD;
      understanding the impact of an impaired hepatic function on midostaurin PK is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cumulative safety data from over 900 subjects exposed to midostaurin showed that the drug was&#xD;
      well tolerated in patients and in healthy subjects, thus, it was appropriate and justifiable&#xD;
      to study midostaurin in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the difficulty in enrolling subjects with severe hepatic impairment, an interim&#xD;
      analysis was performed when all mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects, and the&#xD;
      respective control subjects, had completed the trial, in order to obtain interim results on&#xD;
      the PK and safety of midostaurin in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The&#xD;
      protocol was amended in April 2018 to make the inclusion / exclusion criteria more fitting&#xD;
      with enrolling the severe hepatic impairment group. The final study analysis was performed&#xD;
      when all severe hepatic impaired subjects, and the matching controls, had completed the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
