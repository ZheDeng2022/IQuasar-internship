  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that commercial air travel causes an increase in the blood pressure&#xD;
      in the lungs (pulmonary artery pressure) that can be clinically relevant. Portable&#xD;
      echocardiography (heart ultrasound) now offers a non-invasive means of studying this&#xD;
      in-flight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a commercial airliner flying at high altitude, the reduced cabin air pressure means that&#xD;
      all passengers are exposed to slightly lowered oxygen levels ('hypoxia') equivalent to an&#xD;
      altitude of approximately 5,000 to 8,000 ft. Although mild, this hypoxia is sufficient to&#xD;
      stimulate some of the body's protective responses (eg changes in breathing and in hormonal&#xD;
      secretion) and can be dangerous for passengers with heart or lung disease, who must breathe&#xD;
      supplementary oxygen in-flight or may even be prohibited from flying because of the risks of&#xD;
      hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that severe hypoxia results in constriction of blood vessels in the lungs (a&#xD;
      phenomenon called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction), which in turn causes an increase in&#xD;
      the blood pressure in the lungs ('pulmonary arterial pressure'). Unlike other physiological&#xD;
      responses to hypoxia, this is often harmful and frequently leads to pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      and right heart failure (eg in some lung diseases and at high altitude). Even a modest&#xD;
      increase in pulmonary arterial pressure could be clinically important in some airline&#xD;
      passengers with heart/lung disease, as it may exacerbate their condition. However, it is not&#xD;
      known whether the mild hypoxia experienced in an aircraft cabin is able to cause an increase&#xD;
      in pulmonary artery pressure. Limited evidence suggests that it might - for example, there&#xD;
      have been reports of passengers acutely developing new right heart failure in-flight, and&#xD;
      data from animal studies also support this possibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to establish the effect of mild aircraft cabin hypoxia on pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure in healthy passengers and also in a patient with Chuvash polycythaemia. In this rare&#xD;
      genetic disease, cellular responses to hypoxia are 'switched on' to some extent even during&#xD;
      normoxia, causing increased red blood cell production. Affected individuals usually present&#xD;
      with symptoms of polycythaemia in early adulthood and are typically asymptomatic following&#xD;
      treatment with therapeutic venesection. Importantly, affected individuals have exaggerated&#xD;
      acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction which may place them at risk of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertensive responses during air travel.&#xD;
