  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases is increasing worldwide. Infections and&#xD;
      vaccinations in childhood may have an impact on the subsequent development of asthma and&#xD;
      allergy. In Guinea-Bissau, the investigators previously found that Bacille Calmette-Guérin&#xD;
      (BCG) vaccine was associated with reduction in atopy. Since then the investigators have&#xD;
      conducted a randomised trial of BCG vaccine given at birth to low birth-weight infants. The&#xD;
      present study aims to follow up children enrolled in the BCG randomised trial to assess for&#xD;
      asthma and allergy later in childhood. Based on previous observations, the investigators&#xD;
      expect children allocated to receive BCG at birth will have a reduction in allergy profile&#xD;
      when compared to children who did not receive BCG at birth.&#xD;

      Background: Prevalence of asthma and allergy is increasing worldwide, and the cause is&#xD;
      unclear. Previous work by the Bandim Health Project and others has identified that infections&#xD;
      and routine childhood vaccinations have an impact on the development of atopic sensitisation&#xD;
      and allergic symptoms later in life. A number of these studies have found association between&#xD;
      BCG vaccination and reduction in atopy and allergy. Only one randomised trial has been&#xD;
      conducted of BCG vaccine to protect against allergy with inconclusive results. The present&#xD;
      project provides the opportunity to follow-up children born low birth-weight who were&#xD;
      randomised to receive BCG vaccine at birth or to receive BCG later in infancy as part of&#xD;
      regular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children given BCG vaccine at birth will have reduced prevalence of positive skin-prick&#xD;
           test and allergic symptoms when compared with children who did not receive BCG at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early BCG vaccination will be associated with reduced prevalence of positive skin prick&#xD;
           test and allergic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early DTP vaccination will be associated with increased prevalence of positive&#xD;
           skin-prick tests and allergic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the effects of environmental factors, including BCG, DTP and measles&#xD;
           vaccines, on atopy (determined by skin-prick tests) and symptoms of asthma, eczema and&#xD;
           food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the sex-differential effects of vaccination on atopy and allergic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the association between faecal microbial diversity, atopy and food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: children previously enrolled in NCT00146302 will followed up at home (currently aged&#xD;
      3-9 years) and tested for atopic sensitisation with skin-prick tests and presence of allergic&#xD;
      symptoms determined by questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 812 children from the Bandim Health Project study area were enrolled in the&#xD;
      randomised trial. The investigators anticipate to be able to follow up approximately 487 of&#xD;
      these children, which will have the power to detect a 30% difference in atopic sensitisation&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
