      This is a randomized, single-center, partial-blind study to evaluate the dermal irritation&#xD;
      potential and to detect photo-toxicity and photo-allergy potential of GSK2585823, Benzoyl&#xD;
      peroxide BPO 5% gel, Benzoyl peroxide 3% gel, vehicle gel and negative control (distilled&#xD;
      water) applied using Finn-Chambers® by single and 7-day repeat patch test in 20 Japanese&#xD;
      healthy male and female volunteers. Finn-Chambers containing no investigational product will&#xD;
      be applied in the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will also be assessed by measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms, safety&#xD;
      laboratory data and review of adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subjects will be applied the adequate amount of GSK2585823, Benzoyl peroxide 3%, Benzoyl&#xD;
      peroxide 5%, placebo (Vehicle) and negative control (distilled water) using Finn Chambers on&#xD;
      Scanpor (the tape for the patch test which Finn Chamber® put on the Scanpor® tape in advance)&#xD;
      on their upper back at same time for the simple patch test and the photo patch test. The&#xD;
      empty Finn Chamber® will also be applied at the same time. The position of application for&#xD;
      each product (including empty Finn Chamber®) will be randomized The position of application&#xD;
      for each subjects will be same for the simple patch test and the photo patch test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the simple patch test, dermal condition will be assessed up to 48 hours after removal of&#xD;
      the Finn-Chambers®. After removing the Finn-Chambers®, the skin areas will be gently wiped&#xD;
      with wet absorbent cotton before the first evaluation at 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the photo patch test, two sets of Finn-Chambers® will be applied to the skin. Twenty-four&#xD;
      hours after the single application or the last application of the repeat dosing, a set of&#xD;
      Finn-Chambers® will be removed. The skin areas will be gently wiped and exposed to 6.0 J/cm2&#xD;
      of ultraviolet A. The other set of Finn-Chambers® are covered to avoid ultraviolet A exposure&#xD;
      to serve as un-irradiated control when photo-allergy is assessed 30 minutes after ultraviolet&#xD;
      A exposure. After the assessment, the skin areas will be covered with empty Finn-Chambers®&#xD;
      for additional 24 hours to prevent further exposure to light. Photo-toxicity will be assessed&#xD;
      24 and 48 hours after the ultraviolet A exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Simple Patch test&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dermatologist will examine the planned application sites and skin reactions at the&#xD;
           application sites, and make assessments at the following time points according to the&#xD;
           criteria proposed by the patch test study group in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           &lt;Single application phase&gt; Day 1: just before application Day 3: 30 minutes after&#xD;
           removal of study medication (48.5 hours after application) Day 4: 24 hours after removal&#xD;
           of study medication (72 hours after application) &lt;Repeat application phase&gt; Day 5: just&#xD;
           before application Days 6-11: every 24 hours (30 minutes after removal; about 23.5 hours&#xD;
           after application). This result will be used only for safety assessment and not for&#xD;
           calculation of irritation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Day 12: 30 minutes after removal of last study medication (24.5 hours after the last&#xD;
           application) Day 13: 24 hours after removal of last study medication (48 hours after the&#xD;
           last application) Day 14: 48 hours after removal of last study medication (72 hours&#xD;
           after the last application)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment Criteria Proposed by Patch Test Study Group in Japan No visible reaction(-);&#xD;
           0 Minimal visible erythema(±); 0.5 Erythema(+); 1 Erythema + edema(++); 2 Erythema +&#xD;
           edema + papules + vesicles(+++); 3 Erythema bullosum (++++); 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dermatologist will examine that application site on Day 4 for single application&#xD;
           phase and Day 14 for repeat application phase to determine whether the symptom is an&#xD;
           allergic reaction or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Photo Patch Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The scorer (dermatologist) will examine the planned application sites and skin reactions&#xD;
           at the application sites, and make assessments at the following time points according to&#xD;
           the criteria proposed by the patch test study group of Japan Dermatology Society].&#xD;
&#xD;
           &lt;Single application phase&gt; Day 1: just before application Day 3: 24 hours after&#xD;
           irradiation (48 hours after application) Day 4: 48 hours after irradiation (72 hours&#xD;
           after application) &lt;Repeat application phase&gt; Day 5: just before application Day 13: 24&#xD;
           hours after removal of last study medication (48 hours after the last application) Day&#xD;
           14: 48 hours after removal of last study medication (72 hours after the last&#xD;
           application)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dermatologist will examine the irradiation sites 30 minutes after irradiation (about&#xD;
           24.5 hours after the start of application) on Day 2 (single) and to determine whether&#xD;
           there is photo-urticaria or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 30 minutes after irradiation to determine whether there is photo-urticaria or not. Then,&#xD;
           24 and 48 hours after irradiation, the skin reactions at the irradiation sites will be&#xD;
           compared with the corresponding non-irradiation site for photo patch test, using the&#xD;
           criteria showing in Table 1 and the photo-toxicity of each investigational product will&#xD;
           be assessed according to the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Criteria for Photo-toxicity No reaction or similar to the non irradiation site; -&#xD;
      Slightly stronger than the non irradiation site; ± Definitely stronger than the non&#xD;
      irradiation site; + 2 ranks stronger than the non irradiation site according to the criteria&#xD;
      in Japan; ++ 3 ranks stronger than the non irradiation site according to the criteria in&#xD;
      Japan; +++&#xD;
