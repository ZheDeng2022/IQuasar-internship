  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing epidemiological evidence that consumption of red meat is associated with&#xD;
      greater incidence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) than either white meat or non-meat foods.&#xD;
      Research from our group has shown that a high saturated fat (SF) diet with a moderate red&#xD;
      meat content selectively increases intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and larger low&#xD;
      density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are more weakly associated with CVD risk than smaller&#xD;
      LDLs. In contrast, the investigators have found that with a similar intake of SF, high beef&#xD;
      consumption results in a preferential increase in small and medium LDL particles that are&#xD;
      strongly related to CVD. To date, no studies have directly compared the lipoprotein effects&#xD;
      of red meat with that of other food sources of protein in the context of both high and low&#xD;
      saturated fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that the effects of SF on&#xD;
      lipoprotein markers of CVD risk are influenced by sources of dietary protein. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that adverse effects of SF on plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol (C),&#xD;
      apolipoprotein B (apo B), and atherogenic LDL particles are greater in a diet with a high&#xD;
      content of red meat than in diets in which the major proteins are from white meat (poultry)&#xD;
      or non-meat sources. The investigators propose a clinical trial in which 180 healthy men and&#xD;
      women will be randomized to high SF or low SF diet groups, and within each group, consume&#xD;
      diets with equivalent amounts of protein from red meat, white meat, and non-meat sources for&#xD;
      4 wks each in random order. Specifically, the investigators will test whether: (1) With high&#xD;
      SF, the red meat diet, compared to the other protein sources, will result in higher levels of&#xD;
      LDL-C, apoB, small and medium LDL, and total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)C; (2) With low&#xD;
      SF, dietary protein source will not be related to any of these measurements; (3) With both&#xD;
      the white meat and non-meat protein diets, increased LDL-C with high vs. low SF will be due&#xD;
      primarily to increases in large LDL, whereas with red meat the additional increase in small&#xD;
      and medium LDL will result in greater increases in plasma apoB and total LDL particle number.&#xD;
      Aim 4 will test hypotheses that increases in small and medium LDL with high SF plus red meat&#xD;
      are related to increased activity of hepatic lipase, a key determinant of small LDL&#xD;
      production, and that increases in large LDL induced by high SF are related to suppression of&#xD;
      LDL receptors. The investigators will also assess the effects of protein source and saturated&#xD;
      fat content on markers of insulin resistance, inflammation and endothelial function.&#xD;

      Clinic Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic a total of 11 times from screen to completion of study.&#xD;
      This will include weekly visits with the nutritionist and 9 visits requiring blood draws (at&#xD;
      screen and on 2 consecutive visits after each dietary period). At each visit, participants&#xD;
      will be weighed, waist and hip circumference will be measured and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      monitored. The total amount of blood collected during the course of the study will be 455 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (SV: 1 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiters will initially determine eligibility through review of a screening questionnaire&#xD;
      and a telephone or personal interview. If a potential subject is eligible and interested, an&#xD;
      orientation package will be mailed that will include written information about the study&#xD;
      requirements. Interested individuals passing pre-screening will be scheduled for a screening&#xD;
      blood draw visit to determine final eligibility. At the screening visit (SV), participants&#xD;
      will give informed consent, review their medical history with a registered nurse, and have&#xD;
      their blood pressure, weight, height, and waist and hip circumference measured. Thirty ml of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn for measurement of plasma triglycerides (TG), total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C,&#xD;
      glucose and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Women of childbearing potential will be given&#xD;
      a beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (b-hCG) urine pregnancy test. Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted within 2 weeks to notify them of their eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritionist Visits (Initial: 1 hr):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will meet weekly with a nutritionist to receive counseling including weight&#xD;
      management and diet review. At these meetings, participants will receive a week's worth of&#xD;
      frozen entrees and study foods, as well as standardized menus with check lists. During the&#xD;
      washout period (weeks 6-8; weeks 12-14), subjects will continue to refrain from alcohol but&#xD;
      will consume their usual home diet for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-diet Visits Requiring Blood Draws (A visits: 1.5 hr, B visits: 2.5 hr):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic on two separate days following completion of each diet to&#xD;
      provide blood samples. Duplicate sampling reduces biological variability, and hence improves&#xD;
      the power of the study to detect significant diet-induced changes in measurement. On the&#xD;
      penultimate day of each diet (visits 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A) a fasting blood draw (45 mL) will be&#xD;
      taken for plasma measurements (TG, total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, lipoprotein subfractions, glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, and CIII, and inflammatory markers). On the last day of&#xD;
      each dietary period (visits 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B) participants will provide a second fasting blood&#xD;
      sample (for lipids and lipoproteins as above). Lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase&#xD;
      activities will also be measured in plasma (20mL) collected 15 minutes after intravenous&#xD;
      heparin (75 units/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements: Blood pressure will be measured 3 times in a sitting position and the&#xD;
      last 2 values averaged. Anthropometric measurements include height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference, and % body fat by bioimpedance (Tanita scale). Waist circumference is measured&#xD;
      two times at the iliac crest and hip circumference is measured at the widest point of the&#xD;
      hips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Blood sampling: Using standard blood collection procedures, blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected from participants after a 12-14 hour fast. The blood will be collected into tubes&#xD;
      containing the following preservative solution: 3.0 gms EDTA (dipotassium), 1.7 mg P-Pack,&#xD;
      0.15 gms gentamycin sulfate, 0.15 gms chloramphenicol, 5.96 mls aprotinin (Sigma A-6279), and&#xD;
      0.30 gms sodium azide all of which are diluted to 20mls with doubly deionized water. Plasma&#xD;
      is separated by immediate centrifugation at 4Â°C. Lipid and lipoprotein measurements are&#xD;
      performed and aliquots of plasma are frozen for future analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-heparin Blood Sampling: A blood sample (20ml) will be drawn 15 minutes after intravenous&#xD;
      administration of a heparin bolus (75 U/kg, see Risk section for justification) for the&#xD;
      analysis of plasma lipase activity. Prior to administration, participants will be interviewed&#xD;
      for family history of clotting disorders or personal contraindications including use of&#xD;
      anticoagulants, history of bleeding or bruising abnormalities or other diseases, allergies,&#xD;
      or recent dental work. Following administration, participants will remain in clinic for 2&#xD;
      hours under observation. They will also be provided with an information sheet regarding&#xD;
      heparin and the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of endothelial function: Endothelial function will be assessed in the fasting&#xD;
      state by finger reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT, Endo-Pat2000,&#xD;
      Itamar Medical, Israel) and expressed as RH-PAT index. Participants will rest in a supine&#xD;
      position in a quiet, temperature-controlled room for 30 min. prior to PAT measurements and&#xD;
      will abstain from caffeine for 6 hours and from water for 2 hours prior to the test, per&#xD;
      manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
