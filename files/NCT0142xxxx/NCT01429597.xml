      Primary objective and endpoint is the analysis of the long-term course of lyso-Gb3 and its&#xD;
      clinical correlation to the progression of the cardiomyopathy in N215S-Fabry patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal disorder that leads to excessive deposition of neutral&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids in the vascular endothelium of several organs in the body. Progressive&#xD;
      endothelial accumulation of glycosphingolipids accounts for the associated clinical&#xD;
      abnormalities of skin, eye, kidney, heart, brain, and peripheral nervous system. Fabry&#xD;
      disease manifesting predominantly in men. Female heterozygotes also present with features of&#xD;
      Fabry disease. It is suggested that the mean age of hemizygotic men at the onset of&#xD;
      symptomatic stroke is 29 - 34 years. The mean age of female heterozygotes at the onset of&#xD;
      symptomatic strokes is 40 - 43 years.In Europe the prevalence of Fabry disease seems to be&#xD;
      massively underrepresented; actual textbooks describe 1 per 40.000. However, recent data (Lin&#xD;
      HY, et al., 2009) demonstrate the identification of eight different mutations in the&#xD;
      alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) gene in 110 027 newborns who were screened by assaying&#xD;
      the alpha-Gal A activity followed by genetic analysis. Hwu and co-workers (2009) have shown&#xD;
      in 90,288 male newborns screened for Fabry disease that 73 males had GLA gene mutations.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, 86% had the c.936+919G&gt;A (also called IVS4+919G&gt;A) splice mutation. In&#xD;
      contrast, screening 81,689 females detected two heterozygotes. Summarizing, newborn screening&#xD;
      identified a surprisingly high frequency of Taiwanese males with Fabry disease (approximately&#xD;
      1 in 1,250), 86% having the IVS4+919G&gt;A mutation previously found in later-onset cardiac&#xD;
      phenotype patients.The late-onset mutation N215S is discussed to be a so-called cardiac&#xD;
      variant (Perry Elliott, 2006; Eng et al., 1993, Sachdev et al., 2002). The prevalence of most&#xD;
      mutations is low, i.e. Fabry disease spontaneously and individually inheriting so-called&#xD;
      private mutations. However, there are some mutations that occur more frequent. Besides for&#xD;
      instance R112H, A143T and R227X, also N215S belongs to this group (Dobrovolny et al., ASHG&#xD;
      Abstract, 2008). The enzyme activity is only moderately affected, but hemizygous patients&#xD;
      display a clearly decreased activity in leucocytes and fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, Young and colleagues (Acta Paediatr Suppl.) concluded that Gb3 is not an ideal&#xD;
      biomarker using the example of N215S. All heterozygotes were unconspicuous and only 50% of&#xD;
      the examined hemizygotes had increased levels. However, globotraosylceramid (lyso Gb3) seems&#xD;
      to reveal all (genetically) found patients with a pathologically elevated level (with a mean&#xD;
      of 1,17ng/ml (females) and 2,43ng/ml (males) respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a case study from 2004 (Meehan et al., American Journal of Kidney Diseases) was shown that&#xD;
      a hemizygous male 75 years of age had a renal manifestation of mild proteinuria and a mildly&#xD;
      decreased renal function due to high Gb3 accumulation in podocytes, to a lesser extent in&#xD;
      tubular endothelial cells. Furthermore, he had mild congestive heart failure, a reduced left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction, and hypercholesterolemia. Thus, it is obvious that in Fabry&#xD;
      patients with the N215S mutation disease progression can be mono- to oligosymptomatic, but&#xD;
      show a tendency for the cardiac and renal phenotype rather than classical manifestation.&#xD;

      The laboratory examinations of the blood samples for measuring the lyso-Gb3-level will be&#xD;
      done at the Laboratory of the Albrecht-Kossel-Institute, University of Rostock in&#xD;
      collaboration with associated diagnostic laboratory partners. This laboratory offers an&#xD;
      existing infrastructure, a highly standardized quality of the workflow, a short examination&#xD;
      time of the samples and a long period of experiences in the assessment of the biological&#xD;
      impact of mutations and polymorphism, as evidenced recently in the sifap1-study.&#xD;
