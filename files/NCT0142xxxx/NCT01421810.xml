    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can have unwanted facial or male-patterned body&#xD;
      hair, irregular menstrual periods, or no menstrual periods excess body weight, and&#xD;
      infertility. It also results in elevated androgen levels such as testosterone. In women with&#xD;
      PCOS, the majority of excess androgens are produced by the ovaries. However, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether the ovaries are fully active during early puberty. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine how the ovaries contribute to the production of male hormones in the body during&#xD;
      different stages of puberty, so that it can be better understood why some females have excess&#xD;
      androgens.&#xD;

      Adolescent hyperandrogenemia can represent a forerunner to adult PCOS. Because adrenarche&#xD;
      leads to an increase in adrenal androgen production during early puberty and since early&#xD;
      puberty is associated with an overnight rise in testosterone that follows a similar time&#xD;
      course to cortisol, we hypothesize that the adrenal gland is a major source of androgens in&#xD;
      early puberty. On the other hand, the overnight rise in testosterone may reflect an ovarian&#xD;
      response to overnight increases of gonadotropin secretion in early puberty. However, the&#xD;
      ability of the ovaries to produce androgens (e.g., to respond to gonadotropin stimulation)&#xD;
      during early puberty has not been tested concurrently in these girls. The sources of excess&#xD;
      androgen production and the timing of their relative contributions across puberty are&#xD;
      important in understanding the mechanism of hyperandrogenemia in these individuals. In&#xD;
      addition, determination of the sources of hyperandrogenemia across puberty may have clinical&#xD;
      utility in the development of preclinical screening tests designed to reveal those girls at&#xD;
      greatest risk for PCOS and identification of potential therapeutic targets to prevent its&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Girls age 7-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal weight (BMI 5-85%-ile for age) or overweight (&gt;85%-ile)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With or without signs of excess androgen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening labs within age-appropriate normal range, with the exception of a mildly low&#xD;
             hematocrit (see below) and the hormonal abnormalities inherent in obesity which could&#xD;
             include mildly elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), lipids, testosterone, prolactin,&#xD;
             DHEAS, E2, glucose, and insulin; and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             and/or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently enrolled in another research protocol will be excluded, except for&#xD;
             those enrolled in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022. This protocol is designed to allow subjects&#xD;
             enrolling in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022 to simultaneously participate in this companion&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI-for-age &lt; 5th percentile&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight &lt; 27 kg if simultaneously participating in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022 due to blood&#xD;
             volume limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity associated with a diagnosed genetic syndrome (e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since the study involves looking at ovarian function, boys will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test or lactation. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             informed of the result by the screening physician. Under Virginia law, parental&#xD;
             notification is not required for minors. However, the screening physician will&#xD;
             encourage them to tell their parent(s) and counsel them about the importance of&#xD;
             appropriate prenatal care and counseling. We will arrange follow-up for them at the&#xD;
             Teen Health Clinic at the University of Virginia or their primary care physician's&#xD;
             office in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal laboratory studies will be confirmed by repeat testing to exclude laboratory&#xD;
             error.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Morning cortisol &lt; 3 microgram/dL or history of Cushing syndrome or adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 300 ng/dL, which&#xD;
             suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if postmenarchal, the&#xD;
             17-hydroxyprogesterone will be collected during the follicular phase, or ≥ 40 days&#xD;
             since last menses if oligomenorrheic). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt;300 mg/dL is&#xD;
             confirmed on repeat testing, an adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated&#xD;
             17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt;1000 ng/dL will be required for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or a hemoglobin A1c &gt;6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for age. Subjects with adequately treated&#xD;
             hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal prolactin. Mild elevations may be seen in overweight girls, and elevations&#xD;
             &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt;36% and hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL. Subjects with a mildly low&#xD;
             hematocrit (33-36%) will be asked to take iron in the form of ferrous gluconate for up&#xD;
             to 60 days. Subjects weighing ≤ 36 kg will take one 300-325 mg tablet oral ferrous&#xD;
             gluconate daily (containing 36 mg elemental iron); subjects weighing &gt;36 kg will take&#xD;
             two 300-325 mg tablets oral ferrous gluconate daily (containing 36 mg elemental iron&#xD;
             each). They will return to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or alternate UVA clinical&#xD;
             unit after 30-60 days of iron therapy to have their hemoglobin or hematocrit rechecked&#xD;
             and will proceed with the remainder of the study if it is ≥12 g/dL or ≥36%,&#xD;
             respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent liver test abnormalities, with the exception that mild bilirubin elevations&#xD;
             will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Mild elevations may be&#xD;
             seen in overweight girls, so elevations &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be&#xD;
             accepted in this group.&#xD;
