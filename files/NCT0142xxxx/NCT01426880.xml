  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study participants with primary breast cancer will receive a standard chemotherapy with an&#xD;
      anthracycline and a taxane as well as trastuzumab in case of HER2-positive tumors at doses&#xD;
      and duration in concordance to current treatment guidelines. Patients will be receive and&#xD;
      benefit in addition currently not in the neoadjuvant setting registered medication as&#xD;
      lapatinib or bevacizumab of which significant increases of cure (pCR) rates have been&#xD;
      reported in previous phase III studies. Patients randomized to carboplatin will receive in&#xD;
      addition to the described backbone therapies a potentially active agent which suggested&#xD;
      synergy of efficacy with chemotherapies as well as targeted agents. Patients might have the&#xD;
      risk of an increase in toxicities due to the added agents and will have additional burden due&#xD;
      to investigations required for study participation. However, due to the severity of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the high risk of relapse and death due to the stage of disease, this&#xD;
      increase in toxicity and burden appears less relevant compared to the potential higher&#xD;
      efficacy and finally cure rate by the incorporated treatments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the&#xD;
      standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2-positive disease trastuzumab is given&#xD;
      simultaneously to chemotherapy. Recent data from the Neo-Altto and Neosphere trials suggest&#xD;
      that a dual blockage of the HER2 receptor with e.g. trastuzumab and lapatinib reach&#xD;
      significantly higher pCR rates than trastuzumab alone and should therefore represent the&#xD;
      treatment back-bone of new neoadjuvant trials. A preplanned subgroup analysis of the&#xD;
      GeparQuinto study demonstrated that in TNBC the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a&#xD;
      significant increase of pCR rates (HR 1.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having a better cardiac tolerability profile compared to conventional anthracyclines, the&#xD;
      non-pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin (NPLD) Myocet® might provide the possibility&#xD;
      to combine taxane, anthracycline, platinum salt as well with targeted agents as double HER2&#xD;
      blockage or bevacizumab.&#xD;
