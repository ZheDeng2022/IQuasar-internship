      This randomized, controlled trial evaluates the analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous&#xD;
      single-dose paracetamol, dexketoprofen and morphine for the treatment of low back pain.&#xD;

      Study Design and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial performed in&#xD;
      an ED of a tertiary care hospital with annual census of approximately 37.000 visits. The&#xD;
      local ethics committee approved the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing single intravenous doses of&#xD;
      paracetamol (1 g), dexketoprofen (50 mg) and morphine (0.1 mg/kg) for patients presenting to&#xD;
      the emergency department (ED) with suspected low back pain. Subjects with inadequate pain&#xD;
      relief at 30 minutes received rescue fentanyl (0.75 microg/kg). We compared changes in pain&#xD;
      intensity 30 minutes after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects reported pain intensity on both a 100-mm visual analogue scale (limited by 'no pain'&#xD;
      and 'the worst pain') and a 4-point verbal rating scale (no pain, mild, moderate, or severe&#xD;
      pain) just before the drug administration, 15th minutes and 30th minutes after the study drug&#xD;
      administration. The demographic features of study patients and adverse effects, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, headache, hypotension, altered mental status, allergic&#xD;
      reaction, itching, urinary retention, thoracic rigidity, respiratory depression and dry&#xD;
      mouth, were recorded to the study form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was the pain reduction in VAS and VRS at 15th&#xD;
      and 30th minutes. Secondary outcome measures were the need for rescue drug and the presence&#xD;
      of any adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was planned as a superiority trial. When the 20 mm difference in VAS is&#xD;
      accepted as clinically significant and the standard deviation is accepted as 25 mm, 35&#xD;
      patients are needed with each group with 95% power. All the analysis were implemented&#xD;
      according to the intention to treat analysis. The precise of differences between time&#xD;
      intervals within groups and between groups and statistical significance were expressed by 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95% CI).&#xD;
