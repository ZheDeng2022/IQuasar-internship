      The objective of this study is to evaluate the evolution 6 months after a fall occurring at&#xD;
      home in people over 75 equipped or non-equipped with a precocious detection device. The&#xD;
      possibility to establish a relation between the alert emitted by the device, the time&#xD;
      separating the fall from the arrival at hospital and the potential consequences for the&#xD;
      persons will be analyzed with the greatest accuracy. Besides, the sequences of intervention&#xD;
      of the different operators will be described with precision. 200 persons living at home in&#xD;
      the ESSONNE(France)and having fallen at least one time during the previous 3 months will be&#xD;
      included in the study and two groups of 100 will be constituted randomly after having signed&#xD;
      a written consent. Of the 2 groups, one will be constituted with persons equipped with a&#xD;
      precocious fall detection device named Vigi'Fall® , the second being non-equipped. After a&#xD;
      first visit checking that the inclusion criteria are abide by and the installation of the&#xD;
      device in the persons designated randomly for being equipped, a second visit will be carried&#xD;
      out after 10 months in order to know the evolution, i.e. if the persons are still alive,&#xD;
      living at home or having left for admission in an institution (hospital, nursing home,&#xD;
      retirement home...). By a detailed comparison between the 2 groups, it will be possible to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential interest of having been equipped or non-equipped with a precocious&#xD;
      fall detection device. Hence, a change in practices may lead to a prevision of elderly&#xD;
      persons likely to benefit of a precocious detection device and to the development of&#xD;
      prevention in hospital geriatric departments, geriatric care networks, emergency departments&#xD;
      and local services for the elderly and disabled. Another possible gain of the study is to&#xD;
      sensitize the medical, paramedical and social teams to the usefulness of precocious detection&#xD;
      devices in elderly subjects at risk for falls.&#xD;

      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective : To evaluate the evolution 6 months after a fall occurring at home in&#xD;
      people over 75 equipped or non-equipped with a precocious detection device. Prospective&#xD;
      interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective : To establish a relation between the alert emitted by the device, the&#xD;
      time separating the fall from the arrival at hospital and the potential MORBI-mortality To&#xD;
      describe the sequences of intervention of the different operators Methodology :Multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective, cohort, interventional study. Pattern of the study : The study will comprehend 2&#xD;
      visits to be realized in a 10-month interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization, inclusion and selection visit(Visit 1): The inclusion of the subject will&#xD;
           be effective once the enlightened consent signed, after check of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
           Inclusion and standardized questioning will be realized by the medical evaluators. The&#xD;
           data will be obtained by questioning the subject and if need be of relatives and GP. The&#xD;
           questioning will be carried out with a questionnaire on independent card comprising the&#xD;
           frailty elements. Independently, a follow-up will be operated at home by a nurse of HPGM&#xD;
           Les Magnolias hospital for the maintenance of the adhesive patch to be changed regularly&#xD;
           nearly every 10 days in the persons equipped, the study plans the installation of&#xD;
           Vigi'Fall® device as the only peculiar measure during the coverage. At the conclusion of&#xD;
           that first report, the whole questionnaires will be picked up again by a participant in&#xD;
           charge of completing the potential missing data. Via this colligation of missing data,&#xD;
           the exhaustiveness of the data will be automatically checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. End of study visit (Visit 2): 10 months 10 months after the installation of Vigi'Fall®&#xD;
           device, a contact will be established with the subject and if need be relatives and GP&#xD;
           to be informed of the evolution but as well the appearance of potential falls with their&#xD;
           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relation between alert, intervention time and evolution : Theses relations will be&#xD;
                investigated with the most possible accuracy. The standardized questioning will be&#xD;
                completed by an investigator up to a maximal exhaustiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Description of the sequences of intervention:These sequences will be evaluated via&#xD;
                a simple and standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expected results, perspectives and scientific data: To quantify with accuracy the&#xD;
                evolution in persons over 75 equipped with a precocious detection device after a&#xD;
                fall occurring at home in comparison with a witness population non equipped. To&#xD;
                establish a relation between the alert emitted by the device, the time separating&#xD;
                the fall from the arrival at hospital and the potential MORBI-mortality. To&#xD;
                describe with the most possible accuracy the time sequences of the different&#xD;
                operators To quantify the rate of subjects hospitalized (with the duration of&#xD;
                hospitalization), of subjects still living at home or having left to be admitted in&#xD;
                institution (nursing home, retirement home...) in the different groups. The&#xD;
                information hence obtained will enable a better knowledge of the tools for&#xD;
                detection and precocious alert in falls of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Direct benefit for geriatricians, sanitary and care professionals and emergency&#xD;
                physicians:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in practices :Prevision of subjects likely to benefit of a precocious detection&#xD;
      device. Development of prevention in hospital geriatric departments, geriatric care networks,&#xD;
      emergency departments and local services for the elderly and disabled (SDPAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education : Sensitize the medical, paramedical and social teams to the usefulness of&#xD;
      precocious detection devices in elderly subjects at risk for falls.&#xD;
