      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the efficacy of sugammadex in dose of 4 mg/kg administered at&#xD;
           reappearance of T2 for reversal of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in&#xD;
           subjects undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex&#xD;
           administered at reappearance of T2 for reversal of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular&#xD;
           blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. to evaluate the time from the start of sugammadex or placebo administration to the time of&#xD;
      extubation and to the time of recovery of TOF ratio to ≥ 0.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the Operating Room (OR) and Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) length of stay&#xD;
           after the end of surgery in subjects with pipecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
           reversed by 4.0 mg.kg-1 sugammadex compared to placebo (saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare the number of patients extubated in the OR after the reversal by sugammadex or&#xD;
           placebo, evaluate the TOF ratio at the time of extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Sugammadex has to be effective and well tolerated for reversal of pipecuronium-induced&#xD;
      blockade&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sugammadex is the first selective relaxant binding agent indicated for reversal of rocuronium&#xD;
      and vecuronium-induced blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time sugammadex is able to form the complexes with other aminosteroid-based&#xD;
      muscle relaxants including long acting NMBAs* such as pancuronium 1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Still there are only limited data on the efficacy of sugammadex with pancuronium and no data&#xD;
      on the efficacy of sugammadex with other aminosteroid-based long acting NMBA - pipecuronium&#xD;
      which is still widely used in Russia (as well as in the other former Soviet Union Countries&#xD;
      and Eastern Europe countries). In the only study evaluating efficacy of sugammadex with&#xD;
      pancuronium has been shown that moderate pancuronium-induced blockade is effectively reversed&#xD;
      in less than 3 minutes with a sugammadex dose of 4.0 mg/kg 3. In this respect it would be&#xD;
      interesting in this study to evaluate the efficacy of sugammadex with pipecuronium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also very well known that the incidence of postoperative residual blockade (and its&#xD;
      complications) is higher when the long acting NMBAs such as pancuronium and pipecuronium are&#xD;
      used 4,5,6,7. So the possibility to use sugammadex for reversal of pipecuronium-induced&#xD;
      blockade could help to reduce the incidence of residual blockade and related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of sugammadex for the reversal of long acting NMBAs such as pipecuronium at&#xD;
      the same time would be significant in light of the limitations of cholinesterase inhibitors.&#xD;
      These drugs are more often administered after the long acting NMBAs taking into account their&#xD;
      prolonged clinical duration of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the dose of sugammadex 4 mg/kg will allow to recover the TOF ratio to 0.9&#xD;
      in less than 4 min and in this case this time will be similar to the recovery time after&#xD;
      moderate pancuronium-induced blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NMBAs-neuromuscular blocking agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A single center, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, safety-assessor&#xD;
           (single) blinded trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia who receive&#xD;
           succinylcholine for tracheal intubation and pipecuronium for maintenance of&#xD;
           neuromuscular blockade. Planned number of subjects - 42&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be randomised into 2 groups to receive at the end of surgery 4 mg/kg of&#xD;
           sugammadex or 3 ml of saline (placebo) for reversal of pipecuronium-induced&#xD;
           neuromuscular blockade. According to the sample size justification randomization will be&#xD;
           done with the ratio of 1:2 - 14 patients will be enrolled in the placebo group and 28&#xD;
           patients - in sugammadex group&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neuromuscular function will be monitored using the objective neuromuscular monitoring&#xD;
           with the TOF-Watch® SX acceleromyograph at the adductor pollicis muscle, starting after&#xD;
           induction of anesthesia (before succinylcholine and pipecuronium administration) and&#xD;
           continuing at least until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The primary efficacy variable is the time from the start of sugammadex or placebo&#xD;
           administration (reappearance of T2) to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The secondary efficacy variable is the time from the start of sugammadex or placebo&#xD;
           administration to the time of extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety assessment is going to be done in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
           of sugammadex for reversal of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (analysis of&#xD;
           AEs and vital signs)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs, i.e. heart rate and blood pressure (at screening, pre-pipecuronium,&#xD;
                pre-sugammadex or pre-placebo, at 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes post-sugammadex or&#xD;
                post-placebo, and at the post-anesthetic visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination (at screening, at the post-anesthetic visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pre-treatment (serious) events (from signing informed consent until administration&#xD;
                of sugammadex or placebo) and (serious) adverse events ((S)AEs, from administration&#xD;
                of sugammadex or placebo up to the end of trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Descriptive Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from OR admission (physical placement of subject into the OR) to actual OR&#xD;
                discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from start of sugammadex or placebo administration to actual OR discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from tracheal extubation to actual OR or PACU discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from PACU admission to actual PACU discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of patients extubated in the OR in both groups&#xD;
