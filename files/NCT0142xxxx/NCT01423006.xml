  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of focal Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) in men with low-risk, clinically&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RFA is a minimally invasive procedure. It is an image-guided technique that heats and&#xD;
      destroys cancer cells. In RFA, imaging techniques such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) are used to help guide a needle electrode into a cancerous tumor.&#xD;
      High-frequency electrical currents are then passed through the electrode, destroying the&#xD;
      cancer cells. Use of an RFA device was approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) in&#xD;
      1997 for the purposes of treating soft tissue tumors. The device we (Moffitt Cancer Center)&#xD;
      will be using in this study has clearance for clinical use from the FDA. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      the device is measured using biopsy cores at the site of the cancer after the RFA procedure.&#xD;
      To evaluate the benefits of this procedure, we will also evaluate the change in&#xD;
      quality-of-life indicators from baseline to 6 months following RFA. RFA is being developed as&#xD;
      a minimally invasive potential treatment for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a pilot clinical trial. Pilot clinical trials are smaller versions of&#xD;
      larger studies that are conducted to prepare for the larger study. This pilot study pre-tests&#xD;
      a research device before a large-scale multicenter study is launched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific purpose of this pilot trial is to find out if RFA can effectively treat prostate&#xD;
      cancer with fewer side effects including effects on urination, bowel function, and sexual&#xD;
      function. RFA for early stage prostate cancer is designed to affect only the part of the&#xD;
      prostate where cancer has been detected. The reasoning for this approach is the smaller the&#xD;
      area given RFA, the less damage to surrounding tissues.&#xD;
