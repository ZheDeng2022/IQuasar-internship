  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), a common disabling condition, is the commonest type of arthritis&#xD;
      worldwide.Pain is the leading symptom and is often chronic in na. Current treatment options&#xD;
      have had limited symptomatic effect and are associated with significant side effects.&#xD;
      Duloxetine, a selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      have, besides its antidepressant properties, a centrally acting analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of duloxetine in reducing pain&#xD;
      in older adults with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      288 patients aged 65 years and above with ACR clinical and radiographic criteria of primary&#xD;
      knee OA attending the outpatient clinic of our institution were enrolled in this study. All&#xD;
      patients underwent a physical examination and where questioned about the number of flares.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included any inflammatory, autoimmune, psychiatric illness and morbid&#xD;
      obesity. Patients were randomized 1:1. One hundred and forty four received 60mg/day of&#xD;
      duloxetine HCL and 144 received placebo together with their usual therapy for 16 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure was pain reduction. Secondary outcome measures included improvements&#xD;
      in physical functioning scores. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and&#xD;
      Visual Analogue pain Scale, (VAS, 0-100 mm). Functional assessment using the self-reported&#xD;
      physical function as measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), WOMAC pain and stiffness scores and the Geriatric Depression&#xD;
      Scale (GDS) was conducted. Alterations in dosage of analgesic/NSAID drugs used were recorded.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Data was collected at baseline and at monthly&#xD;
      intervals for 4 months. All staff involved in data collection was blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      assignment groups.&#xD;
