      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the accuracy of the femoral implant&#xD;
      placement utilizing the VISIONAIRE Femoral Alignment Guide in Birmingham Hip Resurfacing&#xD;
      (BHR) surgery postoperatively after total hip resurfacing using the BHR System.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi- site, clinical study of clinical outcomes following hip&#xD;
      resurfacing using VISIONAIRE Femoral Alignment Guide. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the blocks and to assess alignment of the BHR system when&#xD;
      using VISIONAIRE Femoral Alignment Guide. This study will also document any device-related&#xD;
      surgical complications or adverse radiographic observations.&#xD;

        The patient population considered for this study is patients requiring total hip&#xD;
        resurfacing. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used to identify study&#xD;
        candidates.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females, at least 21 years of age, inclusive, and skeletally mature.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the hip requiring primary total hip&#xD;
             resurfacing due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-inflammatory arthritis (degenerative joint disease) such as osteoarthritis,&#xD;
                  traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, or dysplasia/DDH, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is willing to consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is in stable health and is free of or treated and stabilized for cardiac,&#xD;
             pulmonary, hematological, or other conditions that would pose excessive operative&#xD;
             risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient meets medical clearance to have surgery required for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with infection or sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient with any vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease&#xD;
             severe enough to compromise implant stability or postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient known to have insufficient bone stock to support the BHR device including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with severe osteopenia should not receive a BHR procedure. Patients with&#xD;
                  a family history of severe osteoporosis or severe osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis (AVN) with &gt;50% involvement of&#xD;
                  the femoral head (regardless of FICAT Grade) should not receive a BHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with multiple cysts of the femoral head (&gt;1cm) should not receive a BHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: In cases of questionable bone stock, a DEXA scan may be necessary to assess&#xD;
                  inadequate bone stock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has known moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Subjects on medications&#xD;
             (such as high-dose or chronic aminoglycoside treatment) or with co-morbidities (such&#xD;
             as diabetes) that increase the risk of future, significant renal impairment should be&#xD;
             advised of the possibility of increase in systemic metal ion concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has a known sensitivity to materials in the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is immuno-suppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has physical, emotional or neurological conditions that would compromise the&#xD;
             patient's compliance with postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has BMI &gt;40.&#xD;
