  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the canine guidance (CG) and bilateral balanced&#xD;
      occlusion (BBO) on denture satisfaction and kinesiographic parameters of complete denture&#xD;
      wearers, by means of a cross-over trial. Edentulous patients will receive new maxillary and&#xD;
      mandibular complete dentures and, after the intraoral adjustments and adaptation period, will&#xD;
      randomly receive a sequence of occlusal schemes: BBO followed by CG, or CG followed by BBO.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed by a questionnaire questionnaire based on the criteria used by Celebic and Knezovic-Zlataric (A comparison of patient's satisfaction between complete and partial removable denture wearers. J Dent. 2003;21:445-451) and used by Souza et al. (Validation of the Brazilian versions of two inventories for measuring oral health-related quality of life of edentulous subjects. Gerodontology. 2012;29:e88-95.).&#xD;
Eight questions were answered according to a three-point scale (0=unsatisfactory; 1=regular; 2=good), whose sum provided a summary satisfaction score that ranged from 0 (the participant is completely dissatisfied with existing dentures) to 16 (maximum satisfaction).</description>

    <description>Before enrollment, all participants will receive conventional complete dentures adjusted according to the bilateral balanced occlusion concept.&#xD;
Following randomization, canine guidance will be achieved by adding composite resin (Restorative Z100, 3M Brazil, Sumaré, SP, Brazil) on the lingual surface of the maxillary canines. A sham comparator will also employ the addition of composite, but without changing eccentric contacts.</description>

        <description>Mandibular physiologic movements and the pattern of maxillary denture movement during chewing, as recorded by a kinesiograph (K6-I Diagnostic System, Myotronics research Inc., Seatle, WA).&#xD;
Specific measures involved: (1) Mouth opening; (2) Movement of the mandible from rest position to maximal occlusion (tooth clenching position); (3) Movement of the mandible during chewing; and (4) Movement of the upper denture base during chewing. Data from each measure was not combined into new variables, and collected in a single time point after each intervention.&#xD;
All measures were taken according to the vertical, anteroposterior and left-right axes separately.</description>
