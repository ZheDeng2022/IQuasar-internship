  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are two common heart conditions that are associated&#xD;
      with an increase in death and suffering. When both of these two conditions occur in a patient&#xD;
      the patient's prognosis is poor. These patients have poor life quality and are frequently&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients is&#xD;
      extremely challenging. Two options for managing the atrial fibrillation are permitting the&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation to continue but controlling the heart rate, or to convert the atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation rhythm back to normal and try to maintain the heart in sinus rhythm. Until now,&#xD;
      the method to keep the patient in normal sinus rhythm is with antiarrhythmic drugs. Studies&#xD;
      using antiarrhythmic drugs to control the rhythm failed to show any survival benefit when&#xD;
      compared with permitting the patient to be in atrial fibrillation. In the last few years, new&#xD;
      development in techniques and technologies now enable catheter ablation (cauterization of&#xD;
      tissue in the heart with a catheter) to be a successful treatment in abolishing atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation and that this approach is better than antiarrhythmic drug to control the rhythm.&#xD;
      However, there has not been any long-term study to determine whether catheter ablation to&#xD;
      abolish atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients would reduce mortality or admissions&#xD;
      for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to compare the effect of catheter ablation-based atrial fibrillation rhythm&#xD;
      control to rate control in patients with heart failure and high burden atrial fibrillation on&#xD;
      the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure events defined as an&#xD;
      admission to a healthcare facility for &gt; 24 hours or clinically significant worsening heart&#xD;
      failure leading to an intervention (defined as treatment in an emergency department, a&#xD;
      same-day access clinic, or an infusion centre) or unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider&#xD;
      for administration of an intravenous diuretic and an increase in chronic heart failure&#xD;
      therapy. This study may have a dramatic impact on the way the investigators manage these&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and may improve the outlook and well&#xD;
      being of these patients.&#xD;
