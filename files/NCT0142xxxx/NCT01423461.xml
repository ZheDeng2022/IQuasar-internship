  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Individualized health care&quot; refers to the development of strategies for disease management&#xD;
      and health promotion that are informed by specific data on genetics and physiological&#xD;
      processes that uniquely determine each person's health profile and potential responsiveness&#xD;
      to interventions or susceptibility to environmental exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airway, appears to be determined by multiple&#xD;
      interacting genetic and environmental factors. Such risk factors include allergic responses,&#xD;
      small airways, excess body weight, specific properties of airway smooth muscle, airway and&#xD;
      generalized metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis, and exposures to environmental irritants,&#xD;
      allergens, and psychosocial stressors. To date, asthma treatment strategies have been guided&#xD;
      by &quot;severity&quot; guidelines rather than by characteristics of the child's specific phenotype (a&#xD;
      child's underlying allergic tendency, extent of airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction, or underlying obesity and metabolic perturbations). The growing availability of&#xD;
      new classes of asthma medications that more directly target specific pathophysiological&#xD;
      derangements will require accessing data on each child's asthma risk profiles to optimize&#xD;
      selection of medications and other interventions that most specifically address the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology while minimizing adverse treatment side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to develop a model program for collecting relevant clinical&#xD;
      information and genetic data on a high risk group of asthmatic children, including data on&#xD;
      common co-morbidities, specifically obesity and sleep disorders; use this information to&#xD;
      develop a comprehensive model database for characterizing children according to their health&#xD;
      profiles; and use this characterization to initiate targeted interventions, while continuing&#xD;
      long term follow up of these children to determine differential responsiveness to&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
