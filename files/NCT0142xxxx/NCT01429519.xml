      The study objectives are to evaluate safety and efficacy, of topical administration of RPh201&#xD;
      for treatment of patients with hard to heal wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety evaluation of RPh201 (botanical extract) formulated as an oil solution&#xD;
           administered topically three times per week during an overall treatment period of up to&#xD;
           4 weeks in patients with hard to heal wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy assessment of wound improvement following the use of RPh201 oil solution&#xD;
           (botanical extract) administered topically three times per week during an overall&#xD;
           treatment period of up to 4 weeks and at the follow-up visit at 3 months after end of&#xD;
           treatment in patients with hard to heal wounds&#xD;
