  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major and growing public health concern. Chronic elevation of sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system (SNS) activity has been identified as a major contributor to the complex&#xD;
      pathophysiology of (essential) hypertension. The renal sympathetic nerves play a major role&#xD;
      in the elevation of the SNS activity. Therapeutic renal denervation (RD), the deliberate&#xD;
      disruption of the nerves connecting the kidneys with the central nervous system, has been&#xD;
      shown to be an effective means of modulating elevated SNS activity - both by reducing the&#xD;
      sympathetic modulation of renal function (renin release, sodium excretion and renal blood&#xD;
      flow) and by removing the renal afferent sympathetic contribution to central blood pressure&#xD;
      elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is an observational exploratory study. The main objective of this study is&#xD;
      to learn more on the effects of RD. We wish to do that by quantifying the effects of RD on&#xD;
      various biological variables. Those variables are studied in four sets of investigations: a&#xD;
      radiological set, a laboratorial set, a set of blood pressure measurements and a set of&#xD;
      investigations in the vascular laboratory. The radiological set consists of imaging of the&#xD;
      heart and kidney function (renal perfusion) and structure (renal arteries), the laboratorial&#xD;
      set of serum and urine tests, 24 h- home- and office- blood pressure measurements will be&#xD;
      taken and finally the set of vascular tests contains investigations on pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity(PWV) and heart rate variability(HRV). The data will most likely help us to define&#xD;
      future studies, to describe the mode of action and the effects of RD on various organs and&#xD;
      systems in more detail, and finally to define in more detail which type of hypertensive&#xD;
      patients is especially likely to benefit of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that LV mass will decrease after RD. Because all patients have severe&#xD;
           hypertension, it is likely that a substantial percentage will have increased LV mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that renal perfusion and renal oxygenation increase after RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that there will be no complications related to the device or procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that renal denervation has a beneficial effect on insulin resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that renal denervation will decrease the blood pressure(office and&#xD;
           24-hour-measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that RD has a beneficial effect on PWV and HRV.&#xD;

      Objective: The objectives of this study are: the investigation of changes in left ventricular&#xD;
      mass (LV mass) after RD using MRI, renal perfusion and renal oxygenation after RD using&#xD;
      dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI)and blood oxygenation level dependent MRI (BOLD MRI),&#xD;
      the evaluation of safety of RD, in terms of structural changes in the renal arteries and&#xD;
      kidney using Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Secondly the evaluation of changes in&#xD;
      various biological functions assessed by analysis of blood and/or urine samples. Thirdly the&#xD;
      quantification of changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV)&#xD;
      and heart rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational exploratory-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults with a systolic BP ≥160 mmHg (≥150 mmHg for type 2 diabetics) with a&#xD;
      stable drug regimen including 3 or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic,&#xD;
      or inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side-effects of&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of RD on: radiological variables: left&#xD;
      ventricular wall mass, renal perfusion, renal oxygenation and the anatomy of the renal&#xD;
      arteries. Secondly the effect of RD on biological variables assessed by analysis of blood&#xD;
      and/or urine samples. Thirdly the changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in PWV and&#xD;
      HRV after RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risks associated with the tests and procedures performed for the clinical&#xD;
      study are limited. There are no known risks associated with MRI when appropriate safety&#xD;
      guidelines are followed. Based on the experience form our previous studies, we do not expect&#xD;
      any potential risks regarding the cessation of anti-hypertensives.&#xD;
