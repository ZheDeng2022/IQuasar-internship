      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - (11C)mGlu1 is a new drug that helps to show where a protein, mGluR1, is found in the brain.&#xD;
      The drug contains a small amount of radioactivity that can be detected by imaging studies&#xD;
      like positron emission tomography (PET) scans. By looking at the mGluR1 receptors,&#xD;
      researchers hope to better understand how they are involved in general health, brain&#xD;
      disorders, and addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test how (11C)mGlu1 is distributed in the brain and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure how mGluR1 receptors display (11C)mGlu1 during imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. This study requires four visits to the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial evaluation, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a&#xD;
           PET scan, and a final blood sample after the PET scan, all at different visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI and PET scans will focus on the brain. Participants will receive (11C)mGlu1, and&#xD;
           have scans to see how it shows up in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have whole body imaging studies to see how (11C)mGlu1 shows up in&#xD;
           the body.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein coupled receptors that respond to&#xD;
      glutamate by activating proteins inside nerve cells that affect cell metabolism, thereby&#xD;
      fine-tuning the signals sent between cells to maintain balance in neuronal activity. mGluR&#xD;
      receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1s) are located in several brain regions, including the cerebellum,&#xD;
      hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and basal ganglia. mGluR1 activation stimulates phospholipase C,&#xD;
      resulting in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Detailed&#xD;
      study of mGluR1s has heretofore been hindered by the lack of high affinity and of selective&#xD;
      ligands for this receptor subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol will use a new PET ligand [C(11)]mGlu1 to 1) perform kinetic brain&#xD;
      imaging to quantify mGluR1 binding parameters in brain and determine the reliability and&#xD;
      reproducibility of these measures in 15 healthy volunteers (Phase 1); and 2) if the tracer&#xD;
      proves successful in Phase 1, we will estimate radiation-absorbed doses of [C(11)]mGlu1 in&#xD;
      healthy human subjects by performing whole body imaging (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful development of a PET ligand to image mGlurR1 would have a strong impact on&#xD;
      clinical management of brain disorders characterized by disruptions in glutamatergic&#xD;
      transmission, including anxiety and stress disorders, drug addiction, epilepsy, Huntington s&#xD;
      disease, and Parkinson s disease.&#xD;
