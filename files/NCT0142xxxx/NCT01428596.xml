      This study is to test a therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™) in HIV-1 infected subjects. The&#xD;
      safety and immune responses will be studied in vaccine recipients. The anti-viral effect of&#xD;
      HIVAX vaccine will be monitored during a 12-week treatment interruption phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and the immunogenicity of two doses of a replication defective HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™)&#xD;
      in subjects receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) who have an HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA &lt;50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count &gt;500 cells/mm3. Following the randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled vaccination phase subjects who received active vaccine and who meet&#xD;
      eligibility will undergo a 12-week analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption followed&#xD;
      by reinstitution of antiretroviral therapy (or continued interruption) with follow up through&#xD;
      week 48.&#xD;
