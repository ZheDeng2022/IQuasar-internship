  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is for the participant to give their own T cells (a type&#xD;
      of blood cell in the body that can fight infections and possibly cancer) to them after they&#xD;
      have been removed, grown in a lab, and then coated with an experimental drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the highest dose of EGFR2Bi coated T cells that can be given&#xD;
      without causing severe side effects. Initially a group of 3 participants will receive the&#xD;
      same dose of study drug. If no serious side effects occur, the next group of participants&#xD;
      will receive a slightly higher dose of study agent. The following groups of participants will&#xD;
      receive higher doses of the study drug until a dose is reached where there are unacceptable&#xD;
      side effects and maximum tolerated dose is found, or the planned highest dose level is&#xD;
      reached with no side effects.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine in a dose-escalation phase Ib trial the safety of 3&#xD;

    <description>Immune studies: Serum cytokine responses will be quantified focus on the levels of those factors known to be important regulators of T cell responses. Phenotype analysis will measure the percent of T, B, NKT and NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) samples. T cell proportions would be further analyzed by subset (CD4, CD8, CD25+). Cytotoxicity is measured in percentage in PBMC.</description>

EGFRBi armed ATC Infusions: Armed ATC will be infused intravenously (IV) with the rate of infusion based on the endotoxin content of the product. All patients will be observed for at least 4 hours after an infusion. Armed ATC infusions will begin 3 weeks after chemotherapy and subsequent doses will be administered once weekly, for 3 weeks, then 12 weeks post aATC#1.
