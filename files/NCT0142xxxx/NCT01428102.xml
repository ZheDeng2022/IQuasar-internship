    <textblock>
      During normal physiological conditions hemostasis (the ability of blood to clot) is kept in&#xD;
      homeostatic balance by feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms involve an extremely complex&#xD;
      series of steps on both sides of the coagulation cascade including cellular components (i.e.&#xD;
      clot formation and breakdown). However, should this homeostatic balance be upset, normal&#xD;
      hemostasis is affected resulting in pathological clotting (vessel blockage) or bleeding&#xD;
      (hemorrhage). In instances that include acquired or congenital abnormalities of the&#xD;
      hemostatic system it is clinically important to diagnose, monitor and manage the patient to&#xD;
      optimize therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it is important to regulate the hemostasis&#xD;
      system in the post-surgical outpatient who receives oral anticoagulant therapy to maintain&#xD;
      the homeostatic balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEG® analyzer, using a small whole blood sample, documents the interaction of platelets&#xD;
      with the protein coagulation cascade from the time of placing the blood in the analyzer until&#xD;
      initial fibrin formation, clot rate strengthening and fibrin-platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa,&#xD;
      through eventual clot lysis. It displays both qualitatively and quantitatively the two&#xD;
      distinct parts of hemostasis - the part that produces the clot and the part that causes the&#xD;
      breakdown of the clot. It shows the balance or degree of imbalance in the patient's&#xD;
      hemostasis system, highlights any areas of deficiency or excess, and offers a precise view of&#xD;
      the patient's hemostasis condition. If the system is not in balance, one can see where the&#xD;
      imbalance lies. If a patient is bleeding, it is crucial to determine the cause of bleeding as&#xD;
      soon as possible in order to start the proper treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By utilizing a kaolin/tissue factor activator (RapidTEG™), the TEG® system can measure the&#xD;
      interaction and simultaneous contribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways&#xD;
      which initiate and result in clot formation. This RapidTEG™ reagent can deliver results&#xD;
      faster than activating with Kaolin alone. This protocol will specifically assess one&#xD;
      algorithm called MA. MA is a direct function of the maximum dynamic properties of fibrin and&#xD;
      platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa that represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot.&#xD;
      This represents platelet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of MA RapidTEG vs.&#xD;
      MA Kaolin.&#xD;
