  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principle aim of the project is to identify the key brain circuits associated with&#xD;
      smoking and especially smoking in high risk population. The investigators hope that the study&#xD;
      will provide concrete biomarkers for new therapeutic development and ultimately reducing the&#xD;
      smoking related health burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      There are several studies and hypotheses to be tested. This project includes (1) a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study design that measures brain imaging, smoking, clinical diagnosis and&#xD;
      symptoms, cognitive functional assessments, distress tolerance, and genetic information,&#xD;
      which is also the baseline for the longitudinal study; and (2) a longitudinal study design&#xD;
      for smoking cessation option for 1 year in some smokers and a longitudinal follow-up for all&#xD;
      available subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline portion of the study, subjects are expected to complete clinical symptom&#xD;
      assessments, a computer challenge task to measure distress tolerance, MRI scan, role-play&#xD;
      test to measure cognitive and functional abilities, and blood draw. Subjects who are eligible&#xD;
      will participate in the longitudinal follow-up study where the research team will call&#xD;
      subjects regularly regarding smoking related information (smoking risk and treatment&#xD;
      options).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and Female between ages 12-above (clinical assessments and blood draw only above&#xD;
             62)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to give written assent (age below 18)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to give written informed consent (age 18 or above)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals fulfilled other criteria but over age 62, with major medical illnesses,&#xD;
             significant alcohol or other drug use, or unable to undergo MRI may participate in&#xD;
             clinical assessments and blood draw if his/her participation forms a family unit&#xD;
             (i.e., if at least one of the family member has participated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects above age 62 will not participate in MRI measurements although they may still&#xD;
             participate in clinical assessments and blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to sign informed consent/assent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patient participants, Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC) below 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major medical illnesses that may affect normal brain functioning. Examples of&#xD;
             these conditions include, but not limited to, stroke, repeated seizure, history of&#xD;
             significant head trauma, CNS infection or tumor, other significant brain neurological&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant alcohol or other drug use (substance dependence within 6 months or&#xD;
             substance abuse within 1 month) other than nicotine or marijuana dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Woman who are pregnant (child-bearing potential but not on contraceptive and missing&#xD;
             menstrual period; or by self-report; or by positive urine pregnancy test before MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Can not refrain from using alcohol and/or marijuana 24 hours or more prior to&#xD;
             experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For MRI, unable to undergo MRI scanning due to metallic devices or objects (cardiac&#xD;
             pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips or&#xD;
             other implanted metal parts) or claustrophobic to the scanner&#xD;
