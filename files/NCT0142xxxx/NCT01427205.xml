  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the addition of OSI-906 to cetuximab&#xD;
      can improve response. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s): To assess progression-free survival (PFS) among patients with head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with a combination of cetuximab plus OSI-906 and&#xD;
      compare it with PFS among patients treated with cetuximab plus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of these treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of these two treatment regimens in terms of overall survival,&#xD;
           response rate, and disease control rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of single agent OSI-906 following cetuximab treatment in terms of&#xD;
           response rate and disease control rate in patients who cross-over from Arm B to receive&#xD;
           single-agent OSI-906&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore blood-based and tissue biomarkers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins&#xD;
      on the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSI-906 is designed to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any&#xD;
      disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study&#xD;
      drug has any real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive cetuximab and OSI-906.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive cetuximab and a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor the study doctor will know if you are receiving OSI-906 or the placebo.&#xD;
      However, if needed for your safety, the study doctor will be able to find out which group you&#xD;
      are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse, the study doctor will find out which group you were in and you&#xD;
      will be offered the chance to take OSI-906 alone if you were not already receiving it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive cetuximab by vein. The first dose of&#xD;
      cetuximab will be given over about 120 minutes. If it is well tolerated, each additional&#xD;
      infusion will be given over about 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take OSI-906 or placebo by mouth 2 times every day about 12 hours apart (in the&#xD;
      morning and evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should take OSI-906 or placebo with food and a glass (up to 6 ½ ounces) of water. If you&#xD;
      forget to take a dose, you can take it any time up to 6 hours before the next dose. You must&#xD;
      not take the missed dose with the next dose on that same day or with a dose the next day. If&#xD;
      you vomit after taking the tablet(s), the dose should be replaced only if the tablet(s) can&#xD;
      actually be seen and counted. You should store the study drug/placebo at room temperature&#xD;
      below 77°F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to help decrease the risk of infusion reaction, you will receive Benadryl&#xD;
      (diphenhydramine) by vein before the first dose of cetuximab. If the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed, you will receive diphenhydramine before every dose of cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will need to return all unused OSI-906 or placebo and the empty&#xD;
      bottles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, you will be asked if you have had any side effects and to list any drugs you&#xD;
      may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You should not eat or drink&#xD;
           anything (fast) for 8 hours before this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed and you are able to become pregnant, you will have a&#xD;
           blood (less than 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, your vital signs will be measured before and after you&#xD;
      receive cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks (+/- 14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive treatment as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off&#xD;
      study early if you experience any intolerable side effects, the disease get worse, the doctor&#xD;
      thinks it is your best interest, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after the last dose of study drugs/placebo, you will have an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects and to list any drugs you may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 6 months from then on, you (or your family members or designees) will be asked&#xD;
      about how you are doing and what treatments you may be receiving. This may be by phone,&#xD;
      letter, email, or during clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. OSI-906 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, OSI-906 is only being used in research. Cetuximab is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of colorectal and head/ neck cancer. The combination of OSI-906&#xD;
      and cetuximab is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 66 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
