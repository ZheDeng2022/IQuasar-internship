      Bowel removal is indicated for various types of colon and rectal disease, including colon&#xD;
      cancer, rectal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following removal of the diseased segment of bowel your surgeon will reconnect the two&#xD;
      healthy ends to reconstruct a continuous bowel tube. If the bowel leaks it can become an&#xD;
      extremely dangerous situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of leakage has many causes and is not well understood, but appears to be at least&#xD;
      in part due to not having enough blood going to the bowel. There is currently no way to&#xD;
      evaluate the blood supply to the bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to utilize a special camera to evaluate the blood supply of the&#xD;
      bowel. This new system is called the Spy-scope. This system may assist surgeons in reducing&#xD;
      the occurrence of leaks&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether systemically injected ICG, when fluorescing&#xD;
      in response to NIR illumination, can assist with the assessment of perfusion at a bowel&#xD;
      anastomotic site. This finding may assist surgeons to minimize the occurrence of leaks at the&#xD;
      anastomotic site following this surgical procedure. The present study is a preliminary&#xD;
      investigation to determine if this imaging modality will yield information regarding&#xD;
      perfusion that is likely to be clinically relevant and so determine if a larger, multi center&#xD;
      trial that correlates perfusion to clinical outcome is warranted. The results of the present&#xD;
      study will also assist in the design of a larger scale study. It is expected that a&#xD;
      successful outcome to such a trial will result in less morbidity following laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic bowel surgery is indicated for colon cancer, rectal cancer, diverticulitis,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) and infarcted&#xD;
      bowel. Prophylactic colectomy is also indicated for certain forms of polyposis to mitigate&#xD;
      the risk of progression to colon cancer. The portion of colon resected during a colectomy is&#xD;
      dependent upon the nature of the disease and its location and extent. Traditionally,&#xD;
      colectomy has been performed by means of laparotomy, a standard abdominal incision. In recent&#xD;
      years, beginning in the early 1990s, there has been increasing interest in, and utilization&#xD;
      of, minimally invasive techniques for surgical procedures involving the colon and rectum.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic surgery involves the introduction of surgical instruments through a number&#xD;
      (usually 2-3) of small incisions measuring about 10-12 mm each with visual guidance being&#xD;
      provided by means of a camera attached to an endoscope introduced through a similarly small&#xD;
      access port. Laparoscopic techniques offer numerous benefits including a decrease in&#xD;
      postoperative pain, some improvement in time to tolerance of food and return of bowel&#xD;
      function, shorter hospital stay and more rapid return to normal activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of the type of procedure performed (open or laparoscopic), anastomotic leakage&#xD;
      following colorectal resection and primary anastomosis is a major clinical problem. The&#xD;
      incidence of intraperitoneal anastomotic leaks reported in the literature may be as high as&#xD;
      30%. Anastomotic leaks leads to increased length of hospital stay, and may progress to&#xD;
      abscess formation, sepsis, multi organ failure and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of anastomotic leakage is multifactorial with the following factors appearing to&#xD;
      impact upon leakage; adequacy of blood flow to the anastomosis, contamination, the presence&#xD;
      of a pelvic drain, anastomotic tension, anastomotic technique and the distance from the anal&#xD;
      verge . The present study will investigate the first factor listed above, adequacy of blood&#xD;
      flow to the anastomosis. At present there is no reliable and easy-to-perform modality that&#xD;
      can be used to assess adequacy of perfusion at the anastomosis during colorectal procedures.&#xD;
      This study will investigate the potential for the SPY scope to fill this clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPYÂ® Intraoperative Imaging System is cleared for use in Canada, Japan, Europe and the&#xD;
      US. SPY was originally developed for applications in cardiac surgery and allows cardiac&#xD;
      surgeons to visually assess bypass graft quality in real-time while the patient is still in&#xD;
      the operating room. Subsequently, SPY has received clearance from the FDA for use in plastic&#xD;
      and reconstructive surgery and in solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPY Intraoperative Imaging System was originally developed for open surgical procedures&#xD;
      using ICG, which is an approved drug. ICG is a fluorescent compound, which can be&#xD;
      administered intravenously or intra-arterially. The dye absorbs light in the near infrared&#xD;
      (NIR) region at 806 nm, and emits light at a slightly longer wavelength, 830 nm. When&#xD;
      injected intravenously, ICG rapidly and extensively binds to plasma proteins and is confined&#xD;
      to the intravascular compartment with minimal leakage into the interstitium under normal&#xD;
      conditions. This property makes it an ideal agent for the acquisition of high quality images&#xD;
      of the vasculature. Intraoperative images are acquired during the first pass of a bolus of&#xD;
      ICG through the area of interest. The SPY System has been the subject of numerous peer&#xD;
      reviewed publications demonstrating its safety and efficacy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPY scope, the endoscopic version of SPY, is an endoscopic visible (VIS) NIR imaging system&#xD;
      consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An endoscopic light source that provides illumination for visible light imaging and NIR&#xD;
           fluorescence excitation to the endoscope via a flexible light guide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rigid endoscopes optimized for illuminating the field of view and transmitting images in&#xD;
           the visible and NIR spectrum, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high definition (HD) endoscopic camera system connected to the endoscope eyepiece and&#xD;
           acquiring high resolution visible and NIR fluorescence images The ICG (25 mg per vial)&#xD;
           will be reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions using the entire&#xD;
           contents (10 ml) of the sterile diluent supplied, yielding a 2.5 mg/ml solution of ICG&#xD;
           or using half of the diluent supplied (5 ml) yielding a 5 mg/ml solution.&#xD;
