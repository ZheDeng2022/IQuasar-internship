  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the addition of sulfonylurea&#xD;
      (gliclazide MR) or ,alternatively, basal insulin (insulin detemir) to life-style modification&#xD;
      and metformin treatment as a second step treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus on endothelial&#xD;
      cell functions. The second goal is to identify the effects of these treatment alternatives on&#xD;
      body-mass index, the changes in body fat mass, insulin resistance and on the insulin&#xD;
      secretion capacity of beta cells. The third aim of this study is to determine the success&#xD;
      rates of these treatment alternatives on glycemic control at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of enough number of randomized and controlled studies in the treatment of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes is the most important obstacle in recommending a single-drug or a combination&#xD;
      treatment to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pleomorphic effects of the treatment choices other than the control of hyperglycemia in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes are equally important. There is yet a lack of the comparison of different&#xD;
      treatment alternatives found in the treatment algorithms of American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      (ADA) both in terms of the effects on hyperglycemia control as well as other pleomorphic&#xD;
      effects. Some of these pleomorphic effects are the change in body-mass index, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, insulin secretion capacity and the effects on endothelial functions and&#xD;
      coagulation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is mainly prepared to analyze the effects of the addition of sulfonylurea&#xD;
      (gliclazide MR) or alternatively basal insulin (insulin detemir) to life-style modification&#xD;
      and metformin treatment as a second step treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment&#xD;
      algorithm on endothelial cell functions. The second goal is to identify the effects of these&#xD;
      treatment alternatives on body-mass index, the changes in body fat mass, insulin resistance&#xD;
      and on the insulin secretion capacity of beta cells. The third aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the success rates of these treatment alternatives on glycemic control at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up. This study in this sense is expected to shed the light on the decision of best&#xD;
      treatment option as well as an essential contribution to the lacking literature in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach these aims, 20-65 year-old patients applying to the endocrinology and the metabolism&#xD;
      outpatient unit, having type 2 diabetes diagnoses with unregulated blood glucose levels after&#xD;
      first step treatment (life-style modification and metformin) will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
      either to the Gliclazide MR arm or the Insulin Detemir arm. As soon as patients in each arm&#xD;
      reach to the target glycemic levels (0. week), basal tests showing endothelial function as&#xD;
      well as inflammatory and coagulation status such as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)and&#xD;
      investigation of the peripheral blood levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, vWF,&#xD;
      E-selectin, P-selectin, endothelin-1, PAI-1, tPA and HMW adiponectin will be performed. To&#xD;
      investigate the insulin resistance and the changes in insulin secretory capacity of beta&#xD;
      cells, mixed meal test will be performed and data obtained about glucose as well as insulin&#xD;
      levels during mixed meal test will be evaluated. To identify the changes in body-fat mass,&#xD;
      bioimpedance analyses will also be performed. All these basal tests will be repeated in each&#xD;
      study subject, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after reaching the target glycemic levels. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to insulin detemir arm in the beginning will only have gliclazide MR treatment&#xD;
      after the 12.week tests are performed. The effects of continuous gliclazide MR treatment or&#xD;
      early insulin detemir followed by gliclazide MR treatment on endothelial cell functions,&#xD;
      inflammation and coagulation, insulin resistance, insulin secretory capacity of beta cells&#xD;
      and body-fat mass will be evaluated by comparing the 0. week with 12. and 24. week values&#xD;
      within each arm as well as 24. week values between arms.&#xD;
