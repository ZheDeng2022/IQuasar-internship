  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Food choice is influenced by postprandial mood; the feelings of well-being after a&#xD;
      meal. Postprandial mood can be measured by subjective responses. Physiological responses may&#xD;
      play an important role in the generation of postprandial mood. However, the relationship&#xD;
      between subjective and physiological responses after a meal is not clear yet. To investigate&#xD;
      this relationship, moderate alcohol consumption will be used as a mood modulator, because of&#xD;
      its well-studied effects on mood. Postprandial mood depends on the current mood state.&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators will manipulate the current mood state by changing the ambiance&#xD;
      to measure the influence of moderate alcohol consumption with a meal on postprandial mood in&#xD;
      a pleasant or unpleasant ambiance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption with a meal in different&#xD;
      ambiances affects postprandial mood, evaluated by subjective and physiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 28 apparently healthy, normal weight (BMI 18.5-27 kg/m2) women (18-45 y),&#xD;
      taking oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 4 times having dinner at TNO Zeist with either 3 glasses of sparkling white&#xD;
      wine (~30g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine in either a pleasant or unpleasant&#xD;
      meal ambiance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption with a meal in different&#xD;
      ambiances changes the response of subjective and physiological parameters of mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ho: there is no effect of alcohol consumption and ambiance on mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: there is an effect of alcohol consumption and ambiance on mood&#xD;
