  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-lumen bronchial tube (DLT) had been demonstrated to benefit for thoracic surgery and&#xD;
      also played an important role to achieve one-lung ventilation (OLV) for exploring the&#xD;
      surgical fields. However, compared with the single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT), the DLT had&#xD;
      larger OD (outer diameter), longer length, and was more complex in its structure. For&#xD;
      avoiding oral tissue trauma and shortening the DLT intubating time, thus, an adequate and&#xD;
      complete glottic viewing under laryngoscope was needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, several video-assisted laryngoscopes had been developed to facilitate&#xD;
      the tracheal intubation in the difficult airway. Among these devices, the GlideScope®&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope (GVL) (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA) was a reusable video laryngoscope with a&#xD;
      60° curvature blade. A light source and a digital video camera were installed at the tip of&#xD;
      the laryngoscope blade and the pictures of the glottis and the vocal cords were displayed on&#xD;
      an LCD monitor. We could insert the endotracheal tube passing the vocal cords into the&#xD;
      trachea more precisely and had less tissue damaging under the GVL's guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with direct MacIntosh laryngoscope, the GVL had been reported that it can decrease&#xD;
      the intubation time and increase the successful rate of first intubation in normal and&#xD;
      difficult airways. However, the efficacy of the GVL in intubating the DLT was unclear and had&#xD;
      never been evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the intubation&#xD;
      conditions, safety, and patient comfort between using the GVL and the direct Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope in a specific population of patients needed DLT intubation. Main outcome&#xD;
      measures were intubation success rates and the time needed to intubate the DLT with the two&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Research Board of the Memorial Hospitals&#xD;
      of Kaohsiung Medical University and all patients included in the study gave written informed&#xD;
      consent. Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, ≧&#xD;
      18 years of age, and needed double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) for thoracic surgery were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria were increased risk for regurgitation and&#xD;
      pulmonary aspiration, history of gastroesophageal reflux, and pregnancy. Furthermore, when a&#xD;
      tracheostomy or prolonged ventilation on ICU was planned, patients were also excluded. All&#xD;
      tracheal intubations in the study were performed by two experienced (&gt; 10 year) Board&#xD;
      Certified anesthesiologists who each had experience of at least 300 tracheal intubations with&#xD;
      each device before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient had entered the operating room, standard monitoring including ECG, invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement on the radial artery and pulse oximetry were established. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to direct MacIntosh laryngoscope group (Group M, n = 30) or GVL group&#xD;
      (Group G, n = 30) by opening a sealed envelope after they had entered the operating theatre.&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2-3 mg.kg-1, fentanyl 2μg.kg-1, and rocuronium&#xD;
      0.6mg.Kg-1. After achieving adequate muscle relaxation and anesthetic depth, DLT intubation&#xD;
      was performed with direct laryngoscope or GVL. The bronchial and the tracheal cuff of the DLT&#xD;
      were lubricated with SURGILUBE® sterile, surgical lubricant (E. FOUGERA &amp; CO. Melville, New&#xD;
      York, A division of Nycomed US Inc.) thinly before intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The demographic characteristics of both groups included age (years), gender&#xD;
      (female/male), weight (kg), height (cm), body mass index (BMI), and ASA classification were&#xD;
      recorded. The airway characteristics included the modified Mallampati classification, mouth&#xD;
      opening (active and passive), and the thyromental distance were also recorded. Patients were&#xD;
      measured of thyromental distance and incisor gap on maximal opening of the mouth and grading&#xD;
      of The modified Mallampati classification in the operative room by another anesthesiologist&#xD;
      not involved in the study. Passive mouth opening was measured after induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
      After pre-oxygenation with oxygen 100%, patients received thiamylal 5 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl&#xD;
      2μg.kg-1 for anesthesia induction and facilitated DLT intubation with rocuronium 0.8 mg.kg-1&#xD;
      and propofol 1.0 mg.kg-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time to calculate DLT insertion (T3) was separated into T1 and T2, respectively,&#xD;
      defined as started after jaw opening when the GVL or the direct laryngoscope passed the&#xD;
      patient's lips and stopped when three complete waves of end-tidal CO2 showed on the monitor&#xD;
      of capnography and measured by an independent observer. T1 time interval was calculated from&#xD;
      the jaw opening, placement of GVL or standard Macintosh laryngoscope, to the view of glottis&#xD;
      opening. T2 time interval was calculated from intubator holding DLT to three complete waves&#xD;
      of end-tidal CO2 showed on the monitor of capnography. The procedures to position of DLT were&#xD;
      declared in brief as following: the distal 10-12cm of the DLT was curved to approximately&#xD;
      90°; a conventional laryngoscope in group M and a Glidescope in group G to assist position&#xD;
      DLT into trachea [4]; the tip of the DLT bronchial lumen was passed through the vocal cords&#xD;
      and advanced into the glottis; to remove stylet of DLT; 180° counterclockwise rotation to&#xD;
      facilitate the insertion of the bronchial cuff and tracheal lumen past the vocal cords; an&#xD;
      additional 90° clockwise rotation to fit the tube into left main bronchus [5]. Grading of&#xD;
      laryngo-pharyngeal tissues viewed by intubator according to the Cormack and Lehane&#xD;
      classification (grades I-IV) that defined as grade I- complete glottis visible, grade II-&#xD;
      anterior glottis not seen, grade III- epiglottis seen, but not glottis, and grade IV-&#xD;
      epiglottis not seen [6]. The intubator determined the grades of laryngeal viewing either by&#xD;
      direct laryngoscope or by Glidescope® with video monitor. The backwards upwards rightwards&#xD;
      pressure (BURP) maneuver to optimize the glottis view was also recorded and the pressure&#xD;
      grading was defined as none, light, and heavy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blade of laryngoscope or GlideScope® was removed, we examined blood coating on its&#xD;
      surface. The oral cavity, pharynx and larynx for signs of lacerations or bleeding provoked by&#xD;
      the intubation was also examined by another otolaryngologist 5 minutes later, who was not&#xD;
      aware of the chosen technique to complete intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters were recorded in the operating theatre after starting standard&#xD;
      monitoring. Measurement of hemodynamic parameters included of time interval of baseline,&#xD;
      intubation and post-intubation 1, 3 and 5 min, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with&#xD;
      sevoflurane. At the end of surgery, patients were trained to breathe spontaneously. The DLT&#xD;
      was removed when spontaneous ventilation reached a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and the patient&#xD;
      could respond to simple verbal commands. The patients were interviewed by an independent&#xD;
      investigator to determine whether they were suffering from a sore throat or dysphagia the&#xD;
      next day of post-operation. We quantified the degree of soreness of the throat and dysphagia&#xD;
      by using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10, with VAS 0 being rated as 'none', 1-3&#xD;
      as 'mild', 4-6 as moderate' and 7-10 as 'severe'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a likely difference in mean times to intubate of 10 s with a SD of 10 s, an a priori&#xD;
      power analysis revealed a group size of n = 27 was needed to detect a difference with a power&#xD;
      of 0.8 at α-level of 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test&#xD;
      for non-parametric and univariate ANOVA for parametric data. Duncan's post-hoc test was&#xD;
      performed where appropriate. Hemodynamic data were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures.&#xD;
      Data are expressed as mean (SD) where applicable or actual numbers. SPSS 16.0.1 software&#xD;
      (Apache Software Foundation, Forest Hill, MD, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.&#xD;
