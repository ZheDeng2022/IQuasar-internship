      Urea cycle disorders (UCD) are amongst the most frequent of the inborn errors of metabolism&#xD;
      (IEM) and result from a block in the hepatic disposal of waste nitrogen from protein&#xD;
      catabolism. Viral infections play a significant role in precipitating life-threatening acute&#xD;
      hyperammonemic crises in UCD. The recent H1N1 influenza pandemic has placed this vulnerable&#xD;
      population at significant risk. The standard of care for these patients is routine&#xD;
      vaccination for seasonal and H1N1 influenza viruses. However, nutritional deficiencies and&#xD;
      their underlying enzymopathy may affect the efficacy of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary management of urea cycle disorders includes dietary modification with protein&#xD;
      restriction. Protein energy malnutrition, essential fatty acid deficiencies and micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies due to restrictive dietary management have been reported in various inborn&#xD;
      errors of metabolism. In general, dietary deficiencies and their effect on immune function&#xD;
      are well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the disposal of waste nitrogen, the urea cycle also generates arginine for&#xD;
      various biologic functions. Depending on the site of the metabolic block, UCD patients are at&#xD;
      risk for becoming systemically deficient in citrulline and arginine, with potential&#xD;
      implications for the immune system. The immunomodulatory roles of the amino acids citrulline&#xD;
      and arginine have been characterized in the context of nutritional deficiencies in disease&#xD;
      states such as cancer and sepsis. Systemic infection may also deplete systemic citrulline and&#xD;
      arginine, compounding an underlying deficiency in UCD. Cells of the immune system have a more&#xD;
      direct relationship with the urea cycle: urea cycle enzymes arginosuccinate synthetase (ASS),&#xD;
      arginosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase (ARG1) may also be components of leukocyte&#xD;
      metabolism. Overall, general and specific nutritional deficiencies and enzymopathies&#xD;
      affecting leukocyte metabolism may potentially affect vaccine efficacy. However, immune&#xD;
      system function in experiments of nature such as UCD remains an understudied area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate the nutritional/metabolic and immunologic&#xD;
      states of patients with UCD or related disorders. Routine inpatient admissions will last 2-3&#xD;
      days and involve urine collection, blood drawing, radiological procedures, nutrition&#xD;
      assessment and biometrics, and vaccination for combined seasonal/H1N1 influenza. Follow-up&#xD;
      outpatient appointments will be scheduled at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be to describe the nutritional and immune deficiencies seen, query&#xD;
      for nutrition/enzymatic/immunologic correlations in this patient population, describe vaccine&#xD;
      efficacy in this patient population, and search for new genes in rare families that have&#xD;
      evidence for an unknown class of UCD. The population will consist of patients previously&#xD;
      evaluated at NIH, physician referrals, and families directed to the study from&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov as well as the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation. All patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
