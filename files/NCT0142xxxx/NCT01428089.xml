  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During childhood, the levels of certain hormones: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH),&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, and progesterone are&#xD;
      very low. However, when puberty starts, GnRH and LH pulses begin to increase, but they&#xD;
      initially do so at night only. It is unknown why GnRH and LH pulses increase at night and&#xD;
      then decrease during the day (instead of being increased all the time). The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to see how quickly progesterone reduces LH pulses. The study is also meant to find&#xD;
      out whether too much testosterone (also a hormone) in the blood causes problems with the&#xD;
      ability of progesterone to reduce LH pulses. In this study, the investigators aim to discover&#xD;
      whether or not giving 3 small doses of progesterone to pubertal girls will prevent the&#xD;
      nighttime increase of LH pulses. From the information gathered in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators may be able to learn more about how menstrual cycles are normally established&#xD;
      in girls during puberty. Ultimately, if the investigators understand these normal processes,&#xD;
      the investigators may be able to better understand abnormalities of puberty.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Studies will be performed in early pubertal (late Tanner 1 [estradiol level &gt; 20 pg/ml] to&#xD;
      Tanner 3, premenarcheal) girls with and without hyperandrogenemia (HA). After a potential&#xD;
      subject is identified by the Pediatric, Teen, or Endocrine clinics, she will come to the CRU&#xD;
      or alternate UVA clinical unit for an outpatient screening exam. The goals and procedures of&#xD;
      the study will be explained to the potential subjects and their custodial parents, and they&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to ask questions. A subject and her custodial parent(s) will be&#xD;
      asked to sign the assent and consent forms. A physician will record a family and personal&#xD;
      medical history and perform a physical exam. The physical exam will include height, weight,&#xD;
      and determination of pubertal stage (Tanner scale). Since adiposity is a potential confounder&#xD;
      in this study, measures of adiposity will be recorded. This will include measurement of waist&#xD;
      circumference (using standard technique) to provide an estimate of abdominal adiposity. Hip&#xD;
      circumference will also be measured. Additionally, BOD POD® will be used to measure total fat&#xD;
      mass, fat free mass, and percent body fat. Blood tests will include CBC, Chem17, prolactin,&#xD;
      LH, FSH, E2, P, total testosterone, SHBG, DHEA-S, 17-OHP, TSH, insulin, beta-hCG, and&#xD;
      cytoadipokines. Bone age (simple x-ray of left hand and wrist) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If safety labs are abnormal during screening (e.g., abnormal liver tests, abnormal TSH),&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to return once for repeat (confirmatory) labs to exclude lab error,&#xD;
      especially when values are only slightly abnormal. Repeat testing will generally occur within&#xD;
      one month of the original screening lab draw. If exclusionary lab values are confirmed on&#xD;
      such repeat testing, subjects will be excluded from participation. If the subject has a low&#xD;
      hemoglobin (&lt;11.5 g/dL for non-African American subjects; Hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL for African&#xD;
      American subjects ) at the time of screening, we will offer the option of taking oral iron&#xD;
      supplementation at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg for 30 days. Subjects weighing ≤ 36 kg will be given&#xD;
      300-325 mg oral ferrous gluconate daily (containing 36 mg of elemental iron); subjects&#xD;
      weighing &gt;36 kg will be given 300-325 mg oral ferrous gluconate twice daily. Following the&#xD;
      course of iron supplementation, the subject will then return to the CRU for a repeat&#xD;
      hemoglobin, and will only be able to proceed with the study if her hemoglobin is greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 11.0 g/dL for African American subjects or greater than or equal to 11.5 g/dL for&#xD;
      non-African American subjects. If the subject's hemoglobin remains low after repeat testing,&#xD;
      we will recommend that they follow up with their primary physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If three months have elapsed between an admission and the subject's most recent safety labs,&#xD;
      then safety labs (CBC, chemistry and liver panel) will be obtained prior to the overnight&#xD;
      admission (or on admission) to exclude anemia and any other exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will then be scheduled for an inpatient admission.&#xD;
      They will begin taking iron supplementation for a maximum of 30 days prior to admission.&#xD;
      Girls weighing ≤ 36 kg will take one 300-325 mg tablet oral ferrous gluconate daily&#xD;
      (containing 36 mg elemental iron); subjects weighing &gt;36 kg will take two 300-325 tablets&#xD;
      oral ferrous gluconate daily (containing 36 mg elemental iron). The inpatient admission can&#xD;
      occur at any time during this period of iron supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient Admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be admitted to the CRU, or alternate UVA hospital unit, at 0900-1000 h. A&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test (HCG) will be obtained. A hemoglobin will be measured-if a CBC has not&#xD;
      been done within the past 7 days, a fingerstick will be done to check the hemoglobin prior to&#xD;
      insertion of the IV line. Alternatively, subjects may come to the CRU early on the day of&#xD;
      their admission before their scheduled admission time. The study team will be responsible for&#xD;
      scheduling this with the subject. In order to continue with the admission, girls must have a&#xD;
      negative HCG. They must also have either a hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL for African American&#xD;
      subjects or ≥ 11.5 g/dL for non-African American subjects. A small amount of topical&#xD;
      lidocaine and prilocaine cream (EMLA cream) may be applied to facilitate IV line placement.&#xD;
      An IV line will be placed in a forearm vein at ~1000-1030 h, and blood draws will begin at&#xD;
      1100 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be taken every 10 min for 20 h (i.e., from 1100 h to 0700 h the following day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample volume will be 0.75 ml every 10 minutes for later measurement of LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2 hours (on the hour), an additional 3.5 ml will be drawn for later measurement of&#xD;
           FSH, T, E2, P, and cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 0700 h, an additional 3.5 ml will be drawn for measurement of fasting insulin,&#xD;
           glucose, SHBG, DHEAS, IGF-1, and androstenedione.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take 5-25 mg oral micronized P (based on body weight, to achieve mean plasma P&#xD;
      1-2 ng/ml) or placebo at 1100, 1500, and 1900 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formal lights out will occur at 2300 h, and subjects will be encouraged to sleep at this&#xD;
      time. Subjects will be awakened at 0700 h. No sleeping will be allowed from 1100-2300 h.&#xD;
      During blood sampling, activity (e.g., awake, sleeping) will be recorded by the nurse every&#xD;
      10 minutes. Additionally, periods of sleep will be estimated using wrist actigraphy&#xD;
      (Motionlogger Basic-L; Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) (42). The Motionlogger Basic-L is a&#xD;
      watch-like device (that includes an accelerometer) that will be worn on the wrist by the&#xD;
      research participant during the overnight admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be fasting from 2100 to 0700 h. The subject will be offered meals at standard&#xD;
      meal times the evening prior to study, but breakfast will not be served until after the 0700&#xD;
      h sample is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Follow-Up for study participants: Subjects participating in this study will be asked&#xD;
      to respond to a questionnaire (sent via electronic mail or US postal service) and/or phone&#xD;
      calls at 6-12 month intervals during the subsequent three years to determine the progression&#xD;
      of normal puberty, the onset and frequency of menses, and the development of any hirsutism.&#xD;
      Whenever possible, we will see the patient in the CRU or alternate UVA clinical unit at these&#xD;
      times to obtain blood for hormone analysis including fasting insulin and glucose, cortisol,&#xD;
      SHBG, testosterone, DHEA-S, LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone (10 cc of blood drawn with&#xD;
      each visit); in addition to a brief physical exam to include height, weight, and Tanner&#xD;
      stage. The follow-up portion of this study is completely optional.&#xD;
