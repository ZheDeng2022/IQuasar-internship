      The purpose of this study is to examine the advantages and disadvantages of using the EnSeal&#xD;
      device in hemorrhoid surgery as compared to traditional hemorrhoid surgery techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the use of the Enseal device will demonstrate an improvement a&#xD;
      patient's overall experience through less postoperative bleeding and pain, decreased time for&#xD;
      wound healing, and a faster return to work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EnSeal Device is FDA approved for surgery in ligating and dividing vascular tissue during&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. Electrical energy is converted into heat energy and resultant simultaneous&#xD;
      division of tissues. This allows surgery to be bloodless and sutureless. It has been&#xD;
      successfully used by many individual practitioners for hemorrhoidectomy, with apparent&#xD;
      advantage and success; but to date, no comparative study has been done to assess the&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of this method of hemorrhoidectomy, when compared to traditional&#xD;
      excisional techniques. The investigators propose to use this device in the current study in&#xD;
      the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease where vascular tissue is excised in bloodless and&#xD;
      sutureless fashion. It is currently being used in institutions throughout the United States&#xD;
      and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will receive the same standard postoperative instructions as for&#xD;
      conventional hemorrhoidectomy, which include wound care, pain medicine, and other standard&#xD;
      instructions. The patient will be followed in the office with visits at 3 to 4weeks, and 3&#xD;
      months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits, they will be assessed for postoperative complications including but not&#xD;
      limited to: bleeding, urinary retention, fecal impaction, hospital re-admission and pain.&#xD;
      Delayed complications -greater than four weeks- will be followed including impaired healing,&#xD;
      constipation, abscess, fistula formation, fissure, and stenosis. The patient's pain score and&#xD;
      type and amount of pain medications taken will be recorded by the patient daily for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks then weekly for a month postoperatively. This will be assessed using a pain diary&#xD;
      which includes a visual analog pain scale (allowing the patient to describe their pain level&#xD;
      on a scale between 1 and 10) and space to note the quantity of pain medications used. During&#xD;
      each office visit, the operating surgeon will evaluate the patient.&#xD;
