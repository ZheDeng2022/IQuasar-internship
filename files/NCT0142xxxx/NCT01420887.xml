  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to determine if the rehabilitative benefits of continuous&#xD;
      passive motion (CPM) will help preserve/restore the joint function and significantly improve&#xD;
      the rate of recovery of patients after the surgical release of elbow contractures better than&#xD;
      standard physiotherapy and static splinting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elbow stiffness and reduced motion commonly occur after elbow injury or surgery. With&#xD;
      traumatic injuries to the elbow, contractures are a common complication. Indeed, they are&#xD;
      expected in most cases. For patients with these injuries who are otherwise healthy, active&#xD;
      and require the restoration of full function in order to return to their previous level of&#xD;
      activity/work, this reduced motion can be especially problematic and even debilitating. The&#xD;
      investigators have found and published that most patients treated with postoperative&#xD;
      Continuous Passive Motion following surgical repair of their stiffness have been able to&#xD;
      recover all or nearly all of their prior elbow mobility and function. Though CPM has been in&#xD;
      clinical use for decades, a prospective randomized clinical trial has never been published&#xD;
      proving its effectiveness. The investigators believe and intend to show in this study that&#xD;
      the rehabilitative benefits of continuous passive motion (CPM) will help preserve/restore the&#xD;
      joint function and significantly improve the rate of recovery of patients after stiffness is&#xD;
      surgically repaired. Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that postoperative use of CPM enhances&#xD;
      tissue healing and hastens recovery following surgical release of elbow contracture. Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2: To demonstrate that postoperative use of CPM improves ultimate function following&#xD;
      surgical release of elbow contracture. Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that CPM is a&#xD;
      cost-efficient treatment following surgical release of elbow contracture. Study Design: 50&#xD;
      patients who require arthroscopic contracture release, will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two postoperative treatment groups: Experimental - CPM and Control - Physical Therapy.&#xD;
      Participants of this study will be followed for 12 months postoperatively. Throughout this 12&#xD;
      month period the impact/effectiveness of CPM vs Physical Therapy will be evaluated by&#xD;
      assessing functional status, pain, mobility, general health related quality of life, utility,&#xD;
      and societal cost-effectiveness. In line with the mission of the National Institute of&#xD;
      Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, this study will help anyone with elbow&#xD;
      injuries that result in stiffness and loss of motion. Such a study has the advantage of being&#xD;
      highly translational with the potential to have an immediate impact on patient treatment and&#xD;
      care. The findings from this study will be able to help patients immediately and ensure that&#xD;
      the principals of Evidence Based Medicine are applied to patients with these types of elbow&#xD;
      injuries and that they receive the treatment they need for the best possible recovery based&#xD;
      on hard evidence and scientific facts.&#xD;
