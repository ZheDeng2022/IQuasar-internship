    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will evaluate phyto-therapy's, in the form of blueberry powder,&#xD;
      synergistic effect on second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The&#xD;
      proposition is that the addition of blueberry polyphenolics to routine docetaxel therapy will&#xD;
      have a significant, positive effect in the response rate and overall survival.&#xD;

      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of using blueberry powder (rich in&#xD;
      anthocyanidins) as an adjunct therapy with the conventional chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      paclitaxel/docetaxel for treatment of NSCLC. The study is based on information from published&#xD;
      studies in which blueberry anthocyanidins (bioflavonoids which give blueberries their color)&#xD;
      have been shown to regulate a vast array of molecular targets, and on our own exciting and&#xD;
      compelling preliminary data showing that blueberry anthocyanidins elicited potent synergistic&#xD;
      chemo-sensitizing effects in two highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell&#xD;
      lines.&#xD;

&#xD;
