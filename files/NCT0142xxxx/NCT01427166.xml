  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the scientific literature has yet to provide sufficient evidence regarding the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of cording. The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the utility of non&#xD;
      invasive vascular imaging for assessing the pathophysiology of cording in a small study&#xD;
      cohort of patients who were treated for breast cancer. The hypothesis is that cording may&#xD;
      have a vascular etiology&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cords are bands of tissue that are present in the axilla following breast cancer surgery and&#xD;
      may extend across the antecubital fossa and into the forearm. Cords are often painful to&#xD;
      patients and limit their shoulder range of motion.The proposed study design involves the&#xD;
      recruitment of patients who are enrolled in Partners Protocol # 2008P000540, a prospective&#xD;
      analysis of symptoms, functionality and quality of life questionnaire to evaluate lymphedema&#xD;
      in patients following treatment for breast cancer. This protocol recruits newly diagnosed&#xD;
      breast cancer patients prior to any treatment interventions. Subjects are required to undergo&#xD;
      volumetric arm measurements and complete the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment for&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Questionnaire (LEFT-BC) which will allow for the evaluation of changes in&#xD;
      functionality, upper extremity utilization (fear associated avoidance), and quality of life.&#xD;
      Throughout treatment patients will be screened before and after each treatment event:&#xD;
      surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Following the conclusion of treatment for breast cancer,&#xD;
      patients will be measured at least 2 times per year (every 4-7 months). If during these study&#xD;
      visits the patient notes cording symptoms, the research staff administering the questionnaire&#xD;
      will be alerted. At this point, they will notify a designated medical provider who will&#xD;
      perform a physical examination of the area to confirm the presence of cording. Once the&#xD;
      presence of cording is verified, the patient will be provided with the opportunity to enroll&#xD;
      in the proposed trial. Due to the current limited knowledge on the nature of the condition,&#xD;
      the patients arm and axilla will have to be imaged within 7 days of the physical exam&#xD;
      confirmation. The patients will be asked to return to the vascular imaging lab located on the&#xD;
      Massachusetts's General Hospital's main campus. They will undergo a venous duplex ultrasound,&#xD;
      on a General Electric LOGIQ-9 unit with a Phillips-IU-22 probe.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be enrolled in Partners protocol # 2008P000540 &quot;Prospective Analysis&#xD;
             of Symptoms, Functionality and Quality of Life Questionnaires to Evaluate Lymphedema&#xD;
             in Patients Following Treatment for Breast Cancer&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed case of cording by a medical provider (Physician, Nurse Practitioner,&#xD;
             Physician Assistant)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with required follow up Perometer measurements and clinical&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are not enrolled or have been removed from Partners Protocol #&#xD;
             2008P000540 will be excluded from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior surgery or radiation to the head, neck, upper limb, or trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
