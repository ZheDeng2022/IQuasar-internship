  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if T2-18C3, a true human monoclonal antibody that&#xD;
      blocks inflammation, is safe to use in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will also be&#xD;
      looking at the ability of T2-18C3 to improve control of blood sugar levels in diabetics by&#xD;
      blocking inflammation in the pancreas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of T2-18C3 in patients&#xD;
      with T2D. Nine patients will receive four biweekly IV infusions of the study drug, T2-18C3,&#xD;
      at a dose level of 1.25 mg/kg. These patients will be followed for a total of 90 days to&#xD;
      examine safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
