  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Investigator Initiated study, the investigators want to explore the potential of an&#xD;
      induction therapy with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocking agents in a very early disease&#xD;
      stage (less than 3 months of symptom duration) of patients with predominant peripheral&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis (SpA), classified according to the new Assessment of SpondyloArthritis&#xD;
      (ASAS)-criteria. The hypothesis would be that treatment with a TNF-blocker at this early&#xD;
      (&quot;immature&quot;) stage of the disease would result in a significant higher number of patients in&#xD;
      clinical remission compared to placebo, and that - comparable to the early Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis (RA) patients in the BeSt-study - long-term treatment would not be necessary to&#xD;
      maintain this remission in a number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study (with open-label phase, starting&#xD;
      at week 24) sixty patients fulfilling the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis (ASAS) criteria of&#xD;
      peripheral spondylarthritis will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (2&#xD;
      golimumab :1 placebo). During the placebo-controlled phase, 50mg golimumab, or placebo will&#xD;
      be administrated subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks through week 20. Subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with open-label Golimumab 50 mg SC injections at weeks 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. If&#xD;
      patients are in 'clinical remission' (clinical remission is defined by the absence of&#xD;
      arthritis, enthesitis and dactylitis clinically at two major consecutive visits. Visits are&#xD;
      planned at week 12, week 24, week 36 and week 48) then the treatment will be stopped. In case&#xD;
      of clinical relapse, patients will be treated with open-label golimumab 50 mg SC. Patients in&#xD;
      sustained clinical remission will be observed to assess the possibility of maintaining&#xD;
      drug-free remission. The study duration will be 48 weeks.&#xD;
