      The study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study the safety of the drug (HF1020) in healthy male adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study how well the study drug (HF1020) is tolerated in healthy male adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  find the maximum dose that is tolerated in healthy male adults&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male subjects will be randomised to give a total of 32 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be sequentially enrolled into 4 cohorts of ascending dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomised to receive 0.5 milligrams (mg) HF1020 or placebo&#xD;
      (ratio 3:1). When at least 8 subjects within the cohort have completed Day 2 procedures (i.e.&#xD;
      Day 1 + 24 hours) and all ongoing subjects have completed the final Day 15 visit, a Safety&#xD;
      Review Committee (SRC) will meet, review all safety data prior to dose escalation to the next&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 2 will be randomised to receive 2.5 mg HF1020 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 3 will be randomised to receive 10mg HF1020 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 4 will be randomised to receive 25mg HF1020 or placebo.&#xD;
