      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best way to give dasatinib and&#xD;
      cyclosporine in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory or&#xD;
      intolerant to imatinib mesylate. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cyclosporine may help dasatinib work better by&#xD;
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving dasatinib together with cyclosporine&#xD;
      may be an effective treatment for CML.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the safety and tolerability of cyclosporine A in combination with dasatinib in&#xD;
      adults with Bcr-Abl+ chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, or when used in specified&#xD;
      patients with accelerated phase CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib when combined with cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether the combination of dasatinib and cyclosporine alters T cell number and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the feasibility of determining phosphorylation of Src in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells by flow cytometry as a surrogate measure of dasatinib activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cyclosporine PO twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 8-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo peripheral blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during&#xD;
      treatment for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and T-cell number and function by&#xD;
      flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

             al., 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intolerance of TKI therapy shall be defined by non-hematologic toxic effects of any&#xD;
             grade leading to intermittent or chronic non-compliance with, repeated dose reduction&#xD;

               -  Patients must have discontinued imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib at least 7 days&#xD;
                  prior to starting study therapy; this washout period may be omitted at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the PIs, if it is determined that the washout may adversely affect&#xD;
                  patient care&#xD;
&#xD;

             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of dasatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason&#xD;
             and because PTK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry; women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;

             2), due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases exclude patients from this clinical trial because such patients&#xD;
             have a poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             in addition, patients who have active brain metastases may benefit from other&#xD;
             concurrent therapy such as radiation or radiosurgery, and should be considered for the&#xD;
             most appropriate clinical therapy that may provide symptom relief&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to dasatinib or cyclosporine&#xD;

             abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of antithrombotic and/or anti-platelet agents (e.g., warfarin, heparin, low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparin, aspirin, and/or ibuprofen); exception: patients with CML who&#xD;
             have significantly elevated platelet counts taking anagrelide are eligible; patients&#xD;
             who require &lt; 2 mg of warfarin per day for central venous catheter prophylaxis are&#xD;
             allowed on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an&#xD;
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their&#xD;
             ability to swallow and retain dasatinib tablets are excluded; tablets may not be&#xD;
             crushed prior to administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease, defined as&#xD;
             NYHA class III or higher and as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prolonged QTc &gt;= 480 msec (Fridericia correction)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ejection fraction less than institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of breath,&#xD;
             chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without&#xD;
             stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out QTc&#xD;
             prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the&#xD;
             principal investigator; patients with underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be&#xD;
             excluded from the study&#xD;

             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies with dasatinib have&#xD;
             shown embryolethality and fetal skeletal alterations at non-toxic maternal doses;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing human&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;

             Bcr-Abl mutations have not been assessed, will have this assessment in screening; they&#xD;
             will be allowed to enroll and initiate therapy; if screening analysis reveals Bcr-Abl&#xD;
             mutation known to confer resistance to dasatinib, the patient will be discontinued&#xD;
             from study participation)&#xD;
