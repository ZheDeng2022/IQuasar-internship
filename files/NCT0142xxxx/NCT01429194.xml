  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACE) Stapler is an investigational system using&#xD;
      endoscopic guidance to trans-orally place plications in the stomach in obese subjects to&#xD;
      reduce volume and expansion of the fundus and greater curve to abate hunger as part of a&#xD;
      supervised weight reduction program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to perform an evaluation of the safety of the&#xD;
      plication procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the ACE&#xD;
      Stapler for the treatment of obesity over a 24 month follow-up period.&#xD;

      This study was originally sponsored by BaroSense, Inc (protocol 11-03). 69 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled and treated as part of the study at 6 centers in 4 countries outside the United&#xD;
      States. On April 30, 2013 BaroSense Inc went out of business and the study was terminated&#xD;
      with all participating centers' Ethics Committees. At the point of study termination, all&#xD;
      patients were in the middle of post procedure follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boston Scientific has since acquired the technology and study and will re-initiate follow-up&#xD;
      to 24 months in order to collect data to support the original safety and efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      of the protocol. Only the 69 subjects previously enrolled and treated in BaroSense's protocol&#xD;
      11-03 will be eligible for participation in the Boston Scientific continued follow-up study&#xD;
      (&quot;The ACE Follow-up Study&quot; protocol 90891629). The Boston Scientific protocol will be&#xD;
      approved by participating centers' Ethics Committees and patients who choose to participate&#xD;
      in The ACE Follow-up Study will need to sign a new, Ethics Committee Approved, informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
