      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A person who has a traumatic brain injury (TBI) -- also called concussion -- can have&#xD;
      serious and long-lasting effects. Doctors who treat TBI need more information about how the&#xD;
      brain changes over time in people with TBI and how well a person recovers from it. To make&#xD;
      existing TBI treatments more effective and develop new ones, researchers want to look more&#xD;
      closely at how TBI affects people both physically and psychologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect medical information from people with recent traumatic brain injury and compare&#xD;
      this information to that of healthy volunteers and of persons who have had injuries to other&#xD;
      parts of their bodies besides their heads (such as broken bones, orthopedic injuries, after&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 groups of people between the ages of 18 and 70 years will be asked to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons who have had a traumatic brain injury (or concussion ) within the past 30 days,&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons who are healthy and have never had a traumatic brain injury, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons who have had an injury within the past 30 days to a part of their body other&#xD;
           than the head (such as a broken bone, orthopedic injury, surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires two outpatient visits each lasting 1 1/2 days. The 2 visits will be&#xD;
           about 30 days apart. Persons with TBI and non-TBI injuries must have their first visit&#xD;
           within 30 days of their injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
           blood tests and electrocradiogram (ECG a routine heart test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research will involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Giving blood samples (no more than 75 ml each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Having tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking (neuropsychological&#xD;
                testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Having imaging studies of the head including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
                positron emission tomography (PET) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons with TBI will have the same tests at Visit 1 and 2. Healthy controls and persons&#xD;
           with non-TBI injuries will have the same tests at Visit 1 as listed above. But, at Visit&#xD;
           2, they will not have brain MRIs or PETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatments will be provided as part of this research protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people under age&#xD;
      45 in industrialized countries, but there is no specific treatment available for TBI.&#xD;
      Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are markers of vascular injury that are&#xD;
      mobilized after signaling with cytokines, interleukins, MMP9 and other biomarkers (BM) that&#xD;
      may be detected in blood. However, the relation of EPC and these BM to TBI severity has not&#xD;
      been quantified. MRI measurements of lesion volume provide an objective method for TBI&#xD;
      severity assessment and outcome prediction. Moreover, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is&#xD;
      sensitive to detect TBI-related axonal injury, and PET (positron emission tomography) is&#xD;
      useful in functional interpretation of image findings. This cross-sectional study aims to&#xD;
      determine whether EPC and other BM are associated with MRI, DTI and PET findings, and with&#xD;
      functional outcomes in TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate levels of EPC and other BMs participating&#xD;
      in EPC mobilization in TBI patients in comparison to the healthy volunteers and to the&#xD;
      non-TBI trauma controls. The second objective is to relate EPC and BM levels to TBI severity&#xD;
      quantified by functional and radiological evaluations (MRI, DTI and PET). The third objective&#xD;
      is to determine, if there is a relationship between the level of EPC and other BM and&#xD;
      functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 male or female participants between 18 and 70 years of age will be enrolled within 30&#xD;
      days of a moderate TBI (classified as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9-12) or mild TBI (GCS&#xD;
      13-15). If participants had post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) it must have lasted less than 7 days&#xD;
      and any loss of consciousness (LOC) must have lasted less than 24 hours. Fifty healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and 50 persons with non-TBI injuries (such as broken bones, orthopedic injuries or&#xD;
      surgery) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before participating in this protocol, TBI and non-TBI injured participants must have&#xD;
      received routine clinical evaluations for their injuries in hospitals, doctors offices or&#xD;
      other medical facilities. They may be referred to the NIH Clinical Center after discharge or&#xD;
      they may be self-referred. They must be willing to have their medical records sent to the NIH&#xD;
      to assure that their injuries fit the protocol inclusion criteria. Healthy volunteers may be&#xD;
      recruited from families of other participants but most will be recruited through the NIH&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office (PRPL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an outpatient, observational study. Eligible participants will come to the NIH for&#xD;
      two 1 1/2 day outpatient visits separated by 30 days. Persons with TBI will have the same&#xD;
      tests at each of their two visits: a history and physical exam, electrocardiogram, research&#xD;
      blood draws (no more than 75 ml each visit), pregnancy and HIV testing, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and positron emission tomography scan&#xD;
      (PET scan). Healthy controls and persons with non-TBI injuries will have the same tests at&#xD;
      visit 1 as listed above. At visit 2, they will have all the same tests except they will not&#xD;
      have brain MRIs or PETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide novel data regarding the association of levels of EPC and the blood&#xD;
      BMs with severity of imaging-positive TBI. This study will provide a foundation for the&#xD;
      development of interventional trials aiming to improve neovascularization in TBI patients.&#xD;
