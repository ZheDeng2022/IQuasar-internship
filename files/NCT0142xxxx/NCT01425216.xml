  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of keloid disorder is an area of unmet medical need. Current treatments for keloid&#xD;
      partially address small and localized keloids, yet there are no wholly satisfactory or&#xD;
      effective treatments for patients with extensive keloids. Such patients may benefit from&#xD;
      effective systemic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib has the potential to regulate the three known dysregulated biological pathways in&#xD;
      keloid tissue.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysregulation of several intracellular pathways have been reported by various investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [A] Dysregulated apoptosis pathway: p53 mutations have been found in both hypertrophic scar&#xD;
      and keloids fibroblasts from cultured cells to various extents. p53 plays a central role in&#xD;
      the DNA damage response by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death. Time&#xD;
      course experiments making cell cultures at different times to investigate the phenomenon of&#xD;
      apoptosis and its involvement in the process of pathological scarring in both hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars and keloid indicate to dysregulation of apoptotic pathways in Keloid tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [B]Dysregulated TGF- β signaling: Transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF- β1) is well known as&#xD;
      the crucial fibrogenic cytokine promoting ECM production and tissue fibrosis in keloid&#xD;
      forming [9]. TGF- β1 is an essential profibrotic cytokine for collagen synthesis, and it is&#xD;
      well known to increase mRNA expression of procollagen I. Administration of TGF- β1 resulted&#xD;
      in a dramatic increase in intracellular collagen I levels in keloid fibroblasts. Due to the&#xD;
      close relationship between TGF- β signaling and the production of collagen, blocking TGF- β&#xD;
      signaling has the potential of repressing fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis,&#xD;
      thereby preventing the formation of keloids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [C]Dysregulated VEGF signaling pathway: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor), one of the&#xD;
      most widely studied secreted factors involved in angiogenesis, has been implicated as crucial&#xD;
      to normal and pathological wound healing [18]. Gira et al. [19] indicated that VEGF&#xD;
      production is abundant in the underlying dermis of keloids. In vitro studies have indicated&#xD;
      that VEGF is expressed at higher levels in keloid-derived Fibroblasts than in normal skin&#xD;
      Fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor and has been reported to be an effective&#xD;
      inhibitor of apoptosis, TGF-β signaling and VEGF pathway signaling, making it an ideal drug&#xD;
      to test in the setting of extensive keloid disorder.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. All patients will keep a drug diary in order to record compliance with their drug regime. Sorafenib will be taken orally. Maximum length of treatment is 6 months. Starting dose of sorafenib is 200 mg three times per week for one month. In absence of Grade 2 toxicity, the dose will be increased on a monthly basis and will stop at 400 mg twice daily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical Diagnosis of a keloid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of extensive keloid disease as defined in section 1.3&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age 18 to 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A signed informed consent document (ICD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able and willing to receive sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening. The&#xD;
        effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
        child-bearing potential, and men, must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
        study participation and three months beyond the last dose of sorafenib. Should a woman&#xD;
        become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
        inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of any degree of hypertension, even medically controlled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of any form of cardiovascular disease or stroke&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Psychological Illness that may result in non compliance with treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to eggs (sorafenib is formulated&#xD;
             using egg phospholipids).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded&#xD;
             because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with the investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who cannot swallow pills for whatever reason will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients having any history or current evidence of a bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients who are taking, or have taken anticoagulants in past 12 months for any&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             sorafenib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding is not allowed during the course&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients will be advised not to get pregnant during the first 3 months from last&#xD;
        administered dose of sorafenib. Men will be advised to continue using barrier method&#xD;
        contraception and not father a child during the first 3 months from last administered dose&#xD;
        of sorafenib&#xD;
