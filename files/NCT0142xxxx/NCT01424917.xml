      Post transplant vasculopathy is a major negative outcome in heart transplantation. Current&#xD;
      methods of detection are highly invasive and pose a risk to transplant recipients.&#xD;
      Noninvasive markers of endothelial function can be used to detect transplant vasculopathy.&#xD;
      Endothelial biomarkers such as: endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular cellular adhesion&#xD;
      molecules, intracellular adhesion molecules, endothelin-1, thromboplastin, circulating&#xD;
      endothelial cells, uric acid, and C-reactive play a role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of&#xD;
      vasculopathy. Therefore, the investigators would like to assess the association between&#xD;
      various endothelial biomarkers and the presence or absence of transplant vasculopathy.&#xD;

      Cardiac transplantation has become the established treatment of choice for eligible patients&#xD;
      with end-stage heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major and potentially preventable limitation to&#xD;
      long-term survival in cardiac transplant recipients. CAV affects up to 50% of recipients by&#xD;
      year 5, though intimal thickening is present in up to 58% one year after transplantation. CAV&#xD;
      is characterized by diffuse, concentric intimal hyperplasia, involving both epicardial and&#xD;
      intramyocardial coronary arteries. In its most advanced stages, CAV is not amenable to&#xD;
      standard revascularization procedures making the only cure re-transplantation. Given the&#xD;
      limited donor pool and poor outcome, re-transplantation is not an option for all patients.&#xD;
      CAV tends to be a silent process. Due to denervation of the transplanted heart, transplant&#xD;
      recipients do not typically have chest pain, and thus the first symptoms of CAV may be those&#xD;
      of heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Traditional risk factors are important in&#xD;
      predicting the development of CAV, however non-traditional risk factors appear equally&#xD;
      important and include cellular and humoral rejection, graft ischemia at the time of&#xD;
      implantation, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Despite the specific inciting event, the end result&#xD;
      is endothelial dysfunction, which is the predecessor to CAV. Methods to detect, prevent, and&#xD;
      treat endothelial dysfunction and subsequently CAV are few. The rapidity with which it&#xD;
      develops, however, affords a great opportunity to study mechanisms and potential&#xD;
      interventions in a relatively short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation and immune activation and subsequent endothelial injury are felt to&#xD;
      immunopathogenic in the development of CAV. Endothelial activation is a precursor to the&#xD;
      development of transplant vasculopathy, and multiple biomarkers have been shown to correlate&#xD;
      with the presence of endothelial dysfunction in transplant vasculopathy. (fig. 1) Endothelial&#xD;
      activation, as determined by the presence of adhesion molecules, begins hours after brain&#xD;
      death in a donor. VCAM-1, e-selectin, and p-selectin are expressed early after brain death in&#xD;
      the donor and are elevated throughout transplantation in the recipient as a response to&#xD;
      injury in the donor heart. P-selectin and VCAM remain elevated while e-selectin gradually&#xD;
      decrease over three months. There is data suggesting that p-selectin and VCAM remain elevated&#xD;
      up to 2 years after transplantation, suggesting persistent inflammation and immune activation&#xD;
      after transplant. Furthermore, nitric oxide is the principal mediator of protective effects&#xD;
      on the endothelium. The nitric oxide pathway is essential in maintaining vascular integrity&#xD;
      in cardiac recipients, and inhibition of this pathway accelerates intimal thickening and&#xD;
      worsens endothelial function caused by rejection. Intimal thickening is a marker of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and a precursor to the development of CAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, these markers and others involved in atherogenesis, remodeling, immune activation and&#xD;
      endothelial activation, may provide a useful modality in predicting the presence of&#xD;
      vasculopathy. In addition, studying various components of the process, eg. inflammation and&#xD;
      injury, will provide much needed information regarding targets for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive assessments of peripheral artery function have demonstrated correlation with&#xD;
      coronary artery function and are useful modalities to assess risk for coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. Pulse wave amplitude and hyperemic response, using digital tonometry, are measures&#xD;
      of peripheral endothelial function and have been shown to correlate with coronary&#xD;
      microvascular function. Abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation and macrocirculation&#xD;
      precede the development of vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Other measures of&#xD;
      peripheral endothelial function include arterial elasticity (measured using CV Profiler, HDI,&#xD;
      inc.) and flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD). These studies are sensitive&#xD;
      noninvasive predictors of coronary artery disease, though have not been tested widely in the&#xD;
      transplanted population. The investigators will use these studies to characterize peripheral&#xD;
      artery function in heart transplant recipients and to determine whether they will be useful&#xD;
      adjuncts in evaluating patients at risk for transplant vasculopathy. The ability to predict&#xD;
      the development of vasculopathy before it is present provides an opportunity to intervene by&#xD;
      escalating or modifying therapy and an opportunity to possibly prevent CAV, a major&#xD;
      limitation to longevity of transplant recipients.&#xD;
