  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare malignancy, occurring either as a sporadic&#xD;
      disease (75% of cases), or in a hereditary pattern as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type&#xD;
      2 (MEN2A or MEN2B) or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). The MTC arises from the&#xD;
      neural crest C-cells and in hereditary cases the first pathological disorder is C-cell&#xD;
      hyperplasia (CCH) Most patients with MTC have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy have been minimally effective. Molecular targeted&#xD;
      therapeutics (MTTs) and other receptor kinases in patients with advanced MTC have&#xD;
      demonstrated activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite some clinical responses, the collection of tumor tissues and autologous normal&#xD;
      tissues has been virtually non-existent. Thus, laboratory studies defining affected molecular&#xD;
      targets and downstream pathways, and molecular data providing direction for future clinical&#xD;
      trials has yet to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from molecular studies of tumor tissue of hereditary or sporadic MTC patients will&#xD;
      assist in predicting clinical behavior and the biology of MTC in predicting response to a&#xD;
      given MTT, and in designing combination clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarify how normal molecular pathways are altered by mutations in the RET protooncogene.&#xD;
      Including additional genetic mutations and unidentified chromosomal translocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlate results from molecular analyses of MTC tissue with patient s clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define how the molecular and clinical data will be useful in designing targeted therapy for&#xD;
      patients with MTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have confirmed diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia, primary MTC, or metastatic MTC&#xD;
      with archived pathology specimens available at Washington University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraffin blocks of MTC tissues from archival samples at Washington University Department of&#xD;
      Pathology will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H&amp;E slide from selected tissue blocks will be examined for molecular study suitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessary tissue samples from blocks will have molecular studies, including, gene arrays,&#xD;
      array comparative genomic hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective chart review will occur to obtain relevant clinical information.&#xD;
