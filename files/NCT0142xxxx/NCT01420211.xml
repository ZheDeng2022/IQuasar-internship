      The objective of the study is to assess the hepatic uptake of Primovist® after intravenous&#xD;
      administration of 25 µmol/kg body weight in 56 healthy volunteers and in 60 patients with a&#xD;
      liver disease in dependence on the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-genotype.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (Gadoxetate, Gd-EOB-DTPA,&#xD;
      Primovist®) is a newly developed paramagnetic hepatobiliary contrast agent for magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) based on the extracellular fluid marker gadopentetate (Magnevist®).&#xD;
      After intravenous administration, Gd-EOB-DTPA distributes rapidly within the intravascular&#xD;
      and extracellular spaces and is taken up selectively by hepatocytes. The compound is&#xD;
      eliminated from the blood and from the body mainly by two pathways: glomerular filtration of&#xD;
      the kidneys and hepatobiliary excretion. There is many evidence that the hepatic uptake of&#xD;
      Gd-EOB-DTPA from the sinusoidal blood is influenced by specific hepatic transporters of the&#xD;
      organic anion transporter (OATP) family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the highly liver specific agent has been demonstrated that it markedly improves the&#xD;
      quality of detection of focal liver lesions (adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma). Because gadoxetate is taken up both in the normal liver parenchyma&#xD;
      as well as in focal liver lesions of hepatocellular origin, it allows to distinguish between&#xD;
      hepatocyte-containing and non-hepatocyte-containing tissue. In some indications (e.g.&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma), liver-specific contrast&#xD;
      media like Gd-EOB-DTPA are superior to biphasic spiral computertomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic enhancement after intravenous administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA is known to be inhibited&#xD;
      by bromosulfophthalein, taurocholate and rifampicin. Obviously, Gd-EOB-DTPA and other drugs&#xD;
      compete for the organic anion transporters of the hepatocytes. In Oatp1 cRNA injected oocytes&#xD;
      of Xenopus leavis, a saturable uptake of gadoxetic acid has been demonstrated. Since the&#xD;
      human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (previous names: OATP-C, L-ST1,&#xD;
      OATP2), which is responsible for the hepatic uptake of several endogenous and exogenous&#xD;
      compounds like bile acids, bilirubin, peptides, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones,&#xD;
      methotrexate, statins and ezetimibe, is predominantly expressed in the basolateral membrane&#xD;
      of hepatocytes, Gd-EOB-DTPA might be a substrate of this uptake transporter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there were described functional relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for&#xD;
      OATP1B1, which were responsible for markedly reduced transporter function and which were even&#xD;
      shown to alter plasma concentrations of pravastatin and ezetimibe in vivo, we want to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of several genotypes of OATP1B1 on disposition of Gd-EOB-DTPA. While&#xD;
      *15 and *5 carriers of OATP1B1 were described to exhibit decreased lipid-lowering potency and&#xD;
      increased statin-induced myopathy, *1b carriers exerted a significantly reduced&#xD;
      bioavailability of ezetimibe. Due to the fact that the interesting haplotypes like OATP1B1&#xD;
      *15 and *1b are in fact relatively common in European subjects, we intend to define its&#xD;
      influence on Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics and on different signal intensities in magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OATP 1B3 (previous names: OATP8,LST-2), which is also predominantly expressed in the&#xD;
      basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, is responsible for the hepatic uptake of several&#xD;
      endogenous and exogenous compounds like bile acids, 17β-glucuronosyl estradiol, BSP or&#xD;
      digoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence from very recent experimental studies in our laboratory, that Primovist® is&#xD;
      not only a substrate of OATP1B1 but also of the second liver specific uptake transporter&#xD;
      OATP1B3. The MRT contrast agent inhibits the uptake of BSP in HEK tansfected with human&#xD;
      OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and it is also better taken up by these cells than by non-transfected&#xD;
      parental cells. Therefore, we concluded that OATP1B3 might be additionally to OATP1B1 an&#xD;
      specific uptake transporter in human liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very recently, at least six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of OATP1B3 have been&#xD;
      described in literature. At least two of them were described to be of functional relevance:&#xD;
      334T&gt;G (Ser112Ala) and 699G&gt;A (met233Ile). The allele frequencies of the 334T&gt;G and 699G&gt;A&#xD;
      variants in European Caucasians were reported to be 74 % and 71%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of these amino-acid substitutions on OATP1B3 transport function and cellular&#xD;
      localization seems to be substrate and cell line dependent. In man, it was shown that&#xD;
      OATP1B3*2 influences obviously the hepatic uptake of erythromycin and hence the results of&#xD;
      the ERMBT (erythromycin breath test) in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, carriers of OATP1B3 334T&gt;G and OATP1B3 699G&gt;A are planned to be included into the&#xD;
      study with Primovist® to confirm whether the selective hepatic uptake carrier OATP1B3 is&#xD;
      involved in hepatic uptake of the MRI contrast agent additionally to OATP1B1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several animal studies a reduced enhancement of Gd-EOB-DTPA was observed in acute&#xD;
      hepatitis, fatty liver and cholestasis models. Obviously the hepatic uptake of gadexotate&#xD;
      might be determined by liver diseases which lead to an altered function of hepatocytes.&#xD;
      Therefore it is a further aim of the study to assess the influence of liver diseases on&#xD;
      Gd-EOB-DTPA pharmacokinetics and signal intensity and its possible modification by the&#xD;
      OATP1B1-genotype in 60 patients which are subjected to MR imaging of the liver.&#xD;
