  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active forms of vitamin D and its analogs are used to treat elevated parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      levels and bone disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD). More recent animal and human studies&#xD;
      suggest that treatment with vitamin D may be associated with reduction of inflammation and&#xD;
      urinary protein loss as well as reduction the activity of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)&#xD;
      in addition to its effects on the bone metabolism. The investigators of this study have used&#xD;
      the new technique of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) to measure the flow of blood to the&#xD;
      kidney in other human studies. In this study, the investigators will investigate if 3 month&#xD;
      of treatment with an active form of vitamin D in individuals with kidney disease and high&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone levels would reduce protein loss in the urine. The investigators will&#xD;
      also look at the potential changes in blood flow to the kidney using CEU, kidney function&#xD;
      (GFR), inflammation and activity of RAS in response to treatment with active form of vitamin&#xD;
      D. Finally, they will examine the association between reduction of protein loss in the urine&#xD;
      as shown in other studies with any of the other factors measured (e.g, change in blood flow&#xD;
      or inflammation).&#xD;

      Screening visit, (Day 1) Most subjects will be contacted during their visit to the Kidney&#xD;
      Center Clinic. In some cases, subjects are identified a few days after their visit with their&#xD;
      nephrologists and once their laboratory results are available. If a subject is eligible for&#xD;
      participation in the study, screening visit will occur at the Nephrology Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center located right next to the Kidney Center Clinic. The following will occur during the&#xD;
      screening visit,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Details of the study procedures will be reviewed with the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent is signed and the subjects will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A physical exam will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vital Signs will be taken (blood pressure and heart rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of child bearing age. If positive&#xD;
           subjects will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If a urine test for proteinuria is not ordered at the clinic visit by subjects'&#xD;
           nephrologist, a urine sample will be collected and sent to the laboratory for urine&#xD;
           creatinine and urine protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects will be asked to present to the CRU within one week of their screening visit in&#xD;
           the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subjects will be asked not to start vitamin D pills prescribed by their nephrologists&#xD;
           until after completing study visit 2 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 2 - 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A physical exam will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital Signs will be taken (blood pressure and heart rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A urine sample will be collected and will be tested for,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine creatinine (baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine protein (baseline)&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. A large bore intravenous catheter will be placed in a peripheral vein for the purpose of&#xD;
           infusion of Definity and will be locked with heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood samples will be collected at the time of IV catheter placement. These samples will&#xD;
           be checked for baseline concentrations of ,&#xD;

           saturation is &lt;90% the subject will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subjects will need to lie in bed on their back and remain in bed until the test&#xD;
           procedures are completed (may be up to use a bedside commode).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Resting ultrasonography will be performed on both kidneys to determine kidney volume,&#xD;
           and Doppler studies will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Color Doppler from the subcostal view will be performed to rule out the possibility of&#xD;
           intracardiac shunts. These individuals will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The Definity vial will be placed at room temperature before being used. It will be&#xD;
           activated after shaking the vial using Vialmax for 45 seconds. It will be used&#xD;
           immediately after activation.&#xD;
&#xD;

           Definity into a peripheral vein will be started at 2 ml/min and titrated for optimal&#xD;
           image quality (not to exceed 10 ml/min at any time).&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. To assess optimal microbubble concentration based upon video intensity, ultrasound&#xD;
           images of the left ventricle will be obtained and used as the control. Microbubble&#xD;
           administration will then be titrated accordingly but not to exceed 10 ml/min at any&#xD;
           time.&#xD;

&#xD;
       16. One to four impulses with high MI of 1.0 will be used to destruct the microbubbles and&#xD;
           then imaging of the kidney with low MI (0.1) will continue for several seconds to a few&#xD;
           minutes. Infusion of Definity will stop at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. During the administration of Definity, vital signs including heart rate and pulse&#xD;
           oximetry will be obtained continuously&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       20. Subjects will be discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. At the time of discharge each subject will be asked to start taking the active vitamin D&#xD;
           pill prescribed by their nephrologists. They will be asked to inform us if they stop&#xD;
           their medication for any reason within the next three months.&#xD;
