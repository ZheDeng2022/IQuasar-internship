    <textblock>
      To determine the impact on Interpreting Physician performance in detecting breast cancer, as&#xD;
      defined by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), when Automated&#xD;
      Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) and screening mammography (XRM) are combined, compared to screening&#xD;
      mammography alone in asymptomatic women with &gt;50% parenchymal density and a screening&#xD;
      mammogram assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category 1 (negative) or 2 (normal with benign&#xD;
      findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the improved Reader performance is illustrated by plotting the ROC curves for&#xD;
      XRM alone and XRM+ABUS. If Reader performance improves with the addition of ABUS to the XRM,&#xD;
      the area under the curve (AUC) for XRM+ABUS (AUCXRM+ABUS) will be greater than the area under&#xD;
      the curve for XRM Alone (AUCXRM Alone). This difference is represented as ∆AUCABUS. The null&#xD;
      and alternative hypotheses can be formally expressed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: ∆AUCABUS = 0, AUCXRM+ABUS = AUCXRM Alone The null hypothesis is that Reader performance&#xD;
      will be unchanged with the addition of ABUS to a screening mammogram assigned a BI-RADS&#xD;
      Assessment Category of 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA: ∆AUCABUS ≠ 0, AUCXRM+ABUS ≠ AUCXRM Alone The alternative hypothesis is that Reader&#xD;
      performance will be changed with the addition of ABUS to a screening mammogram assigned a&#xD;
      BI-RADS Assessment Category of 1 or 2. A statistically significant change will be considered&#xD;
      equivalent to a statistically significant improvement if the estimated value of AUCXRM+ABUS&#xD;
      is greater than that of AUCXRM Alone with statistical significance at an alpha level of .05&#xD;
      for a two-sided test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Clinical Retrospective Reader Study is an observational case-controlled, multi-reader&#xD;
      multi-case Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) study involving approximately 16&#xD;
      Interpreting Physicians (Readers) and approximately 200 breast screening cases which will be&#xD;
      reviewed and of those, 164 breast screening cases will be included in the primary data&#xD;
      analysis. All primary data analysis cases will consist of screening mammogram and Automated&#xD;
      Breast Ultrasound image readings from the same asymptomatic females with &gt;50% parenchymal&#xD;
      density for whom the screening mammogram was assigned a BI-RADS Assessment Category 1&#xD;
      (negative) or 2 (normal with benign findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Readers will review a total of 200 cases: the Non-Cancer Case Set, the Cancer Case Set,&#xD;
      and additional Control and Supplemental Case Sets. These cases will be randomized during the&#xD;
      reading session so each Reader will review the entire Case Set in a unique order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis will be performed on the Readers'&#xD;
      Likelihood of Malignancy (LOM) ratings from their initial review of the screening mammogram&#xD;
      alone and their final review of the screening mammogram and Automated Breast Ultrasound for&#xD;
      the Non-Cancer Case Set and Cancer Case Set.&#xD;
