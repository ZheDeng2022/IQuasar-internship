  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few recommendations concerning the diet and dosage to be administered to patients treated&#xD;
      with corticosteroids are established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems important to study prospectively the indication of a diet low in salt and&#xD;
      sugar in patients undergoing corticosteroid therapy, to record side effects observed and to&#xD;
      measure their frequency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the French clinical patterns governing the prescription of corticosteroids, it is&#xD;
      customary to prescribe a diet low in salt and low in sugar. This dietary prescription is&#xD;
      based on the interest of any diet to prevent the occurrence of side effects of steroids such&#xD;
      as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and congestive heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no specific dietary requirements in other European countries. This lack of&#xD;
      recommendations is based on the fact that there is no evidence that a strict diet reduces the&#xD;
      side effects of steroids on the one hand and secondly, that the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      undergoing a diet low in salt and low in sugars affects their quality of life. In addition,&#xD;
      no prospective study has helped to establish the frequency of side effects of corticosteroids&#xD;
      depending on dose and duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to study whether a diet intervention with low salt or low&#xD;
      sugar during a prolonged corticosteroid treatment has any interest and effectively reduces&#xD;
      the frequency and severity of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that all parameters being equal, to randomize the diet of patients&#xD;
      started on steroids for a predictable period of 3 months minimum for a dose greater than 20&#xD;
      mg per day. One group will observe the low-salt diet, low in sugar and the other will follow&#xD;
      a normal diet. The assessment will be made after 1 year, even if steroid treatment is&#xD;
      continued beyond.&#xD;
