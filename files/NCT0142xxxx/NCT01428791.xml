      Linkages between depression and cardiovascular disease have been well documented. These&#xD;
      appear to be more than associations, and may reflect causal relationships through a number of&#xD;
      proposed pathways, including decreased physical activity, poor dietary habits, medication&#xD;
      non-adherence, and a direct impact on inflammatory mediators. Older adults are affected by&#xD;
      both depression and heart disease, with increased risk in African American and Latino&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRIGHTEN-Heart trial tests the hypothesis that an enhanced primary care delivery system&#xD;
      intervention which provides evidence-based, patient-centered mental health services targeting&#xD;
      depression and cardiovascular risk factors can reduce the risk of development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in low-income elderly blacks and Hispanics. BRIGHTEN stands for&#xD;
      Bridging Resources of a Geriatric Health Team via Electronic Networking, and in this&#xD;
      intervention, specialty providers including geropsychologists, social workers, pharmacists,&#xD;
      nutritionists, chaplains, occupational therapists, and others collaborate via the internet as&#xD;
      a virtual team. The study will determine if such a virtual interdisciplinary clinical team&#xD;
      collaboration can reduce depression in older (age ≥ 65) minority adults with comorbid&#xD;
      depression and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chicago has been characterized as one of America's most segregated cities, with many&#xD;
      neighborhoods characterized by black and Hispanic populations living in concentrated pockets&#xD;
      of poverty. In addition to lowered socioeconomic status, these neighborhoods are also&#xD;
      characterized by remarkable health disparities relative to wealthier, predominantly white&#xD;
      neighborhoods only a few miles away. Disparities in access to health services contribute to&#xD;
      these poorer health outcomes, but are not wholly explanatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the US, both black and Hispanic&#xD;
      adults have elevated rates of many major risk factors including physical inactivity, obesity,&#xD;
      elevated levels of Fasting Blood Glucose, and dyslipidemia. Blacks also have elevated rates&#xD;
      of hypertension, and experience well-documented excess mortality rates. Experts are&#xD;
      anticipating that, given high prevalence of risk factors, most importantly the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, similar disparities in cardiovascular mortality may soon emerge for Hispanics as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond cardiovascular disease, these populations face psychosocial challenges such as&#xD;
      poverty, unemployment, societal racism, and high rates of major and traumatic life stress,&#xD;
      all of which can contribute to high rates of depression and anxiety symptoms. Even the&#xD;
      physical environment adds to the levels of stress: empty buildings that can become criminal&#xD;
      and drug havens, boarded up storefronts, lack of groceries providing access to fresh fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables (so-called &quot;food deserts&quot;). Disparities in access to health services, and&#xD;
      these environmental conditions, as well as personal and familial factors associated with&#xD;
      poverty are related to health disparity outcomes in complex ways that are only beginning to&#xD;
      be understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkages between depression and cardiovascular disease have been well documented. These&#xD;
      appear to be more than associations, but may reflect causal relationships through a number of&#xD;
      proposed pathways, including decreased physical activity, poor dietary habits, medication&#xD;
      non-adherence, and a direct impact on inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging is often associated with worsening of health disparities. The most vulnerable&#xD;
      subpopulation among the urban poor are the elderly, as they are naturally vulnerable due to&#xD;
      old age, compounded by lifetime exposure to poverty, and diminished defenses against violence&#xD;
      in their homes or neighborhoods, including routes to health service providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, health care interventions targeting specific individual risk factors in the elderly&#xD;
      have had only limited success in reducing health disparities in cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that this is due to two reasons. First, changes in the healthcare&#xD;
      system are needed that feature multidisciplinary teams rather than individual practitioners.&#xD;
      Second, treatment of cardiovascular risk factors requires attention to the patient's&#xD;
      emotional state to guard against the possibility that providers and patients are working at&#xD;
      cross-purposes; that is, the provider wants the patient to take action to improve long-term&#xD;
      survival, while the patient is experiencing low self-esteem, hopelessness, helplessness, or&#xD;
      even a passive or active wish to die. Reducing the risk of heart disease in this complex&#xD;
      bio-psychosocial context requires more than prescribing the right medication or recommending&#xD;
      that individuals modify their diet and exercise. The investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      multi-level intervention targeting both the healthcare system and the individual's&#xD;
      psychosocial and behavioral risk factors may succeed where past interventions have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose testing the hypothesis that an enhanced primary care&#xD;
      delivery system intervention which provides evidence-based, patient-centered mental health&#xD;
      services targeting depression and cardiovascular risk factors can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular disease in low-income elderly blacks and Hispanics. Researchers&#xD;
      at Rush University Medical Center have developed and tested several &quot;virtual&quot;&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team interventions, in which healthcare providers communicate as a team via&#xD;
      e-mail, telephone, fax, or video conferencing. The first of these, the Virtual Integrated&#xD;
      Practice project demonstrated that primary care practices could partner with community-based&#xD;
      teams to improve care of older adults with chronic illness. A subsequent program called&#xD;
      BRIGHTEN (Bridging Resources of a Geriatric Health Team via Electronic Networking) enhanced&#xD;
      the assessment and treatment of late life depression and anxiety in primary care. The&#xD;
      proposed &quot;BRIGHTEN Heart study&quot; will determine if a virtual interdisciplinary clinical team&#xD;
      (BRIGHTEN Heart) can reduce depression in older (age ≥ 65) minority adults with comorbid&#xD;
      depression and metabolic syndrome. The overall purpose of this study is to reduce racial&#xD;
      disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in black and Hispanic elderly by&#xD;
      effectively controlling behavioral and psychosocial risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second, exploratory purpose of the study is to better understand the impact of current&#xD;
      major stressors and lifetime and current traumatic stressors, as these may be &quot;hidden&quot;&#xD;
      factors that impact emotional state, individual behavior, access to care, and intervention&#xD;
      adherence. It is our goal to them incorporate what the investigators learn about the impact&#xD;
      of major and traumatic stressors into later intervention as part of our overall Center&#xD;
      efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to an educational group, older minority patients with symptoms of depression and&#xD;
      comorbid metabolic syndrome receiving the BRIGHTEN Heart virtual team intervention will&#xD;
      demonstrate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Significant reductions in symptoms of depression [Primary trial outcome]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Significant reductions in metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improved adherence with medications prescribed for medical illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether BRIGHTEN Heart can reduce depression symptoms in older adults with&#xD;
           the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the BRIGHTEN Heart intervention can result in reduced prevalence of&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome as compared to a control population&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the mediating hypothesis that the BRIGHTEN Heart intervention results in&#xD;
           improvements in adherence with medications&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the impact of trauma and major life stressors on the results of the&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
