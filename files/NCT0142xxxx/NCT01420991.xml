  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is the most deadly kind of stroke. Each year,&#xD;
      40,000 Americans have SAH. Case-fatality approaches 60% and more than half of those who die&#xD;
      do so before reaching the hospital. Most commonly, SAH results from rupture of an&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysm. Screening high-risk individuals could identify those at greatest risk&#xD;
      and decrease the devastating effect of SAH. Aortic Aneurysm also constitutes a major public&#xD;
      health problem with high lethality. Current estimates are that ruptured aortic aneurysm kills&#xD;
      13,000 Americans each year. Screening efforts have effectively lowered mortality from aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture but a high proportion of those who die did not have a diagnosis of aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm prior to rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between intracranial and aortic aneurysm has long been recognized, but&#xD;
      poorly quantified. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a molecular&#xD;
      biological evidence for a shared pathophysiology. The chromosome 9p21 locus confers increased&#xD;
      risk for both intracranial aneurysms and aortic aneurysms. These GWAS data, along with&#xD;
      linkage data for other susceptibility loci, indicate that individuals and families harboring&#xD;
      one type of aneurysm may be at especially increased risk of the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this project is that opportunistic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms&#xD;
      (AAA) may be warranted in patients who present with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This&#xD;
      study is meant to see if the yield of screening in this population is too low to justify its&#xD;
      routine use. The investigators plan to systematically screen for AAA in all cases of aSAH&#xD;
      presenting to MCH for treatment. If no individual out of 81 consecutively screened cases of&#xD;
      aSAH has evidence of AAA, then the investigators can have strong confidence that there is a&#xD;
      less than 5% chance of finding an AAA in the patient population.&#xD;
