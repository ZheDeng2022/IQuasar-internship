      The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high-dose ethylester concentrate of&#xD;
      of n-3 fatty acids administered early after an acute myocardial infarction on subsequent&#xD;
      cardiac events and serum lipids.The second purpose of this study was to assess the impact of&#xD;
      high-dose n-3 fatty acids on several markers of coagulation, inflammation, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and lipid peroxidation. Re-investigation was intended after a prolonged&#xD;
      wash-out-period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Results of epidemiologic studies and clinical trials indicate that moderate doses of n-3&#xD;
      unsaturated fatty acids reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD) and may improve&#xD;
      prognosis. N-3 fatty acids have several beneficial cardiovascular properties (1-3), including&#xD;
      antiatherothrombotic, antiarrhythmic, and antihypertensive effects, and are especially noted&#xD;
      for their triacylglycerol-reducing ability (3-7). These effects may translate into an&#xD;
      improved clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pronounced effect obtained of moderate doses of n-3 fatty acids supplementation may&#xD;
      suggest an even stronger effect of pharmacologic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The object of this study was therefore to assess the effect of a high-dose ethylester&#xD;
      concentrate of n-3 fatty acids as compared to corn oil administered early (4-8 days) after an&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (MI), on fatal and non-fatal subsequent cardiac events (cardiac&#xD;
      death, resuscitation, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris), during 2 ys&#xD;
      follow-up (median 18 months). We hypothesized that a high-dose of n-3 fatty acids would&#xD;
      improve serum lipids in this population, and beneficially influence several markers of&#xD;
      coagulation, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred patients with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) were recruited at one&#xD;
      hospital center (Central Hospital in Rogaland, Stavanger, Norway) from September 1995 until&#xD;
      December 1996. All patients were included between the fourth and the eighth day after an&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (MI). All patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 gelatin&#xD;
      capsules of Omacor-R (Pronova AS, Oslo) or corn oil twice a day. Each capsule contained&#xD;
      either 850-882 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as ethylesters&#xD;
      in the average ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) of 1:2 or&#xD;
      the same amount of corn oil. α-Tocopherol (4 mg) was added to all capsules. The capsules were&#xD;
      administered in a double-blind manner over 12-24 months. A detailed patient history was&#xD;
      recorded and a clinical examination was performed. The electrocardiogram was scrutinized for&#xD;
      infarct location. The recent injury was classified as an anterior or inferior Q-wave&#xD;
      infarction or any non-Q-wave infarction. Treatment was initiated immediately after inclusion&#xD;
      and collection of baseline blood samples. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee for Western Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up, including blood tests and electrocardiogram recordings, was repeated at 6&#xD;
      wk, 6 mo, 1 y, 18 mo, and, for some patients, 2 ys after the start of treatment. A deviation&#xD;
      of 2 wk at the first follow-up and ≤1 mo at later follow-ups was allowed. All cardiac events&#xD;
      and ongoing medication were recorded. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death,&#xD;
      resuscitation, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and unstable angina. Revascularization&#xD;
      and death from other causes were also recorded. The study was closed at the end of 1997. The&#xD;
      median follow-up time (ignoring events except deaths) was 1.5 y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of serum triacylglycerols, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (HDL)-cholesterol were performed at inclusion, 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months. In addition,&#xD;
      analyses of markers of inflammation [high-sensitivity-C-reactive protein (CRP), CD-40 Ligand&#xD;
      (CD40L)], coagulation [D-Dimer, fibrinogen, tissue factor, activated factor XII (FXIIa)],&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction [adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and Intra-Cellular Adhesion&#xD;
      Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), homocysteine)], and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) as a&#xD;
      marker of the oxidative burden of n-3 fatty acids, have been performed at different time&#xD;
      points during follow-up, to evaluate the influence of n-3 fatty acids on these markers, and&#xD;
      to assess their prognostic ability following a myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover,&#xD;
      holo-transcobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), n-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic&#xD;
      Peptide (NT-proBNP), matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), Pregnancy-associated plasma protein&#xD;
      A (PAPP-A), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and CD40 Ligand (CD40L) were measured also in order to&#xD;
      evaluate their prognostic ability following a myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After closure of the main study, the purpose was to evaluate the prognosis of the study&#xD;
      subjects after a prolonged wash-out period.&#xD;
