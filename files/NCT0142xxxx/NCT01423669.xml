      Purpose Psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) are complex neurobehaviour disorders&#xD;
      influenced by genetic, neurodevelopmental, neurochemical, as well as psychosocial factors.&#xD;
      Despite significant progresses in pharmacotherapy, the disorder often results in long-term&#xD;
      disability (ranked globally amongst the top ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life&#xD;
      years, DALYS), often associated with extensive cost, burden, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective / hypothesis The study aims to (1) measure the prevalence of psychotic symptoms in&#xD;
      the Hong Kong population; (2) explore associated risk and protective factors for the&#xD;
      expression of psychotic symptoms; (3) characterize the functional disability in people with&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms; and (4) study the determinant of clinical presentation or&#xD;
      non-presentation in people with psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, subjects and study instrument The survey will be conducted with a two-phase design.&#xD;
      The first phase interviews will include approximately 5,000 subjects with structured&#xD;
      assessments serving diagnostic criteria for CMD, screening instruments for psychotic&#xD;
      disorder, substance misuse and suicidal behaviours, functioning, service use and&#xD;
      demographics. The second phase comprises of clinician interviews for psychotic disorder and&#xD;
      &quot;at risk mental state&quot; and other variables including neurocognitive, help seeking, stigma and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Prevalence estimates will be weighted, expressed as rates and confidence intervals.&#xD;
      Comorbidity will be estimated using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) Logistic regression will be&#xD;
      used to identify significant factors associated with mental disorders.&#xD;

      Psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) are complex neurobehaviour disorders influenced&#xD;
      by genetic, neurodevelopmental, neurochemical, as well as psychosocial factors. Amongst these&#xD;
      risk factors, recent findings have highlighted the roles of immigration, urban upbringing,&#xD;
      high paternal age, psychoactive substance abuse, as well as stressful early experiences.&#xD;
      Despite significant progresses in pharmacotherapy, the disorder often result in long-term&#xD;
      disability ranked globally amongst the top ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life&#xD;
      years (DALYS, WHO). The World health Organization concludes that the burden and human&#xD;
      suffering associated with psychosis is extensive and results in high service and societal&#xD;
      costs. Identification and treatment of psychotic disorders (sometimes referred to as Severe&#xD;
      Mental Illness, or SMI) is a priority in most mental health services worldwide. However such&#xD;
      efforts are challenging because of the help-seeking is severely compromised by reluctance,&#xD;
      stigmatization, lack of knowledge, and poor accessibility. This has resulted in long delays&#xD;
      before treatment, as well as lack of information about the community prevalence, and&#xD;
      associated disability and risk factors for psychosis (ref DUP paper). Availability of these&#xD;
      data for Hong Kong will facilitate service planning, early detection and intervention&#xD;
      efforts, as well as the consideration of population level preventative strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability data suggest that the prevalence of psychosis in the community is substantially&#xD;
      higher (5.5-28%, vanos 09) than the prevalence of treated disorder (1-3.5%, vanos09 ),&#xD;
      raising important questions about the what determines whether and when psychotic disorders&#xD;
      are intercepted in a particular service setting. It is vital to also to obtain information&#xD;
      about the untreated cases, in terms of risk factors and protective factors, disability, as&#xD;
      well as obstacles to help-seeking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community level data for psychotic disorders in Hong Kong is sparse and there has been no&#xD;
      territory-wide population-level epidemiology. The Hong Kong population has several&#xD;
      distinctive features which are of particular scientific interest and public health concern in&#xD;
      relation to psychosis. Although the overall prevalence of substance abuse is low, there is&#xD;
      disproportionate use of ketamine in Hong Kong, which interferes with glutaminergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission. The relationship between ketamine use and risk for psychosis is of&#xD;
      aetiological and clinical interest. In addition, the unique societal context of Hong Kong has&#xD;
      resulted in a high proportion of immigrants from China. Moreover, a cohort of people with&#xD;
      relatively high paternal age is entering the risk period of developing psychotic disorders&#xD;
      (resulting from older man from Hong Kong and younger women from neighbouring parts of China&#xD;
      in the previous decades).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous relevant study included a district survey, which was more than a quarter of a&#xD;
      century old, and was of limited generalization value because of the uneven socioeconomic&#xD;
      distribution amongst Hong Kong's 18 districts, resulting in likely uneven distribution of&#xD;
      individual with psychosis amongst them. Other relevant data included data of treated new&#xD;
      onset cases from Hong Kong's early intervention service (EASY, annual incidence of at least&#xD;
      600 cases under 25, and estimated 1200-1500 in all age groups), with the limitations of&#xD;
      treated incidence discussed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a territory-wide epidemiological study of psychosis. The study aims&#xD;
      to (1) measure the prevalence of psychotic symptoms in the Hong Kong population; (2) explore&#xD;
      associated risk and protective factors for the expression of psychotic symptoms; (3)&#xD;
      characterize the functional disability in people with psychotic symptoms; and (4) study the&#xD;
      determinant of clinical presentation or non-presentation in people with psychotic symptoms.&#xD;

        The sample for this survey is planned to represent community dwelling adult population in&#xD;
        Hong Kong. The age range will be from 16-75 years. People residing in institutions will not&#xD;
        be covered. The survey will adopt a multi-stage sampling design. The sampling frame will&#xD;
        consist of a random selection of addresses quarters generated with the help of the Censes&#xD;
        and Statistics Department of the Government of Hong Kong SAR. The addresses would be&#xD;
        stratified with geographical location and nature of premises. For each address identified,&#xD;
        an advance letter with return envelop or contact information will be sent. The advance&#xD;
        letter will inform the residents about the nature of the study with an invitation for&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This study is part of the Hong Kong Mental Morbidity Survey 2010 , the sampling frame&#xD;
             is described as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The sample for this survey is planned to represent community dwelling adult population in&#xD;
        Hong Kong. The age range will be from 16-75 years. People residing in institutions will not&#xD;
        be covered. Only Chinese subjects will be recruited. The survey will adopt a multi-stage&#xD;
        sampling design. The sampling frame will consist of a random selection of addresses&#xD;
        quarters generated with the help of the Censes and Statistics Department of the Government&#xD;
        of Hong Kong SAR. The addresses would be stratified with geographical location and nature&#xD;
        of premises. For each address identified, an advance letter with return envelop or contact&#xD;
        information will be sent. The advance letter will inform the residents about the nature of&#xD;
        the study with an invitation for participation. A maximum of five invitations will be sent&#xD;
        by post for non-return within three months. A trained lay interviewer will conduct Phase 1&#xD;
        assessment at home visit for each eligible household expressing interest to participate. To&#xD;
        avoid inflation of characteristics that may aggregate within families, only one adult aged&#xD;
        16 years or over will be selected randomly for interview in each household.&#xD;
