  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care of patients with sepsis and trauma requires the delivery of appropriate definitive&#xD;
      care in the early stages of the illness. Hospitals with limited resources, those in rural and&#xD;
      underserved areas of South Carolina, may be unable to consistently provide optimal care to&#xD;
      these patients. In addition, the shortage of specialists nationally makes it more difficult&#xD;
      for these hospitals to recruit and retain the specialists needed. Patients in these areas&#xD;
      continue to pay the rural penalty of poorer outcomes. This study provides specialists' level&#xD;
      care through telemedicine consults to rural emergency departments in rural areas of SC to&#xD;
      improve outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CREST study is a project that specifically addresses the need to bring health care to&#xD;
      rural communities in SC, as well as evaluates methods and tests technology to implement this&#xD;
      care in rural communities. The CREST study uses telemedicine remotely from MUSC to rural&#xD;
      community hospitals to provide rural community physicians care from specialists for trauma&#xD;
      and sepsis, which are both high acuity, difficult to treat conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST is a multi-site trial of telemedicine services to meet rural patients' and providers'&#xD;
      need for expert evaluation and management of sepsis and trauma. The specific aims of CREST&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that a telemedicine program including education and clinical&#xD;
           consultation between a tertiary care academic medical center and rural, local hospitals&#xD;
           will significantly improve key treatment decisions and outcome measures in sepsis and&#xD;
           trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that the differences in ISS and time to antibiotics for trauma&#xD;
           and sepsis patients exposed to telemedicine intervention and those without the&#xD;
           intervention matched on propensity scores are not due to unmeasured confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST seeks new solutions to rural health disparities, to advance technology, create and&#xD;
      retain jobs and address important research opportunities by combining implementation of a&#xD;
      novel, trans disciplinary clinical program with rigorous, mixed methods scientific evaluation&#xD;
      including clinical, process, and economic outcome measures. The impact on both science and&#xD;
      quality healthcare outcomes is broad and CREST has far reaching implications for addressing&#xD;
      rural health disparities for acute, life-threatening illnesses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impetus for CREST derives from the observation that rural patients are unlikely to&#xD;
      acquire on-site access to appropriate specialist care for high stakes, high acuity,&#xD;
      crisis-mode conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Novel, collaborative approaches are&#xD;
      necessary to provide rural patients with access to appropriate specialist care for sepsis and&#xD;
      trauma. CREST is an innovative, technologically levering mechanism that provides the&#xD;
      opportunity to lessen the inferior outcomes and &quot;rural penalty&quot; paid by patients in rural&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rural patients are less likely to have onsite access to specialist care for sepsis and trauma&#xD;
      for several reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personnel: there is a nation-wide shortage of appropriate specialty providers including&#xD;
           intensivists, trauma surgeons, and other critical care staff 1. Small, rural communities&#xD;
           lack the economies of scale to support resource intense services and if a community has&#xD;
           these specialties, there is often not around the clock coverage necessary for best&#xD;
           quality care for these conditions 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and material resources: Sepsis and trauma patients require immediate&#xD;
           availability of resources such as multidisciplinary ICU staff, large blood banks,&#xD;
           operating rooms, and advanced radiological facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability of resources such as multidisciplinary ICU staff, large blood banks,&#xD;
           operating rooms, and advanced radiological facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location and distance: Patients in rural communities have inferior outcomes in sepsis&#xD;
           and trauma 2, 3. This is likely multifactorial and includes delays in entry to the&#xD;
           Emergency Medical System network, longer travel times to definitive care facilities and&#xD;
           delays in definitive care delivery. Inter-hospital transfer may be limited both by&#xD;
           severity of patient illness, acute care and ICU bed shortages in tertiary care centers.&#xD;
           Additionally, the scarcity of tertiary care hospital beds increases the importance of&#xD;
           initiating transfer for patients who will maximally benefit from tertiary care referral&#xD;
           4, 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact to rural patients with sepsis and trauma, due to lack of access to appropriate&#xD;
      specialist care, is substantial. Sepsis is one of the most common serious critical illnesses.&#xD;
      It kills 28-50% of patients diagnosed 6, 7 and is the 10th leading cause of death in the US&#xD;
      8. Furthermore, the incidence is increasing in conjunction with the aging of the US&#xD;
      population 9. The impact of rurality on sepsis has received modest investigation, but rural&#xD;
      patients likely have worse outcomes.3 In SC, patients referred from Emergency Departments&#xD;
      (ED's) in smaller, typically rural hospitals have a 22% increase risk of death as compared to&#xD;
      those referred from ED's in larger, urban hospitals (CREST preliminary analysis) suggesting&#xD;
      the benefits of specialist directed care available to patients at larger facilities. Equally&#xD;
      concerning is an apparent race-associated disparity in which African American patients&#xD;
      presenting to rural ED's in SC are twice as likely to be discharged from the ED with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of sepsis as compared to white patients. Although the rates for discharge from an&#xD;
      ED with a diagnosis of sepsis are low at 3.95% for whites and 8.71% for African Americans&#xD;
      (CREST preliminary analysis), it is concerning that any patient is discharged from an ED with&#xD;
      this diagnosis and the disparate rates may reflect the well-described phenomenon of unequal&#xD;
      treatment 10. Critically ill patients with any diagnosis benefit from intensivist-directed&#xD;
      care including a 30-40% reduction in mortality.11 Unfortunately, over half of US hospitals&#xD;
      have no intensivist coverage at all and rural hospitals are disproportionately affected by&#xD;
      this problem 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, trauma is the leading cause of death among Americans up to age 45 and the fourth&#xD;
      leading cause of death overall for all ages 8. Deaths from injury occur in a tri-phasic&#xD;
      distribution: 50% of deaths from injury occur at the scene, 30% occur in the first 1-2 hours&#xD;
      and 20% occur during hospitalization between 1-2 weeks after admission. Trauma care at&#xD;
      designated trauma centers improves survival 13. Yet, rural hospitals are rarely trauma&#xD;
      centers and in SC patients injured in rural communities have inferior outcomes and higher&#xD;
      costs 14. Significant disparities can be identified among SC's elderly and minority&#xD;
      populations. 14 An important barrier to facilitating quality care for SC trauma patients&#xD;
      relates to triage efficiency between rural hospitals and a trauma center. Outcomes for&#xD;
      seriously injured rural patients are negatively affected when patients are taken to&#xD;
      non-trauma EDs and then transferred to a trauma center 13 . Conversely, transfer of patients&#xD;
      with low risk of death and disability to trauma centers represents over-triage, and creates&#xD;
      additional stressors at already busy trauma centers accruing financial burden on the health&#xD;
      care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST is scientifically innovative on multiple levels. It is the first prospective,&#xD;
      mixed-methods evaluation of telemedicine; as well as one of the few studies in&#xD;
      remote/telemedicine not sponsored by industry. CREST is the first study to demonstrate&#xD;
      improved outcomes for sepsis using telemedicine and will augment the sparse literature on&#xD;
      trauma and telemedicine. CREST also serves as a demonstration project showing that access to&#xD;
      specialist care for rural patients with high stakes, high acuity conditions can be reliably&#xD;
      provided through telemedicine. CREST technology is non-proprietary and relatively low cost&#xD;
      and thus allows important cost-effectiveness analyses to ascertain the viability of&#xD;
      telemedicine in rural settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST includes two elements - an educational program for rural providers and clinical&#xD;
      consultation for patients with sepsis and trauma. Collaborating hospitals receive&#xD;
      telemedicine hardware and software, usage instruction, and 24/7 access to MUSC experts in&#xD;
      sepsis and trauma for patient consultation in real-time. This project uses a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design, which incorporates a controlled experiment using pre-existing&#xD;
      patient groups as the controls. This design minimizes threats to external validity and offers&#xD;
      efficiency in the longitudinal aspect of the research. Main dependent measures include time&#xD;
      to initiation of appropriate antibiotics for septic patients and reduced transfer rates of&#xD;
      less-severe trauma patients as measured by average increase in the Injury Severity Score&#xD;
      (ISS). Data collection for the controls in the retrospective groups and the prospective&#xD;
      intervention group will be conducted by using structured audit forms by trained staff. The&#xD;
      research plan includes investigation of outcomes, including treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rural hospitals are the primary targets for CREST because these institutions tend to have&#xD;
      fewer specialty providers and often cannot provide definitive care for patients with sepsis&#xD;
      and trauma. Eligible rural hospitals are strategically identified based on several criteria.&#xD;
      First, the hospital is located in a rural area as designated by the US Department of&#xD;
      Agriculture. Second, the hospital has substantial resource limitations as indicated by a&#xD;
      Level III or IV Medical Facility Status from the Joint Accreditation Committee for Hospital&#xD;
      Organizations. Third, the hospital is within MUSC's typical 120 mile catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST investigators are mindful of the importance of collegial and collaborative approaches&#xD;
      to recruiting rural hospitals and providers. To establish a framework for the working&#xD;
      relationships important to the success of CREST, collaborating hospitals and MUSC sign a&#xD;
      Memorandum of Agreement stipulating the roles and expectations. The fundamental duties for&#xD;
      the rural hospitals are: 1) work with MUSC research team to facilitate human subjects&#xD;
      approval of CREST; 2) coordinate their providers' availability with CREST's educational&#xD;
      program; 3) facilitate working relationships between MUSC clinical experts and appropriate&#xD;
      clinicians at rural hospitals and 4) allow CREST investigators access to patient records to&#xD;
      ascertain outcome measures. MUSC provides: 1) an educational program 2) the technical&#xD;
      expertise and equipment; 3) 24/7 availability for clinical evaluations; 4) training and&#xD;
      support of chart abstractors to acquire outcome data; and 5) the conducting of analyses and&#xD;
      writing of reports for CREST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREST allows rural spoke hospitals 24/7 access to MUSC sepsis and trauma experts who provide&#xD;
      formal consultation for patients with these conditions including appropriate documentation in&#xD;
      the medical record. Rural hospitals can utilize the telemedicine consultants on a one-time&#xD;
      basis for initial evaluation and recommendations or request ongoing collaborative care with&#xD;
      MUSC clinical experts. If a patient benefits by transfer to MUSC, this is identified and MUSC&#xD;
      clinicians are already familiar with the patient's clinical status, representing another&#xD;
      advantage of telemedicine services. Alternatively, if patients can be adequately managed at&#xD;
      referring spoke sites this is determined, thus improving triage efficiency for tertiary care&#xD;
      referrals.&#xD;
