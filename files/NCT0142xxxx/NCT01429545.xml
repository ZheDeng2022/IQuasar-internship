    <textblock>
      Preterm birth, defined as birth at less than 37+0 weeks of gestation, is the most important&#xD;
      determinant of adverse infant outcomes. It accounts for 5 to 11% of births in the world, but&#xD;
      represents the single largest cause of mortality and morbidity for newborns and a major cause&#xD;
      of morbidity for pregnant women. These babies are at increased risk of cerebral palsies,&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary insufficiency and other handicaps resulting in suboptimal performance in&#xD;
      school and decreased abstractive thinking compared with infants born at term. The economic&#xD;
      burden on society in catering for these preterm babies is high. A multi-level modeling of&#xD;
      hospital service utilization and cost profile of preterm birth done in 2005 in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom, has outlined the huge economic consequences of preterm birth in the first 10 years&#xD;
      of life. Furthermore, recent data from Denmark have shown an overall increase in the&#xD;
      proportion of preterm deliveries by 22% from 1995 to 2004(from 5.2% to 6.3%). Neonatal&#xD;
      mortality has declined, mostly due to improved management of very low birth weight babies&#xD;
      rather than prevention of preterm labor (PTL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common treatment used in the management of PTL involves pharmacological inhibition&#xD;
      of preterm uterine contractions. Perinatal death and morbidity resulting from PTL are not&#xD;
      only strongly related to early gestational age but also to antenatal administration of&#xD;
      steroids and transfer to a tertiary care centre in utero or after birth.6 Hence, the choice&#xD;
      of tocolytic agent depends on its ability to delay the delivery by at least 48 hours from the&#xD;
      time of administration of steroids and preferably longer without maternal or fetal side&#xD;
      effects. There is considerable variation in the type of tocolytic agent used in different&#xD;
      parts of the world. Single agent tocolysis using ritodrine (β-agonist), atosiban (oxytocin&#xD;
      antagonist) or nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) is a common practice. Atosiban has been&#xD;
      shown to have comparable effectiveness to β-agonists but with improved side-effect profile&#xD;
      similar to that seen in placebo studies. Meta analysis from Cochrane systematic review failed&#xD;
      to demonstrate the superiority of atosiban over betamimetics or placebo in terms of tocolytic&#xD;
      efficacy or infant outcomes, but, the maternal drug reactions that required treatment&#xD;
      cessation were fewer with atosiban. Nifedipine is the only agent associated with improved&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes and fewer maternal side-effects than betamimetics. A direct comparison&#xD;
      between atosiban and nifedipine has shown that both drugs are equally effective in acute&#xD;
      tocolysis, however maternal side-effects were more pronounced with nifedipine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the differences in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, one may expect to have&#xD;
      improved tocolysis when two agents are combined. In vitro studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      simultaneous blockade of these different pathways could result in an additive or even&#xD;
      synergistic effect capable of producing better uterine relaxation than induced by each drug&#xD;
      alone. Accordingly, the use of multiple agent therapies has been suggested as a way forward&#xD;
      in tocolytic search. In an observational study, combination therapy without serious side&#xD;
      effects has been used in the management of PTL at extremely early gestations by Ingemarsson&#xD;
      et al.3 However, this was not tested in structured human trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to compare the tocolytic efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of atosiban and nifedipine against the single agent, atosiban in the treatment of&#xD;
      PTL.&#xD;
