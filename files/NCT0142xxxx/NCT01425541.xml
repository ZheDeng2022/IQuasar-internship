    <textblock>
      Girls with high levels of the male hormone testosterone often develop polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome (PCOS) as adults. Women with PCOS often have irregular menstrual periods, excess&#xD;
      facial and body hair, and weight gain. Women with PCOS also have difficulty becoming&#xD;
      pregnant. Some, girls with high levels of male hormone will develop normal hormone levels as&#xD;
      they grow up. Most girls continue to have high levels of male hormone as adults. In addition,&#xD;
      girls with elevated levels of male hormones often have lower fertility rates in adulthood. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators will aim to discover the effect of 7 days of estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone on GnRH pulses in girls and women with the goal of understanding how and why&#xD;
      some girls and women have higher levels of male hormone and the causes of PCOS. If&#xD;
      investigators understand the causes of these disorders, they may be able to better treat them&#xD;
      and perhaps even learn how to prevent the development of PCOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent hyperandrogenemia (excess androgen production) occurring before or during early&#xD;
      puberty appears to be a precursor to adult polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS affects&#xD;
      about 6% of women of childbearing age in the United States. Those who suffer from this&#xD;
      disorder often experience irregular menstrual periods, excess facial and body hair, and&#xD;
      weight gain. PCOS is also a leading cause of infertility. Women with PCOS often report&#xD;
      irregular menstrual cycles as adolescents. A study of adolescents with menstrual&#xD;
      irregularities showed that some subjects normalize endocrine function as they mature, while a&#xD;
      majority maintained hyperandrogenism in conjunction with high levels of luteinizing hormone&#xD;
      (LH) and polycystic ovaries. In addition, girls with high levels of serum androgens often&#xD;
      have lower fertility rates in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that adult PCOS, and perhaps adolescent hyperandrogenemia, are due in part to&#xD;
      dysregulation of pituitary and ovarian hormones. Synthesis and secretion of LH and follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH) are primarily regulated by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).&#xD;
      Both LH and FSH are secreted by the same gonadotrope cell, and the frequency of stimulation&#xD;
      of this cell by GnRH in part determines which hormone is released. In primates, rapid GnRH&#xD;
      frequencies (approx. 1 pulse/ hour) favor LH secretion whereas slower GnRH stimuli (1 pulse/&#xD;
      3 hours or less) favor FSH release. In normal women, the cyclical rise and fall in hormone&#xD;
      levels control follicular maturation and ovulation. Early studies showed an initial&#xD;
      predominance of FSH in the follicular phase, with a subsequent rise in estradiol (E2). In the&#xD;
      late follicular phase, LH increases as a consequence of increased GnRH secretion. Following&#xD;
      ovulation, rising levels of E2 and P then reduce GnRH pulse frequency, allowing a rise in FSH&#xD;
      for the next cycle of follicular maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One feature of adult PCOS is increased mean serum levels of LH and increased LH pulse&#xD;
      frequency, presumably due to increased stimulation of the pituitary by excess hypothalamic&#xD;
      secretion of GnRH. Since women with PCOS maintain high levels of LH and low levels of FSH,&#xD;
      follicle maturation and ovulation do not occur normally. Girls with hyperandrogenemia in&#xD;
      adolescence also have an increased frequency of LH pulses when compared to age matched&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hyperandrogenemic adolescents could be treated effectively before or during pubertal&#xD;
      maturation, development of clinical PCOS as an adult could potentially be avoided. One&#xD;
      proposed cause of both hyperandrogenemia and PCOS is a defect in GnRH pulse modulation, which&#xD;
      normally happens as puberty progresses. GnRH is secreted by a part of the brain called the&#xD;
      hypothalamus. In normal pubertal maturation the increase in GnRH pulse secretion during sleep&#xD;
      stimulates LH and ovarian E2 and P secretion. Feedback of these hormones reduces GnRH pulses&#xD;
      during daytime hours, initiating cycles of ovarian-hypothalamic feedback regulation which&#xD;
      mature into the patterns seen in normal ovulatory cycles. Recent studies have shown that E2&#xD;
      and P can slow LH pulses in adult women with PCOS, but higher concentrations of P are needed&#xD;
      to inhibit LH pulse frequency. If hypothalamic (GnRH pulse generator) sensitivity to&#xD;
      inhibition by P is reduced during pubertal maturation, the low levels of P present during the&#xD;
      initial development of ovarian cyclicity may not be adequate to suppress GnRH/LH pulse&#xD;
      secretion. This could lead to LH excess and relative FSH deficiency. Administering oral doses&#xD;
      of P in early adolescence may compensate and restore normal ovarian-hypothalamic feedback. In&#xD;
      turn, increasing amounts of naturally secreted P in subsequent cycles could eventually&#xD;
      normalize the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of this line of investigation is to determine if E2 and P treatment of&#xD;
      adolescents with hyperandrogenemia can slow the GnRH pulse generator to promote FSH&#xD;
      production and the advent of normal menstrual cycles. As an initial step we propose to&#xD;
      determine if the GnRH pulse generator is relatively insensitive to E2 and P inhibition in&#xD;
      hyperandrogenemic adolescent girls.&#xD;
