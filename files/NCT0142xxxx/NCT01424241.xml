  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims primarily to determine the effect Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1)&#xD;
      normalization into current IGF1 normal ranges with Sandostatin LAR® therapy on biochemical&#xD;
      metabolic, cardiovascular and body composition parameters in patients with active acromegaly.&#xD;

      -Study Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of IGFI normalization with&#xD;
      Sandostatin LAR® therapy on metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular risk profile and body&#xD;
      composition in patients with active acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Study Design: This is an open label,single center, prospective study. Patients with active&#xD;
      acromegaly who have not received prior somatostatin analog therapy will receive sandostatin&#xD;
      LAR® for 9 months. Assessments will include laboratory testing, intravenous glucose tolerance&#xD;
      tests, signs and symptoms questions, cardiac echocardiography (ECHO) and Dual-emission X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) body composition before and at the end of the 9 months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of the analysis are change in insulin sensitivity, change in&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk marker, change in biochemical markers of the Growth Hormone (GH)/IGF1&#xD;
      axis, change in ECHO determined cardiac parameters and change in body composition such as&#xD;
      increase in total body fat or decrease in lean body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Subjects A total of 20 subjects total at this site will be enrolled. Subjects will&#xD;
           be recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the protocol out of the&#xD;
           patients who are seen at our Neuroendocrine unit for evaluation of acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment Method Subjects will be recruited from those presenting to the&#xD;
           Neuroendocrine Unit for evaluation of acromegaly. Subjects will be recruited by the PI&#xD;
           after they have been approached by their physician and expressed an interest in study&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Procedures Subjects will come to the Neuroendocrine Unit for visits monthly during&#xD;
           the study period and administration of study drug. Patients will have their doses&#xD;
           titrated based on IGF1 level as per the study protocol. Patients will undergo laboratory&#xD;
           testing, physical examinations, ECHO, DEXA and other noninvasive questionnaires and&#xD;
           monitoring as specified by the protocol over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Issues Small risks include possible pain and bruising at the site of the needle&#xD;
           insertion for blood drawing. Sandostatin LAR® is associated with gastrointestinal side&#xD;
           effects such as bloating and diarrhea which usually subside. About 15% of patients&#xD;
           treated with this medication develop gallstones. These usually remain asymptomatic.&#xD;
           Pituitary tumors may also change in size during these medical therapies.&#xD;
