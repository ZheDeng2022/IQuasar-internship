      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.&#xD;
      Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, also work in different ways to kill cancer&#xD;
      cells or stop them from dividing. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by&#xD;
      blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab and&#xD;
      bendamustine hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of giving lenalidomide&#xD;
      together with rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with refractory&#xD;
      or relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot/feasibility study of bendamustine, rituximab, and lenalidomide combination&#xD;
      with a goal of assessing maximum tolerated dose, safety and feasibility of this combination.&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab IV over 5-8 hours on day 1, bendamustine hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on days 1-2, and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Ancillary treatment is available per the protocol (eg, supportive care for rituximab&#xD;
      infusions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum-tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine&#xD;
           and rituximab chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine and&#xD;
           rituximab chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall and complete response rates of lenalidomide in combination with&#xD;
           bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin&#xD;
           lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during treatment&#xD;
      for correlative studies. Tumor tissue samples may also be collected.Patients are followed up&#xD;
      for up to 5 years post-registration.&#xD;

                  weight (LMW) heparin or therapeutic warfarin during the protocol treatment and&#xD;
                  for ≥6 months afterwards. Patients with strong family history of thrombosis&#xD;
                  should be considered for thrombophilia work up and/or anticoagulated at the&#xD;
                  discretion of treating MD.&#xD;

                  standard prophylaxis with ASA (aspirin) or LMW heparin/warfarin at the discretion&#xD;
                  of treating MD. Active smokers should be advised on thrombosis risk and smoking&#xD;
                  cessation and may participate in the study if prophylaxis with ASA (aspirin) or&#xD;
                  LMW heparin/warfarin (at the discretion of treating MD) is given. Patients on&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Known myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Receiving erythroid stimulating agents (EPO: Procrit, Aranesp). Note: Use of erythroid&#xD;
