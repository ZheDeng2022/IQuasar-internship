    <textblock>
      Chronic foot ulcers are particularly prevalent in patients with underlying diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      These ulcers are reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization among people with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate CureXcell® in treating chronic lower extremity&#xD;
      ulcers in adults with diabetes mellitus. CureXcell® is a cell based therapy, containing&#xD;
      activated homologous white blood cells prepared from donated healthy whole blood. A total of&#xD;
      280 patients will be randomized to receive either CureXcell® or sham.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic foot ulcers are particularly prevalent in patients with underlying diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is growing at epidemic rates in Europe, United States and&#xD;
      in general worldwide. Foot ulceration is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of infection, gangrene and amputation. These ulcers are&#xD;
      reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization among people with diabetes. Despite&#xD;
      existing ulcer therapies and technologies, there continues to be a great necessity for new&#xD;
      wound healing technologies that will further improve healing rates for these chronic ulcers&#xD;
      that remain a major source of morbidity, concern, and cost. This Phase 3 multinational,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study is designed to evaluate CureXcell® in&#xD;
      treating lower extremity chronic ulcers in adults with Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CureXcell® is a cell based therapy obtained from donated whole blood. The blood are collected&#xD;
      from healthy, young adult (age 18-40), the cells separated and then activated by hypo-osmotic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 280 patients, in approximately 35 sites in the US, Canada and Israel, will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either CureXcell® or control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of CureXcell® (study&#xD;
      biologic) compared to control, as adjunct to Good Ulcer Care. Additional objectives are to&#xD;
      demonstrate safety, tolerability and durability of CureXcell® compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two phases: a core double-blind phase and a follow up phase.&#xD;
