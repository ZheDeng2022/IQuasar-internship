  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a common problem, affecting 5-8% of the population. Peanut allergy causes&#xD;
      reduced quality of life due to the perceived high risk of severe reactions. Patients rely on&#xD;
      accurate labeling of both loose and pre-packed foods, but these are often ambiguous and&#xD;
      unhelpful. There is a common conception that labeling is 'over-cautious'. Peanut-allergic&#xD;
      consumers face increasingly restricted food choices in complying with this advice due, in&#xD;
      part, to the proliferation of advisory labels such as 'may contain peanuts'. This contributes&#xD;
      to the reduces quality of life of affected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For industry to provide more accurate and helpful labeling, certain characteristics of the&#xD;
      food-allergic population need to be defined. Firstly, the minimum 'eliciting dose' for the&#xD;
      population has been estimated by studying large groups of peanut allergic patients who are&#xD;
      challenged with peanut ingestion in increasing amounts. From these, an eliciting dose that&#xD;
      provokes a reaction in 10% of the food-allergic population has been estimated at between six&#xD;
      and 14mg of peanut protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation of population eliciting doses (ED) into acceptable levels of allergen&#xD;
      contamination for the population requires consideration of a 'safety factor'- to account for&#xD;
      individual variability in dose threshold and severity. Data suggest such variability depends&#xD;
      in part on extrinsic factors (exercise and sleep restriction). Each factor may have a&#xD;
      different effect in scale and direction. The investigators are proposing a cross-over trial&#xD;
      with 85 peanut-allergic adults who will each undergoing a baseline peanut challenge followed&#xD;
      by repeat challenges with extrinsic factors applied, in random order (repeat baseline,&#xD;
      +exercise and +sleep restriction). These data will further define ED for the UK population&#xD;
      and a safety factor derived from shift in threshold, to inform industry and protect the&#xD;
      allergic population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      N=100 subjects will undergo a baseline challenge to peanut without exacerbating extrinsic&#xD;
      factors. These initial baseline challenges will be performed when asthma is well controlled&#xD;
      (validated by normal spirometry values), the subject is rested and there is no evidence of&#xD;
      viral illness (clinical history and examination). A two-day double blind placebo controlled&#xD;
      peanut challenge (DBPCPC) will be performed. Subjects receive either all placebo doses or all&#xD;
      active doses on one of two days. Each day consists of all eight doses separated by 20 minute&#xD;
      intervals (3microg to 1g). The active doses are hidden in a carrier which has been assessed&#xD;
      for blinding efficacy. Subjective and objective dose threshold and severity score for&#xD;
      challenge outcome will be recorded. Subjects will receive detailed written and verbal advice&#xD;
      to avoid peanut until the next challenge. All subjects will be asked to carry oral&#xD;
      antihistamines and injectable adrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who have a clinical reaction during the initial baseline DBPCFC will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of 6 balanced cross over intervention sequences from a Latin square design.&#xD;
      Each group rotates through three further challenges in a different order: control (no&#xD;
      extrinsic factor), exercise and sleep restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects must not have had any accidental reaction to peanut in the previous three&#xD;
           months. This challenge will be performed when asthma is well controlled (validated by&#xD;
           spirometry normal values), the subjects are rested (sleep diary for preceding week will&#xD;
           be examined) and there is no viral illness (clinical history and examination). A peanut&#xD;
           challenge will be performed (identically to the initial baseline DBPCFC). Dose threshold&#xD;
           and severity score for challenge outcome will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise challenge Subjects undergo a repeat challenge to peanut with exercise as an&#xD;
           extrinsic factor, a minimum of three months after the previous challenge. Subjects must&#xD;
           not have had any accidental reaction to peanut in the previous three months. This&#xD;
           challenge will be performed when asthma is well controlled (validated by spirometry&#xD;
           normal values for the individual and clinical history), the subjects are rested, and&#xD;
           there is no viral illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge will be double blind and placebo controlled. The challenge will take place on&#xD;
      two occasions, on one day all four doses will contain placebo only, on the second all four&#xD;
      doses will be active (peanut). The subjects will undergo an identical exercise protocol on&#xD;
      both days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each day the challenge will begin with 15 minutes of exercise using a standardised&#xD;
      protocol. Following this the first challenge dose is given. This is followed by 20 minutes of&#xD;
      rest (and observation) before a further exercise period followed by ingestion of the second&#xD;
      dose and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active doses will beâ€¦&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1/100th of the threshold identified at the initial baseline challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1/10th of the threshold identified at the initial baseline challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The threshold dose identified at the control challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One dose increment higher than the dose identified at the control challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective and objective dose thresholds and severity score for challenge outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is no reaction to any dose on the active day then the active arm will be repeated on&#xD;
      a separate day, starting at the lowest available challenge dose (3 micrograms). Dose&#xD;
      increments up to at least 1/100th of the threshold identified at the control challenge will&#xD;
      follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Sleep restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a repeat double blind placebo controlled challenge to peanut&#xD;
      including sleep restriction as an extrinsic factor, a minimum of three months from the last&#xD;
      challenge. Subjects must not have had any accidental reaction to peanut in the previous three&#xD;
      months. This challenge will be performed when asthma is well controlled (validated by&#xD;
      spirometry normal values), and there is no viral illness (clinical history and examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the research ward on the evening prior to the challenge.&#xD;
      Overnight, sleep will be restricted to 3 hours (2300-0200). Subjects will undergo a peanut&#xD;
      challenge, using the same dosing range and intervals as the initial baseline challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective and objective dose thresholds and severity score for challenge outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded on central online data store. The challenge will take place on two occasions, on one&#xD;
      day all doses will contain placebo only, on the second all doses will be active (peanut). The&#xD;
      subjects will undergo an identical sleep restriction protocol on each day.&#xD;
