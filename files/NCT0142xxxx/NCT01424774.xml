    <textblock>
      This study will be performed at clinical sites that have administered CardioGen-82® to&#xD;
      patients from January to July 2011. The patients enrolled(i.e., &quot;target date patients&quot;) will&#xD;
      be all those who were dosed at the end of use of the CardioGen-82® generators on the last day&#xD;
      of generator use from the generator that was used immediately prior to the recalled generator&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;target date generators&quot;). These are not patients who received drug eluted from the&#xD;
      recalled generator. Of these patients, it is planned that 100 patients will be entered in&#xD;
      this trial.&#xD;

      This clinical study protocol will use a three tier approach consisting of the following&#xD;
      examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient examination with Survey Meter: Patients who agree to be tested at the clinical&#xD;
           sites will be first evaluated using a survey meter. In those patients in whom radiation&#xD;
           count is ≥ 2 times above background count using a standard survey meter, the presence of&#xD;
           Sr-82 and/or Sr-85 will be assessed through a quantitative reading from a calibrated&#xD;
           portable isotope identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient examination with Portable Isotope Identifier: This examination will be done by&#xD;
           use of a portable isotope identifier, which will be supplied by the Sponsor to the study&#xD;
           sites. An assessor, independent to the study site, will perform the examination. In&#xD;
           those patients whose radiation count is ≥ 2 times above background count using a&#xD;
           standard survey meter, the presence of Sr-82 and/or Sr-85 will be assessed through a&#xD;
           quantitative reading from a calibrated portable isotope identifier. The reading will be&#xD;
           forwarded along with the date of the reading, the date of the patient's CardioGen-82®&#xD;
           scan, and the total dose of CardioGen-82® administered to the patient, to an independent&#xD;
           medical expert, independent to the study site, who will back-calculate an estimated dose&#xD;
           of Sr-82 and/or Sr-85 from these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient examination at Oak Ridge National Laboratory: Any patient whose estimated dose&#xD;
           of Sr-82 exceeds the specified limit of 0.02 microcuries per mCi Rb-82 administered,&#xD;
           and/or whose estimated dose of Sr-85 exceeds the specified limit of 0.2 microcuries per&#xD;
           mCi Rb-82 administered, will be asked to travel to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in&#xD;
           Tennessee, for accurate whole body scanning. Scan data from Oak Ridge National&#xD;
           Laboratories will be analyzed by one or more independent medical experts to accurately&#xD;
           back-calculate exposure to Sr-82 and/or Sr-85, and to estimate health hazard for the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;

        The study population would come from sites who administered CardioGen-82® during the time&#xD;
        period of January 2011 to July 2011. The patient population is expected to be patients&#xD;
        (i.e., target date patients) who were administered Caridogen-82 that had been eluted from&#xD;
        the generator on the last usage day the generator was used prior to the generator that was&#xD;
        recalled (i.e., target date generator). It is planned to enroll 100 patients in this study.&#xD;
        Each site that agrees to participate will be encouraged to enroll at least 1 patient.&#xD;
        Depending on the number of sites agreeing to participate, the enrollment time frame may be&#xD;
        extended to include the last 3 to 5 days of generator usage.&#xD;
