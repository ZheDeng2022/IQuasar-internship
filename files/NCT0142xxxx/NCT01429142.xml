      The objectives of the main study are to evaluate the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of a counseling intervention to support medication intake among patients treated for HIV. The&#xD;
      aim is that through the availability of medication intake reports collected through&#xD;
      electronic monitoring, more adherence problems can be identified and medical decision-making&#xD;
      improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy focuses on the broader range of nursing care in HIV-treatment, examining the&#xD;
      content of care delivered to support physical, mental, sexual and social well-being; whether&#xD;
      the delivery of the AIMS intervention affects the quality of care on domains other than&#xD;
      adherence; and whether the content of care on these various domains can be linked to patient&#xD;
      well-being and satisfaction.&#xD;

      **MAIN STUDY**&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Adherence to HIV-medication is an important predictor of treatment success, yet&#xD;
      between 25-40% of the patients does not always take the medication as prescribed. A&#xD;
      nurse-delivered counseling intervention (AIMS: Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy)&#xD;
      to optimize patient adherence has shown promising results in a pilot study and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial among Caucasian, treatment-experienced patients. AIMS is a patient-centered&#xD;
      counseling intervention to support self-regulation of medication intake, using feedback&#xD;
      reports of electronically monitored adherence. AIMS has been evaluated positively by patients&#xD;
      and nurses, and has been developed to be implemented in usual patient care against minimal&#xD;
      time and monetary investments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of the AIMS intervention compared to&#xD;
      &quot;care-as-usual&quot; in Dutch HIV-clinics among a representative sample of patients (all&#xD;
      ethnicities, starting or already on treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in seven HIV-clinics in the Netherlands&#xD;
      and select 230 patients (details regarding sample size calculation: see below) eligible for&#xD;
      intervention based on the following criteria: 1- All treatment experienced patients who&#xD;
      started combination AntiRetroviral Therapy (cART) ≥1996, are &gt;9 months on treatment, are&#xD;
      continuing treatment, and had at least one detectable viral load (blips included) during the&#xD;
      last 3 years (count starts after 9 months cART). 2- All treatment-naïve patients initiating&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial inclusion, treatment experienced patients with suboptimal adherence measured&#xD;
      during a 2-month electronic monitoring baseline period will be eligible for randomization to&#xD;
      the intervention or the control group. Treatment-initiating patients will be randomized&#xD;
      directly after consenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: A prospective multicenter trial with randomization of patients within nurses.&#xD;
      Eligible treatment experienced patients with suboptimal adherence after 2 months baseline&#xD;
      adherence monitoring will be randomized to receive either usual care plus the&#xD;
      AIMS-intervention, or care as usual. Next, randomized experienced patients will visit the&#xD;
      clinic every 4-5 months, with a minimum of 3 visits during at least a 15-month period&#xD;
      (including the baseline period a total of 17 study months). Treatment-naïve patients will be&#xD;
      randomized directly after consenting. As part of the AIMS-intervention, intervention&#xD;
      participants are encouraged to start with a 2-week readiness trajectory before initiating&#xD;
      cART. After initiating cART, control and intervention participants return for a visit after&#xD;
      2-4 weeks, 3-4 months, 6-7 months, 9-10 months, and 12-15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY MEASURES: Viral load, health care usage, quality of life, and adherence data will be&#xD;
      obtained. MEMS-data will only be collected among half of the control group (randomly assigned&#xD;
      to MEMS y/n).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: 1- Primary cost-effectiveness outcome: a) costs per point increase in the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with an undetectable viral load, b) costs per Quality Adjusted Life&#xD;
      Year (QALY) gained. Secondary: Costs per one point increase in adherence as measured with the&#xD;
      MEMS-caps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- Primary effectiveness outcome: The number of detectable viral loads at study months 6-7,&#xD;
      10-11, and 14-15 for experienced patients, and months 6-7, 9-10, and 12-15 for patients&#xD;
      starting treatment. Secondary: Adherence according to MEMS-caps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **PROJECT OBJECTIVES SUB STUDY** BACKGROUND: HIV-nurses' tasks go beyond discussing and&#xD;
      supporting adherence, and include promoting patients' sexual, mental, physical and social&#xD;
      well-being. Hence, it will be important to establish whether delivering the AIMS-intervention&#xD;
      impacts the quality/scope of usual clinic care on these other important domains. In addition,&#xD;
      measuring the content of usual care during the trial provides the opportunity to explore&#xD;
      whether this is related to patients' well-being (sexual, mental, physical, social) and&#xD;
      satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: 1- To monitor the content of usual care on the different HIV-nursing domains and&#xD;
      examine whether usual care content predicts patients' well-being and satisfaction with&#xD;
      HIV-care at follow-up. 2- Explore whether delivering the AIMS-intervention has&#xD;
      (dis)advantageous effects on the content and impact of usual care on domains other than&#xD;
      adherence (sexual, mental, physical, social).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: HIV-nurses and patients in the study clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND MEASURES: HIV-nurses' usual care with regard to adherence, as well as mental,&#xD;
      sexual, social and physical health will be assessed through questionnaires at randomization&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. In addition, HIV-nurses will complete a brief online checklist&#xD;
      after each study visit indicating the main topics discussed during that meeting. At&#xD;
      randomization and after the study, patients will complete a brief questionnaire about their&#xD;
      mental, social, physical and sexual health, and satisfaction with their care on these&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES: 1- The relation between the content of care with patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      well-being. 2- Potential effects of AIMS on the content of care and patient well-being and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial grant application, a sample size was computed based on the assumption that&#xD;
      only non-adherent, treatment experienced patients would be approached. However, following the&#xD;
      input from participating clinics, the final inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated&#xD;
      as explained below. An updated sample size computation was done after inclusion had been&#xD;
      initiated, which was submitted to (date: 27th February, 2013) and accepted by (date: 15th&#xD;
      April, 2013) the funder (ZonMw, the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and&#xD;
      Development) using actual trial data in order to enhance accuracy of the estimates (the&#xD;
      expected treatment effect is the same in both computations, the other estimates were adjusted&#xD;
      to match then new criteria and available data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the primary outcome measure was computed on the basis of a dichotomous&#xD;
      dependent variable (detectable versus undetectable viral load), The data was planned to be&#xD;
      analyzed using a multi-level model (patients nested within nurses) that would account for&#xD;
      differential intervention effects between nurses. A total sample of 432 patients (18 nurses)&#xD;
      was required to detect significant intervention effects at post-intervention with an alpha =&#xD;
      .05 (two-sided) and 80% power, based on the following assumptions: depending on the nurse,&#xD;
      (a) 60% to 80% of the patients have an undetectable viral load during usual care (i.e. ≥ 6&#xD;
      months after start of cART), (b) this increases in the intervention condition compared to the&#xD;
      control condition by 5 to 20 percentage points, and (c) a nurse recruits on average 25&#xD;
      patients for the trial. (d) We expected a maximum dropout of 20%. We therefore intended to&#xD;
      include 450 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Updated sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The updated sample size computation is the following: A sample of 230 patients (22 nurses) is&#xD;
      required to obtain 80% power to detect a significant intervention effect on viral load for at&#xD;
      least one of three time points (for treatment-experienced patients: T1, T2, and T3; for&#xD;
      treatment-initiating patients: T3, T4, and T5) with alpha=.05 (two-sided) and using a&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction. Viral load at baseline is used as a covariate. A multilevel model is&#xD;
      used with random intercepts and random treatment effects at the nurse level. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on the following assumptions: depending on the nurse, (a) 60% to 80% of&#xD;
      treatment-initiating patients have an undetectable viral load during usual care (i.e. ≥ 6&#xD;
      months after start of ART), (b) 15% to 20% of treatment experienced-patients and all&#xD;
      treatment-initiating patients have a detectable viral load at baseline, (c) this increases in&#xD;
      the intervention condition compared to the control condition by 5 to 20 percentage points,&#xD;
      (d) a nurse recruits on average 11 patients for the trial, and (e) an expected maximum&#xD;
      dropout of 10%.&#xD;

    <description>The AIMS-intervention is counseling intervention, using MEMS-data printed in simple plots. The following intervention steps will be followed:&#xD;
-Discussion of practical, tailored information about adherence -Identification of desired adherence level and motivations -Print of patients' MEMS-report and comparison with desired level -ID causes of non-adherence and how to deal with problems -Designing a tailored action plan. -Follow-up: evaluation of accomplishments, remaining problems and solutions, until desired level of adherence has been accomplished. -Formulation of goals for behavioral maintenance.&#xD;
Among patients starting treatment, the same elements will be delivered but MEMS-feedback can only be incorporated in the second session (after medication has been used). Moreover, a readiness element is added at treatment initiation, where patients discuss the necessity and concerns of initiating medication and are offered the possibility to practice intake for 2 weeks with placebo.</description>
