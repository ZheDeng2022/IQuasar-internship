      Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) for peripheral arterial disease influences&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is an increasing widespread systemic disease, representing a significant&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and mortality for those affected by it. Age-adjusted prevalence of&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease lies at 12%, increasing to 20% in persons above the age of 70.&#xD;
      Five percent of patients with intermittent claudication develop critical limb ischemia within&#xD;
      five years from early symptoms, and are considered to be at risk of major amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst bypass surgery remains a valid treatment option for patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease and ensures good long-term anatomical patency and clinical durability, this trusted&#xD;
      surgical procedure comes at a certain risk of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, patent&#xD;
      vessels of good quality, particularly veins needed for the bypass procedure, are often&#xD;
      unavailable and impose limitations to the method. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)&#xD;
      has evolved in the past years as a valid treatment modality for patients with stenotic&#xD;
      arterial lesions of the lower extremities due to peripheral arterial disease. However,&#xD;
      re-stenosis following PTA for peripheral arterial disease is not uncommon and poses a serious&#xD;
      therapeutic problem. Despite the increasing prevalence and incidence of peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease in the population, timely diagnosis or use of diagnostic and prognostic markers are&#xD;
      still lacking (still lags behind the current diagnostic and treatment strategies for coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and acute coronary syndromes). Indeed, currently, only few recognisable risk&#xD;
      factors for the development of re-stenosis have been recognized. These include beside&#xD;
      clinically advanced peripheral arterial disease and diabetes mellitus, also pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      and pro-coagulatory states with high CRP and fibrinogen as well as post-interventionally&#xD;
      increased levels of von Willebrand factor and plasminogen inhibitor-1. Furthermore, TGF-beta1&#xD;
      levels are also significantly increased in patients with re-stenosis. The actual missing link&#xD;
      between these &quot;common&quot; pro-inflammatory markers and the occurrence of re-stenosis is however&#xD;
      not known - the answer may lie in subcellular fragments circulating in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, these so-called cell-derived plasma microparticles (MPs) are small phospholipid&#xD;
      vesicles up to 1.5 Âµm in size that are released from platelets, circulating leukocytes and&#xD;
      endothelial cells upon activation. Originating from lipid rafts, they contain defined&#xD;
      bioactive molecules that are potentially implicated in thrombogenesis and trans-cellular&#xD;
      activation. Additionally, pro-inflammatory functions may be mediated by putative&#xD;
      ligand-receptor interactions, classical pathway complement activation 11 and by triggering or&#xD;
      modifying target cells and their functions. Furthermore, MPs represent a population of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine-exposing sub-cellular fragments, function as &quot;carriers&quot; of circulating&#xD;
      tissue factor, and may be invaluable in maintaining normal haemostasis when platelet function&#xD;
      is impaired. Microparticles transport pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukins,&#xD;
      interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor alpha. Increasing evidence suggests that released&#xD;
      MPs are more than just inert cell debris or irrelevant platelet dust. Instead, they are&#xD;
      potent biological agents found in healthy individuals but also implicated in a variety of&#xD;
      diseases, including vascular inflammatory states after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes, and diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome e.g. diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) due to diabetes mellitus type 2&#xD;
      also present with an increased &quot;baseline&quot; pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory state. It&#xD;
      appears that in diabetic patients platelet-derived microparticles may participate in the&#xD;
      development or progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, elevated numbers of microparticles,&#xD;
      specifically platelet-derived, have been described in patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although microparticles have been well-documented as mediators of inflammation and&#xD;
      coagulation in various cardio-vascular disease events, it is currently not known how PTA for&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease influences microparticle numbers, phenotype and distribution pre-&#xD;
      and post interventionally and how they are related to or affect the incidence of early&#xD;
      re-stenosis - or if indeed they may be used to predict patients at risk of early re-stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Plasma derived microparticles actively influence the course of disease and are&#xD;
      associated with early re-stenosis/re-occlusion after angioplasty in patients (men and women)&#xD;
      with peripheral arterial disease by acting as mediators between innate- and cellular immunity&#xD;
      as well as the coagulation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The first aim of the study is to characterise and quantify microparticles from&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples at baseline and one day post-angioplasty Aim 2: The second aim is to&#xD;
      characterise and quantify microparticles in the follow up period 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-angioplasty and to identify whether the microparticle profile can be used to define&#xD;
      patients at greater risk for re-stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The third aim is to address the possible gender differences in microparticle&#xD;
      distribution and numbers in a sub-group analysis. This will be an important part of the&#xD;
      project as currently no such data exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will include measurements at baseline, one day, 2 weeks, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months post-angioplasty.&#xD;
