  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of sertraline treatment of depression in&#xD;
      older adults on gait stability, balance recovery reactions, and markers of bone metabolism.&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that will determine feasibility and generate hypotheses for a larger&#xD;
      definitive study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of antidepressant medication&#xD;
      frequently used to treat depressive and anxiety disorders in the elderly. Although widely&#xD;
      considered to be a safe option, several observational studies have found that SSRIs have as&#xD;
      strong an association with falls as other psychotropic medications including tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants and benzodiazepines. However, the potential mechanism for a link between&#xD;
      SSRIs and falls is unclear. Compared to other psychotropic medications, SSRIs have lower&#xD;
      rates of side effects that could contribute to falls, including sedation, orthostatic blood&#xD;
      pressure changes, and anticholinergicity. Interestingly, SSRIs have also been associated with&#xD;
      fractures, more so than other classes of antidepressants, in both administrative database&#xD;
      studies and prospective cohort studies that control for falls history. Serotonin is known to&#xD;
      play a role in regulating bone mass and some studies have found a loss of bone mass in&#xD;
      individuals on SSRI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of SSRIs with falls and fractures is confounded by depression which is itself&#xD;
      associated with falls, gait instability, bone loss and fractures. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to disentangle the contribution of the disease versus the treatment to risk of falls and&#xD;
      fractures. As a first step towards this goal, this pilot study will: i) estimate effect sizes&#xD;
      for statistical power calculations for an adequately powered study; and ii) examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of timely recruitment of older patients with major depression who have not taken&#xD;
      antidepressant medication for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address our research question, we have designed a prospective observational pilot study.&#xD;
      Older adults with depression will be assessed at baseline, and then 3,6, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of sertraline antidepressant therapy. A non-depressed comparison group will be&#xD;
      used to control for the learning effects of repeated assessment. The outcomes of interest are&#xD;
      changes in gait, static balance, and dynamic balance recovery reactions. Our primary outcomes&#xD;
      are the short-term changes in these variables at 3 weeks, but we will also perform a&#xD;
      longitudinal analysis to assess change over 12 weeks.&#xD;
