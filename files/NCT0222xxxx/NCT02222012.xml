      The investigators propose a multi-source pattern which integrates neuroimaging data&#xD;
      associated with multiple, symptom-related neural processes relevant in depression to improve&#xD;
      classification accuracy. The investigators conclude that combining brain activation related&#xD;
      to the core-symptoms of depression using the multi-source monitoring data substantially&#xD;
      increases classification accuracy while providing a sparse relational neuromarkers-model for&#xD;
      future prediction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The &quot;Multiway stimulator coil®&quot; (Brainsway Ltd.) is a novel TMS stimulator with several new&#xD;
      and unique properties. Currently standard TMS devices include a single channel, and can&#xD;
      operate only a single coil. The &quot;Multiway stimulator coil®&quot; (Brainsway Ltd.) includes two&#xD;
      channels which can operate two independent TMS coils, either simultaneously or sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Multiway stimulator coil®&quot; (Brainsway Ltd.) may be used to obtain a differential&#xD;
      activation of various brain regions. For instance it can be used to induce high frequency&#xD;
      stimulation of a certain brain region, thus inducing facilitation, while simultaneously&#xD;
      stimulate at low frequency in another brain region, leading to inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the investigators propose a multi-source pattern which integrates&#xD;
      neuroimaging data associated with multiple, symptom-related neural processes relevant in&#xD;
      depression to improve classification accuracy. The investigators conclude that combining&#xD;
      brain activation related to the core-symptoms of depression using the multi-source monitoring&#xD;
      data substantially increases classification accuracy while providing a sparse relational&#xD;
      neuromarkers-model for future prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to to monitor and optimize the anti depressive effect of brain&#xD;
      modulation technique using novel multi model monitoring approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with one of two designs of the study device (the &quot;Multiway Coil®&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single Channel with a coil placed over the left PFC (10 Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two channels: a. 10 Hz over the left PFC. b. 1 Hz over the right PFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in the current study will undergo monitoring procedure inclusive of functional&#xD;
      MRI and electroencephalogram.&#xD;
