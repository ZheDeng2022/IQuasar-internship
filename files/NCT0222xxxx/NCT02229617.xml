  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For people who identify as transgender, there is a strong sense that they were born into the&#xD;
      wrong body and that their outward looking body does not match how they truly feel about&#xD;
      themselves. They feel male, not female and have always felt that way. There is a great deal&#xD;
      of discomfort or dysphoria about looking and feeling female, and there is a strong desire to&#xD;
      achieve a more masculine appearance. While surgery, clothing and hair for example, can help a&#xD;
      person appear more like a male, many transgender males will want to take testosterone to make&#xD;
      them feel and look more masculine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This usually involves injecting testosterone into a muscle every 1-2 weeks for many years.&#xD;
      Intramuscular injections can often be uncomfortable or painful, and requires the patient to&#xD;
      be taught how to inject themselves. Or somebody else has to do it. There is a growing trend&#xD;
      in some transgender men to give their injection just below the skin or subcutaneously (like&#xD;
      insulin in a diabetic), because it is less uncomfortable but we don't really know if&#xD;
      testosterone gets into the blood in the same way. At least one clinic in the US already&#xD;
      suggests that patients can use the subcutaneous method but there is almost no research to&#xD;
      show it's the same as intramuscular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project will be looking at a small group of transgender males who are already on&#xD;
      intramuscular testosterone and then switch them over to the same dose of subcutaneous&#xD;
      testosterone, and then compare their levels of testosterone. If those levels are similar,&#xD;
      then patients may chose the less uncomfortable subcutaneous injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In caring for transgender males (born female but identify as male), intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      testosterone is considered standard of care if they elect therapy to transition. Yet, IM&#xD;
      testosterone has limitations: discomfort; a modest amount of teaching; bleeding concerns if&#xD;
      the patient is on anticoagulants; and fluctuations in circulating serum testosterone. Erratic&#xD;
      absorption may also led to variability in mood and energy. Due to these limitations, there is&#xD;
      a trend, especially in younger patients, to use the more comfortable subcutaneous (SC) route.&#xD;
      However, there are little data suggesting equivalency of SC to IM testosterone and virtually&#xD;
      no data in transgender males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In transgender males, SC testosterone will yield similar pharmacokinetics and better&#xD;
      tolerability when compared to IM testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate, using a cross-over design, whether pharmacokinetic parameters of SC vs. IM&#xD;
           testosterone administration are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize, using a validated pain questionnaire and patient diary, tolerability of&#xD;
           SC vs. IM testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (19-59 years old) on a weekly self-injection schedule of either T cypionate or&#xD;
      enanthate will be included. Patients with medical instability, recent or imminent surgery&#xD;
      will be excluded. Twenty-five patients will be recruited from the 6 local Vancouver Coastal&#xD;
      HealthTrans Primary Care physicians' clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a cross-over design, trough serum testosterone levels from the IM technique will be&#xD;
      determined weekly for 3 weeks. Patients will then switch to SC injection of the same&#xD;
      testosterone ester and dosage, and weekly trough levels measured for another 8 weeks. These&#xD;
      trough measurements will allow us to determine attainment of steady-state testosterone&#xD;
      levels. During the 3rd and 11th week, serial testosterone levels will be collected to&#xD;
      generate noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters, which will be compared between the two&#xD;
      techniques. Patients will complete a validated pain analogue questionnaire during the initial&#xD;
      3-week IM phase, and again during weeks 2 and 8 of the SC phase and maintain a diary&#xD;
      throughout the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used with p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      denoting significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If SC testosterone yields similar pharmacokinetics and better tolerability than&#xD;
      IM testosterone, it will reduce the perceived barrier of IM injections and mitigate&#xD;
      non-compliance. There are potential cost savings as patients will not require a clinician to&#xD;
      inject. The findings may also be generalized to hypogonadal males. Ultimately, results are&#xD;
      crucial to designing a larger multi-center study to provide definitive dosing&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
