      Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  develop an Internet-based education programme about venous leg ulcer nursing care (ELC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the clinical, cognitive and economical outcomes of education programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. What are the cognitive outcomes of ELC (perceived knowledge, attitudes towards venous leg&#xD;
      ulcer nursing care, theoretical knowledge level and practical knowledge)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for research question 1 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nurses using the ELC will have better knowledge (perceived, practical and theoretical&#xD;
           knowledge) than those who will not use the ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nurses using the ELC will have more positive attitudes towards venous leg ulcer nursing&#xD;
           care than those who will not use the ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. What are the clinical outcomes of ELC (ulcer healing, ulcer size, treatment supplies)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for research question 2 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ulcer healing progresses better among patients who are taken care by nurses using the&#xD;
           ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ulcer sizes will be 10 % smaller among the patients cared for nurses using the ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nurses using the ELC will use mire adequate treatment supplies than those who will not&#xD;
           use the ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. What are the economical outcomes (treatment time and supply usage) of ELC?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for research question 3 is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The economical expenditures will be lower among nurses using the ELC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate aim is to promote evidence-based nursing care among patients with venous leg&#xD;
      ulcer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study takes place in home-care in two Finnish municipality, which are similar size and&#xD;
      staff structure and working ideology are basically the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of participants has started with information occasion in both municipalities in&#xD;
      June 2014. Nurses were asked to fill the Patients Clinical Situation Questionnaire, handouts&#xD;
      and forms for informed consent were delivered. (Figure 1) All eligible nurses and patients&#xD;
      will be identified with Patient Clinical Assessment. The sample size was determined with&#xD;
      power analysis and the result was that 200 nurses are needed in the intervention group and&#xD;
      100 nurses in the comparison group.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention group will receive the ELC for six weeks (15.9. - 26.10.2014) and comparison group will not receive it.&#xD;
Members of the intervention group in will work in teams of 10 nurses with weekly questions (released in Mondays) based on patient-description existing in Moodle. One member of the team will send the solutions to questions once a week (in Thursdays) Moodle. Researcher will download the model-answer to Moodle once a week (in Fridays) and nurses will compare their answer to model answer (self-evaluation).</description>

    <intervention_name>Internet-based education of venous leg ulcer nursing care</intervention_name>
    <description>Intervention is delivering the ELC (Electronic Learning of venous leg ulcer nursing care) to home health-care nurses (registered nurses, public health nurses and licensed practical nurses) . The ELC development was based on the integrative literature review about nurses' knowledge gaps on venous leg ulcer nursing care. The pedagogical basis of the ELC is constructivism and blended learning approach. The ELC comprises contact learning and distance learning. Content of ELC is evidence-based information already existing in Internet and the basis of the information is the Finnish Current Care Guidelines for Chronic leg ulcers (2014), which are evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They are intended as basis for ulcer treatment decisions, and guidelines can be used by nurses and other healthcare professionals.</description>
