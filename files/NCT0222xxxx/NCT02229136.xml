  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase 2 study to evaluate two different steroid-based mouth rinses&#xD;
      (Miracle Mouth Wash plus hydrocortisone versus prednisolone oral rinse) for the prevention or&#xD;
      treatment of everolimus-associated stomatitis (mouth sores) in postmenopausal patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with an aromatase inhibitor plus everolimus. An exploratory analysis&#xD;
      will also evaluate patient response to next anti-cancer therapy of physician's choice&#xD;
      following discontinuation of therapy with an aromatase inhibitor plus everolimus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stomatitis, or inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the mouth and throat, is a common&#xD;
      side affect associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, stomatitis has&#xD;
      been reported in approximately 44% - 64% of patients treated with everolimus (Afinitor PI).&#xD;
      However, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor-induced stomatitis (mIAS) is a&#xD;
      different clinical entity, manifesting more frequently as discrete aphthous-like lesions&#xD;
      rather than diffuse inflammation. Oral lesions are typically well demarcated, single or&#xD;
      multiple ovoid-shaped ulcerations, with a grayish-white pseudomembrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the BOLERO-2 trial, 56% of patients with MBC (metastatic breast cancer) treated with&#xD;
      exemestane plus everolimus developed stomatitis, with 37% developing grade 2/3 stomatitis.&#xD;
      These rates are consistent with the rates reported with everolimus therapy in patients with&#xD;
      other types of cancers (Afinitor PI). Although this adverse event is reversible,&#xD;
      approximately one-fourth of the patients treated with everolimus in the BOLERO-2 trial&#xD;
      required dose interruptions or dose reductions, and this may impact the benefit from therapy.&#xD;
      Despite the frequency of stomatitis associated with mTOR inhibitor therapy, strategies to&#xD;
      prevent and/or ameliorate this painful side effect are not well defined or documented. Expert&#xD;
      guidelines on the management of mIAS have been developed, but these guidelines are based on&#xD;
      retrospective observational and/or anecdotal evidence, and prospective data on the efficacy&#xD;
      of mIAS prevention and management strategies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence to suggest steroid therapy may be helpful in the management of mIAS.&#xD;
      Steroid-containing ointments or mouth rises have also been shown to alleviate symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with non-chemotherapy associated apthous oral ulcers. Reports on the effectiveness&#xD;
      of non-steroid mouthwash formulations have been mixed, but agents that induce a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic effect, may help to reduce discomfort and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study has been designed to investigate the effectiveness of two oral rinses&#xD;
      (miracle mouth wash [MMW] plus hydrocortisone, vs prednisolone) to prevent or reduce the&#xD;
      severity of stomatitis in patients with MBC undergoing treatment with an aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      plus everolimus (AIE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because very little is known about the impact of everolimus therapy on response&#xD;
      to later lines of treatment for MBC, and preclinical data suggest mTOR inhibition may&#xD;
      resensitize cells to endocrine therapy, this study will also assess tumor response to next&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy of physician's choice, including duration of response and sites of&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive everolimus 10 mg PO QD (by mouth, every day) plus standard dose AI&#xD;
      (physician choice of Letrozole, Exemestane, or Anastrozole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of treatment with either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: MMW plus hydrocortisone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Prednisolone oral solution (15mg/5ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the oral rinse will start on Day 1 of everolimus therapy, and will be&#xD;
      self-administered. Patients will be instructed to swish and expectorate (cough or spit out)&#xD;
      10ml of the assigned mouth rinse 4 times per day. Patients may also gargle 4 times per day&#xD;
      with the assigned rinse for any symptoms of pharyngitis. Patients will also be instructed to&#xD;
      fill out the Oral Stomatitis Daily Questionnaire (OSDQ) at home every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of stomatitis, as well as other adverse events, dose reductions/interruptions,&#xD;
      and everolimus discontinuation due to toxicity, will be monitored for the first 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. After the end of the initial 12 week randomized portion of the study, patients&#xD;
      will continue to be followed every 2 months (for up to 1 year following discontinuation of&#xD;
      everolimus for progression or intolerable toxicity or progression on subsequent anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy, whichever occurs first) to determine when AIE treatment is discontinued and reason&#xD;
      for discontinuation (toxicity, progression), sites of disease progression, response to next&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy of physician's choice (by physician assessment) and duration of response,&#xD;
      and sites of disease progression to next anti-cancer therapy following progression on AIE.&#xD;
