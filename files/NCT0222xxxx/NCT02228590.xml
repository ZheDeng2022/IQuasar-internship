    <measure>The Percentage of Patients With Resolution of an 'OFF' Episode to an 'ON' State Following Administration of APL-130277</measure>
    <time_frame>At 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after dosing at Visits 3 - 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical confirmation of an 'OFF' state was assessed prior to dosing and confirmation of 'OFF' or 'ON' was assessed after dosing at Visits 3 - 5 by the Investigator. The first full 'ON' dose was defined as the earliest dose in which a patient achieved a full 'ON' state as assessed by the Investigator. The percentage of patients who achieved their first full 'ON' is presented for each timepoint, regardless of the dose received, and for the study overall (i.e. all post-dose timepoints).</description>

          <description>At each dosing visit patients were assessed in a 'OFF' state by withholding their PD medication the night before, a dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not convert to a full 'ON' state within 3 hours and did not experience orthostatic hypotension, the next higher dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not turn ON with the next higher dose, levodopa was administered and completed their visit. Possible administered doses of APL-130277 were 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. Dosing Day 1: The starting dose was 10 mg APL-130277, and if no response 15 mg was administered. Dosing Day 2: Either the dose which elicited a response (i.e. an 'ON' state) at Day 1 was administered or the next higher dose (20 mg) was given. If no response occurred at 20 mg APL-130277, 25 mg was administered. Dosing Day 3: Either the dose which elicited a response at Day 2 was administered or the next higher dose (30 mg). If no response occurred at 30 mg the patient was discontinued.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Patients With Resolution of an 'OFF' Episode to an 'ON' State Following Administration of APL-130277</title>
        <description>Clinical confirmation of an 'OFF' state was assessed prior to dosing and confirmation of 'OFF' or 'ON' was assessed after dosing at Visits 3 - 5 by the Investigator. The first full 'ON' dose was defined as the earliest dose in which a patient achieved a full 'ON' state as assessed by the Investigator. The percentage of patients who achieved their first full 'ON' is presented for each timepoint, regardless of the dose received, and for the study overall (i.e. all post-dose timepoints).</description>
        <time_frame>At 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after dosing at Visits 3 - 5.</time_frame>
        <population>The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication.</population>

            <title>APL-130277</title>
            <description>At each dosing visit patients were assessed in a 'OFF' state by withholding their PD medication the night before, a dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not convert to a full 'ON' state within 3 hours and did not experience orthostatic hypotension, the next higher dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not turn ON with the next higher dose, levodopa was administered and completed their visit. Possible administered doses of APL-130277 were 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. Dosing Day 1: The starting dose was 10 mg APL-130277, and if no response 15 mg was administered. Dosing Day 2: Either the dose which elicited a response (i.e. an 'ON' state) at Day 1 was administered or the next higher dose (20 mg) was given. If no response occurred at 20 mg APL-130277, 25 mg was administered. Dosing Day 3: Either the dose which elicited a response at Day 2 was administered or the next higher dose (30 mg). If no response occurred at 30 mg the patient was discontinued.</description>

          <title>Duration of 'ON' Response From Time of Dosing of APL-130277</title>
          <description>Clinical confirmation of 'OFF' or 'ON' was assessed after dosing at Visits 3 - 5 by the Investigator. The duration of the 'ON' response was defined as the length of time in which a patient was confirmed 'ON' within a dose, and was calculated from the time noted by the Investigator and recorded in the eCRF. The mean duration of the first full 'ON' response following administration of APL-130277 is presented for patients who turned 'ON' for the study overall.</description>
          <population>The mITT Population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication, and data is presented for patients who turned 'ON'.</population>

            <description>At each dosing visit patients were assessed in a 'OFF' state by withholding their PD medication the night before, a dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not convert to a full 'ON' state within 3 hours and did not experience orthostatic hypotension, the next higher dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not turn ON with the next higher dose, levodopa was administered and completed their visit. Possible administered doses of APL-130277 were 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. Dosing Day 1: The starting dose was 10 mg APL-130277, and if no response 15 mg was administered. Dosing Day 2: Either the dose which elicited a response (i.e. an 'ON' state) at Day 1 was administered or the next higher dose (20 mg) was given. If no response occurred at 20 mg APL-130277, 25 mg was administered. Dosing Day 3: Either the dose which elicited a response at Day 2 was administered or the next higher dose (30 mg). If no response occurred at 30 mg the patient was discontinued.</description>

            <description>At each dosing visit patients were assessed in a 'OFF' state by withholding their PD medication the night before, a dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not convert to a full 'ON' state within 3 hours and did not experience orthostatic hypotension, the next higher dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not turn ON with the next higher dose, levodopa was administered and completed their visit. Possible administered doses of APL-130277 were 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. Dosing Day 1: The starting dose was 10 mg APL-130277, and if no response 15 mg was administered. Dosing Day 2: Either the dose which elicited a response (i.e. an 'ON' state) at Day 1 was administered or the next higher dose (20 mg) was given. If no response occurred at 20 mg APL-130277, 25 mg was administered. Dosing Day 3: Either the dose which elicited a response at Day 2 was administered or the next higher dose (30 mg). If no response occurred at 30 mg the patient was discontinued.</description>

            <description>At each dosing visit patients were assessed in a 'OFF' state by withholding their PD medication the night before, a dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not convert to a full 'ON' state within 3 hours and did not experience orthostatic hypotension, the next higher dose of APL-130277 was administered. If the patient did not turn ON with the next higher dose, levodopa was administered and completed their visit. Possible administered doses of APL-130277 were 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. Dosing Day 1: The starting dose was 10 mg APL-130277, and if no response 15 mg was administered. Dosing Day 2: Either the dose which elicited a response (i.e. an 'ON' state) at Day 1 was administered or the next higher dose (20 mg) was given. If no response occurred at 20 mg APL-130277, 25 mg was administered. Dosing Day 3: Either the dose which elicited a response at Day 2 was administered or the next higher dose (30 mg). If no response occurred at 30 mg the patient was discontinued.</description>
