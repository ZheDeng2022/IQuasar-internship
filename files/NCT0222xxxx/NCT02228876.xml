      This 3-year proposal is a family-based cohort study to establish a representative sample of&#xD;
      probands with ASD and their parents with well-characterized environmental, clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes, endophenotypes, and genetic data to conduct CNV experiments and the&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations. Based on our previous findings, probands with CNVs larger&#xD;
      than 500kb has been identified and their families will be newly recruit in the present&#xD;
      project to reveal the origin of the CNVs and reveal the clinical feature of the families. The&#xD;
      significant findings in specific genes will conduct pathway analysis to reveal the etiology&#xD;
      in ASD, providing further understanding in the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to its high prevalence, long-term impairment, high genetic component (heritability &gt;&#xD;
      90%), and lack of effective prevention and treatment, ASD has been prioritized for genetic&#xD;
      studies. However, despite extensive genetic research, there has been no any conclusive result&#xD;
      mainly due to the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ASD. Given the progress of CNV study&#xD;
      in ASD, several challenges remain to be faced with, such as differences in phenotypic&#xD;
      definition across different studies; a lack of population norms for CNVs, and a lack of&#xD;
      consensus in methods for CNV detection and analysis. In the present study, the large segments&#xD;
      of CNV found in ASD probands will be compared with standardized controls from National Center&#xD;
      for Genome Medicine (NCGM), Academia Sinica to identify the possible CNVs. The other&#xD;
      important issue of CNV research in ASD is to investigate whether the origin of CNVs are&#xD;
      inherited or de novo. By collecting the complete background and revealing the CNVs of the&#xD;
      parents and siblings, the origin of the CNVs will be uncovered in the present project. The&#xD;
      candidate genes from important CNVs will be identified by pathway analysis. Gene expression&#xD;
      will be conducted to confirm the pathogenic genes. Notably the present study will help bridge&#xD;
      the gap to translate the bench findings to bedside to help early detection of ASD and pave&#xD;
      the way developing effective treatment for ASD in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the above-mentioned rationale of this project and limited research budget from NSC, the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of this project is to identify the important CNVs to reveal the pathogenic&#xD;
      genes for ASD for future translational research in ASD and to prospectively characterize&#xD;
      clinical features of ASD individuals with CNV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are as follows,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify important and pathogenic CNVs by comparing the CNVs and CNPs of the controls&#xD;
           provided by NCGM , Academia Sinica;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess parents and siblings of ASD patients who were found to have ~500 kb CNVs in&#xD;
           our previous study using clinical, psychopathological, and social measures for family&#xD;
           study and also to conduct CNV analysis in the families to determine the origin of the&#xD;
           CNVs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct a follow-up assessments of clinical features, and social and&#xD;
           neuropsychological functions of ASD probands with CNV to examine the phenotype changes&#xD;
           over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the clinical phenotypes between de novo and inherited groups to reveal the&#xD;
           pathogenic CNVs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To conduct pathway analysis of genes involved in the CNVs, and to confirm the pathogenic&#xD;
           genes by conducting gene expression analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To investigate the associations of clinical phenotypes such as autistic tendency, and&#xD;
           social impairments between (1) probands with/without CNVs/controls, and (2)&#xD;
           probands/unaffected siblings/controls.&#xD;

        Based on our preliminary CNV results of 339 probands, approximately 120 probands had been&#xD;
        identified to have CNVs larger than 500kb. In the present project, the parents and siblings&#xD;
        of the probands with CNVs larger than 500kb will be recruited (estimated sample size,&#xD;
        parents = 200, siblings = 40) and reassess the ~120 probands.&#xD;
