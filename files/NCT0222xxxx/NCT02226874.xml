      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The National Cancer Institute was funded to study how much radiation U.S. veterans who&#xD;
      served in the 1950s were exposed to. Researchers want to estimate how much radiation these&#xD;
      veterans received. They will use two methods and compare them. One is to interview the&#xD;
      veterans and study their military records. The other is to take blood samples and look for&#xD;
      certain types of changes in the blood cells. Being exposed to some kinds of radiation is&#xD;
      known to cause changes in blood cells. The amount of changes to these cells tells scientists&#xD;
      about how much radiation was received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand how to measure how much radiation a person has received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Veterans who were exposed to radiation at a specific site in the Pacific in 1954 or&#xD;
           other sites in the 1950s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Veterans close in age to the first group, who have low levels of exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men about 25 years old with no exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1 visit, in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have blood drawn. This will take 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The exposed veterans will be interviewed. They will answer questions about the nuclear&#xD;
           events they experienced. This will take up to 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the exposed veterans, researchers will look at their military records, if they can.&#xD;
           They will estimate how much radiation the veteran received.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Understanding the potential consequences of exposures from nuclear detonations is a current&#xD;
      national security concern. In the event of a nuclear detonation, an important priority for&#xD;
      the scientific and national security community is to be able to estimate exposure to the&#xD;
      general population for medical triage, treatment, follow-up and risk projection for public&#xD;
      health purposes. The only available comprehensive exposure estimates for persons exposed to&#xD;
      nuclear detonation radiation are from studies of wartime atomic bomb survivors. There is an&#xD;
      urgent need to evaluate exposure assessment methods in other populations and to determine how&#xD;
      well each works and the obstacles involved in the application of each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of other studies of exposures to nuclear detonation radiation, the Atomic&#xD;
      Veterans Epidemiologic Study (AVES)1, a large ongoing study of atomic veterans of 115,000&#xD;
      atomic veterans who participated in aboveground nuclear weapon tests during 1945-1962&#xD;
      provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the lasting biological effects of radiations&#xD;
      received during nuclear detonations. That study has the means for identifying veterans who&#xD;
      received the highest exposures as well as control subjects with minimal to no exposure. An&#xD;
      overview of the AVES can be found at&#xD;
      http://www.vbdr.org/meetings/2013/Presentations/02_Dr_Boice.pdf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a small methodologic investigation with the following objective:&#xD;
      evaluate the level of agreement between radiation exposure estimates from the generally&#xD;
      simple and inexpensive assessment strategy of model-based dose reconstruction with the only&#xD;
      well-established long-term biologically-based dose estimation technique - quantification of&#xD;
      chromosome aberration frequency. In this study, the dose reconstruction would include&#xD;
      individual interview data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would be conducted using a group of U.S. veterans exposed to nuclear detonation&#xD;
      radiation during the 1950s and 1960s. While there are many thousands of veterans still alive&#xD;
      today who participated in nuclear testing-related activities, only 16 have been identified&#xD;
      that are still living and that have estimated exposures of sufficient magnitude for the&#xD;
      chromosome aberration frequency assay to be successful. These particular veterans were&#xD;
      exposed on Rongerik Atoll in the Pacific in 1954 and at the Nevada Test Site in 1951-1952.&#xD;
      The dose estimates will also be compared against individual records of exposure obtained from&#xD;
      radiation film-badges, when available. All the persons to be studied are part of the study&#xD;
      cohort in the AVES study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of evaluating the model-based dose reconstruction with the dose estimates&#xD;
      based on chromosome aberration frequency will be to assess the presence of any substantial&#xD;
      differences (either systematic or random) in doses now being estimated via model-based dose&#xD;
      reconstruction in the AVES. Because the chromosome aberration frequency assay is difficult,&#xD;
      expensive and somewhat invasive (requiring a blood sample), it is not practical in a study of&#xD;
      many thousands of subjects as in the AVES. Determination that the model-based dose&#xD;
      estimations are not systematically different from FISH-estimated doses is of substantial&#xD;
      value to the AVES. To a limited degree, i.e., within the constraints of the small sample&#xD;
      size, the study may be indicative of the potential for model-based dose estimates to be&#xD;
      relied upon if mass exposures were to take place from a nuclear detonation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is noteworthy that the collection of samples and data to evaluate doses in this study will&#xD;
      take advantage of a one-of-a-kind situation to obtain exposure-related data from a unique&#xD;
      (and rapidly dwindling) population living persons exposed to atomic weapons detonation&#xD;
      radiation a situation that cannot be repeated except under wartime or actual national threat&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXPOSED VETERANS. Subjects for this investigation are required to have received, according&#xD;
        to military records, whole-body radiation doses in excess of 0.25 Sv to ensure adequate&#xD;
        detection of the radiation exposure by the FISH method. The recorded doses are crude dose&#xD;
        estimates, often based on group radiation monitoring rather than on individual data,&#xD;
        however, they are the only information available, upon which to select the study subjects&#xD;
        that meet our criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To date, 16 exposed veterans that meet this requirement have been identified by the AVES&#xD;
        through accessing databases of the NTPRP constructed by the Dept. of Defense.&#xD;
