      The purpose of this study is to investigate if including fitness testing in preventive health&#xD;
      checks increase cardiorespiratory fitness and motivation to change physical activity behavior&#xD;
      compared with preventive health checks without fitness testing.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changing unhealthy lifestyle improves health and reduces morbidity. Motivation is a key&#xD;
      component in initiation and maintenance of lifestyle changes. Identifying and motivating&#xD;
      individuals with unhealthy lifestyle to change behaviour may be achieved through preventive&#xD;
      health checks as already implemented in some countries. However, knowledge about the impact&#xD;
      of individual components included in preventive health checks is lacking. Consequently, the&#xD;
      most effective composition of preventive health checks remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Danish municipality, the Check your Health Prevention Program (CHPP) was recently&#xD;
      initiated, offering preventive health checks to all 30 to 49 year-old citizens. This program&#xD;
      provides the unique opportunity to evaluate single components of a preventive health check in&#xD;
      a real-life setting. Only a few previous studies have included cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      (fitness) testing in a preventive health check. Fitness is associated with multiple health&#xD;
      benefits such as improved cardio-metabolic profile and reduced risk of cancer, diabetes, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate the effect of including fitness testing in preventive&#xD;
      health checks on fitness level, motivation for changing physical activity behaviour, physical&#xD;
      inactivity prevalence and self-rated health. The investigators hypothesize that fitness&#xD;
      testing as part of preventive health checks compared to preventive health checks without&#xD;
      fitness testing 1) increases fitness level assessed after one year and the percentage of&#xD;
      participants increasing motivation to change physical activity behaviour assessed after two&#xD;
      weeks, and 2) reduces physical inactivity prevalence and improves self-rated health scores&#xD;
      during the one-year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested-design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial is embedded in the above mentioned health promotion program, CHPP, which is&#xD;
      conducted during the years 2012 to 2017. In the CHPP, all citizens living in the municipality&#xD;
      of Randers aged 30-49 years per 1st of January 2012 (n = 26,216) were identified in the&#xD;
      Danish Civil Registration System.The identified population was randomized into five equal&#xD;
      groups, one for each year of the CHPP. Invitations are dispatched continuously by mail and&#xD;
      include information about the CHPP and a prefixed appointment for a health check. Health&#xD;
      checks and health behavioural courses will take place at Randers Health Centre and health&#xD;
      consultations at the citizen´s general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health check&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the addition of fitness testing in the intervention group, the preventive health&#xD;
      checks will include assessments of the following: body weight and height, waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and&#xD;
      triglycerides), HbA1c and lung function. Moreover, a baseline questionnaire regarding&#xD;
      physical activity level, motivation for changing physical activity behaviour, self-rated&#xD;
      health, smoking, and alcohol will be answered in connection with the health check. At the end&#xD;
      of the health check, the results are presented in a personalized health profile leaflet,&#xD;
      which includes recommendations for follow-up according to the risk-profile. The baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and the subsequent follow-up procedures are identical in the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization and education&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health check will be conducted by health professionals who have been trained in all&#xD;
      measurement procedures as well as in risk communication to ensure standardization and&#xD;
      quality. Execution of the health check is further standardized by a written protocol and&#xD;
      adherence to the protocol is checked continuously. Furthermore, a process evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed by submaximal cycle ergometer testing. Motivation&#xD;
      for changing physical activity behavior will be assessed using the Transtheoretical Model´s&#xD;
      Stages of Change, and secondary outcomes using a modified version of the questions developed&#xD;
      by Saltin and Grimby and the Short-Form 12, Health Survey, version 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a questionnaire regarding motivation for changing physical&#xD;
      activity behaviour two weeks after the health check and will be invited for fitness testing&#xD;
      after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is handled by a data-manager with no scientific involvement. The eligible&#xD;
      population for this trial was defined by the CHPP randomization. Citizens randomized for the&#xD;
      third out of five years of the CHPP will be further randomized by household to either&#xD;
      intervention or control in the present trial. The intervention, the outcomes, group&#xD;
      assignment, and the future outcome assessments in this trial are unrevealed in the invitation&#xD;
      for the CHPP. The health behavioural courses and the health consultations will be carried out&#xD;
      un-blinded due to the real-life setting. At the one-year follow-up, the personnel assessing&#xD;
      the outcomes will be independent and blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated sample size of 1,500 participants allows for a categorical analysis of fitness&#xD;
      level and is calculated on the basis of the following assumptions: 1:1 randomization, false&#xD;
      positive error rate of 0.05, power of 0.8, intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 and&#xD;
      categorical analysis with a power to detect a difference of 10% in the prevalence of very low&#xD;
      fitness between the study groups. The investigators determined this 10% difference to be&#xD;
      clinically meaningful based on expert opinions and criteria employed in other research. The&#xD;
      intracluster correlation coefficient was included to reflect a possible clustering effect of&#xD;
      the general practitioners (n = 46), which is seldom greater than 0.05 in primary care&#xD;
      settings. The estimated sample size accounts for a 30% loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using STATA 12.0 software. Continuous variables are&#xD;
      presented as mean ±standard deviation and categorical variables as absolute numbers and&#xD;
      relative (%) frequencies. In the comparative analyses Student´s t-test will be used, when&#xD;
      comparing means or changes in means of continuous variables and Chi2-test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      t-test, when comparing proportions for categorical variables. Analyses will be adjusted for&#xD;
      baseline physical activity. Stratified analyses will be performed on sex and age groups and&#xD;
      analysis of motivation will only be performed on the subgroup comprising precontemplaters,&#xD;
      contemplaters, and preparators at baseline. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. If appropriate, multiple imputation methods will be applied (using data from&#xD;
      social and medical national registries coupled with health check data), and sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will be performed. Moreover, the potential effect of clustering by the general&#xD;
      practitioners will be investigated. The statistical significance level is set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS AND LEGAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will comply with The Declaration of Helsinki and each participant will provide&#xD;
      written informed consent for data to be used for research purposes in agreement with the&#xD;
      Danish Health Law. Approval by The Danish Data Protection Agency is obtained (2013-41-2527).&#xD;
