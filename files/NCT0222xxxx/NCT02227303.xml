      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of 8-weeks use of the Medidata Patient&#xD;
      Cloud (a mobile application for capturing data directly from subjects, enabling entry of&#xD;
      diary and quality of life data into internet-enabled devices) in combination with an activity&#xD;
      tracker (Fitbit Flex) on health outcomes in overweight people with Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;
