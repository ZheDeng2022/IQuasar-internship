      In case of PET or CT based cN1 (suspected) NSCLC, ESTS guidelines propose mediastinal staging&#xD;
      by echo-endoscopy OR mediastinoscopy. Recent data show a sensitivity of less than 50% for&#xD;
      echo-endoscopy to detect N2 disease in cN1 NSCLC patients, while prevalence of mediastinal&#xD;
      nodal disease was 24% (unpublished data Aster II).2 The investigators plan to perform a&#xD;
      prospective multicentric observational study to measure the sensitivity of mediastinal&#xD;
      staging by video-assisted mediastinoscopy (VAM) in cN1 operable and resectable (suspected)&#xD;
      NSCLC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few reports in the literature evaluated the final pathological stage distribution of patients&#xD;
      with resectable and operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with clinical stage cN1.&#xD;
      These retrospective series demonstrated that patients with computed tomography (CT) based cN1&#xD;
      often had clinically occult mediastinal lymph node metastases (N2/3 disease). Hishida et al.&#xD;
      reported that 30% of 143 patients with cN1 were diagnosed N2/3 by mediastinoscopy3. Watanabe&#xD;
      et al. reported that 37% of 168 patients with cN1 were diagnosed N2/3 by mediastinoscopy 4.&#xD;
      Adding FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) to CT might enable the detection of N2/3&#xD;
      disease among these cN1 patients, but negative PET findings do not necessarily exclude N2/3&#xD;
      disease. Kim et al reported that 19,2 % of 99 patients with cN1, in whom cN2 was ruled out by&#xD;
      PET-CT scan, were found to have pathologic N2 disease at pulmonary resection with mediastinal&#xD;
      lymph node dissection.5 In conclusion, 20-30% of patients with cN1 nodes on imaging, and&#xD;
      normal sized FDG-negative mediastinal lymph nodes on CT and PET have malignant involvement in&#xD;
      their mediastinal nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACCP guidelines state that invasive preoperative mediastinal staging should be performed&#xD;
      in these cN1 patients 6. The updated ESTS guidelines recommend mediastinal staging by&#xD;
      echo-endoscopic or mediastinoscopy.1 Non-randomized trials suggested the potential of linear&#xD;
      endosonography for mediastinal staging 7-9. However, the patients with cN1 disease form only&#xD;
      a minority in these studies. A recently performed prospective ASTER 2 trial (N=100) showed a&#xD;
      sensitivity of echo-endoscopic for mediastinal staging of 38% (ITT analysis), while the&#xD;
      prevalence of mediastinal nodal disease was 24% (unpublished data Aster 2) 2. The conclusion&#xD;
      made by ASTER 2 is that a negative endosonography must be followed by a VAM. However, the&#xD;
      investigators consider such double approach not cost-effective in a setting with N2&#xD;
      prevalence &lt;30%. Therefore, it seems reasonable to perform a VAM instead of an endosonography&#xD;
      in cN1 patients, which is one of the proposed strategies in the recent ESTS guidelines.1&#xD;
      However, there is no prospective study to date that assessed the sensitivity, NPV and&#xD;
      accuracy of VAM in a well-defined group of cN1 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several publications have demonstrated a lobe-specific mediastinal nodal drainage for upper&#xD;
      versus lower lobe NSCLC. Shapiro et al conclude that in early lung cancer, including cN1&#xD;
      disease, lobe-specific mediastinal dissection is warranted 10. However, in this study the&#xD;
      only patient with a positive subcarinal node, upper lobe tumour, and negative superior&#xD;
      mediastinal nodes had positive N1 nodes. To the investigators knowledge there is no study&#xD;
      focussing on mediastinal nodal dissemination patterns in cN1 patients.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with operable and resectable cT1-2-selected T3 cN1cM0 NSCLC undergo VAM for mediastinal lymph node staging. After VAM, patients without tissue proof of N2/3 disease at surgical staging undergo a VATS or thoracotomy with systematic lymph node dissection during the same anaesthesia or at a later stage.&#xD;
Sensitivity, NPV and accuracy of staging with VAM will be calculated. Provided N2 lymph node metastases are proven by VAM the patient goes off study protocol and can further be assessed/treated according to local clinical practice.</description>
