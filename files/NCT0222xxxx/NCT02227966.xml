  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this preliminary study is to investigate whether the transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves the cognitive function in patients with Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS over the&#xD;
      left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Patients or their&#xD;
      legally responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to&#xD;
      use it at home. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied everyday in the morning for&#xD;
      12 weeks. The patients were evaluated at baseline, at week 6 and 12.&#xD;
