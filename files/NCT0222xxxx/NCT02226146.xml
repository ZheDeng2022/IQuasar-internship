      This is an open-label, proof-of-concept, single group study in adult patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, moderate to extensive BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 2 weeks, an open-label&#xD;
      treatment period lasting 4 weeks consisting of IV infusion of bertilimumab on Days 0 and 14&#xD;
      and 28, and a safety and efficacy follow-up period of approximately 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive concomitant oral steroids during the treatment and follow-up period.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, proof-of-concept, single group study in adult patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, moderate to extensive BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 2 weeks, an open-label&#xD;
      treatment period lasting 4 weeks consisting of IV infusion of bertilimumab on Days 0 and 14&#xD;
      and Day 28, and a safety and efficacy follow-up period of approximately 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive concomitant oral steroids during the treatment and follow-up period.&#xD;
      They will start on 30 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent). The initial dose will be&#xD;
      maintained for at least 1 week, commencing on Day 0, until blister formation has ceased,&#xD;
      crusts and erosions have disappeared and reepithelialization of lesions has started. The&#xD;
      corticosteroid dose will then be reduced to 20 mg daily for 5 to 14 days. According to&#xD;
      clinical response, this will be followed by corticosteroid dose reduction in 5 mg steps every&#xD;
      5 to 14 days until a dose of 10 mg daily is reached and then corticosteroid dose reduction in&#xD;
      2.5 mg steps every 5 to 14 days until the end of the study.&#xD;
