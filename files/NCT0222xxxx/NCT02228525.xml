    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Simon's two-stage minimax design, this trial will accrue a maximum of 20 patients. Early termination may occur if no responses are observed in the first 13 patients. If at least one response is observed, the trial will continue to the maximum sample size. At the end of the trial, the treatment strategy will be considered promising in this patient population if at least 3 patients achieve a response. The type I and type II errors are set at 0.10.</description>

    <measure>response duration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response duration will be calculated among patients who achieve a response of HI, mCR, PR or CR using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Median duration of response and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival from the time of study enrollment will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Overall survival curves will be displayed for the study population along with selected quantiles and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of survival.</description>

    <measure>tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability of Selinexor and ST will be evaluated by means of drug related AE reports, physical examinations, and laboratory safety evaluations. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.03 will be used for grading of AEs.</description>

    <description>Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who are refractory to hypomethylating agents (decitabine or 5-azacytidine) will receive oral selinexor at a starting dose of 60 mg twice weekly for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of no therapy. Dose reductions are permitted for patients who are benefiting from selinexor but have poor tolerance. After discontinuation from treatment, patients will be followed by the study staff for survival status approximately every three months.</description>
