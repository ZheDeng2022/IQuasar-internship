  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to demonstrate that the Flow Area within a blocked coronary vessel as&#xD;
      assessed by OCT is greater with the MGuard Prime stent compared to non-mesh control stent&#xD;
      (BMS/DES) in subjects undergoing primary PCI for ST-segment elevation MI. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that end of procedure flow area is greater with the MGuard Prime compared with&#xD;
      stenting with a non-mesh DES or BMS.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The reference vessel diameter (RVD) of the infarct lesion is 2.75-4.0 mm by visual&#xD;
             assessment, assessed after TIMI 2/3 flow is restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The entire lesion length requiring treatment is ≤33 mm by visual assessment, assessed&#xD;
             after TIMI 2/3 flow is restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has not&#xD;
             reached the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study&#xD;
             endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A previous coronary interventional procedure of any kind within 30 days - - - Female&#xD;
             patients of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (patients in whom cardiopulmonary&#xD;
             resuscitation was successfully performed and in whom normal mental status was&#xD;
             achieved, may be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiogenic shock (SBP &lt;80 mmHg for &gt;30 minutes, or requiring IV pressors or&#xD;
             intra-aortic balloon bump (IABP) or other hemodynamic support device for hypotension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of thrombolytic therapy for the current admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the last 6&#xD;
             months, or any permanent neurologic deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intracranial bleed at any time, or known intracranial pathology (e.g. tumor,&#xD;
             arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or recent major bleeding within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or inability to accept blood&#xD;
             transfusions.&#xD;

             or v) contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated (prior anaphylaxis,&#xD;
             however, is an absolute contraindication to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL or platelet&#xD;
             count &lt;150,000 for the present admission or within 7 days prior to index procedure, if&#xD;
             available. NOTE: Baseline labs do not have to be available to consent patient. If&#xD;
             laboratory results become available only after randomization, and do not meet&#xD;
             inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient will not be de-registered from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

          -  Rheolytic thrombectomy, a PTCA balloon with diameter &gt;2.0 mm, or any other device&#xD;

             proximal to, at or distal to the target lesion making it unlikely that the OCT&#xD;
             catheter or stent will be able to reach or can be deployed across the target lesion&#xD;
             with full expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion is a bifurcation with a side branch ≥2.0 mm in diameter.&#xD;

&#xD;
