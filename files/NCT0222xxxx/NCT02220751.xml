      The purpose of the study was to monitor the activity of periodontal disease and suggest&#xD;
      potential biomarkers related to active periodontal disease in patients with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (PD) associated or not with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), based on the&#xD;
      evaluation of the profile of gene expression of periodontal sites and the evaluation of&#xD;
      inflammatory salivary proteins. Two hundred and five periodontal patients were enrolled, but&#xD;
      only 41 exhibited ≥ 1 mm attachment loss in at least three periodontal site (active sites) 2&#xD;
      months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. The final sample was: 21 patients with chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (PD group) and 20 with chronic periodontitis and diabetes (PD+DM group).&#xD;
      Fifteen periodontal- and systemically healthy patients were included as control group. Saliva&#xD;
      collection, glycated hemoglobin measurement, periodontal examination and radiographs were&#xD;
      conducted before and 2 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Radiographic&#xD;
      subtraction was performed from pairs of the radiographs. Measurements of the areas with&#xD;
      density loss were recorded. Gingival biopsies of active and non-active sites with similar&#xD;
      clinical parameters were harvested for Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Array gene&#xD;
      expression analysis. Saliva samples were analyzed by Multiplex Cytokine Profiling Immunoassay&#xD;
      for analysis of protein expression. The clinical attachment loss mean was higher in the PD+DM&#xD;
      group (p&lt;0.05). There was a high correlation between clinical attachment loss and darkened&#xD;
      radiographic areas in active sites of the PD group and PD+DM group. When compared PD group to&#xD;
      PD+DM, patients with diabetes had an up-regulated profile. Active sites of the PD group&#xD;
      showed nine genes (specific chemokines, interleukins and receptors) differentially expressed&#xD;
      with an up-regulated profile. Active sites of the PD+DM group showed six genes (specific&#xD;
      chemokines, interleukins and receptors) differentially expressed with an up-regulated&#xD;
      profile. After periodontal therapy, there was a reduction of some salivary proteins in both&#xD;
      periodontal groups, but not significant. In conclusion, it was possible to identify genes&#xD;
      differentially expressed in active sites from both groups, which may be considered useful in&#xD;
      indicating potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of periodontitis; salivary proteins show a&#xD;
      trend in distinguishing the standard of health and disease and may be used in the future as&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of periodontitis with or without diabetes.&#xD;

      This case-control longitudinal study was carried out at University of São Paulo between March&#xD;
      2009 and June 2012 as a joint collaboration of the Department of Oral Surgery and&#xD;
      Periodontology and the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Metabolism. It was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Human Ethics Research Committee&#xD;
      of the Ribeirão School of Dentistry - University of Sao Paulo (process n. 2009.1.88.58.7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical attachment loss above 1 mm was determined according to the tolerance method&#xD;
      adapted to the computerized periodontal probe, considering the standard deviation of 0.3 mm&#xD;
      for the electronic probe multiplied by 3. Teeth with prosthesis or furcation lesions were not&#xD;
      considered. The periodontal sites that had this clinical attachment were called active sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the initial clinical examination, a supragingival scaling with ultrasonic&#xD;
      device was performed to facilitate the examination. The clinical parameters evaluated were:&#xD;
      probing pocket depth, relative clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing were&#xD;
      recorded at six sites per tooth with the aid of a computerized periodontal probe. To reduce&#xD;
      the variations between baseline and 12-month evaluations, an acrylic stent was used to&#xD;
      standardize the position of the computerized periodontal probe. Bleeding on probing was&#xD;
      assessed according to presence or absence of bleeding up to 20 seconds after probing. The&#xD;
      plaque index, presence or absence of biofilm, was recorded at four sites per tooth. It was&#xD;
      also verified the furcation involvement with the aid of a manual periodontal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical parameters were recorded two weeks after supragingival scaling (baseline) and&#xD;
      two months after non-surgical periodontal therapy by one-blinded calibrated examiner. A&#xD;
      calibration exercise was performed to achieve acceptable intraexaminer reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the metabolic control assessment, the HbA1c levels were analyzed in patients from both&#xD;
      groups at baseline and two months after non-surgical periodontal therapy, at the&#xD;
      Endocrinology Clinic of the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, University of São Paulo. All&#xD;
      diabetics were under the supervision of an endocrinologist advised to communicate any change&#xD;
      in medicine intake or diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A program of plaque control with dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene instruction, and the&#xD;
      scaling and root planning sessions were performed by the same operator using curettes and an&#xD;
      ultrasonic device in PD and PD+DM groups. All scaling and root planning procedures were&#xD;
      inspected for a second operator. Oral hygiene was reviewed after a week and after a month of&#xD;
      periodontal disinfection, followed by dental prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PD+DM group, the non-surgical periodontal therapy was associated with systemic doxycycline&#xD;
      100 mg/day, for two weeks after an initial dose of 200 mg, started on the day before&#xD;
      periodontal therapy. Patients of the PD group had no access to information about antibiotics&#xD;
      administration to patients of the PD+DM group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-stimulated whole expectorated saliva was collected (~ 3 ml) from each subject into&#xD;
      sterile tubes. Subjects were refrained from eating, drinking, and oral hygiene for 2 hours&#xD;
      prior to saliva collection. Saliva samples were placed on ice immediately and aliquoted prior&#xD;
      to freezing at -80º Celsius. Samples were thawed and analyzed within 6 months of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete series of radiographs was taken in each patient at baseline, using the paralleling&#xD;
      technique. Two months after periodontal therapy, radiographs were taken with the same&#xD;
      technique in teeth with active periodontal sites. Thereafter, the radiographs were digitized&#xD;
      in tagged image file format (TIFF) on a scanner. Digital subtraction radiographs were&#xD;
      performed with the baseline and 2-month radiographs using specific software. Only teeth with&#xD;
      interproximal sites with periodontal disease activity were included in this analysis. Changes&#xD;
      between radiographs were depicted as a darkened area for loss of alveolar bone mass. These&#xD;
      areas were measured (mm2) using specific measurements software. As in the clinical&#xD;
      examination, it was performed intra-examiner calibration for the measurements of areas of&#xD;
      radiographic density loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival tissue samples were obtained from active sites of the each patient in both groups&#xD;
      during regular periodontal surgery. The excised gingival collar was then carefully removed&#xD;
      from the roots and the alveolar process. Gingival biopsy comprised epithelial and connective&#xD;
      tissues. The samples are immediately submerged into liquid nitrogen to be then stored at -80º&#xD;
      Celsius for RNA extraction and gene expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA from biopsies was extracted using the Trizol reagent according to the directions&#xD;
      supplied by the manufacturer. From 1 µg of total RNA, a strand of complementary DNA (cDNA)&#xD;
      was synthesized through a reverse transcription reaction according to the directions supplied&#xD;
      by the manufacturer. At the end of this reaction, cDNA was stored at -20º Celsius for later&#xD;
      use. The Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Array allowed simultaneous analysis of 84&#xD;
      genes involved in specific signaling pathways. The genes included in PCR array plates for&#xD;
      human inflammatory cytokines and receptors.&#xD;
