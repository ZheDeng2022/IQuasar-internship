      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is bleeding around the under surface of the brain&#xD;
      caused by rupture of an aneurysm arising from a blood vessel. Stroke may occur in&#xD;
      approximately one third of patients as a result of narrowing of the blood vessels around the&#xD;
      brain, following aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One theory as to why this may happen is because bleeding around the base of the brain damages&#xD;
      particular cells (neurons) that control blood flow around the rest of the brain. These&#xD;
      neurons may control blood flow by releasing a neurotransmitter called Acetyl Choline (ACh).&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that damage to these neurons may prevent the production of ACh, which then&#xD;
      causes reduced blood flow and stroke if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By stimulating these neurons, we aim to investigate whether it is possible to improve the&#xD;
      blood flow around brain and ultimately prevent strokes in patients following subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage. Donepezil, a drug widely used in dementia, inhibits the brain's natural break&#xD;
      down of ACh. We predict that by increasing the amount of Ach in these neurons, donepezil may&#xD;
      improve blood flow to the brain, reducing the chance of developing stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to St George's hospital with a confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage between the ages of 18 and 85 years old will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      trial. The protocol has been designed to take place around the patients' aneurysm treatment,&#xD;
      which is performed under general anesthesia (GA). Recruited participants will be anesthetized&#xD;
      for their aneurysm treatment and then enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial participants will have a Xenon CT scan under GA to assess brain blood flow prior to&#xD;
      having treatment of their aneurysm. Patients randomized to donepezil treatment will receive a&#xD;
      loading dose of 20mg via a feeding tube immediately after their Xenon scan. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group will not receive the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the trial will undergo repeat Xenon perfusion scanning under GA between 3 and&#xD;
      4 hours after their first scan, which coincides with the completion of their aneurysm&#xD;
      treatment. Those in the donepezil group will then receive a daily dose of 5 mg for a period&#xD;
      of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of care other than those related to the trial will be the same as for any other&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. Patients (or their legal representative for those unable&#xD;
      to consent) will be able to decline participation in the trial or withdraw at any point.&#xD;

All participants will be regularly evaluated by clinical staff while inpatients under care of the neurosurgical service. Those discharged prior to the 6 week period will be followed up regularly by telephone and provided with a diary to record potential adverse events.</description>
