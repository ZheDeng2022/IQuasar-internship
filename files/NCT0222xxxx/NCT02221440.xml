  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementary oxygen is routinely administered to patients, even those with adequate oxygen&#xD;
      saturations, in the belief that it increases oxygen delivery. However, oxygen delivery&#xD;
      depends not just on arterial oxygen content but also on perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal oxygen administration has been used in an attempt to lessen fetal distress by&#xD;
      increasing the available oxygen from the mother. However, the effect of supplemental maternal&#xD;
      oxygen therapy on fetal acid base status has been debated for more than seven decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Prophylactic maternal low flow nasal oxygen administration during the second&#xD;
      stage of labor can relieve fetal distress.&#xD;

      A report from the cochran library (Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Dec 12;12:CD000136.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Too little evidence to show whether oxygen administration to the woman during labour is&#xD;
      beneficial to the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some babies show signs of distress, such as unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel&#xD;
      motion (meconium) during their mother's labour. This may be caused by a lack of oxygen&#xD;
      passing from the woman to the baby through the placenta. Sometimes, women may be encouraged&#xD;
      to breathe extra oxygen through a facemask (oxygen administration) to increase the oxygen&#xD;
      available to the unborn baby. A review of two trials found too little evidence to show&#xD;
      whether oxygen administration to the woman during the second stage of labour is beneficial to&#xD;
      the baby. No trials of oxygen administration when the baby is showing signs of distress were&#xD;
      found. Further research is needed.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apgar score less than 7</measure>
    <time_frame>at one and five minutes after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from 0 to 2, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from 0 to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration). The infant is given a score of 0, 1 or 2. The scores are added up and the total sum is their Apgar score.&#xD;
The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.</description>
