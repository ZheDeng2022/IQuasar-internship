  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to determine absorption profile of a sugar-based beverage on&#xD;
      inflammatory mechanism by timing of beverage consumption relative to meal intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to determine absorption profile of a sugar-based beverage on oxidative&#xD;
      and metabolic mechanism by timing of beverage consumption relative to meal intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be served as an internal reference or negative control group to compare with&#xD;
      polyphenol containing studies from other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive 3 identical placebo drinks at each time points: fasting (0h), with&#xD;
      standardized breakfast meal (2h), and 2 hours after the breakfast meal (4h). A planned size&#xD;
      of 12 will be recruited into this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-arm design utilizing a multiple sampling, and repeated measures&#xD;
      paradigm to evaluate timing influence of consumption of sugar-based beverage associated acute&#xD;
      effect on inflammatory markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A planned sample size of 12 will be recruited into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit, one pre-study visit, and 1 study visit. The study will take 1-2&#xD;
      weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject informed consent document and determine&#xD;
      subject eligibility through height and weight measurements, vital signs, blood glucose test&#xD;
      (finger prick), and completion of a survey related to general eating, health, and exercise&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day)&#xD;
      will be instructed at initial screening visit and collected at a pre-study visit to assess&#xD;
      subjects' baseline dietary intake pattern. After reviewing baseline food records, subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to avoid any berry products throughout the study and follow a strictly&#xD;
      limited polyphenolic diet for 3 days prior to the study visit, while maintaining their usual&#xD;
      diet pattern and physical activity. Prior to 10-hr study visit, a dinner meal will be&#xD;
      provided the day before the study visit to control the second meal effect from the food and&#xD;
      beverage intake of the night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the study visit fasted for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After pre-study&#xD;
      procedures (height, weight, waist circumferences, vital sign, and blood glucose measurements)&#xD;
      , a registered nurse will place a catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple blood&#xD;
      sample collections and take the initial blood draw at fasting. Thereafter, blood sample&#xD;
      collection will occur every 1 hour for the next 10 hours. During the 10-hr study visit,&#xD;
      subject will drink one of 3 identical placebo drinks at fasting (right after fasting blood&#xD;
      draw), 2nd placebo drink with the breakfast meal (2 hrs after fasting blood draw) and the 3rd&#xD;
      placebo drink at 2 hours after the breakfast meal (4 hrs after fasting blood draw).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal female subjects will be studied during the follicular phase of their menstrual&#xD;
      cycle because food intake tends to be more stable during the follicular phase (days 1-13)&#xD;
      than during the luteal phase (days 14-28) when the rise in progesterone levels decrease&#xD;
      satiety often resulting in increased intake.&#xD;
