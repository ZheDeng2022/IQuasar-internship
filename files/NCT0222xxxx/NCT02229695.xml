      This is a prospective comparison trial. Patients that will be included in the trial are those&#xD;
      that will have operations in which their abdominal closure is temporary, i.e. patients&#xD;
      sustaining trauma or septic abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be grouped according to the method of temporarily abdominal closure (TAC)&#xD;
      procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Bogota bag&quot; (BB), a sterile intravenous bag silo closure. The two methods are currently&#xD;
           accepted with no clear cut evidence to prefer one on another. At Soroka Medical Center&#xD;
           the decision to choose either of the methods is at the surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure will be measured in all patients by the urinary bladder pressure&#xD;
      technique at 6 12 24 ant 48 hours post operation. The measurement is a routine procedure done&#xD;
      as part of the monitoring processes of critically ill patients in the General Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (GICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for the development of acute intra abdominal hypertension with or&#xD;
      without abdominal compartment syndrome.&#xD;

      Comparison of intra-Abdominal hypertension development after bogota bag or VAC abdominal&#xD;
      closure Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate and compare in a standardized manner the development of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      hypertension (IAH) following VAC closure and &quot;Bogota bag&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective comparison trial. Patients that will be included in the trial are those&#xD;
      that will have operations in which their abdominal closure is temporary, i.e. patients&#xD;
      sustaining trauma or septic abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be grouped according to the method of temporarily abdominal closure (TAC)&#xD;
      procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VAC closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Bogota bag&quot; (BB), a sterile intravenous bag silo closure. The two methods are currently&#xD;
           accepted with no clear cut evidence to prefer one on another. At Soroka Medical Center&#xD;
           the decision to choose either of the methods is at the surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure will be measured in all patients by the urinary bladder pressure&#xD;
      technique at 6 12 24 ant 48 hours post operation. The measurement is a routine procedure done&#xD;
      as part of the monitoring processes of critically ill patients in the GICU. It will be&#xD;
      carried out by a nurse who will be blinded as to the type of the abdominal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for the development of acute and significant respiratory&#xD;
      compromise, including an elevated inspiratory pressure of &gt;35 mbar and a decreased partial&#xD;
      oxygen pressure / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) of &lt;150 torr, hypotension (&lt;90 mmHg&#xD;
      systolic pressure not due to hemorrhagic, septic, or neurogenic causes), renal dysfunction&#xD;
      (urine output, &lt;30 mL/hr), and a clinically determined rigid, tense abdomen, and increased&#xD;
      abdominal circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded. Hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure, heart rate),&#xD;
      lactate, PaO2, partial carbonic dioxide pressure (PaCO2), tidal volume, peak airway pressure)&#xD;
      and renal (urine output) functions will be registered at 24 and 48 hours following surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the indication for operation, type of trauma, its severity and the operative&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and fluid balance at 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reoperations. Time in ICU and time to final abdominal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with severe abdominal trauma or none traumatic acute abdomen, that at the end of&#xD;
      operation the surgeon will decide to use temporary abdominal closure (TAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Adults male or female over 18 years old. The surgeon decides the need for&#xD;
      TAC at the end of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Patients that the surgeon estimates they will not survive 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of IAH Development of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) Need for reoperation&#xD;
      of decompressive laparotomy during first 48 hours. Time to final (on discharge from hospital)&#xD;
      abdominal closure and the type of closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methodology The calculated sample size based on power of 0.80, alpha 0.05, known&#xD;
      incidence of 0.25 and estimated incidence of 0.10 is 42 patients.&#xD;
