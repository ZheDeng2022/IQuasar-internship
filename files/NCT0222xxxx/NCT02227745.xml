      Photocoagulation is the standard treatment in the focal EMCS, disrupts vascular leakage and&#xD;
      allows the pigment epithelium remove the intraretinal fluid is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of visual loss but can reduce contrast sensitivity and retinal sensitivity, the&#xD;
      characteristics of the function can be reduced such as setting (location and stability) are&#xD;
      relevant to the quality of the patient's vision parameters, reading comprehension, especially&#xD;
      the ability, duration of diabetic macular edema, could have a significant impact on survival&#xD;
      and / or the functional reserve of the macular cells subjected to mechanical and toxic&#xD;
      stress-induced edema. It seems that in the treatment of patients with EMCS, photoreceptor&#xD;
      damage occurs as a recent phenomenon, and can precede neurodegeneration retinal photoreceptor&#xD;
      loss, whereby visual function can be decreased. An adjunctive treatment as Dorzolamide&#xD;
      facilitating effect helping resorption of intraretinal fluid through EPR and reduce adverse&#xD;
      events that is the loss of contrast sensitivity and retinal sensitivity, response time of&#xD;
      photocoagulation treatment could be reduced to the patient, because the rate of resorption of&#xD;
      intraretinal fluid is facilitated and thus the duration of the response, also could reduce&#xD;
      damage to vision caused by the inadequacies of the photoreceptors during the evolution of&#xD;
      macular edema avoiding moderate visual loss, there by increasing the quality of life in terms&#xD;
      of improving the quality of vision in diabetic patients. In addition to obtaining a specific&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with photocoagulation is helpful for focal edema in diabetic and a new&#xD;
      level using dorzolamide in retina Dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy after focal&#xD;
      photocoagulation is more effective than placebo in improving visual function in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema&#xD;

      Patients referred to ophthalmology for developing type 2 diabetes subspecialist&#xD;
      ophthalmologist evaluate the macula them by biomicroscopy, pupillary dilation, to detect&#xD;
      clinically significant macular edema. EMCS diagnosis is made according to ETDRS criteria, and&#xD;
      patients who were requested to submit fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with focal leakage on angiography were scheduled focal photocoagulation;&#xD;
      day focal photocoagulation is measured before the procedure Measurement of visual acuity,&#xD;
      visual acuity, refraction Measuring contrast sensitivity Measurement of retinal sensitivity&#xD;
      Measurement of Optical Coherence Tomography ophthalmoscopic review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently photocoagulation treatment was applied according to the guidelines of the ETDRS&#xD;
      (1-50 number of shots, shot diameter of 100 microns and 120-180 mW power) and the patient was&#xD;
      re-evaluated at 4 weeks, which will repeat the testing day photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient what the research project will be discussed, will be invited to participate, will&#xD;
      be read and informed consent was explained, questions and concerns will be clarified during&#xD;
      the study, and patients who agree to enter the study will be assigned so random treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient 1 drop of topical drug in the treaty provided every 8 hours for 4 weeks eye is&#xD;
      placed, the drug provided will be needed for 4 weeks, plus a control sheet dose delivery will&#xD;
      be provided and shall be referenced again in April weeks later for evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of topical treatment, evaluation from 8:00 to 11 pm will be the same from the&#xD;
      first date&#xD;
