  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This thorough QT (TQT) study will take place in healthy subjects administered single doses of&#xD;
      study drug. It will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, 4-treatment&#xD;
      crossover study. Subjects will be randomized in an equal ratio to one of 12 possible&#xD;
      treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence will comprise all 4 treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization&#xD;
      Phase will have 2 periods: Screening (up to 27 days) and Baseline Period 1 (1 day).&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined during the Screening Period. The Randomization Phase will&#xD;
      consist of 8 periods: Treatment Period 1, Baseline Period 2, Treatment Period 2, Baseline&#xD;
      Period 3, Treatment Period 3, Baseline Period 4, Treatment Period 4, and a Follow-Up Period.&#xD;
      Each Baseline Period will last 1 day, followed by the corresponding treatment period. On the&#xD;
      first day of each treatment period, subjects will receive a single dose of the assigned study&#xD;
      drug. During each treatment period, subjects will be required to stay in the clinical unit&#xD;
      from the baseline period to 24 hours postdose. Subjects will then be released from the clinic&#xD;
      and will undergo a washout interval of at least 13 days, during which time they will return&#xD;
      for additional PK sampling.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy, non-smoking, male or female subjects ages greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
             to less than or equal to 55 years old at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 18 to less than or equal to 30 kg/m2&#xD;
             at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a&#xD;
             negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]). A separate baseline assessment is&#xD;
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse&#xD;
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method&#xD;
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], or have a vasectomized partner with&#xD;
             confirmed azoospermia, but not oral contraceptive or contraceptive implant) throughout&#xD;
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently&#xD;
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as described above if&#xD;
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation. Hormonal contraceptives (oral or implant) are not permitted forms of&#xD;
             contraception in this study. All females will be considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive&#xD;
             months, in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause) or&#xD;
             have been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least one month before dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing potential&#xD;
             or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30&#xD;
             days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the study&#xD;
             period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Evidence of disease that may influence the outcome of the study within 4 weeks before&#xD;
             dosing (eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver,&#xD;
             kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological&#xD;
             system, or cardiovascular system, or subjects who have a congenital abnormality in&#xD;
             metabolism)&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examinations, vital signs, ECG finding, or laboratory test results that requires&#xD;
             medical treatment at Screening or Baseline Periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             interfere with study procedures or compromise subject safety&#xD;
&#xD;
