      Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an assisted reproductive technology (ART) by which&#xD;
      embryos, created through in vitro fertilization (IVF), can be screened for genetic conditions&#xD;
      or traits before they are implanted into a woman s uterus. Within the past few years, a&#xD;
      controversial non-medical use of PGD has gained recognition as having possible significant&#xD;
      ethical implications. Non-medical sex selection (NMSS) describes the use of PGD technology to&#xD;
      choose the sex of a child for social, as opposed to medical, reasons. In the US and a select&#xD;
      few other countries, it is legal to use NMSS for family balancing, or the intentional&#xD;
      selection of an underrepresented sex to balance a family where the majority of the children&#xD;
      are of one sex. Proponents of family balancing believe that NMSS is an expression of&#xD;
      reproductive autonomy and is ethically acceptable on those grounds. Opponents are more likely&#xD;
      to cite beneficence (toward the existing children and the potential future child) and justice&#xD;
      (resource allocation and access, for example) as the basis for concerns around NMSS and&#xD;
      family balancing specifically. In the US and other countries, healthcare providers (HCPs) are&#xD;
      often the gatekeepers to this technology. There is little research exploring the experiences&#xD;
      of HCPs with PGD and NMSS. The Moral Experience framework (Hunt and Carnevale, 2011) is&#xD;
      useful for understanding the potential concerns of HCPs as well as their feelings and&#xD;
      behaviors evoked by lived and hypothetical experiences around NMSS. Also of interest is how&#xD;
      HCPs feel that decisions about NMSS are made and their preferences as to how they should be&#xD;
      made. Finally, there is concern that NMSS may be the first in a line of non-medical uses for&#xD;
      PGD and that a slippery slope toward what some describe as designer babies will follow. We&#xD;
      are interested in eliciting the traits that HCPs believe are hypothetically appropriate or&#xD;
      inappropriate for PGD and how they make the distinction. Interviews with HCPs (OBGYNs and&#xD;
      reproductive endocrinologists) on these topics will be transcribed and subjected to thematic&#xD;
      analysis in order to identify common themes. An understanding of the experiences and&#xD;
      attitudes of this stakeholder population can help clarify current issues at individual,&#xD;
      societal, and global levels and future directions for research and policy....&#xD;
