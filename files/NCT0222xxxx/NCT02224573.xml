      To investigate the potential antiepileptic effects of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P) in children&#xD;
      and young adults with Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label extension study for participants with Dravet syndrome or&#xD;
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have previously participated in double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical studies of GWP42003-P (Core Studies). The first participant will not enroll into the&#xD;
      open-label extension study until the Data Safety Monitoring Committee has reviewed the safety&#xD;
      data from Part A of study GWEP1332.&#xD;
