  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cardiac, Vascular and Cognitive Dysfunction (CVCD) Alliance will be a prospective,&#xD;
      multi-ethnic cohort study in healthy Canadian individuals between 35 and 69, looking at&#xD;
      contextual risk factors and novel predictors of hard events over a period of four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique features of this initiative are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI as the sole imaging technique (including the use of a mobile MRI machine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contextual factor analysis (including community environmental profile assessments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record linkage follow-up of individuals to health services (administrative) databases&#xD;
           for major morbidity and mortality events and health services utilization&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac, vascular, and cognitive dysfunction have a strong impact on the quality of life,&#xD;
      longevity and health care costs, in Canada and globally. Cardiovascular risk factors account&#xD;
      for up to half of the attributable risk for dementia, mediated in large part by difficult to&#xD;
      detect microvascular disease of the brain. In this study the investigators will try to&#xD;
      understand the role of the societal structure, nutrition, access to health services, and&#xD;
      other socio-environmental and contextual factors on cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical&#xD;
      disease and clinical cardiovascular events at the individual and population levels. We will&#xD;
      try to identify markers for early subclinical dysfunction in the brain, vessels, heart and&#xD;
      abdomen using magnetic resonance imaging and investigate the associations with contextual and&#xD;
      individual determinants of these markers, as well as to assess the predictive value of novel&#xD;
      markers of subclinical dysfunction on the development of clinical cardiovascular events.&#xD;
