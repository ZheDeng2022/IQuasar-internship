      The investigators plan a study to randomize 540 children in Nepal to early (≤30 seconds) or&#xD;
      late (≥180 seconds) clamping of the umbilical cord at birth. The children will be followed&#xD;
      with blood tests (hemoglobin and ferritin) at 8 and 12 months of age, and their development&#xD;
      is evaluated by questionnaire (Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire ) at 12 months of age, and by&#xD;
      testing (Bayley -III) at 18-24 months of age. By implementing the project in a country with a&#xD;
      high proportion of anemia at one year of age (about 75%), we can reduce the number of&#xD;
      children in the study and still achieve significant results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is a global health problem and causes anemia and impaired neurodevelopment in&#xD;
      children. Anemia is estimated by WHO to occur among 25% of all children before school age,&#xD;
      and the corresponding figure in Europe is 3-9 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By waiting 3 minutes to clamp the cord after birth, a large part of the child's blood volume&#xD;
      remaining in the placenta is transfused over to the child's body. Research shows that the&#xD;
      neonate's blood volume can increase by about 40% and this blood contains 3 to 4 months'&#xD;
      supply of iron. In Sweden, we have shown that late clamping of the umbilical cord could&#xD;
      reduce iron deficiency in children at four months of age by 90%. Globally, most countries&#xD;
      practice early cord clamping and the child is deprived of the placental blood transfusion.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that by delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord, anemia at&#xD;
      8 and 12 months will be reduced an this in turn will be beneficial for the childrens&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be implemented at Paropakar Maternity and Women 's Hospital, Kathmandu. It&#xD;
      hosts approximately 23,000 births annually.&#xD;

      Study Protocol Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping on anaemia at 8 and 12 months and&#xD;
      later neurodevelopment in late pre-term and term infants; a facility-based&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial in Nepal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction At the time of birth, the infant is still attached to the placenta via the&#xD;
      umbilical cord. The infant is usually separated from the placenta by clamping the cord with&#xD;
      two clamps. This task takes place during the third stage of labour, which is the period of&#xD;
      time from the birth of the infant to the delivery of the placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active management of the third stage of labour has been described in a recent World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) report as the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of obstetric and midwifery practice during the&#xD;
      latter part of the 20th century. Active management has involved the clinician intervening in&#xD;
      the process through three interrelated processes: the administration of an uterotonic drug;&#xD;
      early cord clamping and cutting; and controlled traction of the umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early cord clamping has been generally advised to be carried out in the first 30 seconds&#xD;
      after birth, regardless of whether the cord pulsation has ceased. Due to evidence shown the&#xD;
      last decade, recent guidelines for management of the third stage of labour no longer&#xD;
      recommend immediate cord clamping but changes in practice is questioned and policies on&#xD;
      hospitals are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible beneficial and adverse effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed clamping allows time for a transfer of the fetal blood in the placenta to the infant&#xD;
      at the time of birth. This placental transfusion can provide the infant with an additional&#xD;
      40% more blood volume. The amount of blood returned to the infant depends on when the cord is&#xD;
      clamped and at what level the infant is held prior to clamping. Neonatal benefits associated&#xD;
      with this increased placental transfusion include higher haemoglobin concentrations,&#xD;
      additional iron stores and less anaemia later in infancy, higher red blood cell flow to vital&#xD;
      organs and better cardiopulmonary adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed cord clamping has been linked to an increase in the incidence of jaundice which, in&#xD;
      severe cases, could have longer term effects on the health and development of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies performed by the principal investigator in a high-income country has shown&#xD;
      that delayed cord clamping, compared with early clamping, resulted in reduced prevalence of&#xD;
      neonatal anaemia. Furthermore delayed, cord clamping improved iron status and reduced&#xD;
      prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) at 4 months of age without demonstrable adverse effects.&#xD;
      As ID in infants even without anaemia has been associated with impaired development , delayed&#xD;
      cord clamping seems to benefit full term infants even in regions with a relatively low&#xD;
      prevalence of ID anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later effects on anaemia and development:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improved iron stores at four to six months after delayed cord clamping suggests that ID&#xD;
      anaemia could be reduced at eight to twelve months of age, but this could not be shown in the&#xD;
      principal investigators latest study, possibly due to small sample size. Although ID anaemia&#xD;
      is rare (3-9 %) in high income countries, the negative impact on children's health and&#xD;
      development should not be underestimated. As an example, a 15 % reduction of anaemia in&#xD;
      Sweden among toddlers (from 3 to 2,5 %) would help 500 children annually. No randomized trial&#xD;
      has evaluated the effect of delayed versus early cord clamping on infants after 6 months of&#xD;
      age in a low income country with high prevalence of iron deficiency and anaemia. As anaemia&#xD;
      is associated with extensive health effects, such as stunting, fatigue and impaired&#xD;
      neurodevelopment reducing anaemia in infants is an urgent need in a global perspective. In a&#xD;
      recently published observational study from Peru, anaemia at eight months of age was&#xD;
      evaluated at infants born before and after a hospital change of regime from early to delayed&#xD;
      cord clamping. The study resulted in a significant reduction of anaemia by 16% (from 75 to&#xD;
      59%) as well as a significant higher level of haemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study in Nepal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal, children age 6-17 months have high anaemia prevalence (72-78%). Approximately 50%&#xD;
      of all anaemia among preschoolers can be contributed to ID. By performing the planned study&#xD;
      in a country with high anaemia prevalence, we can reduce sample size dramatically and still&#xD;
      be able to detect significant effects on haemoglobin levels and neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of delayed and early cord clamping on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anaemia (and haemoglobin level) at 8 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ferritin at 8 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bilirubin at 2-3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or special care nursery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Development at 12 and 18-24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be infant haemoglobin 8 and 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be neonatal morbidity (need for phototherapy, and respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms). Maternal postpartum haemorrhage; effects of delayed and early cord clamping on&#xD;
      iron status at 8 and 12 months of age; psychomotor development at 12 months of age assessed&#xD;
      by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire and development evaluated by The Bayley Scales of Infant&#xD;
      and Toddler Development at 18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial comparing delayed and early cord clamping will be implemented in&#xD;
      the hospital. The study will be conducted at the Paropakar Maternity and Women's Hospital,&#xD;
      Nepal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women are eligible if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late preterm or term pregnancy (gestational age 34 to 41 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single pregnancy with expected vaginal delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mother/family give consent to return for follow-up at 8 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are serious congenital malformations, syndromes, or other congenital&#xD;
      diseases that could affect the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When delivery is imminent (expected within 10 minutes), the midwife will opened a sealed,&#xD;
      numbered, opaque envelope containing the treatment allocation. The interventions consist of&#xD;
      delayed clamping of the umbilical cord (≥180 seconds after delivery) or early clamping of the&#xD;
      umbilical cord (≤60 s). The time from complete delivery of the baby to the first clamp on the&#xD;
      umbilical cord will be measured with a stopwatch by the midwife's assistant or the&#xD;
      surveillance officer. All other aspects of obstetric care will be managed according to&#xD;
      standard practice at the hospital. In both groups, oxytocin will be given to the mother after&#xD;
      the umbilical cord is clamped. All staff in the delivery unit will be trained in the study&#xD;
      procedures before the trial started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the delivery, the babies will be cared for according to clinical routines, and early&#xD;
      breast feeding will be encouraged. As part of the study, the infant will be assessed at 1 and&#xD;
      6 hours by the midwife, who will record if the baby has been breast fed and the presence of&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms (that is, respiratory rate &gt;60 breaths/minute, presence of nostril&#xD;
      flaring, grunting, or intercostal retractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will stay at the postnatal ward with their mothers for two or three days, except for&#xD;
      well babies whose mothers preferred to leave the hospital earlier and infants who requires&#xD;
      admission to the neonatal unit. Transcutaneous bilirubin will be checked at 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      of age if newborn is still at the hospital, and before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 8 and 12 months of age, infants will be scheduled for a follow-up visit including blood&#xD;
      sampling (hemoglobin and ferritin) and weight and length measurements. Venous blood sampling&#xD;
      will be performed. Before the visit, parents will be asked to complete a three day food diary&#xD;
      to assess whether the infant was exclusively or partially breast fed and whether formula or&#xD;
      solids were given. Parent will be assisted in answering the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If funding is achieved, children wil be examined by The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler&#xD;
      Development, Third Edition at 18-24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians performing neonatal examinations, staff members responsible for collection of&#xD;
      blood samples and background data, and laboratory staff performing analyses of blood samples&#xD;
      will be blinded to each infant's allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected from maternal healthcare records: reported&#xD;
      illness, medication, parity, weight, height, smoking habits at the time of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the primary outcome at eight months was estimated to find a difference of&#xD;
      15% (70% versus 55%) in the prevalence of anaemia between the two randomization groups with a&#xD;
      power of 80% and a type I error rate of .05. Using Fisher's exact-test to analyze outcome&#xD;
      data a group size of 176 would be needed. Taking into account an attrition rate of 35% we&#xD;
      calculate to include 270 newborns in each group, i.e. a total of 540.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research involving newborn infants and small children need careful ethical&#xD;
      considerations, mainly since the subjects themselves can't agree to whether they want to&#xD;
      participate in the study or not. In particular, research that is not immediately of benefit&#xD;
      for the patients needs ethical consideration. The included infants are healthy full-term&#xD;
      infants undergoing umbilical cord clamping, which is a standard procedure after birth. The&#xD;
      possible benefit of the intervention (delayed cord clamping) of increasing iron stores and&#xD;
      preventing infant anaemia is estimated to be higher than the risk of probable adverse&#xD;
      effects, such as hyperbilirubinaemia. Ethical approval has be sought and obtained from Nepal&#xD;
      Health Research Council (June 6, 2014, 76/2014). Written informed parental consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before the intervention, and parents can withdraw from the study at any time without&#xD;
      any need for explanations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion and Policy Implication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing ID among infants is important as it is associated with impaired neurodevelopment. In&#xD;
      Sweden, ID has been found among 26% of 12 months old infants. With high global prevalence of&#xD;
      infant anaemia, delayed cord clamping has the potential to reduce infant anaemia and thereby&#xD;
      improve infants' and children's health and development. In crude numbers, a reduction by 10%&#xD;
      would mean an annual reduction of 60 000 infants with anaemia in Nepal. The trial is&#xD;
      important to perform as although strong indications exists on the effect of delayed cord&#xD;
      clamping on anaemia at 8 to 12 months of age, it has not been evaluated by a randomized&#xD;
      trial. By the proposed study, outcome as well as safety effects will be analyzed, and results&#xD;
      might not only contribute to the practice in Nepal, but also to the global community, in&#xD;
      particular low income countries with a high prevalence of ID anaemia.&#xD;
