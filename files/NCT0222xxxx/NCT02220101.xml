      Comparison of four methods for measuring temperature perioperatively in patients scheduled&#xD;
      for laparoscopic surgery and intensive care patients who are hypo-, normo-and hyper terme;&#xD;
      Bladder Monitoring, Nasopharyngeal, SpotOn TM, Zero heat flux method and Temporal Scanner.&#xD;
      The study is a single-center, observational study carried out by the Central Surgical and&#xD;
      Intensive Section at Vestfold Hospital Trust.&#xD;

      Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perioperative hypothermia is associated with several serious complications and therefore&#xD;
           most likely to be avoided. Monitoring of body temperature is therefore required&#xD;
           perioperatively .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are in the literature concerns that some methods of measuring temperature&#xD;
           perioperatively is accurate enough and whether they reflect core temperature adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some authors have questioned whether temporal scanner (TS ) - and nasopharynx ( NP) -&#xD;
           measurements are accurate enough to measure the actual core temperature. Much of the&#xD;
           research on TS measurements have been done on children and newborns in an intensive&#xD;
           setting, but little perioperatively .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 patients will be included ; 60 at Central Operations and 60 at Intensive&#xD;
      Section at the Vestfold Hospital Trust. Duration of inclusion will be approximately one year&#xD;
      . Starting around January 2014. The study emanates from Vestfold Hospital Trust and was&#xD;
      designed by Espen Lindholm who is responsible for the project , Camilla B Norén who is&#xD;
      principal investigator and project manager. Kjetil G Ringdal , Karl - André Wian and Knut&#xD;
      Arvid Kirkebøen (University Hospital of Oslo ) are supervisors. The study is supported by&#xD;
      research, Vestfold Hospital Trust and 3M Company Norway (study material ) and it is applied&#xD;
      Regional Ethics Committee. Patients will not get different treatment than standard treatment&#xD;
      in hospital and it causes no follow-up calls or hospital visits. All patients (if possible)&#xD;
      give written consent for participation.&#xD;
