      This study is a prospective study in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of doing endomicroscopic imaging during interventional radiology procedure in two main&#xD;
      indications: lung and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative study will involve the use of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. The&#xD;
      proposed study is a feasibility study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interventional radiology is a medical sub-specialty of radiology which utilizes&#xD;
      minimally-invasive image-guided procedures to diagnose and treat diseases in nearly every&#xD;
      organ. The concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose and treat patients using&#xD;
      less invasive techniques currently available in order to minimize risk to the patient and&#xD;
      improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, surgery was the only treatment available for many conditions. Today,&#xD;
      interventional radiology treatments are frst-line care for a wide variety of conditions.&#xD;
      Patients should be offered the least invasive option frst. It is important to get a second&#xD;
      opinion and know all of your treatment options before consenting to any procedure or surgery.&#xD;
      Interventional radiologists are specialists in minimally invasive treatments, have a unique&#xD;
      breadth of training and provide consults to every type of specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical removal of liver tumors offers the best chance for a cure. Unfortunately, liver&#xD;
      tumors are often inoperable because the tumor may be too large, or has grown into major blood&#xD;
      vessels or other vital structures. Sometimes, many small tumors are spread throughout the&#xD;
      liver, making surgery too risky or impractical. Surgical removal is not possible for more&#xD;
      than two-thirds of primary liver cancer patients and 90 percent of patients with secondary&#xD;
      liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the technical feasibility and safety of doing&#xD;
      endomicroscopic imaging during interventional radiology procedure in two main indications:&#xD;
      lung and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cellvizio insertion during the interventional procedure leads to change in known adverse&#xD;
           events / serious adverse events rate during and one month after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is technically feasible to obtain images from Cellvizio during an interventional&#xD;
           radiology procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cellvizio is a helpful assistance to increase the efficacy of biopsy which require to&#xD;
           evaluate its accuracy eg. the predictive value of Cellvizio compared to pathology&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benefit of spatial accuracy for the yield of the biopsy procedure and potential&#xD;
           subsequent intervention, e.g. radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding lung biopsies and lung ablation, potential increase of a database to refine&#xD;
           image interpretation criteria with pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In liver application, the goal is to build a database of images and define image&#xD;
           interpretation criteria with pathologists to start image interpretation work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The predictive value of biopsies with Cellvizio assistance for lung or liver tumor&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both applications, technical feedback from the physicians is expected on how they think&#xD;
      the combined use of the devices could change the care path. E.g. a certain step in the&#xD;
      workflow might become obsolete or the workflow could lead to fewer patient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the safety of this protocol, the use of endomicroscopy will not change in any way the&#xD;
      patient management and standard procedure, including the diagnosis nor treatment decisions.&#xD;
      All the adverse events / serious adverse events will be noted during the procedure and one&#xD;
      week after the procedure.&#xD;
