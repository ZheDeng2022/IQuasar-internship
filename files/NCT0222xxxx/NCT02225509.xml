      1. Principal objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this study is to validate the diagnostic performance of a Dx15&#xD;
           molecular test based on molecular transcriptomic signatures previously identified in&#xD;
           distincts cohorts of samples to determine the malignant or benign profile of a thyroid&#xD;
           nodule with indeterminate cytological analysis. The target population includes&#xD;
           categories III [Follicular lesion of undetermined significance or Atypia of undetermined&#xD;
           significance (FLUS/AUS)] and IV [Follicular neoplasm / Suspicious for follicular&#xD;
           neoplasm (FN/SFN)] of the Bethesda classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The expected target performance of the Dx15 molecular test in this target population is&#xD;
           95% for specificity with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 87%, and 75%&#xD;
           for sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the performance of the Dx15 test in samples collected during the study by&#xD;
                fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in each and in all of the indeterminate Bethesda&#xD;
                classification categories (categories III, IV and V: suspected malignancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the performance of the TI-RADS ultrasonography score for diagnosing&#xD;
                thyroid cancer in patients presenting with a thyroid nodule and having available&#xD;
                cytological analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To check the potential of performance of the molecular signature as well as of its&#xD;
                combination with other tests by applying it in a blind manner to samples collected&#xD;
                from patients presenting with thyroid nodules and whose aspiration biopsy result is&#xD;
                benign (Bethesda category II), malignant (Bethesda category VI) or non-diagnostic&#xD;
                (Bethesda category I)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the performance of mutation tests (isolated mutations, chromosomal&#xD;
                rearrangements) for diagnosing thyroid cancer in patients presenting with a thyroid&#xD;
                nodule and with available cytological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To estimate the performance of the combination of the Dx15 test result and other&#xD;
                diagnostic tools such as mutation tests and/or the TI-RADS score to diagnose&#xD;
                thyroid cancer in patients presenting with a thyroid nodule and having an&#xD;
                indeterminate cytology result (especially AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN). The combination of&#xD;
                Dx15 diagnostic test results with other study parameters will also be considered in&#xD;
                order to establish the option of an algorithmic approach for the diagnosis of&#xD;
                thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the results of cytological and histological analyses obtained in the&#xD;
                centres and by centralised reading and assessment of the impact of its results on&#xD;
                the other study analyses and parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional analyses deemed relevant on the basis of various parameters and data&#xD;
                collected during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective of exploratory research:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of all or part of the FNA samples for the purpose of research as part of&#xD;
                thyroid cancers, especially with the objective of optimising or identifying&#xD;
                additional molecular signatures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended for patients for whom a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid&#xD;
      nodule/nodules is medically indicated for the detection of thyroid cancer. Fine-needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsy should preferably be carried out under ultrasound guidance as part of the&#xD;
      patient's standard management plan. In order to limit screening bias, the investigators&#xD;
      should, wherever possible, ask all patients seen consecutively to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible, screened patients will have been informed and will have signed a consent form prior&#xD;
      to study-related activities which include notably the use and storage of some cells collected&#xD;
      by fine-needle aspiration biopsy which have not been used for diagnostic purposes. The&#xD;
      fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples will be collected either from the remaining material of&#xD;
      FNA or there will be dedicated FNA sample in order to ensure an adequate quantity of material&#xD;
      for molecular analysis, if necessary. The patients will also be invited to take part in the&#xD;
      mutation study in a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples of enrolled patients will be sent to the Diaxonhit Genomics Laboratory and&#xD;
      analysed using Diaxonhit technology after checking the quantity and quality of the samples.&#xD;
      Enrolled patients whose samples are inadequate in terms of quantity or quality for the&#xD;
      various molecular tests will not be considered for the study. If necessary, mutation analyses&#xD;
      can be carried out anonymously by an independent French laboratory and under the supervision&#xD;
      of Diaxonhit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the results of cytological and histological analyses or the monitoring&#xD;
      program carried out by the centre will be recorded on electronic case report forms (e-CRF)&#xD;
      generating an anonymous data base hosted by Clinfile - a data management company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be followed up until the malignant or benign status of their&#xD;
      nodule(s) is known following fine needle aspiration biopsy, histological analysis of the&#xD;
      surgical specimen or, failing that, clinical monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone surgery will be followed up until the histological results are&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of patients who have not undergone surgery, follow-up will be carried out over a&#xD;
      minimal period of 1 year (12 months), as from the patient's enrolment. Patients who have not&#xD;
      undergone surgery will be clinically followed up for a maximum of 12 months after enrolment&#xD;
      of the last study patient in order to benefit from the extended follow-up of patients who&#xD;
      enter the study at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the cytological and histological analyses will be confirmed by the centralised&#xD;
      re-reading of the slides for statistical analysis, under blind status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with validating the identified signature and in an attempt to improve&#xD;
      diagnostic testing for thyroid cancers, the Diaxonhit company reserves the right to carry out&#xD;
      additional exploratory analyses of all or part of the samples collected in order to identify&#xD;
      new molecular signatures. These potentially new signatures will be validated in other&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint criterion will be the proportion of correct classifications for defining&#xD;
      the malignant or benign nature of a fine-needle aspiration biopsy carried out in patients&#xD;
      presenting with thyroid nodules and an indeterminate cytology for Bethesda categories III and&#xD;
      IV. The results obtained with the signature will be compared to the histology results of the&#xD;
      surgical specimen or, failing that, to the results of the monitoring program implemented by&#xD;
      the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the performance of previously identified transcriptome signatures will also be&#xD;
      carried out on every other category, which may or may not be indeterminate according to the&#xD;
      Bethesda classification. This information will be considered as the secondary endpoint&#xD;
      criterion. Other secondary endpoint criteria will include the proportion of correct&#xD;
      classifications obtained when the signature is linked to other predictive tests such as&#xD;
      mutation tests or the TIRADS score in order to define the malignant or benign nature of a&#xD;
      fine-needle aspiration biopsy carried out in patients presenting with thyroid nodules and&#xD;
      having an indeterminate cytology. The results obtained with the combination of tests will be&#xD;
      compared to the histological analysis of the surgical samples or otherwise to the results of&#xD;
      the monitoring program implemented by the clinician. The results of other study parameters,&#xD;
      essentially clinical, laboratory or demographic, will also be combined in an attempt to&#xD;
      define a potential algorithmic approach for diagnosing thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the Dx15 molecular test will be determined in the target population using&#xD;
      Bethesda category III and IV samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment of 1000 patients is scheduled in order to achieve the necessary recruitment&#xD;
      levels for categories III and IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the study, the Dx15 test may also be applied to a sample of cohorts in&#xD;
      other Bethesda categories (I: non-diagnostic, II: benign, V: SMC, and VI: malignant) in order&#xD;
      to identify test performance in these other categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, for the fine-needle aspiration samples tested with Dx15 and used to&#xD;
      determine performance, the presence of a related histopathological result of the surgical&#xD;
      specimen will be given priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample eligible for assessment is one that meets the Diaxonhit quality and quantity&#xD;
      criteria in order to enable the scheduled molecular analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be performed in centers specialized in the diagnosis and follow-up of&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.&#xD;
