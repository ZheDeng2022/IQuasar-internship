    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the appropriate dose of LL37 that can be&#xD;
      given to patients with melanoma. Researchers also want to learn if LL37 can stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system to help control the disease.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of LL37 based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of LL37 will be tested.&#xD;
      Up to 2 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of LL37 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week for 8 weeks, LL37 will be injected into 2-4 tumors. The injections will&#xD;
      be done in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 week before your first study drug injection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a punch biopsy of a tumor. To collect a punch biopsy, the area of skin is&#xD;
           numbed with anesthetic and a small cut is made to remove all or part of the affected&#xD;
           tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumors will be measured and photographed. Your private areas will be covered (as&#xD;
           much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be taken unless there are tumors&#xD;
           on your face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2, you will have a punch biopsy of one of the injected tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Weeks 1, 3, and 5 and 7, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to study your&#xD;
           immune response to LL37.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4, you will have a punch biopsy of one of the injected tumors and one of the tumors&#xD;
      that you did not have an injection in. Photos of the tumors will be taken to show if the&#xD;
      disease has responded to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the LL37 injected sites will be taken to show if the disease has responded to&#xD;
           the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive up to 8 weeks of study treatment. You will be taken off study if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have to stop the study treatment earlier than planned because the disease got worse or&#xD;
      you had intolerable side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumors will be photographed and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to study your immune&#xD;
           response to LL37.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a punch biopsy of one of the injected tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These off-study procedures will be completed within 14 days after your last dose of study&#xD;
      treatment. You will be contacted by phone or clinic visit at 30 days (+/- 7 days) after your&#xD;
      last dose to follow up on any drug-related toxicities which were present at the end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks after your last study drug dose and every 8-12 weeks after that, you will have&#xD;
      scans to check the status of the disease. Your doctor will decide what type of scans you will&#xD;
      have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your last study drug dose, at your routine clinic visits every 3 months for 1 year, the&#xD;
      study staff will ask you about the status of disease, if possible. If you do not plan to&#xD;
      continue to receive medical care at MD Anderson, the study staff will contact you by phone,&#xD;
      email, or letter to ask about the status of disease. The calls should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. LL37 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study&#xD;
      drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 participants will be treated in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
