      Hypersalivation (sialorrhea or ptyalism) is known as a frequent, disturbing, uncomfortable&#xD;
      adverse effect of clozapine therapy that can lead to noncompliance. Until now there is no&#xD;
      effective enough treatment for this side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated that different medications from the substitute benzamide&#xD;
      derivatives group: amisulpride, sulpiride (higher selective binding to the D2/D3 dopamine&#xD;
      receptor) and moclobemide (reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, which inhibits the&#xD;
      deamination of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine) may be effective as a treatment of&#xD;
      clozapine-induced hypersalivation (CIH). Moreover, there is another substitute benzamide&#xD;
      derivative: metoclopramide (dopamine D2 antagonist, usually used as antiemetic medication in&#xD;
      general medicine). The investigators hypothesis assumes that anti-salivation effect&#xD;
      characterizes the whole group of benzamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of metoclopramide as an optional&#xD;
      possibility for management of CIH.&#xD;

      Hypersalivation (sialorrhea or ptyalism) is known as a frequent, disturbing, uncomfortable&#xD;
      adverse effect of clozapine therapy that may persist for several years. This side effect is&#xD;
      usually dose-related. It may occur all over the day, but it is most pronounced during night&#xD;
      sleep, since swallowing reflex is diminished, and patients usually complain of wakening with&#xD;
      a wet pillow (sometimes called as &quot;wet pillow&quot; sign).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivation is regulated by sympathetic (adrenergic) and parasympathetic (cholinergic) tones.&#xD;
      The phenomenon of clozapine-induced hypersalivation (CIH) remains mysterious since the drug&#xD;
      has potent α2 antagonistic, M4 - muscarinic agonistic, and anticholinergic (M1, M2, M3, and&#xD;
      M5) activities and each of these has a different effect on the control of salivation. While&#xD;
      α2 antagonistic and M4 - muscarinic agonistic effects increase salivation, the&#xD;
      anticholinergic effect leads to diminished saliva secretion. It has been reported that CIH is&#xD;
      observed from 10 to 80% of patients according to various sources, an average rate is 30% of&#xD;
      clozapine-treated patients. Further to the social embarrassment related to hypersalivation,&#xD;
      additional consequences of CIH include painful parotid gland swelling and parotid duct&#xD;
      obstruction due to the formation of calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is a second generation neuroleptic agent whose structure consists of a&#xD;
      dibenzodiazepine derivative with a piperazinyl side chain. It has a unique neuropharmacologic&#xD;
      profile, which is attributed to atypical antipsychotic agents with proven efficacy in&#xD;
      refractory schizophrenia, but its widespread use is limited by adverse effects such as&#xD;
      agranulocytosis, seizures, sedation, weight gain, and sialorrhea. Clozapine has a weak&#xD;
      binding affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors by its slightly greater preference for D1&#xD;
      receptors, as noted with a D1:D2 receptor binding ratio of 1:3. Furthermore the drug has&#xD;
      potent binding affinity for serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT2, and also antihistaminic,&#xD;
      anticholinergic, and alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sialorrhea is troublesome its stigmatizing nature results for a schizophrenia patient led to&#xD;
      massive compliance problems. For management of this distressing side effect have been&#xD;
      recommended different pharmacological agents such as α2 - adrenoreceptor agonists, including&#xD;
      clonidine, and lofexidine, but these treatments have unwanted side effects, no proved&#xD;
      effectiveness. They are not been routinely used. These publications show that CIH probably&#xD;
      might have a different neurobiological basis rather than the proposed mediation by the M4 -&#xD;
      muscarinic receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies found that substitute benzamide derivatives with higher selective binding to&#xD;
      the D2/D3 dopamine receptors - amisulpride, sulpiride as well moclobemide (reversible&#xD;
      inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, which inhibits the deamination of serotonin, norepinephrine&#xD;
      and dopamine) may be effective in treatment of CIH without additional adverse effects.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these medications are not effective in all patients who suffered from CIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metoclopramide was first described by Dr. Louis Justin-Besançon and C. Laville in 1964. It is&#xD;
      a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, and a mixed 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Moreover, it is a&#xD;
      5-HT4 receptor agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metoclopramide is fairly often used in general medicine as an antiemetic agent. In 1979, FDA&#xD;
      approved it for treatment of nausea and vomiting. This drug also belongs to substitute&#xD;
      benzamide derivatives group. It is assumed that the anti-emetic activity is caused by its D2&#xD;
      receptor antagonism in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the central nervous system. Dry&#xD;
      mouth is one of its side effects. The investigators hypothesized that antisalivation effect&#xD;
      characterizes the whole group of benzamides, and will be demonstrated also in none&#xD;
      psychotropic agent like metoclopramide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to examine efficacy of metoclopramide as an additional agent for&#xD;
      management of CIH and to approve our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods The study was conducted from January 2012 to May 2014 in two large state&#xD;
      referral institutions: Tirat Carmel Mental Health Center and the Be'er-Sheva Mental Health&#xD;
      Center. The investigators screened 68 patients (males and females, 19-60 years old) suffering&#xD;
      from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, treated with clozapine, and suffering from&#xD;
      hypersalivation. Of all screened subjects, 7 patients refused to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: a) males and females in age 18-60 years old; b) met Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; c) Clozapine treatment for a minimum of 2 months;&#xD;
      d) Constant dose of clozapine and other concomitant medications during previous 2 weeks; e)&#xD;
      At least 2 points on the Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale (NHRS);3 f) Ability and&#xD;
      willingness to sign informed consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study exclusion criteria included: a) the Presence of concurrent medical conditions&#xD;
      contributing to hypersalivation (eg, idiopathic Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy); b)&#xD;
      Evidence of mental retardation; c) Alcohol or drug abuse. Patients who had been treated with&#xD;
      anticholinergic agents and continued to experience CIH were allowed to participate in the&#xD;
      study, provided they continued to suffer from CIH of at least moderate severity. Complete&#xD;
      medical and neurological examinations, including laboratory tests, were performed. Prior to&#xD;
      study entry, all subjects who met the inclusion criteria provided written informed consent&#xD;
      after receiving a full explanation regarding the nature of the study and potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits. The study was approved by both the Tirat Carmel Mental Health Center and the Be'er&#xD;
      Sheva Mental Health Center Institutional Review Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study was conducted in two mental health centers. In order to examine our&#xD;
      hypothesis, the investigators used an add-on design. Sixty-one patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      and schizoaffective disorder (males and females, 19-60 years old), according to the DSM-IV&#xD;
      criteria, treated with clozapine and suffering from hypersalivation, enrolled into the study&#xD;
      (30 patients in metoclopramide group and 31 in the placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and drug administration In order to find a minimal effective dose, all subjects&#xD;
      suffering from CIH (score &gt;2 on Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale - NHRS) in a double&#xD;
      blind randomized mode were treated during a week with 10 mg/day of metoclopramide or placebo.&#xD;
      The patients without improvement continuing the study with 20 mg/day of metoclopramide or&#xD;
      placebo during the next week. Those patients, who did not respond to this dose, were&#xD;
      continued with 30 mg/day of metoclopramide or placebo for another week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypersalivation will be assessed by subjective and objective tools. Clinical global&#xD;
      impression (CGI) patient's self-assessment will be taken as a subjective tool while NHRS and&#xD;
      Drooling Severity Scale (DSS) as an objective one. NHRS consists of the 5-points: 0-absent;&#xD;
      1-minimal (signs of saliva on the pillow in the morning); 2-mild (hypersalivation wakes the&#xD;
      patient once during the night); 3-moderate (hypersalivation wakes the patient twice during&#xD;
      the night), and 4-severe (hypersalivation wakes the patient at least 3 times during the&#xD;
      night). DSS also consists of the 5-points: 1- never drools, 2 -mild, only wet lips,&#xD;
      3-moderate, wet on lips and chin, 4-severe, clothing becomes wet and 5 - profuse, clothing,&#xD;
      hands, tray, and objects become wet. Assessment was performed on baseline (entering into the&#xD;
      study) and every morning during the study period and two weeks after ceasing the add-on&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically significant improvement was defined as a reduction of at least 30% from baseline&#xD;
      to week 2 on the NHRS and DSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Thirty patients from Be'er Sheva Mental Health Center and 31 from Tirat Carmel&#xD;
      Mental Health Center have participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Review Board (&quot;Helsinki Committee&quot;).&#xD;
      Only subjects who will and able to sign a written informed consent form for participation in&#xD;
      the study, were recruited. Confidentially was ensured by means of a number coding system, and&#xD;
      all completed research forms were stored in a secure area.&#xD;
