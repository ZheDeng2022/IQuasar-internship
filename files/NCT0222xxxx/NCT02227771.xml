  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that enhanced vascular healing with the Synergy&#xD;
      stent should minimize the risk of late aneurysm formation and potential clinical&#xD;
      complications but not at the cost of enhanced efficacy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Successful delivery of the Emerge Coronary Dilatation catherter across the lesion and Successful inflation and removal of the Emerge Coronary Dilatation catherter with absences of clinically significant vessel perforation or flow limiting vessel dissection, reduction in thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow from baseline, clinically significant arrythmias requiring medical treatment or device intervention following dilatation with Emerge balloon and Achievment of final TIMLI 3 flow for the target lesion at the conclusion of the index procedure. The primary balloon endpoint will be evaluated in patients where an attempt to use an Emerge Coronary Dilatation catherter is made.</description>
