  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the brain functioning of OCD patients and healthy&#xD;
      controls before and after treatment with Exposure and Response Prevention (EXRP) therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to coordinate thoughts and actions to execute goal-directed behaviors (cognitive&#xD;
      control) and the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and learn from reward (reward&#xD;
      processing) are key processes for human behavior. Dysfunction in these processes has been&#xD;
      hypothesized to contribute to repetitive thoughts and behaviors in many disorders, including&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and eating disorders. We will&#xD;
      use multimodal imaging to investigate neural circuits that support cognitive control and&#xD;
      reward processing, using OCD as a model system. The short-term goal is to clarify how&#xD;
      circuit-based abnormalities contribute to repetitive thoughts/behaviors; these data will&#xD;
      inform future transdiagnostic studies. The long-term goal is to identify control and reward&#xD;
      circuit-abnormalities as targets for new transdiagnostic treatments.&#xD;
