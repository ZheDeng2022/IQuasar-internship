  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, diabetic macular edema is treated is through injection of a medications such as&#xD;
      off-label bevacizumab, which decreases the swelling in the retina. These injections are&#xD;
      sometimes required monthly until the condition is controlled. Recently, there have been some&#xD;
      new FDA approved treatments using laser that decrease the swelling. These approximately ten&#xD;
      minute treatments do not require injections and don't cause permanent damage to the eye, and&#xD;
      they may decrease the number of injections one needs to get to treat diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      (DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether subvisible laser in&#xD;
      combination with intravitreal bevacizumab is non-inferior compared to current standard of&#xD;
      care (intravitreal bevacizumab alone) in achieving favorable outcomes for visual acuity, mean&#xD;
      macular thickness, and patient quality of life, and has fewer needed intravitreal bevacizumab&#xD;
      injections throughout the course of the 12 month study period.&#xD;

      The patient is randomized into one of two study groups described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly&#xD;
           visits and subvisible laser treatment will be administered at the first visit. The the&#xD;
           patient will undergo monthly visits, as he/she would with standard of care treatment,&#xD;
           allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB and laser treatment every 3 months if defined&#xD;
           retreatment criteria are met, as determined by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly&#xD;
           visits. The patient will then undergo monthly exams, as he or she would with standard of&#xD;
           care treatment, allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB if defined retreatment&#xD;
           criteria are met, as determined by a physician. The patient may also undergo sham laser&#xD;
           treatment (he/she will be placed in front of laser but no laser will be activated) so&#xD;
           that the patient isn't made aware of which treatment group he/she is a part of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data that will be collected throughout the study at monthly examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly Snellen Visual acuity test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging using standard&#xD;
           clinic protocol monthly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard clinic diabetic montage Fundus photos at months 0,6,12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography at months 0, 6, 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' visit schedules will be the same as for routine standard of care for the IVB&#xD;
      injection procedure. There are no additional appointments for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be done at San Francisco General Hospital&#xD;
