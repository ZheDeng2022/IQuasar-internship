  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trochanteric bursitis is a common condition, effecting 20% of the population. \Most with&#xD;
      trochanteric bursitis experience chronic intermittent or continuous hip pain at and around&#xD;
      the greater trochanter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of trochanteric bursitis is believed to be a result of inflammation of the bursa,&#xD;
      though this has not been confirmed. Accordingly, the use of corticosteroid injections has&#xD;
      been shown to provide considerable relief. However, routine &quot;blind&quot; injections, those&#xD;
      performed without the aid of imaging, such as fluoroscopy, have shown limited success in the&#xD;
      appropriate needle placement. Fortunately, blind injections have yielded positive results in&#xD;
      majority of the cases. Additionally, the use of fluoroscopy has not shown to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcome for trochanter bursa injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of fluoroscopy has not shown positive benefit, other modes of imaging, such&#xD;
      as ultrasound have not been studied and may be more useful. Fluoroscopy allows for&#xD;
      bony-landmark based injections. Ultrasound allows for direct visualization of the soft tissue&#xD;
      structures such as the bursa and has gained significant support for use in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injections. This prospective blinded study's aim is to evaluate, if any, the benefit of an&#xD;
      ultrasound guided injection and whether ultrasound should be routinely used during trochanter&#xD;
      bursa injections.&#xD;

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study is considered to be completed, because before leaving the institution the PI indicated the study status as completed and entered that actual enrollment number of 80 participants. No other information could be located or obtained for the study and therefore no specific results information can be included. The study status as completed and actual enrollment number of 80 participants should be considered an accurate representation of all available study information.</limitations_and_caveats>
