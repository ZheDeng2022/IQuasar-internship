  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nintedanib when given together&#xD;
      with cisplatin and docetaxel and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer who are undergoing surgery.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cisplatin, docetaxel, and nintedanib before&#xD;
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine safety of nintedanib incorporated to chemotherapy in the induction setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the major pathologic response rate in patients treated with induction&#xD;
      nintedanib and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Response rates to induction treatment (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      [RECIST] version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Response rates to priming therapy with nintedanib single agent (by computed tomography&#xD;
      [CT] assessment using RECIST version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Recurrence-free survival. IV. Overall survival. V. Correlations between major pathologic&#xD;
      response with recurrence-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Toxicity (assessed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Peri-operative morbidity and mortality. VIII. Complete resection (R0) rate. IX.&#xD;
      Correlations of response assessed by imaging studies with outcomes (both pathologic response&#xD;
      to treatment and long-term recurrence-free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Correlations of blood- and tissue-based biomarkers with efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nintedanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RUN-IN PHASE: Patients receive induction therapy comprising cisplatin intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      2 hours on day 1, docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, and nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) from day 2 of course 1 to day 7 of course 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to&#xD;
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION PHASE: Patients receive single-agent nintedanib PO BID on days 1-28. Patients then&#xD;
      receive 3 courses of induction chemotherapy and undergo surgery as above. Treatment continues&#xD;
      even if patients experience disease progression, unless treatment is judged to be not in the&#xD;
      best interest of the patient by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 weeks and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;
