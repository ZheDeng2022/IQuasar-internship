    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of drugs considered standard treatment for&#xD;
      children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in combination with a new&#xD;
      drug called MLN 9708. Additionally, the study is also evaluating if bone marrow or stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, which will be given to some participants, helps to prevent ALL from&#xD;
      returning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the optimal dose of the drug MLN 9708&#xD;
      when given with a standard multi-drug regimen. In the first part of the study, up to 18&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at different doses of MLN 9708. Once the maximally tolerated&#xD;
      (highest, safest dose) is established, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, bone marrow (tissue found in the inside of bones) or stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      will be given to some participants to study whether it helps to prevent ALL from returning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment consists of several different stages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant (if you are eligible based on your medical&#xD;
           condition and the availability of a matched stem cell donor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or If you do not have a transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CNS Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consolidation 2&#xD;
