  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, with its associated co-morbidities, is a major public health challenge. It is&#xD;
      estimated that by 2050, 60% of men and 50% of women will be clinically obese. Obesity is&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain&#xD;
      cancers. The increasing epidemic of obesity has necessitated the study of the complex&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying energy homeostasis. Food intake, energy balance and body weight are&#xD;
      tightly regulated by the hypothalamus, brainstem and reward circuits, on the basis both of&#xD;
      cognitive inputs and of diverse humoral and neuronal signals of nutritional status. Several&#xD;
      gut hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY3-36 (PYY), have been&#xD;
      shown to play an important role in regulating short-term food intake. Peripheral&#xD;
      administration of PYY or GLP-1 enhances satiety and reduces food intake in animals and man.&#xD;
      PYY, GLP-1 along with a host of other hormones are produced by the gut in response to&#xD;
      nutrient availability in different regions of the gut and provide an exquisite mechanism of&#xD;
      nutrient sensing in response to dietary intake. These hormones therefore represent potential&#xD;
      targets in the development of novel anti-obesity treatments. A novel and attractive strategy&#xD;
      to induce appetite regulation is the enrichment of foods with components that stimulate the&#xD;
      release of GLP-1 and PYY. The short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by microbial&#xD;
      fermentation of dietary fibre in the colon have been shown to stimulate the release of PYY&#xD;
      and GLP-1 from rodent enteroendocrine L cells, via stimulation of the G-protein coupled free&#xD;
      fatty acid receptors (FFAR) on colonic L cells. Of the SCFAs produced by colonic fermentation&#xD;
      of dietary fibre, propionate has the highest affinity for FFAR 2. Furthermore, propionate is&#xD;
      an end product of bacterial metabolism, and thus, unlike acetate, does not undergo conversion&#xD;
      to other SCFAs. Increasing colonic propionate is therefore an attractive target for appetite&#xD;
      modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a novel delivery system for delivering propionate to the right site in the&#xD;
      colon and we now wish to optimise the delivery of propionate to the colon in man using stable&#xD;
      isotope labelling methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of SCFA in appetite regulation: SCFA have been shown to stimulate PYY and GLP-1&#xD;
      production in animal models and dietary fibre, of which SCFA are the major end products,&#xD;
      induce appetite regulation in humans. However the evidence underpinning which dietary fibres&#xD;
      induce appetite regulation in humans is very weak because of the difficulty in controlling&#xD;
      studies with very high fibre intake. In a recent project funded under the BBSRC DRINC&#xD;
      initiative (BB/H004815/1), we have the first direct evidence that SCFA can directly regulate&#xD;
      appetite in humans. Prior to this study, in order to achieve production of SCFA to a level,&#xD;
      which is high enough to induce appetite-regulating effects, very large amounts of dietary&#xD;
      fibre (&gt;25 g/d and up to 40 g/d) are required, and compliance with high fibre diets is poor&#xD;
      due to gastrointestinal side effects. Furthermore, supplementing diets with mixed high fibre&#xD;
      does not predictably or reliably increase colonic SCFA production or circulating levels of&#xD;
      SCFA in all human populations because of the variability in gut microbial activity. Finally,&#xD;
      orally administered SCFAs are not palatable and are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine&#xD;
      where L cells are sparse. In our studies to date we have focussed on the SCFA propionate&#xD;
      because it has the highest affinity for the receptors and is an end product of metabolism in&#xD;
      the microbiota and therefore seems the obvious target to manipulate to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of SCFA on appetite regulation. To overcome the unpalatably high levels of&#xD;
      fermentable dietary fibre needed to significantly increase colonic propionate levels, and the&#xD;
      unpredictability in the production of the resulting SCFAs, we have developed and tested a&#xD;
      novel delivery system targeting the release of gram quantities of propionate in the proximal&#xD;
      colon. We estimate that our delivery system may lead to a 2-8 fold increase in colonic&#xD;
      propionate, a level very difficult to achieve through feeding a mixed fermentable fibre diet.&#xD;
      This level of propionate production might have been observed in ancestral diets and in parts&#xD;
      of rural Africa where dietary fibre intake is very high. We have also demonstrated that&#xD;
      delivery system increases plasma propionate levels, reduces food intake in acute studies of&#xD;
      appetite, and in a longer term study (24 weeks), positive effects on food intake, body&#xD;
      composition, glucose homeostasis, circulating lipids, cholesterol and liver function, liver&#xD;
      and visceral fat and weight management were observed. However, in these studies we&#xD;
      pragmatically chose an preparation that could be produced at scale. The amount of propionate&#xD;
      released can be varied which in itself may affect the rate and amount of propionate released.&#xD;
      For an ingredient, with the potential to be incorporated into a wide variety of foodstuffs,&#xD;
      we now wish to investigate the optimum delivery system preparation that delivers the maximal&#xD;
      propionate dose in the least amount of material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use non-invasive, stable isotope labelling methodologies to determine propionate&#xD;
      bioavailability from a range of delivery system preparations, in order to determine the&#xD;
      optimum preparation for delivering maximal propionate to the proximal colon.&#xD;
