      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consumption of thiamin fortified fish sauce&#xD;
      over 6 months increases the thiamin status of women to a level consistent with a low risk of&#xD;
      infantile beriberi. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of thiamin-fortified fish&#xD;
      sauce will increase red blood cell thiamin concentrations, an indicator of thiamin status, in&#xD;
      women consuming thiamin-fortified fish sauce, while concentrations will not change in women&#xD;
      consuming a placebo fish sauce that does not contain thiamin.&#xD;

      Purpose The purpose of this three-armed, double blind randomized control trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether thiamin-fortified fish sauce is an efficacious means of increasing dietary&#xD;
      thiamin intake in Cambodian women to a level that increases erythrocyte thiamin diphosphate&#xD;
      (TDP) concentrations to a level consistent with a low risk of infantile beriberi. Two groups&#xD;
      of women will participate in this study: women of childbearing age (18-45y; n=270), and&#xD;
      pregnant women (18-45y; ~26 weeks pregnant at baseline; n=90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Intervention with thiamin-fortified fish sauce will increase women's TDP&#xD;
      concentrations to levels consistent with a low risk of infantile beriberi compared to those&#xD;
      receiving the control fish sauce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Justification Beriberi is a micronutrient deficiency disease caused by a lack of&#xD;
      thiamin (vitamin B1) in the diet. Infantile beriberi is common in Southeast Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beriberi, a disease caused by severe thiamin deficiency, is rare in the west but is thought&#xD;
      to be more common in developing countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia. In infants,&#xD;
      beriberi presents with symptoms of heart failure and is fatal unless thiamin treatment is&#xD;
      initiated immediately. Beriberi typically presents in exclusively breastfed infants whose&#xD;
      mothers have suboptimal thiamin status and consequently have low breast milk thiamin&#xD;
      concentrations. Maternal thiamin deficiency in Cambodia is likely a result of multiple&#xD;
      factors: the high consumption of white, polished rice, which has been removed from its&#xD;
      B-vitamin-containing husk, a lack of parboiling rice, and low dietary diversity. Improving&#xD;
      the thiamin status of pregnant and lactating women is essential for combating infantile&#xD;
      beriberi. Fortification of a food staple has proven to be a successful strategy in increasing&#xD;
      population levels of thiamin because as a 'passive' intervention, it requires little to no&#xD;
      behavior change. Fish sauce is an ideal vehicle for thiamin fortification: it is consumed&#xD;
      daily in consistently high quantities, and is produced in centralized plants, and has been&#xD;
      successfully used in Cambodia and Vietnam as a vehicle for iron fortification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method All villages in Prey Veng province that are not already involved in an active&#xD;
      intervention (for example, homestead food production, micronutrient powder intervention etc)&#xD;
      will be randomized. A Khmer-speaking research assistant will contact the Village Chief and/or&#xD;
      Village Health Volunteer in the first village on the randomized list and determine the number&#xD;
      of eligible women of childbearing age and pregnant women (~26 weeks) in that village. The&#xD;
      research assistant will move down the randomized list of villages until 360 participants have&#xD;
      been enrolled. The investigators expect enrolment from approximately 10 villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained, Khmer-speaking enumerator will conduct an interview in the participants home. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will collect demographic data, as well as information on dietary intake&#xD;
      (including fish sauce), thoughts and perceptions of fortified products, and knowledge of&#xD;
      thiamin deficiency and beriberi. Once the questionnaire is complete the participant will walk&#xD;
      with the interviewer to a central meeting spot within the village (typically the Village&#xD;
      Chief's home) to complete anthropometric measurements (height and weight). The next morning&#xD;
      the participant will travel to the local health centre for a non-fasted blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant completes the baseline questionnaire, anthropometrics, and blood&#xD;
      collection she will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: low&#xD;
      concentration thiamin-iron-fortified fish sauce (2mg thiamin/mL fish sauce + iron), higher&#xD;
      concentration thiamin-fortified fish sauce (8mg thiamin/mL fish sauce + iron), or placebo:&#xD;
      iron-fortified fish sauce. The bottles and labels of the three fish sauces will be identical&#xD;
      in appearance, except for a code that differentiates the sauces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be visited biweekly for monitoring and evaluation of fish sauce&#xD;
      consumption. Fish sauce will be distributed during these visits to ensure that there are no&#xD;
      'stock outs' of fish sauce during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the first month of the study all participants will attend an educational workshop with&#xD;
      training regarding dietary thiamin intake, thiamin deficiency and beriberi, and infant and&#xD;
      young child feeding (IYCF) practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements (weight and length) will be taken within 72 hours of the birth of&#xD;
      the participant's infant (t~3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At t~4 months, a subset of households (n=28) will participate in an Observed Weighed Fish&#xD;
      Sauce Record wherein a trained enumerator measure all fish sauce consumed by the participant&#xD;
      throughout one day. Two repeat observed weighed fish sauce records will be completed within a&#xD;
      2 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At endline (t=6 months), the questionnaire, anthropometrics, and blood draw will be repeated&#xD;
      with all women. The investigators will also collect a venous blood sample (4mL) from the&#xD;
      infant, and a breast milk sample from mothers from the pregnant cohort. Investigators plan to&#xD;
      analyze all samples within two months of the endline sample collection, and will return to&#xD;
      the villages to share study findings with all participants at a community meeting (general&#xD;
      results shared), and then separately to share individual thiamin results one-on-one. All&#xD;
      participants will have already participated in an educational workshop highlighting the&#xD;
      importance of dietary thiamin intake, and the signs of thiamin deficiency and beriberi.&#xD;
      Individuals with suboptimal thiamin status will be encouraged to speak with their healthcare&#xD;
      provider, and will also be counselled using the materials that were previously used in the&#xD;
      educational workshop.&#xD;
