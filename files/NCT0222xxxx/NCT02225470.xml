    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an open-label randomized parallel two-arm multicenter efficacy,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety study of intravenously administered eribulin versus intravenously&#xD;
      administered vinorelbine in Chinese population. Eligible female subjects will have measurable&#xD;
      disease according to RECIST 1.1 with the modification that chest x-ray cannot be used for&#xD;
      assessment of disease.&#xD;

          1. Female subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the&#xD;
             breast:&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic disease who have received at least two,&#xD;
             and a maximum of five, prior chemotherapeutic regimens for breast cancer, at least two&#xD;
             of which were administered for treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;

                  treatment with any of these agents is not required if the agents are&#xD;
                  contraindicated for a prospective subject and documented in her medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Some of these regimens may have been administered as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant&#xD;
                  therapy, but at least two must have been given for locally recurrent or&#xD;
                  metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects must have proven refractory to the most recent chemotherapy as&#xD;
                  documented by progression on or within 6 months of their last chemotherapy.&#xD;

             group and without other known or suspected cause), or have been sterilized surgically&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation greater than or equal to 1 menstrual cycle prior to&#xD;
             randomization, or have undergone a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of highly&#xD;

             effective contraception for at least one menstrual cycle), during study treatment, and&#xD;
             for 3 months after the final dose of study treatment. Female subjects exempt from this&#xD;
             requirement are subjects who practice total abstinence. If currently abstinent, the&#xD;
             subject must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception, i.e. condom and&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable or implant. Female&#xD;
                  subjects who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of&#xD;
                  the same hormonal contraceptive product from the last menstrual period prior to&#xD;
                  randomization, and must continue to use the same hormonal contraceptive product&#xD;
