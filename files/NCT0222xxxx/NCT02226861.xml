      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Stem cell transplantation from a partially matched donor can lead to graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD). Researchers want to learn how to improve these transplantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if very low doses of Interleukin-2 after a partially matched transplantation prevent&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients: age 18 65, with certain bone marrow or lymphatic system diseases and an&#xD;
           available family member with partial tissue match.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors: age 18 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and many tests&#xD;
           including blood and tissue tying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood tests and tissue&#xD;
           typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will stay in the hospital 3 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have apheresis. Blood is drawn from one arm, run through a machine&#xD;
           that collects white blood cells, then returned into the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous (IV) line placed under the skin and into a neck vein, to stay throughout&#xD;
           transplant and recovery. They may also have a catheter inserted for collecting immune&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow sample taken by needle. They will have 3 more after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Filgrastim injected once daily for 5 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem and immune cells collected by another apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will get:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eight 30-minute doses of radiation, sitting at a machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor immune cells by IV, 6 days before the transplant day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy drugs by IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- Donor stem cells by IV on transplant day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After transplant, recipients will give self-injections of very low doses of&#xD;
           Interleukin-2 once daily for about 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before and after transplant, recipients will get medicine to suppress the immune system&#xD;
           and antibiotics to prevent infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients must stay near NIH for 3 6 months after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All recipients and donors will have 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;

      Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a curative option for many&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies, not all have a suitable donor. Haploidentical peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) has the advantage of immediate availability, higher stem&#xD;
      cell dose, and feasibility of repeated cell collections for generating lymphocyte infusions&#xD;
      to treat or prevent relapse or infection. However, haplo-SCT incurs a risk of bidirectional&#xD;
      rejection with either severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) or graft rejection by the&#xD;
      recipient. Therefore it is important to develop novel strategies to optimize the outcome of&#xD;
      haplo-SCT. Designing a haplo-SCT that incorporates the concepts of modulating the immune&#xD;
      system and allowing the opportunity for graft manipulation and/or adoptive immunotherapy may&#xD;
      improve the treatment outcome. To achieve this, we are first interested in studying the&#xD;
      immune modulatory effect of ultra-low dose Interleukin 2 (ULD IL-2) as GVHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator initiated pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of ULD&#xD;
      IL-2 as GVHD prophylaxis in haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients&#xD;
      with hematologic malignancies. Because GVHD has previously been associated with low numbers&#xD;
      of circulating CD4+ CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (T(regs)), research efforts in increasing&#xD;
      T(regs) either ex-vivo with adoptive transfer of T(regs) or in vivo using immunomodulatory&#xD;
      agents such as IL-2, have shown promise in reducing incidences of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the incidences of acute and chronic GVHD, engraftment, overall&#xD;
      survival, transplant related mortality, and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will adopt the 2 step haplo-SCT method developed by Grosso et. al1 to study our method of&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis. This 2 step approach, in which the lymphoid and myeloid portions of the&#xD;
      graft are given in two separate steps in order to control and optimize T-cell, has already&#xD;
      been published as a feasible and safe platform for haplo SCT for patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies and has been adopted by the Jefferson University Hospital (PA, USA), where they&#xD;
      continue to treat patients under this protocol. As an additional GVHD prophylaxis, we will&#xD;
      use sirolimus, an previously established GVHD prophylaxis which may work with ULD IL-2&#xD;
      synergistically to increase T(regs) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo one apheresis to collect&#xD;
      lymphocytes and CD34+ stem cell product after Miltenyi CD34+ selection. The products will be&#xD;
      cryopreserved until the time of transplantation. Recipients will receive a myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimen of fludarabine and total body irradiation (TBI) on days -10 to -6. After&#xD;
      the last fraction of TBI, a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) product (2 times 10(8) CD3+/kg)&#xD;
      will be given. Cyclophosphamide will be given on days -3 and -2, followed by CD 34+ selected&#xD;
      donor stem cell product infused on day 0. Sirolimus will be initiated on day -1 until day+60.&#xD;
      ULD-IL2 (100,000 IU/m2) will give subcutaneously daily for 12 weeks starting day +1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate 14 recipients (ages greater than or equal to 18 - less than or equal&#xD;
      to 75; planned accrual up to 20 recipient in event of replacement) with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies meeting indication for transplant but who do not have matched related or&#xD;
      unrelated donor available. Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for&#xD;
      toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate (TRSAE). Safety monitoring&#xD;
      will continue until at least 114 days after transplantation, and recipients experiencing&#xD;
      adverse events will be monitored until toxicity resolution or stabilization. Stopping rule is&#xD;
      defined as nonrelapse mortality and steroid refractory GVHD during the period of safety&#xD;
      monitoring for ULD IL-2. Recipients will be followed for up to 1 year to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidences of acute and chronic GVHD, engraftment, overall survival, transplant related&#xD;
      mortality, and relapse.&#xD;
