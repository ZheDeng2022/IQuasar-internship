  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of rapid next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS, such as whole genome sequencing1) with current practice to provide diagnostic or&#xD;
      prognostic information or treatment guidance in acutely ill neonates and infants,&#xD;
      particularly with respect to clinical care, cost and outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, prospective study examining the comparative effectiveness -&#xD;
      both clinical and cost effectiveness - of rapid NGS (StatSeq), compared to standard of care,&#xD;
      including an expanded newborn screen, in acutely ill neonates and infants with potential&#xD;
      genetic diseases. Acutely ill neonates and infants who have an undiagnosed illness, and their&#xD;
      families, will be eligible to participate in the study. The investigators will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 1,000 neonates and infants at a single study site. The study population will be&#xD;
      recruited from Children's Mercy Hospital inpatient population, primarily the intensive care&#xD;
      nursery (ICN, also known as the NICU), with a smaller subpopulation presenting to other&#xD;
      hospital services, such as the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). All affected study&#xD;
      participants will receive an expanded newborn screen (NBS). Newborn screening is biochemical&#xD;
      testing of a heel-prick blood spot that is federally mandated to be performed on all US live&#xD;
      births. 67 diseases are tested for by NBS in MO, most of which are genetic diseases. The&#xD;
      expanded NBS proposed herein is the clinically available StepOne Newborn ScreenÂ® from Perkin&#xD;
      Elmer, and will be performed in addition to standard State of MO screening on all enrolled&#xD;
      infants in both arms. Half of the affected study participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      StatSeq in addition to standard testing for their acute illness and expanded NBS.&#xD;
      Additionally, all willing clinical providers will be enrolled and their perceptions on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have blood drawn for nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) isolation and the expanded&#xD;
      NBS at the time of enrollment in the study. All blood sample volumes will adhere to the CMH&#xD;
      policy on maximum blood in pediatric patients. If the volume allowed for in this policy&#xD;
      exceeds 5ml, 5 ml will be the maximum collected at enrollment. Buccal smears, heel-prick&#xD;
      blood spots, additional blood, urine and tissue samples may be collected, if available as&#xD;
      sample retains from other studies, and stored in the Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine&#xD;
      (CPGM) per their approved IRB protocol (IRB Study #11120514). The latter samples will not&#xD;
      involve invasive sampling. Nucleic acids will be isolated and prepared for NGS with standard&#xD;
      protocols at the CPGM (Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine). Familial samples (for example,&#xD;
      mother, father, affected or unaffected siblings) will also be obtained, and nucleic acids&#xD;
      will also be sequenced per the Genome Center Biorepository protocol, as indicated, to assist&#xD;
      in diagnosis of the acute medical condition in the newborn. All sequencing data will be&#xD;
      stored in the Genome Center Biorepository (IRB Study #11120514).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of two expert Center data analysts will be responsible for analyzing the DNA&#xD;
      variants following NGS. One of the analysts will then compile a report to be presented to the&#xD;
      Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director or Assistant Director. In the case of positive study&#xD;
      findings that may be diagnostic, the Molecular Pathology Laboratory Director or Assistant&#xD;
      Director will perform confirmatory clinical diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, a standard&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic report will be placed in the patient's medical record. In the case of&#xD;
      acutely material (actionable) positive study findings, the results will be verbally conveyed&#xD;
      to the primary clinical team directly prior to confirmatory testing. A generic research note&#xD;
      will be placed in the patient's medical record that indicates that a verbal, provisional&#xD;
      report was issued (Appendix A). Verbal, provisional reporting of results before confirmatory&#xD;
      testing will only be performed in cases where the delay in reporting necessary for&#xD;
      confirmation was likely to result in significant harm to the patient. Confirmatory testing&#xD;
      will be performed promptly in all cases, including those in which in which a verbal report&#xD;
      has been given. A case conference format may be utilized for return of results if the&#xD;
      complexity of the diagnosis or potential treatment for that diagnosis warrants detailed&#xD;
      discussion. If no potentially pathogenic variants are identified, a verbal report will be&#xD;
      provided to the clinical care physician of record to communicate that there were no causative&#xD;
      findings, and a generic research note will be placed in the medical record that states that&#xD;
      nondiagnostic research grade NGS was performed (Appendix B). No negative diagnostic written&#xD;
      report of results will be placed in the patient's chart in this instance, as there is no&#xD;
      available clinical grade testing to confirm negative results for all genes tested. Follow up&#xD;
      with the patient's family will be guided by the clinical care team. All study participants&#xD;
      and their clinicians will be notified of randomization assignment at/by day 10 after&#xD;
      randomization. This information will help alleviate anxiety on the part of the family, and&#xD;
      also provides a mechanism for patient crossover into the rapid NGS arm if the patient is&#xD;
      clinically deteriorating, and at the clinical care team's request. Rarely, those participants&#xD;
      and clinicians will be notified sooner if they were randomized to the rapid NGS group and a&#xD;
      diagnosis is made in less than 10 days. Both molecular diagnoses made and time to diagnosis&#xD;
      will be recorded as primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All positive results from the Perkin Elmer StepOne expanded NBS (received by all enrolled&#xD;
      infants and NOT a study variable) will be returned to the Genome Center personnel. Based on&#xD;
      these results, confirmatory testing through Perkin Elmer will be performed if this condition&#xD;
      was not identified on the standard State NBS screen for each infant. These provisional&#xD;
      results will be verbally communicated with the primary clinician team and additional samples&#xD;
      requested, if necessary, for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the results will be entered in&#xD;
      the patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time a study participant is enrolled, the primary clinical providers will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a survey prior to StatSeq testing and after return of results. We will also review&#xD;
      the patient's medical record and collect clinical variables including laboratory testing,&#xD;
      radiology results, medications and other treatments received to further analyze the effect&#xD;
      rapid NGS has on clinical care. We plan to follow up with families annually up to 5 years&#xD;
      post enrollment and record clinical outcomes related to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be integrated with two other study protocols, one being the CMH Genomic&#xD;
      Medicine Repository (IRB 11120514) and the other Genomes in newborns (#13120442) that studies&#xD;
      the ethical and legal implications of rapid NGS in this population. Data records will be&#xD;
      requested from both studies. The participants must agree to enroll in the Genome Center&#xD;
      Biorepository. The Genomes in newborns study will be optional.&#xD;
