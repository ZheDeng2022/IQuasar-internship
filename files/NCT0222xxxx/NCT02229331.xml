  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilia is a rare X chromosome-linked coagulation disorder resulting from a congenital&#xD;
      deficiency or absence of circulating factor VIII (Haemophilia A) or factor IX (Haemophilia&#xD;
      B).As a consequence, patients with haemophilia are unable to generate adequate thrombin&#xD;
      resulting in abnormal bleeding. Approximately 80-90% of bleeding episodes occur in the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system, especially in the large synovial joints and muscles. Repeated&#xD;
      haemarthrosis induce joint cartilage damage and irreversible degenerative joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular intravenous administration of coagulation factor concentrates starting after the&#xD;
      first joint bleed and/or before the age of 2 ('primary' prophylaxis) is now the&#xD;
      evidence-based, first-choice treatment in children with severe haemophilia. This primary&#xD;
      prophylaxis has radically decreased the incidence of arthropathy in patients with&#xD;
      haemophilia. Despite the positive effect of primary prophylaxis on arthropathy at several&#xD;
      joints, the ankle joint seems to be an exception to the rule, as patients with haemophilia&#xD;
      treated with primary prophylaxis still experience ankle arthropathy. As such, the ankle now&#xD;
      is the main affected joint in patients with haemophilia under the age of 20. This makes the&#xD;
      scientific community facing a new challenge. Determining aetiologic/contributing factors&#xD;
      associated to the ankle arthropathy pathophysiological cascade in children with haemophilia&#xD;
      (CwH) is therefore a primary objective in the haemophilic research community nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading of the ankle is crucial as the ankle plantar flexors provide the main propulsive&#xD;
      power during gait, the tibiotalar joint caries a complex distribution of joint stresses as a&#xD;
      consequence of talar morphology and kinematics and, from a biomechanical and biochemical&#xD;
      viewpoint, differs significantly from other major lower limb joints. Previous biomechanical&#xD;
      studies focused on kinematic and strength measures, however, they omitted to incorporate&#xD;
      fundamental measures of joint loading (joint kinetics) and joint structural integrity (JSI,&#xD;
      assessment of soft tissue and osteochondral integrity through MRI). This makes it impossible&#xD;
      to draw firm conclusions on biomechanical contributing factors. Furthermore, few, low-quality&#xD;
      studies focused on conservative treatment strategies (e.g. strength training, mobilisation,&#xD;
      proprioceptive training) in patients with ankle arthropathy. In a minority of the cases,&#xD;
      important adverse effects (joint bleeding during strength and proprioception training) have&#xD;
      been reported. Because of the low quality of the intervention studies and the lack of&#xD;
      biomechanical studies focusing on joint loading and joint integrity, it is impossible to&#xD;
      pinpoint the aetiology of these side effects. One assumption might be that side effects&#xD;
      originate from inappropriate conservative approaches as a consequence of lacking knowledge on&#xD;
      joint loading and joint integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An innovative approach within the domain of ankle arthropathy in CwH is therefore to study&#xD;
      foot and lower limb kinetics during gait. The quantification of foot joints kinetics&#xD;
      encompasses considerable challenges and, until recently, only simplified single-segment foot&#xD;
      models have been used. Those models typically underestimate the mechanical contribution of&#xD;
      the different foot joints and, of equal importance, overestimate the kinetic contribution of&#xD;
      the tibiotalar joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, a valid 3D Multisegment Foot Kinetic Model&#xD;
      (3DMFKM) should be developed and introduced within the population of CwH. This is important&#xD;
      as it allows to quantify increased loading at the tibiotalar joint (or other joints) that may&#xD;
      help to explain this ankle arthropathy in these patients. This will have been missed by&#xD;
      previous research due to the consideration of the foot as one entire segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing a classification system based on these kinetic data would, in a second stage, be a&#xD;
      pertinent and valuable approach as this provides a rationale for designing randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this perspective, it is also recommended to assess the relationship with other&#xD;
      biomechanical and anatomical determinants, especially if one aims at developing optimal&#xD;
      management and rehabilitation strategies.&#xD;
