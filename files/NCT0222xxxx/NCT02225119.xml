      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Maculopathies are eye conditions that affect the center of the retina. Retina health&#xD;
      depends on the RPE, a layer behind the retina. A new test may measure the health of the&#xD;
      central retina and RPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use the focal electro-oculogram test to understand how the central retina and RPE are&#xD;
      affected in maculopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People at least 10 years old with a maculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical and eye history and an eye exam. Pictures&#xD;
           will be taken of the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their eyes may be dilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They may have a field test. They will look into a lens and press a button when they see&#xD;
           a light. First, they may sit in the dark for 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1-7 visits over 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their vision will be tested and eye pressure measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their pupils will be dilated with eye drops and researchers may take pictures of the&#xD;
           retina and the inside of the eye, and measure the thickness of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an electro-oculogram. They will look at a 2 LED lights and follow&#xD;
           them back and forth for 10 seconds once per minute. Participants will be in darkness for&#xD;
           15 minutes and in light for 20 minutes. One skin electrode will be placed on the nose&#xD;
           and one next to the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with maculopathy will also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Field test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram. Participants will get numbing eye drops and special contact lenses. A&#xD;
           small metal electrode will be taped to the forehead. Participants will watch flashing&#xD;
           lights and try not to blink. First, they may sit in the dark for 40 minutes.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the local response of the retinal pigment&#xD;
      epithelium (RPE) across the posterior pole of the eye by recording the focal electrooculogram&#xD;
      (EOG) in participants with macular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 healthy volunteers and 80 participants, age 10 or older, with macular disorders&#xD;
      affecting the retina/retinal pigment epithelium complex. Examples of such macular disorders&#xD;
      include Stargardt s disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center, observational, case-control study will be comprised of three related&#xD;
      aims. The first aim is focused on developing the focal EOG method which will require&#xD;
      parameter optimization. The second aim is focused on establishing the normal range and&#xD;
      variability of the focal EOG in normal volunteers. The third aim is to examine the focal EOG&#xD;
      in participants with macular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study is to develop a method for recording the focal EOG. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome will be to establish the normal range for the focal EOG and determine the&#xD;
      inter-session and intra-session variabilities of this test. Exploratory outcomes include: 1)&#xD;
      to examine the focal EOG in participants with macular diseases and 2) determine the&#xD;
      inter-session and intra-session variabilities of this test in participants with macular&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
