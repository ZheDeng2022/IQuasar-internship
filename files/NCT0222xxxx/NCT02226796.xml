    <textblock>
      We hypothesize patients who have difficulty with word recall (naming pictures) due to a&#xD;
      stroke will experience greater benefit in word recall after receiving a combination of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and traditional behavioral treatment. This&#xD;
      study will investigate the effects of the timing of tDCS in relationship to the behavioral&#xD;
      treatment to determine the most optimal protocol. Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      involves placing two electrodes on your scalp and sending a very small electrical current to&#xD;
      excite the brain cells of the target site.&#xD;

      Specific Aims Aim 1: Identify and quantify the effects of a-tDCS to the left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in conjunction with intensive behavioral treatment on naming in&#xD;
      non-fluent aphasia. a-tDCS (2mA for 20 minutes) will be applied over the left DLPFC with&#xD;
      cathode over the right orbit. Pre and post treatment behavioral measures of naming and&#xD;
      working memory will be used to quantify and compare differences. Hypothesis 1: a-tDCS will&#xD;
      result in improvements in naming accuracy, naming response times, and working memory (WM) in&#xD;
      participants with non-fluent aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare the effects of a-tDCS applied to the left DLPFC before behavioral treatment to&#xD;
      during behavioral treatment in non-fluent aphasia. a-tDCS (2mA for 20 minutes) will be&#xD;
      applied over the left DLPFC with cathode over the right orbit. Pre and post treatment&#xD;
      behavioral measures of naming and working memory will be used to quantify and compare&#xD;
      functional differences between conditions. Hypothesis 1: a-tDCS to the DLPFC during treatment&#xD;
      will result in a greater improvement of naming accuracy, naming response time and WM in&#xD;
      participants with non-fluent aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The findings from the proposed study will lay the foundation for a larger&#xD;
      clinical trial which will in turn have a significant impact on individuals with aphasia given&#xD;
      that naming deficits are a common symptom in this population. As the presence of naming&#xD;
      deficits has a negative relationship to emotional well-being and functional communication&#xD;
      26-30, treatment that improves naming deficits will positively influence quality of life in&#xD;
      many of these individuals. The approach taken to remediate naming deficits in aphasia is to&#xD;
      treat impaired WM systems on the premise that certain cognitive processes underlie linguistic&#xD;
      functions in aphasia. This approach represents a departure from most behavioral-based naming&#xD;
      treatment approach, but reflects a growing recognition that WM systems in individuals with&#xD;
      aphasia impact their linguistic performance 5, 31. The addition of a-tDCS as a&#xD;
      neuromodulation tool to increase cortical excitability (upregulate) the working memory center&#xD;
      to target naming is a novel approach. In addition, this study will further elucidate the&#xD;
      optimal timing of a-tDCS in order to achieve the most beneficial outcomes, which have not yet&#xD;
      been reported. These findings, along with other related studies, will shape future clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines as more studies adopt a concurrent cognitive-linguistic approach to treat&#xD;
      linguistic deficits in aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Methodology Participants. Four individuals with aphasia will be recruited. These&#xD;
      participants must meet the following inclusionary/exclusionary criteria: a) completion of&#xD;
      high school or GED; b) normal or corrected-to-normal vision; c) adequate hearing acuity for&#xD;
      1:1 conversational exchanges; d) use of English as primary language; e) a vascular lesion in&#xD;
      the dominant left hemisphere verified by an MRI scan within six months of the start of the&#xD;
      study. These participants must also meet the following exclusionary criteria: a) no previous&#xD;
      history of neurological- or psychiatric-based illnesses or disease, language or learning&#xD;
      disabilities, or alcohol/substance abuse; b) no history of seizures; c) no metal implants in&#xD;
      the head (except dental fillings); d) no lesion in the left DLPFC confirmed by MRI; e) no&#xD;
      current pregnancy. Pre-Test Behavioral Measures. Participants will be seen between 2-3&#xD;
      sessions to undergo comprehensive cognitive-linguistic testing prior to initiation of&#xD;
      treatment. Testing will take place at the University of Minnesota (UMN) Clinical&#xD;
      Translational Science Institute (CTSI). Behavioral test measures will include the WAB 32 in&#xD;
      order to obtain the WAB Aphasia Quotient (WAB AQ), Boston Naming Test (BNT) 33 and the&#xD;
      Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA-2) 34. The WAB AQ will provide a general classification of&#xD;
      aphasia subtype, scores from the BNT will provide the level of severity of naming impairment,&#xD;
      and ABA-2 performance will be used to assess severity of apraxia of speech (AoS). To assess&#xD;
      the integrity of the phonological store, participants will be tested for the effects of&#xD;
      phonological similarity using both auditory and visual presentation 35, 36. To assess the&#xD;
      integrity of subvocal rehearsal processes, participants will be tested for the effects of&#xD;
      word length on both auditory and visual span 37; the effects of articulatory suppression on&#xD;
      recall performance 37, 38; and rhyme judgments 39-41. Protocols that have been adapted for&#xD;
      individuals with aphasia will be followed42-45. These tests will be used to distinguish&#xD;
      behavioral evidence of deficient subvocal rehearsal processes from deficient phonological&#xD;
      short-term store. Individuals with a range of moderate to moderately severe nonfluent&#xD;
      aphasia, a range of moderate to moderately severe anomia, and a range of mild to no AoS will&#xD;
      be chosen for the study. Baseline probes will also be obtained prior to the initiation of the&#xD;
      study. Stability of baseline performance, defined as no more than 20% difference between&#xD;
      scores,will be obtained over three consecutive sessions in order to establish experimental&#xD;
      control. Post-Test Behavioral Measures. Participants will also be seen for post-treatment&#xD;
      testing following the implementation of the treatment protocol. Testing will take place in&#xD;
      the participant's home. Post-treatment behavioral measures will include BNT, the ABA-2, WM&#xD;
      tasks, and naming treatment and control items. It is anticipated that only one session will&#xD;
      be needed for post-treatment testing. An adverse events survey will also be provided to&#xD;
      assess the participant's level of discomfort during use of tDCS. tDCS Protocol. Each&#xD;
      participant will be seated comfortably in a chair. A swim cap will be placed on the&#xD;
      participant's head to identify cranial landmarks for accurate electrode placement. The area&#xD;
      referred to as F3 by the International 10/20 system for electroencephalogram electrode&#xD;
      placement46 has been established as the optimal location for targeting the left DLPFC25,&#xD;
      47-49. The F3 region will be located by marking the vertex (the midpoint between left and&#xD;
      right tragus and midpoint between nasion and inion), measuring the head circumference. When&#xD;
      these measurements are entered into the Beam F3 Locator Software50, additional values are&#xD;
      provided to reliably identify the location of F3. Once F3 has been established, two saline&#xD;
      soaked surface sponge electrodes (352cm) will be prepared and placed. For optimal anodal&#xD;
      stimulation to the DLPFC, the anode will be placed over F3 and the cathode will be placed&#xD;
      over the right supraorbital region23, 24, 47, 48. A current of 2mA will be delivered for 20&#xD;
      minutes 24 by a multichannel transcranial current stimulator (Starstim, Neuroelectrics&#xD;
      Corporation; Cambridge, MA). a-tDCS will be applied before and during behavioral treatment in&#xD;
      the design specified below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Design. Two treatment conditions will be presented in a counter-balanced order in a&#xD;
      cross-over design. The non-prime (NONPRIME) condition will consist of 40 minutes of naming&#xD;
      treatment only, followed by an additional 20 minutes of concurrent naming treatment with&#xD;
      a-tDCS. The primed (PRIME) condition will consist of presentation of a-tDCS for 20 minutes&#xD;
      prior to naming treatment, while the subject sits quietly and comfortably in a chair. After&#xD;
      the 20-minute priming period, the a-tDCS will be removed and the participant will receive&#xD;
      naming treatment for 60 minutes. Both conditions will be presented over four consecutive&#xD;
      days. Two participants will receive NON-PRIME-PRIME sequence, with a one-month washout period&#xD;
      between the two conditions. Two other participants will receive PRIME-NON-PRIME sequence,&#xD;
      with a one-month washout period between the two conditions. Naming reaction time will be&#xD;
      immediately evaluated after each treatment day.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation tool that presents a low current that induces bi-directional polarity-dependent changes in the cortex to facilitate focal, prolonged shifts in cortical excitability at or around the time stimulation is provided. Anodal tDCS (a-tDCS), in which the positively charged electrode is placed over the targeted cortical region, has been shown to increase cortical excitability (upregulation), similar to long-term potentiation (LTP). Combining a-tDCS with behavioral-based approaches has been suggested to enhance the learning process and increase the likelihood of retention.</description>

          <description>During the Working Memory battery, participants completed 12 auditory only or auditory &amp; visual computer-based recall tasks. Twelve subset scores were calculated. Total score is calculated as sum of subtest scores and ranges from 0-520 with higher scores indicating greater working memory.&#xD;
The following auditory and auditory/visual subtests have a possible scoring range between 0-40: phonologically similar and dissimilar word span, word length (short and long) and word span The digit span (auditory and visual/auitory) has scoring range of 0-60. Higher values represent better performance.</description>

Transcranial direct current stimulation: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation tool that presents a low current that induces bi-directional polarity-dependent changes in the cortex to facilitate focal, prolonged shifts in cortical excitability at or around the time stimulation is provided. Anodal tDCS (a-tDCS), in which the positively charged electrode is placed over the targeted cortical region, has been shown to increase cortical excitability (upregulation), similar to long-term potentiation (LTP). Combining a-tDCS with behavioral-based approaches has been suggested to enhance the learning process and increase the likelihood of retention.</description>

Anodal tDCS (a-tDCS), in which the positively charged electrode is placed over the targeted cortical region, has been shown to increase cortical excitability (upregulation), similar to long-term potentiation (LTP). Combining a-tDCS with behavioral-based approaches has been suggested to enhance the learning process and increase the likelihood of retention.</description>

          <description>Participants are shown one or 3 possible banks of pictures balanced for phonemic complexity which are randomly assigned to prevent learning effect. Each bank contains 15 items. Time to recall is measured using a stop watch. The mean time to recall across all items is calculated and reported in milliseconds. The smaller the number, the faster / better the reaction time is.</description>
