  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is a rare and complex primary immunodeficiency that affects&#xD;
      multiple systems. It is characterized by elevated Immunoglobulin E(IgE), recurrent skin and&#xD;
      pulmonary infections and eczematoid dermatitis.Somatic manifestations include scoliosis,&#xD;
      joint hyperextensibility, impaired shedding of deciduous teeth and facial dysmorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason of extremely high level of serum IgE in the patients with HIES is unknown. Signal&#xD;
      transducers and activators of transcription 3(STAT3) gene mutations can cause the STAT3/Janus&#xD;
      kinase(STAT3/JAK) signal transduction pathway disorder, then can affect the B cell&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reported that levels of extracellular signal cytokine and the prolonged half-life of&#xD;
      IgE are not the causes of dramatically increased IgE levels in STAT3-HIES patients. According&#xD;
      to our preliminary work, we found that the slight increase of IgE-secreting plasma cells&#xD;
      could not explain the tremendously increased IgE level and that the key class switch&#xD;
      recombination enzyme (AID) was up-regulated in STAT3-HIES patients. Intriguingly, we found&#xD;
      that deregulation of immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) in IgE secreting plasma&#xD;
      cells in STAT3-HIES patients might play a key role in dramatically increased IgE levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuclear factor IL-3 regulated (NFIL3) is a newly discovered transcriptional factor. During&#xD;
      STAT3-HIES IgE-secreting plasma cells differentiating, NFIL3 was significantly upregulated.&#xD;
      The CSR of IgE was down-regulated in STAT3-deficiency mice as well as NFIL3-deficiency mice,&#xD;
      however Interleukin-4（IL-4）, a STAT3-independent cytokine, promotes NFIL3 expression by&#xD;
      Signal transducers and activators of transcription 6(STAT6) dependent manner. Thus, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that NFIL3 may play a key role in dramatically increased IgE levels in STAT3-HIES&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth insight of the pathogenic role of NFIL3 within human STAT3-HIES has great&#xD;
      significance in clarifying the pathogenesis of HIES and exploiting effective targeting&#xD;
      interventions to improve clinical outcomes. Also, it can provide valuable clues for the&#xD;
      clinical treatment of IgE-related diseases, such as parasite infection and malignant&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

        We divided the patients with HIES into two groups, namely Autosomal-dominant Hyper-IgE&#xD;
        Syndrome(AD-HIES) group and Autosomal-recessive Hyper-IgE Syndrome(AR-HIES) group.&#xD;
        According to the different group, we need to do a variety of detection index, for example,&#xD;
        gene mutations, B-lymphocyte subsets, protein expression et al.In addition, healthy control&#xD;
        group is needed in the experiment.&#xD;
