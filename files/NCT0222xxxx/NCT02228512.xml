      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The chemotherapy combination DA-EPOCH-RP includes the drugs etoposide (E), prednisone (P),&#xD;
      vincristine (O), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (H), rituximab (R), and pomalidomide (P).&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if including pomalidomide will help people with two rare lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the safety and efficacy of the chemotherapy drugs DA-EPOCH-RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 years old. They must have primary effusion lymphoma or large cell&#xD;
      lymphoma arising from Kaposi sarcoma Herpesvirus-associated multicentric Castleman disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be with screened with blood tests, scans, spinal tap, and bone marrow&#xD;
           sample. They may have skin or lymph node samples taken and fluid removed from around&#xD;
           some organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have breathing and eye tests. A camera may take pictures inside their&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take pomalidomide alone by mouth for up to 21 days. Then they will get&#xD;
           rituximab by intravenous (IV) catheter, which is a small tube that goes into a vein..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an IV inserted in an arm or chest vein to get the IV chemotherapy&#xD;
           drugs, at the same time the will take pomalidomide by mouth for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will get DA-EPOCH-RP in 21-day cycles. Most people will have 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will get 4 study drugs by IV for 5 days and 2 others by mouth for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will get daily filgrastim injections in the skin until white blood counts are&#xD;
           acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 2 days of some cycles, methotrexate will be injected into the spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing EPOCH-RP, some participants who have Kaposi sarcoma will be prescribed&#xD;
           pomalidomide for 3-weeks, followed by a one week break, for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will repeat the blood tests often. They will also have repeated medical&#xD;
           history, physical exam, urine and stool tests, and pictures of any rashes associated&#xD;
           with these lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have several follow-up visits over 4 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and large&#xD;
           cell lymphoma arising from KSHV-MCD are aggressive B cell neoplasms with&#xD;
           clinicopathologic and molecular profiles distinct from other AIDS-related lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no prospective studies on these rare lymphomas. Clinical experience is&#xD;
           limited; however, reported prognosis is poor, with median survival estimated at less&#xD;
           than 6 months using conventional CHOP-like chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Novel treatment is urgently needed for KSHV-associated lymphomas, and the therapeutic&#xD;
           approach must take into account concurrent KSHV-associated malignancies which are&#xD;
           commonly seen in this patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide, an immune-modulatory derivative (IMiD) of thalidomide has in vitro&#xD;
&#xD;
      direct antitumor effect in KSHV-lymphomas as well as immune modulatory and antiangiogenic&#xD;
      effects that may be beneficial in treating both KSHV-NHL and in many patients, concurrent KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to be an active&#xD;
           agent in the management of KSHV-MCD. Although PEL is a CD20-negative tumor, advances in&#xD;
           the understanding the biology of KSHV-infection of B-cells, the pathobiology of IL-6&#xD;
           syndromes in KSHV-MCD and KSHV-NHL, and clinical experience using rituximab in the&#xD;
           treatment of KSHV-MCD support use of rituximab in the treatment of KSHV-NHL, especially&#xD;
           in patients with concurrent KSHV-MCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
           doxorubicin (DA)-EPOCH is an anthracycline-based regimen that allows for personalization&#xD;
           of dose-intensity showing that inclusion of etoposide and infusional administration&#xD;
           decreases tumor cell resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of DA-EPOCH in combination with rituximab for the treatment of HIVassociated&#xD;
           diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
           effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the central role of controlling HIV viremia with combination antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy (cART) in the management of KSHV-associated malignancies, as well as the likely&#xD;
           contribution of uncontrolled HIV viremia to PEL pathogenesis, cART will be employed as&#xD;
           an important part of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of pomalidomide in&#xD;
      combination with DA-EPOCH-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate overall survival in treatment-naive patients with primary effusion lymphoma treated&#xD;
      with pomalidomide in combination with, DA-EPOCH and rituximab (DAEPOCH- RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years with pathology confirmed primary effusion&#xD;
      lymphoma,&#xD;
&#xD;
      including extracavitary variant OR large cell lymphoma arising in the setting of&#xD;
      KSHVassociated MCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphoma that is measurable or assessable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously treated patients will be allowed if they have not been treated with modified&#xD;
           DA-EPOCH or pomalidomide for KSHV-associated lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any HIV status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematologic and biochemical parameters within pre-specified limits at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to use effective birth control, as defined in the full protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither pregnant nor breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excluded if other serious co-morbid condition that would prohibit administration of&#xD;
           planned chemotherapeutic intervention is present&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/ II study of pomalidomide in combination with modified DA-EPOCH-R in&#xD;
           patients with PEL and diffuse large cell lymphoma arising in the setting of KSHVMCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I of the study will evaluate escalating doses of pomalidomide (3 mg, 4 mg, and 5&#xD;
           mg) in combination with modified DA-EPOCH-R to determine safe and tolerable phase II&#xD;
           pomalidomide dose for combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment in both Phase I and Phase II will have three parts. Patients will receive up&#xD;
           to 21 days of pomalidomide monotherapy (part A), followed by 6 cycles of pomalidomide in&#xD;
           combination with modified DA-EPOCH-R (part B), and then an optional up to 12 months of&#xD;
           pomalidomide (part C) for patients with concurrent KS, symptomatic KSHVMCD, or KSHV&#xD;
           inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with HIV will generally be prescribed cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase I, with 3 dose levels, 9-18 patients will be accrued (3-6 patients per level).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase II portion of the study, 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled over 48-60&#xD;
           months and 12 months follow-up after the last patient has enrolled, a 1-tailed 0.10&#xD;
           alpha level test would have 80% power to determine if OS curve would demonstrate a&#xD;
           1-year OS consistent with 45% or better and ruling out 20% or worse.&#xD;
