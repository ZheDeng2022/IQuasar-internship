      -  The perioperative period can be a significant source of psychological burden, anxiety&#xD;
           and fear for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods have been proposed in order to&#xD;
           alleviate perioperative stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Music is one of the non-pharmacological methods which have been used in this context,&#xD;
           with favorable effects both preoperatively and postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The attenuation of perioperative stress through music listening is probably due to the&#xD;
           activation of emotional and cognitive processes that evoke feeling of pleasure and can&#xD;
           distract patients' attention from fear and unpleasant thoughts related to the surgical&#xD;
           procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Little information is available regarding the effect of intraoperative music listening&#xD;
           on anesthetized, unconscious patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a notion that general anesthesia does not completely abolish auditory&#xD;
           perception and that some processing of intraoperative events can occur in unconscious&#xD;
           patients, even in the absence of postoperative recall&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators hypothesis is that intraoperative music listening can decrease&#xD;
           anesthetic requirements and reduce sevoflurane consumption in female patients subjected&#xD;
           to abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease.&#xD;

      -  The perioperative period can be a significant source of psychological burden, anxiety&#xD;
           and fear for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods have been proposed in order to&#xD;
           alleviate perioperative stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Music is one of the non-pharmacological methods which have been used in this context,&#xD;
           with favorable effects both preoperatively and postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Listening to music during the preoperative period has proved useful as an adjunct to&#xD;
           premedication and can even be used instead of premedication. Additionally, listening to&#xD;
           music postoperatively can also be useful, since it has been related to a more favorable&#xD;
           recovery profile and possible attenuation of postoperative pain. In this context, music&#xD;
           has also been used in Intensive Care Units, with measurable effects on anxiety scales&#xD;
           and hemodynamic parameters. There are also studies investigating the use of music during&#xD;
           operations under regional anesthesia, which have shown that music listening&#xD;
           substantially decreases the need for anxiolytic administration throughout the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The attenuation of perioperative stress through music listening is probably due to the&#xD;
           activation of emotional and cognitive processes that evoke feelings of pleasure and can&#xD;
           distract patients' attention from fear and unpleasant thoughts related to the surgical&#xD;
           procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the favorable effects of music listening during regional anesthesia for the&#xD;
           attenuation of intraoperative stress in conscious patients are more or less expected and&#xD;
           easily interpreted, less is known regarding the effect of intraoperative music listening&#xD;
           on anesthetized, unconscious patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generally, there is a notion that general anesthesia does not completely abolish&#xD;
           auditory perception and that some processing of intraoperative events can occur in&#xD;
           unconscious patients, even in the absence of postoperative recall&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preservation of some form of auditory processing during general anesthesia is not&#xD;
           necessarily undesirable and can be used to the patient's benefit, since it has been&#xD;
           shown that subjecting patients to therapeutic suggestions during general anesthesia can&#xD;
           improve recovery parameters or decrease hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators hypothesis is that intraoperative music listening can decrease&#xD;
           anesthetic requirements. Therefore, the investigators will investigate sevoflurane&#xD;
           consumption necessary to achieve a depth of anesthesia corresponding to bispectral index&#xD;
           values of 45-55. Female patients subjected to abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease&#xD;
           will be randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, audiotapes playing relaxing&#xD;
           soothing orchestral music will be placed on the patients' ears after induction of&#xD;
           general anesthesia while in the other group the same set of audiotapes will be used&#xD;
           without however playing any music&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sevoflurane consumption will be estimated by weighing the sevoflurane vaporizer in a&#xD;
           high-precision scale before induction and after completion of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
           Patients will also be queried regarding recall of any sounds or intraoperative events,&#xD;
           dreaming while anesthetized and they will be asked to rate their satisfaction from&#xD;
           anesthesia. Recovery parameters will also be investigated, such as postoperative nausea&#xD;
           and vomiting and the intensity of postoperative pain. To ensure homogeneity,&#xD;
           standardized analgesia will be administered in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since prolactin is related to the neuroendocrine response to stress, blood will also be&#xD;
           sampled at predetermined timepoints during anesthesia, to detect potential differences&#xD;
           between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical interest of this study lies in the fact that if a non-costly intervention&#xD;
           such as music listening during anesthesia can lead to reduced requirements of anesthetic&#xD;
           agents or to reduced need for postoperative analgesia, this theoretically can be&#xD;
           translated to a reduction in anesthetic cost. In addition, improvement in recovery&#xD;
           profile parameters could lead to a quicker discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit&#xD;
           with reduction in turnaround times and overall time optimization.&#xD;
