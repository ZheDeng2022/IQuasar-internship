  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacemakers and ICD's have traditionally been accepted as contraindications to MRI due to&#xD;
      safety concerns. Recent work in our laboratory as well as our pilot study of approximately&#xD;
      500 patients has shown the safety of most contemporary implanted rhythm management devices in&#xD;
      the MRI environment given appropriate precautions. Because the investigators have completed&#xD;
      testing in animals weighing as little as 80 lbs. without incident, the investigators feel&#xD;
      they can safely image children at this weight or greater (Circulation 2004; 110:475-482).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to expand on our pilot study and to develop a protocol, consistent&#xD;
      with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) requirements, that will increase our&#xD;
      safety experience with clinically indicated MR imaging in patients with implanted cardiac&#xD;
      pacemakers and ICD's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cohort study. One thousand seven hundred patients with a clinical need for MRI will&#xD;
      be recruited. Risks and Benefits associated with Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging in the&#xD;
      setting of implantable devices will be discussed and informed consent obtained. The type of&#xD;
      device and leads will be ascertained. Patients will be monitored by a physician or a&#xD;
      Registered Nurse (RN) with ACLS certification and familiarity with ICD/Pacemaker programming&#xD;
      during the study. When imaging children who meet age and weight criteria, a physician will be&#xD;
      present during the entire study. Fellow and attending radiology and electrophysiology support&#xD;
      will be available in house in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard device testing including battery voltages, thresholds, sensing and lead impedances&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to develop a protocol, consistent with DHHS/ Center&#xD;
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines and requirements to further document&#xD;
      safety in clinically indicated MR imaging in patients with implanted cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillators (ICD's) and pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI's will be conducted on patients who require a clinically indicated MRI only. All studies&#xD;
      will be done in the 1.5 Tesla MRI unit. ECG monitoring pads will be placed on the patients&#xD;
      for the duration of the study. An external defibrillator and Advance Cardiovascular Life&#xD;
      Support (ACLS) drugs will be on hand. Heart rate, blood pressure, O2 saturation will also be&#xD;
      monitored non-invasively throughout the study. All devices will undergo a complete&#xD;
      interrogation prior to imaging. Parameters such as atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds,&#xD;
      R and P wave amplitudes, lead impedance, and battery status will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
      PPMs will be programmed to an asynchronous mode if dependent and to an inhibited mode in&#xD;
      patients without pacemaker dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pacemaker function of ICD's in pacemaker independent patients will be programmed to&#xD;
      ventricular inhibited (VVI) mode at 50 bpm. Pacemaker dependant patients with ICDs will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is a theoretical concern that patients who have capped or abandoned leads&#xD;
      in their chest may be at risk for heating. While there is little or no objective data to&#xD;
      support this concern, given this theoretical concern, patients in this category will only be&#xD;
      admitted to the study if the referring physician deems the MRI critical and after the PI has&#xD;
      carefully considered the risk/benefit ration for each patient who falls in to this category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, there historically has also been a concern that newly implanted leads (&lt;4 weeks)&#xD;
      are at risk for lead to dislodgement d/t possible torque from the MRI environment. This too&#xD;
      is only a theoretical concern and there is little or no scientific evidence to support this&#xD;
      claim. Nevertheless, patients with newly implanted pacemaker/ICD leads will be considered by&#xD;
      the PI for protocol inclusion only if the referring physician deems the MRI to be critical&#xD;
      and after considering the risk/benefit to each individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the appropriate MRI protocol for each MRI patient's unique condition has been&#xD;
      completed, the device will be re-programmed to its original settings and completely&#xD;
      interrogated to detect any changes in device performance.&#xD;
