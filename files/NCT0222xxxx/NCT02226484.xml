      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if oral quercetin increases the expression of claudin-4 in the lining of the&#xD;
           esophagus of patients with a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether the increase in claudin-4 by oral quercetin is accompanied by&#xD;
           improvement in the barrier function and acid resistance of the lining of the esophagus&#xD;
           of patients with a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interested, participants will be consented and provided a questionnaire to complete as&#xD;
      part of the study. Participants will undergo endoscopy for routine care and will have up to 8&#xD;
      esophageal biopsies (small tissue samples) taken for the research study. After endoscopy,&#xD;
      participants will be contacted to begin a 6 week treatment period with study drug (Quercetin,&#xD;
      taken twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 6 week period, participants will be scheduled to have blood drawn and to&#xD;
      have a follow-up endoscopy with biopsies performed for the research study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must be symptomatic (heartburn) and agree to allow endoscopic biopsies from the&#xD;
      lower 5 cm of esophagus for research purposes. If the endoscopy demonstrates non-erosive&#xD;
      reflux disease, biopsies of Esophageal Squamous Epithelium (ESE) are obtained and placed in&#xD;
      mRNA-Later to assess claudin-4 mRNA by qRT-PCR and protein expression by Western blot (53,&#xD;
      64) while other biopsies of ESE are obtained and handled as in SpAim#2 to assess barrier&#xD;
      function of ESE. After consent, subjects complete a questionnaire assessing demographics,&#xD;
      disease-specific parameters such as duration of symptoms and past treatment, and the&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS), a validated measure&#xD;
      of GERD severity. Following this, patients in open label fashion are given orally 500 mg&#xD;
      Quercetin (Q) twice daily (bid) [Pure, House of Nutrition, Yonkers, NY] for 6-weeks. Symptoms&#xD;
      are monitored 1 week before and for the 6 week treatment period. At 6 weeks, a blood sample&#xD;
      is obtained for determination of Q and its metabolites by HPLC and endoscopy and biopsies of&#xD;
      ESE are repeated and processed as initially done for claudin-4 levels in ESE.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change in claudin-4 levels in a given subject before and after administration of Quercetin (Q), our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in claudin-4 levels (i.e. mean Î” of claudin-4 titer from t0 to t1 is 0) and the alternative hypothesis is that claudin-4 levels following the administration of Q will be significantly different than before administration. To test this hypothesis, we will perform paired Student's t-tests. If data violate normality, Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used as a nonparametric alternative to the Student's t. Additionally, exploratory analysis will be performed to assess the impact of treatment on reflux scores, as demonstrated by changes in the GERD Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) before and after therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barrier function and acid resistance of esophageal squamous epithelium (ESE) as measured by epithelial resistance, RT, and fluorescein flux.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the increase in claudin-4 by oral Quercetin (Q) is accompanied by improvement in the barrier function and acid resistance of esophageal squamous epithelium (ESE) in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), we will assess the correlation in claudin-4 expression with our measures of epithelial resistance, RT, and fluorescein flux. Both the predictor variable (claudin-4 expression) and the response variables (RT and fluorescein flux) are continuous variables. Because the correlation between claudin-4 and the response variables is unknown and may not have a linear contour, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used instead of Pearson's correlation, to improve sensitivity to non-linear relationships. Alpha will be set at 0.05.</description>
