  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System in patients with&#xD;
      severe age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The Argus II System has already been studied&#xD;
      in completely blind patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In RP patients, some cells of&#xD;
      the retina are irrevocably damaged and the Argus II System has been found to restore some&#xD;
      basic visual function. On these grounds, the device has received authorization for use on the&#xD;
      European market (the CE certification) in 2011.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 5 subjects with severe dry AMD who are legally blind will be implanted with&#xD;
      the Argus II System. The study will evaluate the safety of the device and surgery, as well as&#xD;
      functioning of the system and the extent of any restored vision. Each subject will be&#xD;
      followed for 3 years, with their eye health and visual function tested at multiple time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must consent to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be between 25 and 85 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be diagnosed with dry AMD (i.e., evidence of drusen and hyperplasia of&#xD;
             the RPE in the eye with geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severely sight impaired and meets the following additional criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Visual acuity of logMAR 1.0 (6/60) or worse in both eyes as measured by ETDRS;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hand motion or worse central vision in the eye to be implanted, as measured with&#xD;
                  a pinhole occluder;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Geographic atrophy (confirmed by Fundus Autofluorescence) and central scotoma&#xD;
                  (confirmed by microperimetry) in the central 20Â° or more;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must be pseudophakic with an IOL successfully implanted in the study eye at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks before baseline testing, or aphakic with a clear capsule. If applicable,&#xD;
             posterior laser capsulotomy may be performed 2 weeks before baseline testing is&#xD;
             performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject must be both motivated and competent to learn to use the Argus II System (by&#xD;
             the Investigator's assessment), and willing and able to commit to the study&#xD;
             requirements. This includes an understanding of the requirements of the study and&#xD;
             acceptance of the time involved in participating;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must not suffer from non-ophthalmic serious adverse events (e.g., myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, etc.) or from non-curable life threatening conditions (e.g. cancer) at the&#xD;

             curvature of the retina like staphyloma and all causes of significant protrusions or&#xD;

&#xD;
