  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a mobile electronic&#xD;
      mindfulness therapy service for patients with definite or suspected chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim will be to determine the effect of the intervention on a symptom&#xD;
      severity/global assessment of improvement for patients with chronic pancreatitis. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a one-month period of daily mindfulness therapy delivered via&#xD;
      a phone messaging service will reduce symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet diagnostic criteria for definite or suspected chronic pancreatitis and have&#xD;
      current symptoms over the past month will be considered for study enrollment. Potential&#xD;
      patients will be initially pre-screened by a patient chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not excluded during the pre-screening process, potential subjects will be mailed&#xD;
      questionnaires to fill out at home and speak with a member of the research team for an intake&#xD;
      interview. At that time, they will be asked to sign a consent form after its review. Subjects&#xD;
      will then be given instructions on how to participate in daily mindfulness therapy for&#xD;
      one-month via the phone messaging service with a research team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study intervention will be four weeks where enrolled patients will&#xD;
      be asked to perform daily mindfulness sessions through our electronic mobile mindfulness&#xD;
      therapy service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be sent a daily automated text message or call reminder to their mobile phone&#xD;
      at a pre-determined time, selected by the patient at the intake interview. The text message&#xD;
      will prompt patients with a phone number to call to access the Mindfulness Therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is ready, s/he will call the provided phone number which is an automated&#xD;
      answering and voice messaging service, which will prompt the patient to select a mindfulness&#xD;
      therapy session of varying durations from 2 to 30 minutes. The session will lead the patients&#xD;
      through deep relaxation breathing exercise for the duration the patient selected from the&#xD;
      phone menu. Although the investigators will only ask patients to do one mindfulness session a&#xD;
      day, patients are free to do as many as they want a day. At the end of their session,&#xD;
      patients will leave a voice message with their name and current location such as home or&#xD;
      work. The investigators will track the mindfulness sessions the individual patient&#xD;
      participated in by obtaining their recorded voice messages in an inbox that correlates with&#xD;
      the duration of the mindfulness session that the patient participated in. The voice messaging&#xD;
      system will also provide information of the time the voice message was left, or time of&#xD;
      completion of the patient's mindfulness session. If the patient prematurely terminated&#xD;
      his/her session, got disconnected from his/her session or forgot to leave a message, the&#xD;
      patient may call the same provided phone number to leave a message with his/her name, date of&#xD;
      unrecorded session along with its duration and location of participation such as home or&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study at four weeks, patients will be asked to complete an exit interview.&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to fill out questionnaires during this interview. The patient will&#xD;
      also be asked to participate in an informal exit interview with one of the research team&#xD;
      members. Patients will be asked of any new medications were added during the duration of the&#xD;
      study. They will also be asked regarding any changes in chronic pancreatitis strategies and&#xD;
      any new stressors.&#xD;
