      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving tipifarnib together with radiation therapy and&#xD;
      temozolomide may be a better way to treat glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for tipifarnib (R115777) in combination with&#xD;
      temozolomide with radiation in patients not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the safety of R115777 in combination with temozolomide with radiation in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for evidence of antitumor activity in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIPIFARNIB: Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY DURING RADIATION THERAPY: Within 5-9 days after starting tipifarnib,&#xD;
      patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) daily and receive temozolomide PO&#xD;
      daily for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-RADIATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning at week 10 post-radiation therapy, patients receive&#xD;
      temozolomide PO on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 1 year or 12 complete&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months.&#xD;

          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 100,000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10 gm/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow function tests must be performed within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             and the test must be performed within 14 days prior to registration; if above the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal but &lt; 2 times institutional upper limit of normal,&#xD;
             the decision to initiate temozolomide treatment should carefully consider the benefits&#xD;
             and risks for the individual patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times ULN and the test must be performed within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration; if above the institutional upper limit of normal but &lt; 2 times&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal, the decision to initiate temozolomide treatment&#xD;
             should carefully consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL before starting therapy and the test must be performed within&#xD;
             14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise&#xD;
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy; patients must not have any disease&#xD;
             that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy&#xD;
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No exclusion to this study will be based on race; minorities will actively be&#xD;
             recruited to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding, and women with reproductive potential&#xD;
             must practice adequate contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be on chronic Coumadin therapy for prior medical problems (e.g.&#xD;
             cardiac valve prophylaxis); this is due to a presumed interaction with Coumadin and&#xD;
             ZARNESTRA leading to a significant increase in international normalized ratio (INR);&#xD;
             patients who develop or have recently developed a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism who are on or will take Coumadin will be allowed to participate; however, the&#xD;
             investigator should be prepared to monitor patients INR closely&#xD;
