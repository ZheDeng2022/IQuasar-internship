  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VELCADE has demonstrated marked activity in haematological cancers leading to registration&#xD;
      (MM, MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently only biweekly or weekly regimens have been explored. Key signalling pathways which&#xD;
      are aberrant in haematological cancers are also present in solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VELCADE covers a broad spectrum of proteins, which are pivotal in carcinogenesis.VELCADE as a&#xD;
      single agent &amp; in combination with chemotherapy in solid cancers has shown modest and real&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity but insufficient for Phase III development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VELCADE PK exposure may be inadequate in solid tumors compared to &quot;liquid cancers.&quot; VELCADE&#xD;
      daily low dose administration may allow a greater PK exposure to be achieved, which is&#xD;
      tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) is tolerable at biologically active doses&#xD;
      VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) results in increased PK (AUC)/PD (20S proteasome&#xD;
      inhibition) VELCADE daily dosing (5-days on, 2-days off) with increased PK/PD results in&#xD;
      improved anti-tumor activity (Increased tolerable VELCADE AUC may potentially cross the&#xD;
      threshold required for clinically significant anti-tumor activity in solid cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some preclinical data suggest that: VELCADE daily dosing results in increased proteasome&#xD;
      inhibition in tumor tissues Combination of VELCADE + XRT/other daily dosing agent may have&#xD;
      increased anti-tumor activity compared to monotherapy alone.&#xD;
