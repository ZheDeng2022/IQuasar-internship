      The primary objectives of the LIFE Study are to demonstrate the clinical and cost benefits&#xD;
      associated with using the Ovation® Abdominal Stent Graft Platform under the least invasive&#xD;
      conditions defined in the Fast-Track EVAR protocol. The key elements of the Fast-Track EVAR&#xD;
      protocol include: appropriate patient selection, bilateral percutaneous access, no general&#xD;
      anesthesia, no ICU admission post procedure, and next day discharge.&#xD;

      The LIFE Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center&#xD;
      post-market registry to evaluate the ultra low profile (14F) Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft&#xD;
      Platform when using in the Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (P-EVAR) treatment of&#xD;
      patients with AAA using a Fast-Track EVAR protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      250 study patients will be enrolled at up to 40 institutions. Follow-up period is one month.&#xD;
