  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate molecular, cytological and genetic features of&#xD;
      occupational chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in conditions of different&#xD;
      occupational exposures. In order to achieve this goal serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      standard inflammation markers level, hemostasis, cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage and associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1800470 transforming&#xD;
      growing factor β1 (TGF β1) gene, rs1828591 hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) gene,&#xD;
      rs4129267 interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) gene, rs1051730 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3&#xD;
      (CHRNA3) gene with COPD in subjects exposed to silica dust and in those exposed to polycyclic&#xD;
      aromatic hydrocarbons exhaust will be investigated. The relationship between genotype and&#xD;
      phenotype characteristics, such as an inflammation activity, assessed by C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α) serum concentration, in different occupational&#xD;
      COPD groups will be studied. The hypothesis is that the mechanisms underlying disease&#xD;
      development and progression are different due to environmental risk factor that reflex in&#xD;
      differs in disease attributes - molecular biomarkers, cytology results and genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility between COPD due to dust, COPD due to chemicals and COPD in smokers therefore&#xD;
      COPD can be subdivided into ecological phenotypes according to environmental risk factor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study rationale: The main risk factors of COPD are tobacco smoking, biomass smoking and&#xD;
      occupational factors. Tobacco smoking is well-known risk factor so tobacco induced COPD is&#xD;
      completely established. Nevertheless the meaning of occupational factors which are less&#xD;
      famous are equally important. Based on comprehensive literature review American Thoracic&#xD;
      Society (ATS) endorsed the notion that strong evidence implicates occupational factors as&#xD;
      cause of COPD [Eisner MD et al., 2010]. Occupational COPD takes 19.2 % of all COPD patients&#xD;
      and 31.1 % of never smokers as resulted NHANESIII study [Hnizdo E. et al., 2004]. A&#xD;
      considerable number of work-related factors have evidence for a causal association with COPD&#xD;
      including (and of course not limited) silica and silicates and polycyclic aromatic&#xD;
      hydrocarbons. Individuals in a variety of occupations and industries such as coal miners,&#xD;
      coke workers, tunnel workers, metallurgists, welding workers, transportation workers,&#xD;
      builders, farmers are exposed to factors cited above. Despite this the clinical and&#xD;
      pathophysiological features of COPD caused by occupational factors are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational factors leading airflow limitation are various entities - vapors, dusts, gases&#xD;
      and fumes with different physical, chemical, biological and other features, so the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying disease development and progression may be different attributable to risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An environmental risk factors exposure as well as tobacco smoking results in COPD only in&#xD;
      part of the subjects which indicates the significant genome and gene environmental&#xD;
      interactions role. COPD develops in predisposed subjects undergoing risk factors exposure.&#xD;
      Therefore the risk of COPD is individual and depends on both genetic and environments. There&#xD;
      are few data concerning the effects of genetic on COPD risk in this specific subgroup -&#xD;
      people who are exposed to occupational risk factors related to the certain environmental&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis will be carried out by Statistica 9.0 software.&#xD;
      Significance level will be considered p = 0.05. The qualitative variables will be expressed&#xD;
      as counts and percentages. The quantitative continuous variables will be expressed as means&#xD;
      and standard error of means (M ± m) for variables that meet the criteria of normality and&#xD;
      minimum and maximum, median for those that do not meet the criteria of normality.&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for comparing multiply independent samples and Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test for comparing two independent samples if variable under consideration will continuous&#xD;
      and that it will be measured on an ordinal scale. For comparisons of proportions, the&#xD;
      Chi-square will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For associations assessment logistic regression method will be used. The odds ratio (OR) and&#xD;
      95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for each professional group. Multiple&#xD;
      regression model will be used to explore the relationships between demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, cytokine concentrations, hemostasis and airflow limitation in professional&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
