      All Danish general practices have a data capture system that collects selected data from the&#xD;
      electronic patient record. These data are used for various quality assurance purposes. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to evaluate the quality assurance system/program that identifies patients&#xD;
      having an increased risk of osteoporosis.&#xD;

      Background/Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners (GPs) have the Sentinel data capture program as an integrated part of&#xD;
      their medical record system. The program identifies if a patient has one or more of the&#xD;
      following risk factors registered with an ICPC code (International Classification of Primary&#xD;
      Care - 2, Wonca International Classification Committee (WICC)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol abuse (P15), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (R95), hyperthyroidism&#xD;
      (T85), rheumatoid arthritis (L88), fracture (L72, L73, L74, L75 and L76 (age &gt; 50))*,&#xD;
      anorexia (P86), glomerulonephritis/ nephropathy (U88), early menopause (ages 40 to 45 and&#xD;
      X05), smoker (current/former P17), corticosteroid treatment (at least two prescriptions),&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) (between 10-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      *L72: radius/ulna fracture, L73: tibia/fibula fracture, L74: hand/foot fracture, L75: femur&#xD;
      fracture, L76: NEC (not elsewhere classified) fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GP can generate a list of his own patients that have an increased risk of osteoporosis&#xD;
      with name, personal identification number, age, address, eGFR (estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate), BMI, an indication of which of the above mentioned diagnoses the patient&#xD;
      has, and whether the patient had been instructed in calcium and vitamin D intake. In order to&#xD;
      generate a list, the GP must have been using ICPC coding for at least 6 months with a minimum&#xD;
      of 70% of patient contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GP can afterwards invite these high-risk individuals for a consultation focussing on&#xD;
      osteoporosis prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has initiated in January 2014 including two general practices (Clinic A &amp; B) from&#xD;
      the Aalborg Municipality that volunteered to participate. Based on the investigators pilot&#xD;
      study the investigators aimed at clinics with approximately 200 patients at risk in each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic A (www.laegernesloejfen.dk) is located in eastern Aalborg, Denmark. Clinic B&#xD;
      (www.l√¶gerneiskalborg.dk) is located in southwest Aalborg, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic A and B's lists of patients at an increased risk of osteoporosis is printed and&#xD;
      downloaded, along with their ICPC coded diagnoses and data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' medical records are screened for exclusion criteria. Eligible patients are&#xD;
      contacted and asked to come for a consultation regarding the risk of developing osteoporosis.&#xD;
      The patients are contacted directly if they visit the clinic anyway; otherwise they are&#xD;
      contacted by e-mail or letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients coming for a consultation are given a questionnaire regarding osteoporosis risk&#xD;
      factors in relation to lifestyle, diet, diseases predisposing osteoporosis, fall prophylaxis,&#xD;
      and medication. The questionnaire also evaluate the patient's attitude towards being offered&#xD;
      preventive examination and treatment by his/hers general practitioner. Patients wanting a&#xD;
      consultation, but not wishing to participate in the scientific study are examined and offered&#xD;
      treatment equal to the consenting patient according to national standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients then have a consultation regarding osteoporosis prevention (typically by a&#xD;
      nurse). During the consultation the patient's different risk factors are discussed and advice&#xD;
      is given regarding fall prophylaxis, diet, calcium and vitamin D. The patient's medication is&#xD;
      examined as specified by national guidelines. All patients are then offered referral to a&#xD;
      DXA-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are scanned and classified as having osteoporosis are offered a new&#xD;
      consultation regarding osteoporosis treatment and blood tests for secondary osteoporosis&#xD;
      screening purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with osteopenia and normal bone mineral density are informed about their test result&#xD;
      and if necessary advised to have a new DXA-scan in a few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on the routine identification of patients at risk of osteoporosis found by&#xD;
      using the Sentinel data capture program. Intervention is not used in the study, however the&#xD;
      patients at risk are offered regular preventive examination according to their risk&#xD;
      (DXA-scan). The study analyses data based on the quality assurance work regarding&#xD;
      osteoporosis of the general practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are informed that participation is completely voluntary and they can withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time and it will have no bearing on present or future treatment. All&#xD;
      participating patients give oral and written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not wanting to participate will not be part of the study and only their sex, age,&#xD;
      risk factors and reason for exclusion will be registered anonymously in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      selection of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of participation in the study will have no consequences on the examination and treatment&#xD;
      offered to patients at risk.&#xD;
