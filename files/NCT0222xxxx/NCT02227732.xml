        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a symptomatic malignant pleural effusion requiring intervention. For an&#xD;
             effusion to be defined as malignant, at least one of the following must be true:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is histocytological confirmation of pleural malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effusion is an exudate (as per Light's criteria) in the context of&#xD;
                  histocytologically proven malignancy elsewhere, with no other clear cause for&#xD;
                  fluid identified&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a history of at least one ipsilateral pleural effusion causing dyspnoea&#xD;
             that responded to thoracentesis where the lung expanded and the dyspnoea was relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is willing and able to meet all study requirements, including attending&#xD;
             follow-up visits or receiving trial-related telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. There is sufficient fluid on thoracic ultrasound to allow safe insertion of an&#xD;
             indwelling pleural catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Negative pregnancy test if appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has significant trapped lung (&gt;20%), or a proximal bronchial obstruction which&#xD;
             is likely to lead to trapped lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a Karnofsky score of less than 50, or a WHO/ECOG performance status of 3*&#xD;
             or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or is lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a history of empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history of chylothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has an uncorrected coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is allergic to device materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has evidence, in the opinion of the Chief Investigator, of either on-going&#xD;
             systemic or pleural infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has had a lobectomy or pneumonectomy on the side of the effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has undergone a previous attempt at pleurodesis which has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has previously been diagnosed with a serious immunodeficiency disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has bilateral pleural effusions, with both being at least moderate in size&#xD;
             (greater than 1/3 of the hemithorax on chest x-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has evidence of fluid loculation such that attempts at pleurodesis are likely&#xD;
             to be futile.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has a mediastinal shift of ≥2cm toward the side of the effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject is receiving concurrent intrapleural chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the&#xD;
             ipsilateral chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has any clinical condition, diagnosis, or social circumstance that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Chief Investigator, would mean participation in the study would be&#xD;
             contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has no access to a telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. No details of blood values (full blood count, clotting screen, urea and electrolytes,&#xD;
             liver function) from within the last 10 days * Patients who have a performance status&#xD;
             of 3 may be considered for the trial if the removal of their fluid would likely&#xD;
             improve their performance score by 1 or more.&#xD;
