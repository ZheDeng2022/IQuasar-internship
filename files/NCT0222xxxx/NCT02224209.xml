      1. Data Quality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the initiation of the study sites, Cerebrovascular Disease Center of Beijing&#xD;
           Tiantan Hospital will verify whether the investigators are qualified, inspect the study&#xD;
           site's facilities, and inform the investigators of their responsibilities, as well as&#xD;
           how to correctly and completely fill related documents. Through investigator training&#xD;
           sessions, the investigators and their teams will understand the trial protocol, CRF and&#xD;
           trial process, etc. Then start-up visit at each site will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Trial monitors will pay start-up visit to the site, and pay the first inspection visit&#xD;
           as soon as possible after the screening/randomization of the first patient. Afterwards,&#xD;
           the monitors will pay inspection visits regularly until the trial visits end. They need&#xD;
           to directly refer to source data to verify the accurate of CRF filling and conduct&#xD;
           inspection/audits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data entered into the CRF shall be subject to examination of internal consistency&#xD;
           (within known classification and scope), external inspection (data are consistent with&#xD;
           the patient's other known data) and trend consistency (data changes do not exceed the&#xD;
           allowable range. For example, excess weight loss prompts changes in dietary status). The&#xD;
           contents of trial database include data collected by each site, abnormal data and&#xD;
           delayed data in progress tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. File Data&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data entered into the CRF must be able to be verified by source data, or directly&#xD;
           entered into the CRF. In this case, the data in the CRF can be regarded as source data,&#xD;
           and used for subsequent data confirmation. Required data of all patients' continued&#xD;
           treatment shall also be routinely recorded in their medical records. The site's&#xD;
           investigators shall clearly make patients' medical records that the patient is&#xD;
           participating in a clinical trial, and also require any other medical staff for&#xD;
           treatment of the patient to contact the trial contact persons before treatment. To this&#xD;
           end, the investigators shall provide their contact information. If a patient preserves&#xD;
           his/her medical records on his/her own, the study site shall preserve a copy of all&#xD;
           trial-related data. Unless related data or information is directly recorded in the CRF,&#xD;
           all research data must be recorded in patients' medical records (or research documents),&#xD;
           and entered into the CRF as early as possible. Source data to be verified and primary&#xD;
           documents used for such purpose must be preserved. Patients' research documents and all&#xD;
           source data shall be preserved until a notice for destruction is received from the&#xD;
           sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Method and Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is powered on the primary endpoint of hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) rate at&#xD;
           30 days post CAS procedure. Superiority analysis will be performed using a two-sample&#xD;
           t-test at a two-sided 5% alpha level. All secondary endpoints will be descriptively&#xD;
           compared between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All analyses will be performed on the Per-Protocol (PP) population. The PP population&#xD;
           will consist of patients who have received the treatment per randomization without major&#xD;
           protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           X2 test is adopted for statistical analysis of two groups of results, supplemented by&#xD;
           compliance with the protocol and actual treatment analysis. The following confounding&#xD;
           factors will be considered in the analysis to determine the effect of different preset&#xD;
           confounding factors on prognosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sex;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Degree, location, diameter and length of lesion stenosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebrovascular collateral compensatory conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebral hemodynamics of the culprit side;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebrovascular reserve or cerebrovascular autoregulation status of the culprit&#xD;
                side;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diameter and pressure of balloon for stage-1 balloon angioplasty;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carotid angioplasty experience of the operating site or doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Appropriate methods will be employed to summarize and analyze patients' baseline&#xD;
           characteristics, safety and other indicators during the trial (including treatment&#xD;
           interruption/termination, lifestyle assessment, concomitant medication, etc.).&#xD;
           Multi-variant method is employed to analyze the effect of demographics and other factors&#xD;
           on primary results. All details of statistical analysis are shown in the separate&#xD;
           'Statistical Analysis Plan'(SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size calculation for the primary endpoint of HPS rate 30 days post CAS&#xD;
           procedure is based on the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two-tailed superiority test a = 0.05 Power = 90% Randomization ratio is 1 (staged&#xD;
           angioplasty arm): 1 (routine single-stage CAS arm) The rate of HPS rate was expected to&#xD;
           be 0.16 per subject during the procedure in the regular CAS arm for high hyperperfusion&#xD;
           risk patients based on previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rate of HPS rate was presume to be 0.02 per subject during the procedure in the&#xD;
           staged CAS arm for high hyperperfusion risk patients depended on the study by Yoshimura,&#xD;
           Kyung Mi Lee and us.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 150 subjects were estimated to be required. Given the above assumptions, a&#xD;
           sample size of 150 (75 Staged CAS: 75 regular CAS) will be required. To account for an&#xD;
           estimated 5% dropout rate, approximately 158 patients will be enrolled. Of these 158&#xD;
           patients, 79 will be randomized to the Staged CAS arm and 79 will be randomized to the&#xD;
           regular CAS arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size calculation was performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS&#xD;
           Institute).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collection of data during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nerve function evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NIHSS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mRS&#xD;
