    <textblock>
      This research trial studies molecular features and pathways in predicting drug resistance in&#xD;
      patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      and who are receiving enzalutamide. Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory&#xD;
      from patients receiving enzalutamide may help doctors learn more about molecular features and&#xD;
      pathways that may cause prostate cancer to be resistant to the drug.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the correlations between baseline molecular features and pathways and&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (&lt;/&gt;= 50% decline) at 12 weeks versus (vs.)&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (defined as time from day 1 of study drug treatment to date of&#xD;
      radiographic progression or clinical progression), disease-specific survival (defined as the&#xD;
      time from day 1 of study drug to date of death from prostate cancer), and overall survival&#xD;
      (defined as time from day 1 of study drug treatment to date of death from any cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and time&#xD;
      to PSA progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify molecular features and cellular pathways present in tumors from men with&#xD;
      metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that are progressing despite&#xD;
      enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore correlation between baseline molecular features and pathways and objective&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and degree&#xD;
      of PSA decline at 12 weeks and maximal PSA decline observed while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and time on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess correlations between cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) molecular features&#xD;
      from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess correlations between cfDNA molecular features and endpoints in the primary and&#xD;
      secondary objectives listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore correlations with baseline molecular features and tissue histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore correlations with baseline tissue histology and PSA change, time to PSA&#xD;
      progression, time on treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples at baseline, during administration of&#xD;
      enzalutamide, and after the time of disease progression for analysis via&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, comparative genome hybridization, and sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;
