  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades there has been a notable increase in the use of a range of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy procedures - colonoscopy particularly -, more so in recent years with the&#xD;
      implementation of colorectal cancer screening programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy can cause discomfort and even pain. In order to reduce these effects and&#xD;
      facilitate the procedure, patients are usually administered iv sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have assessed the impact of sedation on patient discomfort and anxiety, on&#xD;
      the undesirable effects of the colonoscopy, and even on certain aspects relating to its&#xD;
      scientific and technical quality. There have not, however, been any studies evaluating the&#xD;
      effects of sedation on the overall quality of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall quality of every medical act can be defined according to four dimensions:&#xD;
      accessibility, or how easily the patient can obtain the assistance required without physical&#xD;
      or bureaucratic barriers; scientific and technical quality, or the provision of the best&#xD;
      possible assistance with the most up-to-date knowledge and technical resources; perceived&#xD;
      quality, or the patient's degree of satisfaction with the care provided; and safety, or the&#xD;
      absence of undesirable side effects. Doctors have typically assessed the quality of a&#xD;
      procedure based on its scientific and technical quality and its safety. The investigators&#xD;
      have strived to conduct good, complication-free techniques based on cutting-edge scientific&#xD;
      knowledge, but have often overlooked the other dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the impact of the use of sedation on the overall quality of the&#xD;
      colonoscopy, therefore addressing each and every one of its dimensions, namely: scientific&#xD;
      and technical quality, perceived quality and safety. Since sedation during the procedure has&#xD;
      no impact on accessibility, the study will not assess this dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective case-control study. The study will include consecutive ambulatory patients&#xD;
      referred to our Endoscopy Unit for a first-time colonoscopy. Patients will be excluded when&#xD;
      they have had previous colonoscopies, have an anesthetic risk above ASA III (American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesia classifications) allergy to the drugs used or if they are undergoing&#xD;
      antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy contraindicated for the procedure, pregnant woman and&#xD;
      patients unable to understand the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion demographic data, clinical background and indication for the colonoscopy&#xD;
      will be collected on each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter patients will be randomly assigned to colonoscopy without sedation or with&#xD;
      conscious sedation with iv midazolam and fentanyl dosed according to age, weight and baseline&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures will be conducted by four endoscopists with ample experience in endoscopy and&#xD;
      sedation (over 7000 colonoscopies each).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collected during the endoscopy will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The degree of cleanliness of the colon according to the Boston scale; defined as&#xD;
                the adequate preparation of at least 2 points in each region of the colon);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Whether or not colonoscopy is completed up to the cecum;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Time needed for insertion up to the cecum and for withdrawal;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The complications that might arise during the procedure and recovery period (early&#xD;
                complications). To this end, patients' oxygen saturation and heart rate will be&#xD;
                continuously monitored from the beginning of the procedure until their discharged&#xD;
                and their blood pressure will be taken every 5 minutes. Non-sedated patients will&#xD;
                be discharged from the Unit immediately after the procedure, and sedated patients&#xD;
                when they reach a score of 9 or 10 on the Aldrete scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Adenomas resected, based on pathology reports. All of the biopsies will be examined&#xD;
                by a pathologist specialized in gastrointestinal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thirty days after the Endoscopy, patients will be interviewed by telephone by staff with&#xD;
           no involvement in the study (call center) and asked to respond to two questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The ASGE (American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) endoscopy satisfaction&#xD;
                survey (GHAA 9-me), previously translated into Spanish and validated by our team.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A survey on complications suffered in the 30 days following the procedure (late&#xD;
                complications), previously used in earlier studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of quality criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Six indicators will be used to assess the scientific and technical quality of each&#xD;
                procedure. The first three will assess their technical aspects: percentage of&#xD;
                colonoscopies completed up to the cecum; time required to reach the cecum; and&#xD;
                withdrawal time. The remaining three are results indicators: percentage of patients&#xD;
                with adenomas; total number of adenomas per patient; and total number of advanced&#xD;
                adenomas. These indicators were previously validated in our setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Since the use or not of sedation during the procedure does not affect the&#xD;
                cleanliness of the colon, this indicator will be used as a control variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Perceived quality will be assessed using the ASGE (American Society of&#xD;
                Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) satisfaction survey, previously translated into Spanish&#xD;
                and adapted and validated. Total scores, scores for the procedure (item 7 on the&#xD;
                survey) and the number of patients rating the procedure &quot;excellent&quot; will be&#xD;
                analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Safety will be assessed following the same method used in previous research,&#xD;
                analyzing early complications (those occurring during the procedure and recovery&#xD;
                phase) and late complications (those occurring in the 30 days after the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. Comparisons between groups will be&#xD;
      performed using the Chi-squared test for ordinal variables and Student's t-test for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. Results with a p value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Logistic regression will be used to determine the impact of sedation on the&#xD;
      quality indicators studied.&#xD;
