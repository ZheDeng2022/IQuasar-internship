    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, randomized, 2-stage crossover study consisting of&#xD;
      2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence), with an Extension Stage II - Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (Food Effect) with an Extension&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 60 subjects in stage I and 60 subjects in stage II with&#xD;
      hematologic or solid tumor malignancies, excluding gastrointestinal tumors and tumors that&#xD;
      have originated or metastasized to the liver for which no standard treatment exists or have&#xD;
      progressed or recurred following prior therapy. Subjects must not be eligible for therapy of&#xD;
      higher curative potential where an alternative treatment has been shown to prolong survival&#xD;
      in an analogous population. Approximately 23 sites in the US and 2 in Canada will participate&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

      Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study days based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Sequence 1: 2x150 mg tablets followed by 1x30 mg tablet. Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg&#xD;
      tablet followed by 2x150 mg tablets. Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48&#xD;
      hours apart between PK dosing day 1 and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days&#xD;
      under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II - Pharmacokinetics (Food Effect)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two PK study days&#xD;
      based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Sequence 1: 1x300 mg tablet under fasted condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under&#xD;
      fed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg tablet under fed condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under&#xD;
      fasted condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48 hours apart between PK dosing day 1&#xD;
      and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days. The sponsor will generate the&#xD;
      randomization scheme and assign subjects upon enrollment to the appropriate sequence for&#xD;
      dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasted condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will ingest oral&#xD;
      Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast for a minimum of 4&#xD;
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except&#xD;
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after oral Azacitidine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fed condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and following the performance&#xD;
      of all required pre-dose assessments, subjects randomized to receive test medication in a fed&#xD;
      state will begin ingesting a breakfast meal 30 (±5) minutes prior to the planned&#xD;
      administration of oral Azacitidine. They will continue the entire meal within 20 to 25&#xD;
      minutes (no less than 20 minutes) from the time the meal is served. Subjects will then ingest&#xD;
      oral Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast a minimum of 4&#xD;
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except&#xD;
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of oral Azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase (for subjects who have completed PK Stage I or Stage II) Subjects continuing&#xD;
      beyond the pharmacokinetics phase (Stage I or Stage II) will enter the extension phase of the&#xD;
      study at the discretion of the investigator to receive &lt; 6 (four-week) cycles of Vidaza 75&#xD;
      mg/m2 IV or SC daily for 7 days in the clinic and repeat every 4 weeks per prescribed label&#xD;
      at the discretion of the investigator for ≤ 6 (four-week) cycles.&#xD;

                  lifestyle of the patient. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;

             study drug and/or predispose the subject to an increased risk of gastrointestinal&#xD;
             toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that&#xD;
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
