      The objectives of this exploratory study are to (1) evaluate the effect of the multivitamin&#xD;
      multimineral with phytonutrient product vs. placebo on heart health risk factors following&#xD;
      twice-daily consumption for eight weeks; (2) To test the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      multivitamin multimineral with phytonutrient product vs. placebo following twice-daily&#xD;
      consumption for eight weeks.&#xD;

      More and more evidence shows the benefit of fruit and vegetable intake on the maintenance of&#xD;
      good health throughout the lift span. Unfortunately, many people in developed and developing&#xD;
      societies do not eat a diet with the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables. Because&#xD;
      of this, prevalence of chronic disease increases rapidly in worldwide as well as the burden&#xD;
      on the health care system. Therefore, promoting healthy lifestyle and dietary behavior&#xD;
      becomes a critical approach in preventing chronic disease development. According to results&#xD;
      from the Moscow Behavioural Risk Factor Survey performed from 2000-2001 found that mean fruit&#xD;
      and vegetable intake in men and women in Moscow was 190 grams per day, much lower than the&#xD;
      World Health Organization's recommended 400 grams per day. This lower than recommended intake&#xD;
      would correlate to a lower intake of phytonutrients and antioxidants and may be associated&#xD;
      with higher risks for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. In&#xD;
      this study, we are particularly interested in understanding whether a multivitamin&#xD;
      multimineral with phytonutrient product can improve nutritional status and reduce heart&#xD;
      health risk factors in Russian population with low fruit and vegetable intake. This study is&#xD;
      conducted in Russia Institute of Nutrition (ION) clinic, which has 200 beds and outpatients&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
