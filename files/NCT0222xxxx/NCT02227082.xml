  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of breast cancer patients receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy improves both locoregional control and overall survival. In most patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer the locoregional recurrence rate (LRR) is low, however still high LRRs are&#xD;
      found in certain patient groups, especially in locally advanced, inflammatory and triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer. Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug&#xD;
      for homologous recombination (HR) defected tumors and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy is expected to improve&#xD;
      locoregional control and thereby overall survival in both breast cancer patients with a high&#xD;
      probability of locoregional recurrence and patients with HR deficient tumors. However, this&#xD;
      combination treatment has never been tested in humans before. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of radiotherapy to the breast and regional lymph nodes&#xD;
      with concurrent olaparib.&#xD;
