  <brief_summary>

      To improve the sensitivity and specificity of immunoassay, the developing trends are to lower&#xD;
      the detection threshold and to minimize the cross reaction. A new assay technology called&#xD;
      immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) has been developed for rapid and on-site assay with small&#xD;
      volume of sample. Rapid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a clinical and&#xD;
      operational priority in busy emergency departments (ED), early and correct diagnosis is&#xD;
      important. Cardiac enzymes (including CPK/CK-MB, troponins, myoglobulin) and&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) in combination with the medical history and physical examination&#xD;
      are at present the diagnostic cornerstones. Novel biomarkers that rise earlier, have good&#xD;
      diagnosis accuracy and have additional prognostic information are highly needed. The&#xD;
      combination of multiple biomarker assays (markers of myocardial injury, inflammation/plaque&#xD;
      ruptures or heart failure with different mechanism) may increase clinical sensitivity and&#xD;
      improve early risk stratification. The present study, a rapid IMR assay with multiple&#xD;
      biomarkers is proposed and we will examine the performance of this new investigational IMR&#xD;
      assays, comparison with current commercial assays.&#xD;

      To improve the sensitivity and specificity of immunoassay, the developing trends are to lower&#xD;
      the detection threshold and to minimize the cross reaction. A new assay technology called&#xD;
      immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) has been developed for rapid and on-site assay with very small&#xD;
      volume of sample (i.e. less than 1ml whole blood). The reagent is a solution of homogeneously&#xD;
      dispersed magnetic nanoparticles, which are coated with hydrophilic surfactants and&#xD;
      bioprobes. Under external multiple alternating-current (ac) magnetic fields, magnetic&#xD;
      nanoparticles oscillate with the multiple ac magnetic fields via magnetic interaction. The&#xD;
      reagents under the external multiple ac magnetic fields show a magnetic property, called&#xD;
      mixed-frequency ac magnetic susceptibility χac. Magnetic nanoparticles bind with the&#xD;
      bioprobes on the outmost shell and become larger or clustered. The χac of the reagent is&#xD;
      reduced, and the concentration of the biomolecules can be measured quantitatively. Several&#xD;
      papers have demonstrated that IMR can be applied to assay proteins, viruses, chemicals, and&#xD;
      nucleic acids once suitable bioprobes are immobilized onto the magnetic nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a clinical and operational priority in&#xD;
      busy emergency departments (ED). Since ACS is associated with a significant mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, early and correct diagnosis is of great importance. Chest pain is a frequent&#xD;
      symptom in medical emergency departments and distinguishing patients with ACS within the&#xD;
      chest pain group is a diagnostic challenge. Cardiac enzymes (including CPK/CK-MB, troponins,&#xD;
      myoglobulin) and electrocardiography (ECG) in combination with the medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination are at present the diagnostic cornerstones. Different cardiac enzymes&#xD;
      are released after myocardial cell disintegration and are markers of cell necrosis, which&#xD;
      might not be detected immediately after chest pain; and repeated measurements are suggested.&#xD;
      Therefore novel biomarkers that rise earlier, have good diagnosis accuracy and have&#xD;
      additional prognostic information are highly needed. Some publications address the potential&#xD;
      benefit of the combination of multiple biomarker assays (markers of myocardial injury,&#xD;
      inflammation/plaque ruptures or heart failure with different mechanism) could substantially&#xD;
      increase clinical sensitivity and improve early risk stratification. However, this approach&#xD;
      is rather time-consuming and not cost-effect. In the present study, a rapid IMR assay with&#xD;
      multiple biomarkers is proposed and we will examine the performance of this new&#xD;
      investigational IMR assays, comparison with current commercial assays.&#xD;
