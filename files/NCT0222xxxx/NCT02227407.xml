      Ambulation would bring many physiological and psychological benefits and getting up and&#xD;
      walking has been a dream for paraplegia patients.The reciprocating gait orthoses (RGOs) for&#xD;
      paraplegics particularly draws research attentions because it mimics human gait pattern.But,&#xD;
      the high energy consumption and low walking speeds caused the frequent abandonment or the low&#xD;
      utilization of the reciprocating gait orthoses.To improve the design reducing the energy&#xD;
      expenditure, it requires biomechanical analysis of the pathological gait such that the gait&#xD;
      deviations and energy consuming mechanisms can be identified and remedial means can be&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypotheses will include that there would exist an energy saving mechanism&#xD;
      of human reciprocating locomotion based on the principle of conservation of mechanical&#xD;
      energy.Secondly, kinematic and kinetic gait determinants could be derived from the energy&#xD;
      saving mechanism. Finally, the control of knee joint coordinating with the hip joint&#xD;
      movements would facilitate the gait progression and further reduce the energy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the gait of paraplegic patients with&#xD;
      reciprocating gait orthoses and to support the investigators research in biomechanical&#xD;
      analysis, design and control of reciprocating gait orthoses for paraplegia patients. An&#xD;
      experiment to study the pathological gait of paraplegia patients with an existing&#xD;
      reciprocating gait orthosis will be carried out.&#xD;

      Background: Ambulation is a rehabilitation priority for many paraplegic patients, either for&#xD;
      the psychological reasons or with the aim to achieve partial or full independence. It also&#xD;
      provides the therapeutic benefits which are widely acknowledged to improve urinary drainage,&#xD;
      to improve peripheral circulation, and to prevent the complication caused from bedridden,&#xD;
      such as contracture, osteoporosis, urinary tract infection, and constipation etc. Some&#xD;
      studies also found that ambulation will increase cardiopulmonary function. For those&#xD;
      pediatric spinal cord-injured patients, the upright posture also profits the development of&#xD;
      trunk and head control. There are a number of reciprocating gait orthoses (RGOs) available in&#xD;
      practice for paraplegics, the problems of which have been slow, heavy and high&#xD;
      energy-consumption. The biomechanical causes are not fully understood. Despite all the&#xD;
      benefits that RGOs can offer, research and clinical experience indicated that most paraplegia&#xD;
      patients choose wheelchair mobility after discharge to the community because it is faster,&#xD;
      safer and needs less energy expenditure. Therefore, a biomechanical study of the pathological&#xD;
      gait of paraplegia patients with RGOs is critically needed. The problems of currently applied&#xD;
      RGOs need to be analyzed and remedial means to be proposed. In addition, a new RGOs system is&#xD;
      also needed to serve as a research tool and a platform proving the remedial ideas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature Review: There are many kinds of gait orthoses prescribed for paraplegics, which&#xD;
      can be grouped according to the patterns of propulsion. The first type is a group of&#xD;
      swing-through gait orthoses which include the Knee-Ankle-Foot orthoses (KAFO),&#xD;
      Hip-Knee-Ankle-Foot orthoses (HKAFO), and the parapodium. The swing-through gait has high&#xD;
      energy cost and users give up the orthoses easily. Swivel walkers belong to the second group,&#xD;
      which enables paraplegic patients to ambulate in an upright position without the use of&#xD;
      crutches or other walking aids. Patients progress by shifting the center of gravity; and&#xD;
      increase the walking speed by swing their arms and by the rotation of the trunk. Loretta et&#xD;
      al. compared the swivel gait with the swing gait, which shows the swivel gait has slower&#xD;
      speed but more efficient gait which implies that lower metabolic cost and oxygen consumption&#xD;
      are needed. Although the swivel walker has the advantages of providing low energy and&#xD;
      hand-free walking, it was most criticized for its low walking speed and for its inability to&#xD;
      ambulate on an uneven surface. The third one is a group of reciprocating gait orthoses which&#xD;
      were developed with a belief that they would provide a more energy efficient gait than other&#xD;
      gait orthoses. The LSU RGOs developed in the early 1980's has hip joints that are linked to&#xD;
      act in a reciprocal pattern. In the early 1990s, there were two revised version of the LSU&#xD;
      RGOs developed, ARGOs (Advanced RGOs using one cable and IRGOs (Isocentric RGOs) using a&#xD;
      solid rocker bar. The hip guidance orthosis (HGOs) that provides friction-free hip joint also&#xD;
      allows patients to walk reciprocally. WO, walkabout orthosis, is an infraperineal structure&#xD;
      that also facilitates reciprocating walking. Comparing with HKAFO, RGOs was heavier, slower,&#xD;
      and the energy cost (mL/kg/m) was higher although the energy consumption rate (mL/kg/min) was&#xD;
      significantly higher for children in HKAFOs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve an efficient gait and to overcome the problem to be slow, the hybrid system, that&#xD;
      is the combination of the FES and RGOs , had shown the possibility for improvement. Because&#xD;
      this system used both the RGOs structural stability and muscle power stimulated by FES to&#xD;
      decrease the activity of the trunk muscles in prevention from fatigue, it can provide more&#xD;
      energy-efficient gait that increases the aerobic-anaerobic threshold of the patients in the&#xD;
      long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many orthotic options for paraplegia are available but only to provide limited walking&#xD;
      functions with great energy consumption, which has been the reason for the frequent&#xD;
      abandonment or the low utilization of the RGOs. To improve the design reducing the energy&#xD;
      expenditure, it requires biomechanical analysis of the pathological gait such that the gait&#xD;
      deviations and energy consuming mechanisms can be identified and remedial means can be&#xD;
      implemented. There has been a recent research on the biomechanical analysis of an ARGOs&#xD;
      user's gait and some possible mechanisms contributing to the high energy consumption were&#xD;
      discussed. However, no further remedial action in terms of design parameters was suggested in&#xD;
      their work. It is obvious that more research on the biomechanical study are needed to advance&#xD;
      the development of orthotic solutions for paraplegia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait determinants were to identify the sources which affect the energy expenditure. The&#xD;
      determinants include pelvic rotation, pelvic list, knee flexion at mid-stance, foot and ankle&#xD;
      motion, knee motion and lateral pelvic displacement. There were studies to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of these kinematic gait determinants on reduction of the vertical displacement of the&#xD;
      Body Center of mass (BCOM). Gard and Childress found that the magnitude of the trunk's&#xD;
      vertical excursion was virtually unaffected by pelvic list. Kerrigan pointed out the there&#xD;
      are other primary gait determinants needed to explain the actual reduction in BCOM vertical&#xD;
      displacement. A reduction of BCOM vertical excursion may have significant energy&#xD;
      implications, but it requires kinetic consideration to prove the gait determinants do affect&#xD;
      the energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinetic consideration was given in studies to the analysis of mechanical energy emphasizing&#xD;
      the exchange between potential and kinetic energy. A study of normal subjects suggested a&#xD;
      greater exchange between potential and kinetic energy near individually preferred walking&#xD;
      speeds. Since it was previously found that the self-selected speed minimizes the energy cost,&#xD;
      it can be readily induced that the normal gait with lower energy cost implies a greater&#xD;
      conservation of mechanical energy, i.e., a greater exchange between potential and kinetic&#xD;
      energy. It remains unclear as to what roles the gait determinants play in conserving the&#xD;
      mechanical energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, joint biomechanics in the dynamic coordination particularly could never be&#xD;
      overemphasized when the energy consumption during ambulation is concerned. Gait efficiency in&#xD;
      terms of energy cost for ankle fusion patients reached 90% but the hip fusion patients&#xD;
      achieved only a 53% gait efficiency. The ankle fusion does not require major compensatory&#xD;
      movements in the gait pattern but only local substitutions in mid and forefoot areas were&#xD;
      observed. When the hip and the knee were disturbed, patients require pay in energy&#xD;
      consumption and compensatory substitutions for the lost function in the hip and the knee. It&#xD;
      implies that coordination of the knee and the hip has higher priority than the ankle and&#xD;
      human coordinating knee and hip movements could negotiate fairly well even with ankle&#xD;
      disturbance in walking to maintain energy consumption and speeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hybrid orthosis system (HOS) has been being studied for walking after spinal-cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI), which coordinates the mechanical locking and unlocking of knee and ankle joints of a&#xD;
      reciprocating gait orthoses, while propulsive forces are injected and unlocked joints&#xD;
      controlled with functional neuromuscular stimulation. A feasibility study was carried out for&#xD;
      a functional neuromuscular stimulation powered mechanical gait orthosis with coordinated&#xD;
      joint locking (stance control KAFO). A laboratory hybrid RGOs was developed using a HKAFO&#xD;
      which contains controllable friction brakes at both hip and knee joints. A&#xD;
      computer-controlled orthosis system has been developed to address the problems of rapid&#xD;
      muscle fatigue and poor movement control that are characteristic of FES-aided gait. However,&#xD;
      the theme was not on the hip and knee coordination. In order that the coordination of hip and&#xD;
      knee joints can be studied, a computer simulation and experiment validation are necessary.&#xD;
      Therefore, a research tool needs to be developed so that a study can be conducted on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the knee and hip coordination on the reduction of energy expenditure during&#xD;
      ambulation in paraplegia patients with reciprocating gait orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives: In this research, the investigators hypotheses will include that there&#xD;
      would exist an energy saving mechanism of human reciprocating locomotion based on the&#xD;
      principle of conservation of mechanical energy.Secondly, kinematic and kinetic gait&#xD;
      determinants could be derived from the energy saving mechanism. Finally, the control of knee&#xD;
      joint coordinating with the hip joint movements would facilitate the gait progression and&#xD;
      further reduce the energy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental equipments, devices and protocols: The patient evaluation, RGOs design and&#xD;
      fabrication, and fitting will be done under supervision of qualified orthotists in the&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center at National Taiwan University (NTURERC). A Cosmed&#xD;
      K4b2 portable gas analysis system will be used to acquire physiological measures such as&#xD;
      heart rates and oxygen consumption. A three dimensional motion measurement system (Optotrak®&#xD;
      Certus™, Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) with two position sensors, each&#xD;
      with three cameras, will be used to collect kinematic data. Twelve rigid bodies with active&#xD;
      markers will be attached on the segments of subjects of the left upper arms, thighs, shanks,&#xD;
      heels, and the pelvis and the trunk. Eight force plates (AMTI) will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      kinetics of the segments of the lower limbs when using assistance. Participants will be given&#xD;
      instructions for the experiment. Patient's medical data such as diagnosis, onset, birth date,&#xD;
      gender, height and weight will be taken and basic data of normal subjects' will be collected&#xD;
      as well. Paraplegic subjects will walk at their self selected speeds and complete at least&#xD;
      three trials. The kinematic and kinetic data will be collected synchronously. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to walk at their self selected speed for 30 meters along a designated route three&#xD;
      times in order to measure heart rates and oxygen consumption.&#xD;
