    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to obtain information about the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of BIIR 561 CL after continuous intravenous administration of two&#xD;
      increasing doses in healthy elderly volunteers, following the infusion schema of a loading&#xD;
      dose (1 hour) and a maintenance dose (5 hours)&#xD;
