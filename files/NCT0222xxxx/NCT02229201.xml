    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia and surgical stress during craniotomy can lead to brain damage and activation of&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Consequently inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL10) are released.&#xD;
      Cell mediated immune balance can increase postoperative complications (infections, wound&#xD;
      healing, multiple organ dysfunction). Many studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics&#xD;
      reduce systemic and local inflammatory response during major surgery, but animal studies have&#xD;
      shown that volatile anaesthetics can induce neuroinflammation (IL6, NF-κB) that leads to&#xD;
      decline of cognitive function in rodent and possible human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim was to investigate how anaesthetic technique for craniotomy influences the release of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines. Our hypothesis was that when optimal neuroprotective strategies are&#xD;
      followed during surgery intravenous anaesthesia attenuates inflammatory response comparing to&#xD;
      inhalational anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators included 40 patients anaesthetised with remifentanil based anaesthesia with&#xD;
      sevoflurane (S group) or propofol (P group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of IL6, IL8, IL10 were measured during preoperative, perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative periods of both groups of patients. The investigators also noted emergence&#xD;
      parameters, postoperative (pain, shivering, vomiting) and neurological complications after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthetic technique for craniotomy has to provide optimal cerebral perfusion, oxygenation&#xD;
      and prevent brain oedema (1). It also has to lower the stress response on pain during&#xD;
      intubation and surgical manipulation. Emergence from anaesthesia has to be rapid and smooth&#xD;
      to permit early postoperative neurological evaluation. The most likely opioid in the last&#xD;
      decade is short acting opioid remifentanil that can be easy titrated during the procedure and&#xD;
      provides early recovery (2, 3, 4, 5). Currently the propofol-remifentanil and&#xD;
      sevoflurane-remifentanil are the most frequently used combinations for craniotomy (6, 7).&#xD;
      Recently a multicentre study was published that did not show differences in early recovery&#xD;
      between three groups (propofol-remifentanil: TIVA, sevoflurane-remifentanil,&#xD;
      sevoflurane-fentanyl). Either technique provided optimal surgical conditions. The group&#xD;
      received TIVA had attenuated changes in stress biomarkers (cortizol in plasma and urine,&#xD;
      cateholamines. (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and surgical stress during craniotomy can lead to brain damage and activation of&#xD;
      inflammatory response (9, 10). Consequently inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL10) are&#xD;
      released. Cell mediated immune balance can increase postoperative complications (infections,&#xD;
      wound healing, multiple organ dysfunction). Many studies have shown that volatile&#xD;
      anaesthetics reduce systemic and local inflammatory response during major surgery (11, 12,&#xD;
      13, 14), but animal studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics can induce&#xD;
      neuroinflammation (IL6, NF-κB) that leads to decline of cognitive function in rodent and&#xD;
      possible human (15,16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim was to investigate how anaesthetic technique for craniotomy influences the release of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines. Our hypothesis was that when optimal neuroprotective strategies are&#xD;
      followed during surgery intravenous anaesthesia attenuates inflammatory response comparing to&#xD;
      inhalational anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of IL6, IL8, IL10 were measured during preoperative, perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative periods of both groups of patients. The investigators also noted emergence&#xD;
      parameters, postoperative (pain, shivering, vomiting) and neurological complications after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the operating room, the patients were randomly assigned to either Group P or&#xD;
      Group S. Randomisation was done according to computer-generated order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were on a regimen of dexamethasone 4x4mg/day with the first dose given at least&#xD;
      one day before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After arriving to the operating room the standard monitoring was instituted. An arterial&#xD;
      catheter was placed in the radial artery to continuously monitor blood pressure. For extended&#xD;
      haemodynamic monitoring Vigileo system was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were premedicated with midazolam (2-3 mg i.v.) and ondansetron (4-8 mg i.v.).&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis with intravenous cefazolin 2g/100 ml 0.9% NaCl was invariably used in&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia induction in Group P was performed with propofol (Propoven, Fresenius Kabi) and&#xD;
      in Group S with sevoflurane (Sevorane, Abbott Laboratories). Before intubation all patients&#xD;
      received remifentanil (Ultiva, GlaxoSmithKline) and rocuronium (Esmeron, MSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intubation, patient's lungs were ventilated mechanically, with 1:2 oxygen-air mixtures&#xD;
      in P and S group. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Anaesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained by continuous infusion of propofol 4-6 mg/kg/h in the P group and with sevoflurane&#xD;
      0,8-1 MAC in the S group. Remifentanil was adjusted regarding to anaesthesia response (0.1 -&#xD;
      2 μg/kg/min). The depth of anaesthesia was measured by a bispectral index (BIS) monitor; BIS&#xD;
      values were maintained at 40-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For haemodynamic management the following algorithm was used: continuous infusion of 0.9%&#xD;
      NaCl 6 mL kg-¹ for the first hour, followed by 2.5 ml kg-¹h-¹ . If CI &lt; 2 L/min/m2and SVV &gt;&#xD;
      10%, 6% hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi) until SVV-10% ; if there is no&#xD;
      improvement after 250 ml 6% HES-a, ephedrine (0.5% Efedrin, UMC Ljubljana Pharmacy) 5-10 mg&#xD;
      iv or fenilefrin 50-100 μg (0.01%, UMC Ljubljana Pharmacy). If CI &lt; 2 L/min/m2, SVV &lt; 10% and&#xD;
      heart beat &lt; 40/min, atropine 0,5 mg. If the mean arterial pressure increases by more than&#xD;
      30% and the heart rate by more than 30% from baseline, the infusion of remifentanil is&#xD;
      increased. Any adverse hemodynamic events that did not respond to changes in anaesthetic&#xD;
      regimen could be managed with urapidil or metoprolol, as appropriate. Hypotension following&#xD;
      blood losses was maintained with colloids (6% HAES) and blood replacement. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters were monitored continuously at 5-min intervals from the beginning of induction&#xD;
      until the patients were discharged from the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 minutes before the end of the surgery (at the time of dura closer) piritramid 5-10 mg was&#xD;
      administered. Continuous intravenous infusion of piritramid was started postoperatively as&#xD;
      patient control analgesia (PCA). The time of the operation was determined as the time from&#xD;
      pin head-holder placement to its removal. The time from the end of the operation to the&#xD;
      tracheal extubation was also noted. All patients were extubated in the operating theatre and&#xD;
      then transferred to the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the patients stayed in the recovery room for one hour and were then&#xD;
      transferred to the intensive care unit of the Department of Neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard postoperative monitoring generally used in these procedures was implemented. Oxygen&#xD;
      titrated to the lowest level needed to achieve the target arterial oxygen saturation of 96%,&#xD;
      was administered via a Venturi mask. Post anaesthetic adverse events and medication in ICU&#xD;
      were recorded for a period of 24 h after anaesthesia. Adverse events were defined as any&#xD;
      unintended changes in body function or well being, such as hypertension, postoperative nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting, pain, neurological complications, in particular if clinical intervention or&#xD;
      drug therapy was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay was also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomised single centre study was conducted at the Department of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care and at the Department of Neurosurgery, in close&#xD;
      cooperation with the Department of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University Medical&#xD;
      Centre Ljubljana. The investigators included 40 patients anaesthetised with remifentanil&#xD;
      based anaesthesia with sevoflurane (S group) or propofol (P group). The study was approved by&#xD;
      the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia. All the procedures were&#xD;
      performed in accordance with Helsinki declaration. The written informed concern was obtained&#xD;
      from all included patients. The patients included in the study were given anaesthesia by the&#xD;
      same anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data recorded included demographic characteristics, time of surgery, time to extubation,&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood samples for the determinations of cytokines (IL 6, IL 8, IL 10) were drawn at&#xD;
      the following time points: 1. before induction, 2. During tumor resection 3. at the end of&#xD;
      the surgery, and 4. 24 hours after surgery 5. 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyses of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-10 (IL-10),&#xD;
      blood samples were collected in tubes without additive. After centrifugation serum samples&#xD;
      were stored at -20 ºC until analysis. Analyses of samples were performed in one batch.&#xD;
      Chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Immulite analyzer; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,&#xD;
      Germany) was used to measure the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10.&#xD;
