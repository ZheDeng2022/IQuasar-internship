  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accelerated, normofractionated radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in stage II-III&#xD;
      laryngeal and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, twenty to thirty percent&#xD;
      of patients with stage II-III laryngeal and HPV negative oropharyngeal SCC develop disease&#xD;
      progression, mainly due to lack of locoregional control. Radiosensitizers such as cisplatin&#xD;
      and cetuximab are added to radiotherapy in more advanced stage of head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer.&#xD;
      These radiosensitizers improve loco-regional control and overall survival. Unfortunately, as&#xD;
      these radiosensitizers, notably cisplatin, also dose intensify the radiation dose in normal&#xD;
      tissues, they also significantly increase toxicity. Adding a more tumor-specific&#xD;
      radiosensitizing agent could improve loco-regional control and overall survival without&#xD;
      significantly increasing toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy kills tumor cells by inducing DNA damage. The efficacy of radiotherapy is&#xD;
      limited by the ability of tumor cells to repair this DNA damage. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) is an essential enzyme in base excision repair and single strand break DNA repair, DNA&#xD;
      lesions arising from radiation treatment. PARP inhibition and consequently the inhibition of&#xD;
      PARP-facilitated DNA repair enhances the anti-tumor activity of radiotherapy, as shown in&#xD;
      preclinical studies including head and neck xenograft studies. This radiosensitization is&#xD;
      thought to be proliferation dependent and is more pronounced in homologous recombination (HR)&#xD;
      deficient cells, providing an opportunity for tumor specific targeting. Genetic analyses&#xD;
      suggest that HR deficiency is commonly found in H&amp;N SCC: ATM loss has been reported in 60% of&#xD;
      human H&amp;N SCC biopsies and FANC-F defects were reported in 15-21% of human H&amp;N SCC biopsies&#xD;
      and cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of radiotherapy is also limited by tumor hypoxia, as tumor hypoxia results in&#xD;
      radioresistance. Some PARP inhibiting compounds increase tumor perfusion in xenograft models,&#xD;
      thereby reducing hypoxia and specifically sensitizing tumor cells to radiotherapy. Hypoxia is&#xD;
      commonly found in H&amp;N SCC and a high pre-treatment hypoxic fraction in H&amp;N SCC tumors is&#xD;
      associated with worse outcome. The high prevalence of both hypoxia and HR deficiencies in H&amp;N&#xD;
      SCC support the concept of tumor-specific radiosensitization by PARP inhibition in head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug for HR defected tumors&#xD;
      and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and radiotherapy. In humans, olaparib has a low toxicity&#xD;
      profile as a single agent, with increasing bone marrow toxicity when combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy for H&amp;N SCC is expected to improve&#xD;
      locoregional control and thereby overall survival. However, this combination treatment has&#xD;
      never been tested in humans before. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of radiotherapy for stage II-III laryngeal and stage II-III HPV-negative&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC with concurrent olaparib.&#xD;
