    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Identification of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques (with or without&#xD;
      neovascularization) using carotid CEUS is an independent predictor of MACE (over clinical&#xD;
      risk factors, stress echo wall motion results, and carotid ultrasound two-dimensional speckle&#xD;
      tracking strain indices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the diagnostic role of carotid CEUS and two-dimensional speckle tracking strain&#xD;
           imaging for detection of carotid plaque:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the feasibility and safety of Carotid CEUS and Two-dimensional speckle&#xD;
                tracking strain imaging SE .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if carotid CEUS and two-dimensional speckle tracking strain imaging&#xD;
                findings are associated with coronary angiographic results in those patients&#xD;
                undergoing clinically indicated cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in identifying a vulnerable&#xD;
                atherosclerotic plaque and neovascularization compared to carotid MRI, in a subset&#xD;
                of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the prognostic role of carotid CEUS and two-dimensional speckle tracking strain&#xD;
           imaging for prediction of MACE:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if plaque identification (with or without neovascularization) on&#xD;
                Carotid CEUS SE can improve the overall prediction of MACE over stress echo results&#xD;
                alone&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if Carotid ultrasound two-dimensional speckle tracking strain indices&#xD;
                can improve the overall prediction of MACE over stress echo results alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if the detection of plaque neovascularization by Carotid CEUS is an&#xD;
                independent predictor of MACE (over clinical risk factors, stress echo wall motion&#xD;
                results, and carotid ultrasound two-dimensional speckle tracking strain indices).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study. - Participating Site(s) (principal investigators in&#xD;
      parentheses) that will be enrolling patients will be: Mayo Clinic Rochester site (PI: Sharon&#xD;
      Mulvagh, MD). Only subjects who provide their informed consent will be included. Patients&#xD;
      will be prospectively identified at the time they present to the echocardiography laboratory&#xD;
      and scheduled to undergo exercise or dobutamine stress testing for the reason of known or&#xD;
      suspected CAD. The patients will undergo a carotid artery ultrasound with and without&#xD;
      contrast, carotid artery strain imaging and stress echo with contrast in same setting as&#xD;
      detailed in study flow chart. MRI will be performed in a subset of a randomly selected&#xD;
      patient (50 pts) to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in plaque identification. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up by reviewing electronic medical records (EMR) and/ or phone&#xD;
      contact using standardized approved questionnaire survey at 6 and 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
      ultrasound studies have been completed. The outcome is major adverse cardiac events (MACE)&#xD;
      including cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina pectoris, nonfatal&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Study eligibility criteria: age ≥ 18 years,&#xD;
      suspected or known to have CAD and referred to stress echo lab. Study Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
      Previous carotid surgery or angioplasty; Stroke, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      heart failure; other serious disease; Prior contraindication to contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Study Procedures: Carotid artery ultrasound (2D and CEUS) will be performed during the&#xD;
      resting phase of stress echocardiography in each patient. Transthoracic SE [exercise or&#xD;
      dobutamine] will be performed by an experienced sonographer/echocardiographer according to&#xD;
      the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.Imaging protocol: Commercially available ultrasound system (Vivid, GE Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with phased-array transducers, and contrast imaging technology&#xD;
      will be utilized. OptisonTM (GE Healthcare Inc., Princeton, NJ)] will be used for CEUS and&#xD;
      left ventricular opacification (LVO) for wall motion score index (WMSI). 2D carotid US,&#xD;
      carotid strain, CEUS and Contrast SE will be performed in succession. The contrast agent will&#xD;
      be administered per package insert guideline for dosing. The commercially available real time&#xD;
      coherent pulse imaging (CPI) low Mechanical index contrast imaging schemes will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard carotid ultrasound: Longitudinal and short axis images of each carotid artery&#xD;
           will be acquired and digitally stored for off line strain analysis. The short axis&#xD;
           images will be acquired 1.5 cm from the bifurcation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carotid CEUS: The contrast agent will be injected via a peripheral vein as a bolus per&#xD;
           package insert. The appearance of the contrast effect will be observed inside the lumen&#xD;
           of the carotid artery within 15-30 seconds after the injection. A real-time&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced carotid cine-loop (longitudinal and short axis) including images&#xD;
           obtained at least 3 seconds before and 5 minutes after the appearance of the contrast&#xD;
           effect in the lumen of the carotid artery, will be acquired and digitally stored for off&#xD;
           line analysis. The entire imaging session will be digitized and recorded on videotape&#xD;
           and digitally for subsequent offline analysis. All echocardiographic measures will be&#xD;
           made in a blinded fashion by a single observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MRI: 50 pts will be randomly selected to undergo Carotid MRI within the same episode of&#xD;
           care (+/- 4 weeks) to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in identifying a&#xD;
           vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque and neovascularization.The carotid imaging protocol&#xD;
           will involve a standard 2D carotid ultrasound imaging and CEUS imaging as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Trial Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identifiers for this study will be stored on a single electronic spreadsheet that is&#xD;
      password protected and stored on the Mayo EED network. Unique identifiers will be converted&#xD;
      to a study identifier (ID). Only the primary study investigator will have access to the&#xD;
      spreadsheet. The study ID numbers will be maintained on the statistical software spreadsheet&#xD;
      and stored on a password protected departmental server on the Mayo EED. Data will be entered&#xD;
      in statistical software for computer analysis, archiving and storage. All study data will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the study investigators to ensure complete data collection. All study data will&#xD;
      be used only for research purposes, and will not impact medical care and/or decision-making.&#xD;
      There will not be publication of any variable potentially involved with patient&#xD;
      identification. Patient confidentiality will be strictly protected. Trial variables will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographics and Labs:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age, gender, BMI Cardiovascular risk factor Symptom/disease duration (years) Medications&#xD;
           Laboratory Investigations including Lipids (µmol/L) hs-CRP (mg/L) (if available&#xD;
           clinically) BS or HbA1C (if diabetes mellitus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carotid imaging: Intima medial thickness (IMT) and plaque identification (2-D baseline)&#xD;
           Longitudinal and short axis images of each carotid artery will be obtained to measure&#xD;
           CIMT, defined as the distance from the leading edge of the lumen-intima interface to the&#xD;
           leading edge of the media-adventitia interface. The measurement region will be&#xD;
           approximately 1.5 cm distal to the carotid bulb. Atherosclerotic plaques will be defined&#xD;
           as lesions with a focal IMT ≥1.1 mm or more that protrude from the vessel wall into the&#xD;
           lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The plaque echogenicity will be assessed by Gray-Weale's (type I-V): type I: dominantly&#xD;
           echolucent plaque, with a thin echogenic cap; type II: predominantly echolucent lesions&#xD;
           with &lt;50% echogenic areas; type III: predominantly echogenic lesions with &lt;50%&#xD;
           echolucent areas; type IV: uniformly echogenic lesions; type V: plaques with heavy&#xD;
           calcification and acoustic shadows. Types I and II are as fatty plaques, types III and&#xD;
           IV are as mixed plaques and type V are as calcified plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strain imaging Measurements are performed offline on the workstation using Echo PAC&#xD;
           software (GE Healthcare Inc., Princeton, NJ). The media-adventitia interface of the&#xD;
           carotid arterial wall will be manually traced from a still frame image. The&#xD;
           circumferential and radial strain curves will be automatically obtained. Measurements of&#xD;
           the peak radial and circumferential strain, strain rate will be obtained. If carotid&#xD;
           plaque identified: An ROI (regional of interest) will be placed at the plaque 3&#xD;
           different regions: 2 shoulder regions and the fibrous cap top, the measurement results&#xD;
           of the peak longitudinal, radial and circumferential strain, strain rate will be&#xD;
           acquired by the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Carotid CEUS The enhancement of each plaque will be categorized by visual&#xD;
           interpretation, G0: no visible microbubbles within the plaque; G1: moderate microbubbles&#xD;
           confined to the shoulder and/or adventitial side of the plaque; or G2: extensive&#xD;
           microbubbles throughout the plaque, with clear visible appearance of bubble moving into&#xD;
           the plaque core. The quantitative of the enhancement of plaque will be analyzed by using&#xD;
           time-intensity curve. Quantitative parameters will be obtained: BI (baseline intensity),&#xD;
           PI (peak intensity) and EI (enhanced intensity: peak intensity/ baseline intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stress Echo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stress echo data analysis will be per the Mayo Clinic Echocardiography Laboratory&#xD;
           (Rochester MN) stress protocol and generated clinical report. The analysis utilizes the&#xD;
           American Heart Association/American Society of Echocardiography 17-segment model. Wall&#xD;
           motion is evaluated using previously established criteria (29) and rest and stress wall&#xD;
           motion score indexes (WMSIs) are calculated. Wall motion is assessed by scoring as&#xD;
           follows: 1=normal, 2=hypokinetic, 3=akinetic and 4=dyskinetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) validation subset: 50 pts will be randomly selected to&#xD;
           undergo Carotid MRI (per standard imaging protocol) within the same episode of care (+/-&#xD;
           4 weeks). The carotid MRI studies will be sent to Michigan State University via a secure&#xD;
           VPN or similarly secure transfer. The reader will be blinded to the clinical data. The&#xD;
           study will utilize a General Electric 3T scanner with dedicated carotid coils.&#xD;
           Multi-contrast carotid plaque sequences including 3D time-of-flight MR angiography&#xD;
           (TOF), a 3D black-blood sequence optimized to detect intraplaque hemorrhage (MPRAGE) and&#xD;
           pre-contrast black-blood T1 weighting (T1W). During bolus administration of a single&#xD;
           dose of gadolinium based contrast agent, a dynamic contrast enhanced MR study (DCE-MRI)&#xD;
           will be obtained as well post-contrast black-blood T1 weighted sequence (CE-T1W).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up by reviewing electronic medical records (EMR) and/ or phone&#xD;
      contact using standardized approved questionnaire survey at 6 and 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
      ultrasound studies have been completed. The outcome is defined as presence or absence of&#xD;
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including cardiac death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS),&#xD;
      unstable angina pectoris, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Power and sample size calculation: We use several published papers as reference for sample&#xD;
      size estimation. Odds ratio MACE rate Patient population Feinstein 2.5(1.1-6.1) 25%(37/147)&#xD;
      147 Kugiyama 2.52(1.42-4.38) 28%(84/304) 304&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited in these references were at high risk or had known CAD. Since our patients&#xD;
      will include a spectrum of CV risk, we have estimated the hazards ratio to be 1.5-3.0, and&#xD;
      MACE rate at 5-20%. Our statistical resource suggested a sample of 180 patients to provide&#xD;
      80% test power (2-tailed test with α of 0.05) to detect an association of plaque&#xD;
      neovascularization with MACE (HR 2.8, MACE RATE 20%). Anticipating ~20% F/U failure or&#xD;
      withdrawals, we inflated to a total of 216 patients. The primary endpoint is the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of cardiac death within 24 months followup. The secondary endpoint is composite&#xD;
      MACE. For the followup data, the missing data will be reported as missing, unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Statistical analysis Plan Baseline and demographic descriptive analysis including age,&#xD;
      gender, parity, weight, height, Body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA),&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, will be presented. Counts and percentages will be presented for&#xD;
      categorical variables, while means ±standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals will&#xD;
      describe continuous variables for which normality assumptions are met. If the distribution of&#xD;
      a continuous parameter is skewed, transformations will be considered, or medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges (IQR) will be presented. For all analysis we will use a two sided P&#xD;
      value less than 0.05 to be significant and all tests will be performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Cary, NC). Echo feasibility analysis will be evaluated by reporting the percentage&#xD;
      of the analyzable plaques and myocardial segments (for CEUS, WMSI and strain). Safety on the&#xD;
      use of Optison contrast agent will be also evaluated and reported as (%) of adverse events&#xD;
      (categorized as minor or serious adverse events). Measures of data will be reported as mean ±&#xD;
      SD for continuous variables (including quantitative parameters of contrast enhanced in the&#xD;
      plaque and quantitative parameters of strain). The intraplaque neovascularization will be&#xD;
      counted and displayed as percentage. After the SE and CEUS examination, patients will be&#xD;
      grouped as the result of SE and CEUS: group I: with plaque neovascularization and without&#xD;
      abnormal wall motion; group II: without plaque neovascularization and with abnormal wall&#xD;
      motion; group III: without plaque neovascularization and with abnormal wall motion; group IV:&#xD;
      with plaque neovascularization and with abnormal wall motion. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      compared between 2 groups using unpaired t-tests. For comparison of continuous variables in&#xD;
      ≥3 groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Scheffé test was performed.&#xD;
      Frequencies will be compared using Chi square analysis. The correlation between 2 continuous&#xD;
      variables will be determined using a linear regression analysis. The relationship between&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and the grade of plaque neovascularization will be examined using&#xD;
      multiple logistic regression analysis. Cox proportion hazard model is used to estimate the&#xD;
      hazard ratio of prediction of CV. The Kaplan-Meier method is used to calculate coronary&#xD;
      event-free survival in patients with and without intraplaque contrast material enhancement.&#xD;
      Intra- and interobserver agreement for assigning grade to plaque neovascularization will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the Cohen κ test. Observer reproducibility of parameters will be assessed by&#xD;
      using Bland-Altman in 20 randomly assigned patients, by two independent observers blinded to&#xD;
      clinical data. Intraobserver variability will be assessed in the same patients by the same&#xD;
      investigator in 2 occasions at least 1 month apart. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using JMP version 9 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
