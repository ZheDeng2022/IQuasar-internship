  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricle) known medically as Left Ventricular&#xD;
      Hypertrophy (LVH) is very common in patients with heart disease. This increases risk of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however&#xD;
      LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance&#xD;
      are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to&#xD;
      utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin&#xD;
      resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate&#xD;
      the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel&#xD;
      way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will&#xD;
      be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan&#xD;
      and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform non-invasive tests to&#xD;
      measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre trial designed to investigate the benefit, if any, of 12 month&#xD;
      metformin XL 2000mg/day treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 64 nondiabetic&#xD;
      participants with Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and insulin resistance (IR) and/or&#xD;
      prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen on seven occasions: screening, baseline/randomisation, 2 weeks post&#xD;
      randomisation, month 1, month 4, month 8 and final month 12, during which vital signs and&#xD;
      safety bloods will be performed. There will also be three telephone visits at: month 2, month&#xD;
      6 and month 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a screening visit an initial history will be performed following informed consent.&#xD;
      Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram (a painless ultrasound scan of the heart) in&#xD;
      the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded and blood tests to determine fasting insulin resistance index (FIRI), prediabetes&#xD;
      and routine safety, prior to metformin administration, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet all inclusion criteria will return for the randomisation visit within 4&#xD;
      weeks of screening where a Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI) scan will be performed&#xD;
      followed by randomisation to either Metformin XL or placebo in a double blind, randomised&#xD;
      fashion. Also, at this visit endothelial function tests will be performed to assess&#xD;
      peripheral blood vessels in the forearm, central obesity will be quantified using waist&#xD;
      circumference and waist to hip ratio (WHR) and study specific blood sampling performed (with&#xD;
      participant consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final visit or early withdrawal the following will be performed: vital signs, safety&#xD;
      bloods, study specific bloods (with participant consent), echocardiography, endothelial&#xD;
      function tests and cMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the active arm, therapy will be metformin XL in an initial dose of 1000mg/day (metformin&#xD;
      XL 500mg x2/day). Participants will continue on Metformin XL 500mg x2/day for two weeks,&#xD;
      following safety blood checks this dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day. If the higher dose&#xD;
      cannot be tolerated it will be reduced to 1000mg/day (or stopped if not tolerated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target dose of metformin XL at 2000mg/day was chosen based on a previous study of&#xD;
      metformin in nondiabetic heart failure patients with IR, this study demonstrated a beneficial&#xD;
      effect of metformin on insulin resistance, weight reduction and an improvement in submaximal&#xD;
      exercise. The study used the immediate release form of metformin (target of 1000 mg x2/day)&#xD;
      which was associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects resulting in 13%&#xD;
      withdrawal of study medication. For this reason we have selected metformin XR due to improved&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tolerability.&#xD;
