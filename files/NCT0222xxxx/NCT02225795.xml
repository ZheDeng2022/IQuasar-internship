    <textblock>
      This is a study for people with Crohn's Disease (CD) that are not responsive to standard&#xD;
      treatment. CD is a chronic disease with an auto-immune component that goes away and relapses&#xD;
      over the years and causes lifelong impairment of health and quality of life. Regardless of&#xD;
      the therapy used some patients remain seriously ill with active disease after multiple&#xD;
      therapeutic options have been exhausted. There is currently no drug that will cure CD. Drug&#xD;
      treatment is focused on controlling symptoms. Another treatment is to perform surgery but&#xD;
      again this does not lead to cure and is often linked to infection, short gut syndrome&#xD;
      problems and psycho-social and cosmetic issues. Therefore, a treatment that does not involve&#xD;
      surgery or long-term drug treatment may be beneficial especially to young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been of value in other auto-immune&#xD;
      diseases and it is possible that it could be of value in CD. This is a pilot study to&#xD;
      determine if HSCT is safe and effective for children and young adults with severe CD. For&#xD;
      this study the stem cells will come from the patient. This is called an autologous&#xD;
      transplant. The patient will undergo collection and storage of his/her peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells (PBSC). The patient will be given drugs to move (or mobilize) the stem cells from&#xD;
      his/her bone marrow into his/her blood where they will be collected on a machine called&#xD;
      apheresis (similar to dialysis.) The cells will be stored and given back to the patient about&#xD;
      1 month after collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) is an immunologically mediated chronic illness that has a relapsing and&#xD;
      remitting course, most commonly presenting in the 2nd or 3rd decade and causing lifelong&#xD;
      impairment of health and quality of life. Mainstay of clinical treatment for severe disease&#xD;
      is combination of anti-inflammatory agents like 5-aminosalicyaltes and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications like corticosteroids and newer anti-TNF antibodies like Infliximab. None of the&#xD;
      drugs are, at present, curative and a relevant subset of patients are refractory to many of&#xD;
      these pharmacologic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoablative treatment followed by autologous stem cell rescue (Autologous HSCT) has been&#xD;
      tried in this refractory group of patients with successful results. Autologous HSCT is&#xD;
      effective in this auto-immune setting through the eradication of effector/memory T-cell&#xD;
      clones due to a direct immuno-ablative effect of drugs used in the preparative regimen; by&#xD;
      leading to an immune-reset- recovering clones of T- cells from the infused stem cells do not&#xD;
      mount an auto- immune response and are tolerant to 'self' antigens and, by upregulation of T&#xD;
      regulatory cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ or CD8+ FOXP3+) via change in cytokine mileu during&#xD;
      transplant. Increased population of Tregs restricts the activity of self-reactive effector&#xD;
      T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to gain on the success of previously published adult studies of&#xD;
      autologous HSCT in refractory CD, with the aim to confirm the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of HSCT and post-transplant cyclophosphamide when given post-HSCT in pediatric&#xD;
      patients and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, this combination of immuno-ablative therapy with post-transplant cyclophosphamide has&#xD;
      not been extensively studied in children with CD, therefore transplant related mortality&#xD;
      (TRM) and severe toxicity (&gt; grade 3 toxicity by NCI criteria) will be monitored for 100 days&#xD;
      post-transplant in all the patients and stopping rules will be enforced in case of excessive&#xD;
      toxicity or TRM (&gt;10%). Clinical assessments will be done for 1 year post-HSCT for disease&#xD;
      activity, steroid free remission period to evaluate the 'clinical efficacy' of this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim of this pilot is to generate the preliminary safety data to confirm the&#xD;
      feasibility and benefit of autologous HSCT in children and young adults with refractory CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm, pilot study designed to estimate the feasibility, safety and benefit of&#xD;
      immunoablation with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using autologous stem&#xD;
      cells followed by administration of post-transplant cyclophosphamide for children and young&#xD;
      adults with refractory Crohn's disease (CD). The study population is patients with severe and&#xD;
      refractory Crohn's disease who are ≥10 and ≤ 30 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility and toxicity of immunoablation with HSCT and post-HSCT infusion&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with refractory Crohn's disease (CD). Death&#xD;
      (transplant related mortality, TRM) and severe non-hematologic toxicity (≥ grade 3 toxicity;&#xD;
      NCI Toxicity Criteria version 4.0) within the first 100 days after HSCT will be monitored to&#xD;
      meet this end-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are evaluations of incidence of HSCT related complications and&#xD;
      evaluations of response. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of viral reactivations - CMV and EBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of invasive fungal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immune reconstitution after HSCT lymphocyte subpopulations (absolute number of CD3, CD4,&#xD;
           CD8 and CD19 cells), immunoglobulin levels (IgG) and CD4+ CD25+ CD127+ regulatory T&#xD;
           cells (Treg) populations on day +30 , +60 , +100, day +180 and yearly post-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the efficacy and benefit of HSCT in this population at 1 year post HSCT, by&#xD;
           serial assessments of clinical activity of CD, assessment of disease severity- CDAI&#xD;
           scores and length of steroid free remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The HSCT and post-transplant cyclophosphamide regimen will be well tolerated with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity and will lead to &lt;10% transplant related mortality (TRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic illness that is immunologically mediated, of unknown&#xD;
      etiology, but probably induced by an exposure to intestinal bacteria or their component&#xD;
      antigens leading to an excessive T helper type 1 (TH-1) mediated chronic inflammation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract 1. Crohn's disease is a relapsing and remitting disorder most&#xD;
      commonly presenting in the 2nd or 3rd decade and causing lifelong impairment of health and&#xD;
      quality of life 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the therapy used some patients remain seriously ill with active disease after&#xD;
      multiple therapeutic options have been exhausted. In addition, patients with refractory&#xD;
      disease suffer from an inability to eat, frequent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition,&#xD;
      growth retardation, fistulae formation, abdominal pain and psychological distress, ileostomy&#xD;
      or colostomy, and multiple surgeries that may lead to short-gut syndrome, severely affecting&#xD;
      quality of life. Though not well characterized, a distinct excessive mortality exists in this&#xD;
      group of patients 3,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory CD have a higher mortality rate compared to normal population&#xD;
      (hazard ratio of 1.73); but deaths are usually related to surgical complications, liver&#xD;
      disease, infections and intestinal cancer in long term survivors 5. Even though the overall&#xD;
      mortality is low in this group of patients, they suffer from significant morbidity,&#xD;
      cortico-steroid side effects and poor quality of life and 50% patients with refractory&#xD;
      disease will need surgical interventions (ileostomy, colostomy) further affecting the&#xD;
      complications rate 2,3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many drugs have been used for controlling the symptoms of CD, but no drug is, at present,&#xD;
      curative and a relevant subset of patients are refractory to many pharmacologic approaches 6.&#xD;
      Almost all drugs employed in the advanced form of disease, such as immunosuppressives and&#xD;
      immunomodulators, have potential risks. Mainstay of clinical treatment is combination of&#xD;
      anti- inflammatory agents like 5-aminosalicyaltes and immunosuppressive medications like&#xD;
      corticosteroids4. Majority of the patients with severe refractory disease are treated with&#xD;
      anti- Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antibodies like Infliximab (Remicade), but limited options&#xD;
      exist for patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNF therapy7. Approximately 40% of&#xD;
      patients with CD develop intolerable side effects or fail to respond to anti-TNF therapy,&#xD;
      hence there is a significant population of this subset of patients where options are very&#xD;
      limited 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some symptoms may be controlled by prolonged steroids, but there are many known long term&#xD;
      effects of continued steroid use- muscle loss, osteopenia, cataracts and cushingoid habitus.&#xD;
      Majority of these patients enroll on other experimental Phase I/II drug trials or resort to&#xD;
      surgical intervention to control symptoms. Surgical approach (partial gut resection of the&#xD;
      inflamed segment with ileo-colostomy) is an option, but is associated with infection risk,&#xD;
      psycho-social and cosmetic issues and increased morbidity due to short gut syndrome,&#xD;
      especially in young adults. Increased mortality is also associated with surgical&#xD;
      interventions 2,3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, any intervention that avoids surgery or long term corticosteroids in young adults&#xD;
      may be beneficial. Given that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been of&#xD;
      some value in other auto-immune diseases characterized by loss of immune tolerance and or a&#xD;
      TH-1 predominant immune response, it is possible that these procedures could be of value in&#xD;
      CD 9,10. Autologous transplantation might also be of benefit because clearing the body of&#xD;
      committed lymphocyte clones might restore the patient to the status quo ante of being&#xD;
      predisposed to CD but not suffering from it 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of HSCT for CD&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSCT may provide benefit in auto-immune disease by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eradication of effector/memory T-cell clones due to a direct immuno-ablative effect of&#xD;
           drugs used in the preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immune-reset: recovering clones of T-cells from infused stem cells do not mount an&#xD;
           auto-immune response and are tolerant to 'self' antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Upregulation of T regulatory cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ or CD8+ FOXP3+) - by change in&#xD;
           cytokine mileu during transplant. Increased population of Tregs restricts the activity&#xD;
           of self-reactive effector T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Engraftment of uncommitted stem cells in the gut mucosa may lead to direct healing of&#xD;
           mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the effectiveness of HSCT in Crohn's disease Initial observations were made in&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease and hematologic malignancies. For patients who underwent HSCT&#xD;
      for their hematologic malignancy they had remission of their Crohn's disease 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported the clinical course of patients with Crohn's disease receiving&#xD;
      autologous transplantation for another condition. Perhaps the most interesting concerned a&#xD;
      patient who developed symptoms at the age of 9, who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 4&#xD;
      years later and who required substantial treatment over the next 7 years 13. Following&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma it was reported that there&#xD;
      was no clinical or laboratory evidence of recurrence of his Crohn's disease in the next 7&#xD;
      years. Another reported case of Crohn's disease had diffuse pan colitis before&#xD;
      transplantation and was asymptomatic (but had inflammation) at endoscopy 3 years later 14.&#xD;
      Another patient who had symptomatic Crohn's disease for 2 years and had undergone surgery was&#xD;
      free of disease 5 years after transplantation. Systematic colonoscopic evaluation showed&#xD;
      persisting subclinical inflammation initially with progressive clearance. At Vanderbilt we&#xD;
      performed an unrelated donor transplant for a patient with AML and Crohn's disease. He is&#xD;
      currently 10 years post-transplant with no symptoms of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSCT specifically for Crohn's disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report of stem cell transplantation for Crohn's disease concerned 2 patients from&#xD;
      the Chicago group 15. In both of the initial cases Crohn's disease activity index was more&#xD;
      than 250 (normal range &lt;150, pathological range 220 - 600) despite treatment with infliximab.&#xD;
      In both patients, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were mobilized using cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), enriched ex-vivo by CD 34+ selection.&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide and antithyomcyte globulin (ATG) were used for immune conditioning prior to&#xD;
      transplantation. The first patient was a 22 year old woman with a past history of a right&#xD;
      hemicolectomy with severe ileocolic Crohn's disease causing intractable diarrhea with 25&#xD;
      bowel actions per day, fistula and peri-anal sepsis. The second was a 16 year old boy who had&#xD;
      been unwell for 6 years requiring tube feeding and receiving methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine&#xD;
      and 5 amino acyclic acid with Crohn's colitis. In both of these cases, following&#xD;
      transplantation, diarrhea resolved and the Crohn's disease activity index normalized. In the&#xD;
      first patient the haemoglobin rose, whereas in the second it remained at a slightly&#xD;
      sub-normal level. Post-transplantation CRP was within normal limits and the albumin remained&#xD;
      or became normal. These cases were accompanied by extensive colonoscopic evidence of disease&#xD;
      activity. Prior to transplantation both cases had areas of severely active Crohn's disease&#xD;
      with cobble stoning, fissuring and deep ulceration. Following transplantation the bowel&#xD;
      remained abnormal though changes were much more trivial with superficial erosions only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oyama et al reported on autologous HSCT for 12 patients median age of 27 (15-38) with severe&#xD;
      refractory Crohn's disease 16. The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (200&#xD;
      mg/kg) and equine ATG (90 mg/kg). Eleven of 12 patients entered a sustained remission defined&#xD;
      by a CDAI &lt; 150. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months (range, 7-37 months), only one&#xD;
      patient has developed a recurrence of active CD, which occurred 15 months after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hasselbatt et al reported on autologous HSCT 12 patients (ages 24-50) with refractory Crohn's&#xD;
      disease using high dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) without ATG 17. PBSC harvest following&#xD;
      mobilization chemotherapy was successful in 11/12 patients and resulted in a clinical and&#xD;
      endoscopic improvement in 7/12 patients. Subsequent conditioning and autoPBSCT were performed&#xD;
      in nine patients and were relatively well tolerated. Among those, five patients achieved a&#xD;
      clinical and endoscopic remission within 6 months after autoPBSCT. However, relapses occurred&#xD;
      in 7/9 patients during follow-up, but disease activity could be controlled by low-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids and conventional immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 Burt et al reports on autologous HSCT in 24 patients with mean age of 24 years (range&#xD;
      15-52) with anti-TNF refractory Crohn's disease 18. Stem cells were mobilized from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood using cyclophosphamide (2.0 g/m2) and G-CSF (10 ug/kg/day), enriched ex vivo&#xD;
      by CD34 selection, and reinfused after immune suppressive conditioning with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (200 mg/kg) and either equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 90 mg/kg) or rabbit ATG (6 mg/kg).&#xD;
      Eighteen of 24 patients are 5 or more years after transplantation. All patients went into&#xD;
      remission with a CDAI less than 150. The percentage of clinical relapse-free survival defined&#xD;
      as the percent free of restarting CD medical therapy after transplantation is 91% at 1 year,&#xD;
      63% at 2 years, 57% at 3 years, 39% at 4 years, and 19% at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients in remission (CDAI &lt; 150), steroid-free, or medication-free at any&#xD;
      posttransplantation evaluation interval more than 5 years after transplantation has remained&#xD;
      at or greater than 70%, 80%, and 6% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Auto-immune disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are implicated in the suppression of immune responses and in&#xD;
      maintenance of tolerance 19,20. The percentage of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells (T regs) is&#xD;
      significantly decreased in patients with auto-immune diseases like SLE and Type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      20. Also, transfer of Treg can prevent auto-immune phenotype that develops after Treg&#xD;
      depletion in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During HSCT for auto-immune diseases, an increase in Treg population correlates with&#xD;
      remission induction. Zhang et.al has shown that HSCT leads to a newly generated population of&#xD;
      Treg cells that maintain patients in true immunological remission 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burt et.al, also evaluated the role of Treg cells in some of their patients who underwent&#xD;
      HSCT for CD. Before HSCT the mean % of Treg cells was significantly low in CD patients (2.62%&#xD;
      ± 2.01%), compared to normal volunteers (3.86% ± 1.67%). A robust increase in the % of Treg&#xD;
      was observed after HSCT, but this was not sustained over period of time and may have&#xD;
      contributed to relapses 18. Hence, there is clinical evidence that a sustained increase in&#xD;
      Treg population may maintain remission in patients with auto-immune disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the proposed Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to estimate the feasibility of HSCT and safety of post-HSCT&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide infusions for patients with refractory disease who have failed to respond to&#xD;
      Infliximab/and or other immunosuppressive agents. This is designed as a small pilot study&#xD;
      with built in 'stopping rules' in case of excessive toxicity or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the immuno-ablative regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of CY for mobilization: Cyclophosphamide (CY) will be used for mobilization of&#xD;
      peripheral stem cells and for immuno-ablation prior to HSCT. CY has been traditionally used&#xD;
      for mobilization in all HSCT for refractory CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (CY)- Recently, use of post-transplant CY has&#xD;
      been pioneered by John Hopkins and shown to be a very effective GVHD prophylaxis in patients&#xD;
      undergoing HSCT for hematologic malignancies, even in the setting of HLA mismatched and&#xD;
      haploidentical donors. Post-transplant delivery of CY allows for effective deletion of&#xD;
      proliferating allo-reactive T- cells that cause GVHD without adding to the toxicity of the&#xD;
      regimens 22. In a recent study by the Hopkins group post-transplant cyclophosphamide was&#xD;
      successfully used in patients with sickle cell disease undergoing haploidentical bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant with no toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have performed CD34+ stem cell selections to get rid of all immune-reactive T-&#xD;
      cells clones and use purified CD34+ infusions for regenerating the immune system 18. The&#xD;
      problem with this approach is delayed immune-reconstitution post-transplant and a higher&#xD;
      incidence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      European trials have used un-manipulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) as infusions&#xD;
      (without any T cell depletion or CD34+ selections) for SCT in auto-immune diseases 23. Since,&#xD;
      peripheral stem cells contain the same T cells clones that are immuno-reactive and are&#xD;
      infused along with the donor stem cells in non-T cell depleted infusion, this may be one of&#xD;
      the reasons for relapse in T cell replete HSCT done till date for CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to overcome the above-mentioned issues, we propose to use un-manipulated PBSCs,&#xD;
      but give two doses of CY pre- and two doses post-stem cell infusion to effectively deplete&#xD;
      the immuno-reactive T cell clones present in the autologous infusion and therefore, decrease&#xD;
      the incidence of relapse. The total dose of CY remains the same (200 mg/kg), therefore, it&#xD;
      will not add to the toxicity of the regimen, but may lead to more effective depletion of the&#xD;
      immune- reactive clones, obviating the need for costly in-vitro T cell depletions/CD34+&#xD;
      selections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, CY causes sustained depletion of all T cell subsets, but more profound depletion of&#xD;
      CD4+ CD25- subsets, resulting in relative enrichment of CD4+CD25+ cells, which we hope to&#xD;
      expand by using post-transplant cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme Corp, Cambridge, MA): will also be used for&#xD;
      effective immune-ablation and for in-vivo T cell depletion post- stem cell infusion. Rabbit&#xD;
      ATG will be used as this has been shown to promote the expansion of functional Tregs in-vitro&#xD;
      24. Rabbit ATG was use in the largest study by Burt et al 18.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All the subjects considered eligible for the study will be screened and reviewed by the&#xD;
        Gastroenterology (GI) physicians prior to enrollment (Dedrick Moulton, MD or his designee&#xD;
        at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital) 2. Age ≥ 10 and &lt; 30 years 3. Disease status:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's Disease: Diagnosis of Crohn's disease that has been&#xD;
             established based on typical endoscopic/histologic and/or radiological appearances.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active disease, defined as: Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) &gt;30 (see&#xD;
             Appendix I) or Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of &gt;250 (see Appendix II) at any&#xD;
             time within 3 months prior to enrollment and any one of the following- i. Endoscopic&#xD;
             evidence of active disease confirmed on histology within 3 months prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             or ii. Clear evidence of active small bowel Crohn's disease on small bowel imaging&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Refractory disease- Moderate to severe disease that has been unresponsive to current&#xD;
             or prior therapy with mercaptopurine and/or azathioprine (thiopurines), methotrexate&#xD;
             and anti-TNF therapy. Patients should have relapsing disease (i.e. ≥ 1&#xD;
             exacerbation/year) or corticosteroid dependence despite current or prior thiopurines,&#xD;
             methotrexate and anti-TNF maintenance therapy or clear demonstration of intolerance or&#xD;
             toxicity to these drugs. Patients who fail induction therapy with corticosteroids and&#xD;
             anti-TNF therapy, and are therefore not eligible to receive maintenance therapy with&#xD;
             thiopurines or methotrexate will also be candidates for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Negative stool culture, C. difficile, and negative CMV pcr (in stool or colonic&#xD;
             biopsy). Patients with CMV colitis will receive a trial of anti-viral treatment and&#xD;
             only responders will be considered eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients with a prior ileostomy or colostomy may enter the study. For this group of&#xD;
             patients', physician's global assessment will be used to assess clinical activity of&#xD;
             CD, as Pediatric CDAI and CDAI scoring method may not be representative of disease&#xD;
             activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patients with abscesses are eligible to enroll once the abscesses or any other&#xD;
             significant infection has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy or unwillingness to use adequate contraception during the study- if a woman&#xD;
             is of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Organ function criteria-&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Renal: creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73m2 (measured or estimated).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% by multigated radionuclide&#xD;
                  angiography (MUGA) or a shortening fraction of &lt; 25% by cardiac echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pulmonary Function tests: DLCO &lt; 30% or patient on oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Hepatic: serum bilirubin &gt; 3 mg%; AST and ALT &gt; 3x ULN for the institutional lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled Hypertension (using age based criteria) despite at least 2 anti-&#xD;
             hypertensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active Infection or risk thereof-&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Current abscess or significant active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Perianal infection is not an exclusion criterion, provided there is drainage with&#xD;
                  or without placement of drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Abnormal chest x- ray (CXR) consistent with active infection or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Severe diarrhea due to short small bowel; patients believed to have &lt; 700 mm of small&#xD;
             bowel and diarrhea attributable to this will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with toxic megacolon, active bowel obstruction or intestinal perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unable to collect minimum of 3 x106/kg CD34+ cell dose. These patients will be&#xD;
             excluded from receiving the preparative regimen.&#xD;
