  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in memory, attention, cognitive, and executive functions are the most common&#xD;
      disabilities after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is&#xD;
      implicated in these neural functions and dopaminergic pathways are recognized to be&#xD;
      frequently disrupted after TBI. Methylphenidate increases synaptic DA levels by binding to&#xD;
      presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT) and blocking re-uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to use PET imaging with [11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor&#xD;
      ligand, before and after administering methylphenidate, to measure endogenous DA release in&#xD;
      patients who are experiencing problems with cognition, attention and executive function in&#xD;
      the chronic stage after TBI. In addition, we will use TMS to test short intracortical&#xD;
      inhibition, a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAA) - mediated phenomenon, which is&#xD;
      under partial DA control, as a measure of dopaminergic activity on and off&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Deficits in memory, attention, cognitive, and executive functions are the most common&#xD;
      disabilities after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is&#xD;
      implicated in these neural functions and dopaminergic pathways are recognized to be&#xD;
      frequently disrupted after TBI. One of the most widely used DAergic drugs is methylphenidate&#xD;
      (Ritalin ). Methylphenidate increases synaptic DA levels by binding to presynaptic dopamine&#xD;
      transporters (DAT) and blocking re-uptake. PET with methylphenidate challenge to measure&#xD;
      tonic DA release provides valuable insight into the molecular basis of attention-deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and addiction, as well as practical information regarding&#xD;
      likely effectiveness of therapy (1). The objectives of this study are to use PET imaging with&#xD;
      [11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, before and after administering methylphenidate, to&#xD;
      measure endogenous DA release in patients who are experiencing problems with cognition,&#xD;
      attention and executive function in the chronic stage after TBI. In addition, we will use TMS&#xD;
      to test short intracortical inhibition, a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAA) -&#xD;
      mediated phenomenon, which is under partial DA control, as a measure of dopaminergic activity&#xD;
      on and off&#xD;
&#xD;
      methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females (n=30), between the ages of 18 and 55 years in the chronic stage after TBI&#xD;
      who experience deficits in neuropsychological function from TBIs incurred 6 months after the&#xD;
      injury, will be recruited from military treatment facilities or civilian clinics when&#xD;
      presenting for clinical management of TBI or postconcussive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study participants will be evaluated using brain MRI, psychometric measures adapted from&#xD;
           the TBI Common Data Elements, attention tests and information about details of the&#xD;
           injury and experience of post-concussive symptoms will be recorded. Transcranial&#xD;
           magnetic stimulation (TMS) with placebo and with methylphenidate (60 mg by mouth)&#xD;
           challenge will be performed to predict a stimulant response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will be studied with [11C]-raclopride PET in two imaging sessions. One session&#xD;
           will be after administration of placebo and the other after methylphenidate, 60 mg by&#xD;
           mouth. Both placebo and methylphenidate will be given 60 minutes prior to injection of&#xD;
           [11C]-raclopride to allow for peak uptake of methylphenidate in the brain. The binding&#xD;
           potential of [11C]-raclopride relative to a non-displaceable reference region&#xD;
           (cerebellum), BPND, will be used as a measure of D2/D3 receptor availability. The&#xD;
           difference in BPND between methylphenidate and placebo ( BPND) is used to measure of&#xD;
           tonic DA release.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will then be treated with oral methylphenidate, using a forced titration up to&#xD;
           a dose of 30 mg given twice daily for 4 weeks. At that point, the neuropsychologic tests&#xD;
           are repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in information processing speed&#xD;
&#xD;
      during neuropsychologic testing&#xD;

    <description>Relationship between tonic DA release (assessed by displacement of [11C] raclopride by oral methylphenidate) and improvement in processing speed after 4 weeks of treatment with oral methylphenidate.&#xD;
The Perceptual organization and processing speed index is measured from the Digit Symbol and Symbol Searches from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). The tasks that comprise the PSI, (Coding, Symbol Search), are timed and require attending to visual material, visual perception and organization, visual scanning, and hand-eye coordination. It is a standardized scale were 100 is the mean of a normal population, and each 10 points represents 1 standard deviation above or below the mean. Thus, an index of 110 is 1 SD above the mean, 90 is 1 SD below the mean.</description>

        <title>Perceptual Organization and Processing Speed Index</title>
        <description>Relationship between tonic DA release (assessed by displacement of [11C] raclopride by oral methylphenidate) and improvement in processing speed after 4 weeks of treatment with oral methylphenidate.&#xD;
The Perceptual organization and processing speed index is measured from the Digit Symbol and Symbol Searches from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). The tasks that comprise the PSI, (Coding, Symbol Search), are timed and require attending to visual material, visual perception and organization, visual scanning, and hand-eye coordination. It is a standardized scale were 100 is the mean of a normal population, and each 10 points represents 1 standard deviation above or below the mean. Thus, an index of 110 is 1 SD above the mean, 90 is 1 SD below the mean.</description>
