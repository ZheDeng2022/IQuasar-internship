  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seeds from the Buglossoides arvensis plant (trademarked as Ahiflower™) produce oil that is a&#xD;
      rich natural source (20%) of stearidonic acid (SDA), a metabolic intermediate between omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids found in other plants (such as flax) and those found in fish oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study to collect safety data and to investigate the accumulation of&#xD;
      long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human lipids following oral supplementation&#xD;
      with Ahiflower oil in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, comparator-controlled, double-blind study in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Forty subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 supplementation groups (n=20 per&#xD;
      group). One group will consume 10 ml of Buglossoides oil daily and one group will consume 10&#xD;
      ml of flax seed oil daily for a 4 week period. Baseline data will be obtained at week 0.&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic after 2 weeks and again after 4 weeks for measurement of&#xD;
      safety and efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy parameters are statistically significant changes from baseline and between&#xD;
      groups in plasma, red blood cell and leukocyte omega-3 fatty acid content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma EPA concentration expressed as μmol/L plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Plasma 20:4n-3 and DPA individually as μmol/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plasma 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Erythrocyte 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mononuclear cell 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neutrophil 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The omega-3 index (defined as the sum of red blood cell EPA and DHA concentrations),&#xD;
           expressed as % total fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fasting serum chemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. fasting hematology profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. fasting blood lipid profile&#xD;
