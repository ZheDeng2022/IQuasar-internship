    <textblock>
      Colonic diverticula are outpouchings of the large bowel, and they occur in up to 60% of&#xD;
      people over 60 years of age. About 10-25% of patients with diverticula will have symptoms.&#xD;
      These can range from acute diverticulitis, which can be a lethal infection to symptomatic&#xD;
      diverticular disease, which involves inflammation of the bowel and altered bowel habits,&#xD;
      decreasing patients' quality of life. We do not know which patients will develop acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis or which patients will develop diverticula in their colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that diverticulitis may be associated with, or even caused by, alterations in the&#xD;
      bacteria that live in the colon, known as the gut microbiome. Until recently it was too&#xD;
      expensive and too complex to examine the microbiome in detail. We propose to examine for the&#xD;
      first time in detail the microbiome of patients with acute diverticulitis and asymptomatic&#xD;
      diverticulosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be analysed for gut microbiome composition by 16S ribosomal RNA gene&#xD;
      pyrosequencing. There is a part of the bacterial cell, the ribosome, which is the same in all&#xD;
      bacteria (16S). Through PCR, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing, we can separate out&#xD;
      the different types of bacteria in a sample. We can then look at the different kinds of&#xD;
      bacteria in each patient population, as well as how diverse the populations are within the&#xD;
      groups, and compared to other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to be able to discriminate between the microbiome of patients with acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis and asymptomatic diverticulosis. This study many change how diverticulitis and&#xD;
      diverticulosis are conceptualized and treated. Alterations in the microbiome in these disease&#xD;
      states may be able to be treated, preventing further disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diverticulosis affects 60% of people over 60 and roughly 10-25% of individuals will have&#xD;
      symptoms, ranging from acute diverticulitis requiring emergent intervention to symptomatic&#xD;
      diverticular disease with persistent lower abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Up to 5%&#xD;
      of patients with acute diverticulitis will die while hospitalized. In spite of the prevalence&#xD;
      and severity of its manifestations, fundamental questions remain about the nature of&#xD;
      diverticulitis and diverticulosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human colon contains 100 trillion bacteria, including hundreds of species and 10 times as&#xD;
      many genes as the human genome. While alterations in the microbiome have been implicated in&#xD;
      disease states such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),&#xD;
      the microbiome has not been adequately described in relation to colonic diverticula. As&#xD;
      King's College Hospital has the only known dedicated Diverticular Disease clinic, we have a&#xD;
      uniquely large patient population in which to learn about this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When colonic diverticula become inflamed or perforate, patients have diverticulitis. Inciting&#xD;
      factors for episodes of acute diverticulitis are not well characterized, but include age,&#xD;
      lifestyle factors and certain medications. Clinicians have no way to predict which patients&#xD;
      will get diverticulitis, nor how severe its presentation will be. In some cases of&#xD;
      pericolonic diverticulitis (known as Hinchey I), inflammation may resolve even without&#xD;
      antibiotics, while in other cases, perforated diverticulitis will include feculent&#xD;
      peritonitis (Hinchey IV) and require emergent colon resection. Diverticulitis may be caused&#xD;
      by alterations in the microbiome, but this has not been sufficiently addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis, that is, the presence of colonic&#xD;
      diverticula in the absence of symptoms, will never experience an episode of diverticulitis.&#xD;
      There has been, however, some limited evidence that the microbiome in diverticulosis is&#xD;
      altered, and similar to that in acute diverticulitis. If that is so, then predicting which&#xD;
      patients will develop acute diverticulitis will remain impossible. It will also mean that&#xD;
      research which did not assess or control for the presence of diverticula in patient&#xD;
      populations will need to be revisited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, clinicians have no basis to predict (1) which patients will develop severe acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis requiring surgery or (2) which patients will develop acute diverticulitis&#xD;
      which will resolve with antibiotics. We believe that further insights into the gut microbiome&#xD;
      will allow for better diagnostics and treatments in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few, limited studies of the microbiome in diverticulitis, but not full&#xD;
      pyrosequencing. This is because research costs have fallen 5 orders of magnitude in the past&#xD;
      decade while computational capacity has increased. Studies have looked at the individual&#xD;
      strains of bacteria within stool or mucosal samples, which does not suffice to understand the&#xD;
      complex microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the gut microbiome has not been thoroughly investigated in diverticular disease, this is&#xD;
      an exploratory study. However, we do wish to test the hypotheses that patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic diverticulosis have a microbiome more similar to patients with acute&#xD;
      diverticulitis, than to that of normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. Methodology Setting: King's College Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in south&#xD;
      London. King's is a referral centre for the work up of two-week wait for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (2ww) assessments, with 900 new patient referrals assessed per year. Also, the Accident &amp;&#xD;
      Emergency Department at King's admits up to 250 patients per year with acute diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 4 sets of patients will be recruited. 25 patients per group will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups A and B. Patients with acute diverticulitis will be recruited from the A&amp;E department&#xD;
      at King's, prior to commencement of antibiotics. Rectal swabs will be obtained from patients&#xD;
      with a chief complaint of acute abdominal pain upon initial assessment, prior to initial&#xD;
      antibiotics. All specimens will be initially frozen, but only patients specimens with an&#xD;
      admitting diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and colonic imaging (CT imaging or visualization&#xD;
      at surgery) will be analysed. Patients with acute diverticulitis will be assessed in 2&#xD;
      groups, those patients with perforated diverticulitis (i.e., Hinchey III or IV) and those&#xD;
      patients with unperforated diverticulitis (Hinchey I or II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C. Patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis will be recruited from the 2-week wait&#xD;
      (2ww) colorectal cancer pathway. Patients presenting with a chief complaint of fresh rectal&#xD;
      bleeding, with no other complaints, will be recruited prior to diagnostic imaging, either by&#xD;
      CT, CT colonography, or endoscopy. They will provide a stool sample or rectal swab prior to&#xD;
      bowel cleansing, if required for their evaluation, as that may alter the microbiome. Those&#xD;
      patient samples with diverticulosis (and or haemorrhoids, as the other most common cause of&#xD;
      fresh PR bleeding) will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D. Patients with or without haemorrhoids, and no other colonic pathology will be&#xD;
      recruited from the 2ww colorectal cancer pathway. These will be the normal controls. Patients&#xD;
      presenting with a chief complaint of fresh PR bleeding, with no other complaints, will be&#xD;
      recruited prior to diagnostic imaging, either by CT, CT colonography, or endoscopy. They will&#xD;
      provide a stool sample or rectal swab prior to bowel cleansing, if required for their&#xD;
      evaluation, as that may alter the microbiome. Those patient samples with diverticulosis (and&#xD;
      or haemorrhoids, as the other most common cause of fresh PR bleeding) will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool analysis: Stool samples will be analysed for faecal microbiome composition by 16S&#xD;
      ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing, through a cooperative agreement with the Bruce lab at&#xD;
      King's College London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, gene targeted 16S rRNA sequencing examines a structural component of the bacterial&#xD;
      ribosome through targeted primers. Constant portions of the ribosomal RNA are amplified,&#xD;
      which allows for identification of the variable portions. Sequences are then clustered in to&#xD;
      OTUs, operational taxonomic units and may be assigned to lineages from genus all the way to&#xD;
      phyla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical analyses: Microbiome composition will be assessed in several different&#xD;
      ways. Alpha diversity will be measured, which is a measure of the average diversity within a&#xD;
      sample. Multiple assessments of alpha diversity will be made, including Chaol richness&#xD;
      estimate, OTU richness, and Shannon index. Alpha diversity has been shown to be reduced in&#xD;
      patients with active IBD as compared to patients with quiescent disease, but has not been&#xD;
      described in diverticular disease. Beta diversity is a comparison of diversity between&#xD;
      samples (that is, the separation of the phylogenetic structure of the OTUs in one sample as&#xD;
      compared to all other samples) will be calculated through Unifrac distances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Metabonomic studies of the gut microbiome at this time are necessarily&#xD;
      exploratory. As such power calculations have not been performed in the field. However, in&#xD;
      this instance analysing 25 samples per group should be sufficient to discriminate between&#xD;
      groups and assess their diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing infrastructure: All infrastructure needed is currently in place. The study team&#xD;
      (Professor Bjarnason and Mr Papagrigoriadis) currently manage the 2ww clinics, as well as&#xD;
      attend to acute admissions in A&amp;E at King's College Hospital. A materials transfer agreement&#xD;
      is in place with the Bruce lab at King's College London for transfer of other faecal samples,&#xD;
      and would only need to be amended.&#xD;
