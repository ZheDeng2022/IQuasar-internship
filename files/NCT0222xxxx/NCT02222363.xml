      This Phase I, open label dose escalation study of VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors will determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600&#xD;
      when administered by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment&#xD;
      cycle. Dose escalation will proceed according to the standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design using doubling&#xD;
      doses. The doses are: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600.&#xD;

    <description>Tumor response will be determined using CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at pre-treatment, Cycle 2 Day 28, at every 8 weeks thereafter, and at off-study (if a scan has not been performed within the last prior 4 weeks). Patients in the MTD confirmation cohort only will have a pre-treatment baseline positron emission tomography- computerized tomography (PET-CT) scan and then at Cycle 2 Day 28. Tumor response will be determined by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In patients with disease not measurable by RECIST 1.1, blood samples for biomarkers of tumor response will be collected at pre-treatment baseline and then after every 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a dose of VLX600 by 4-hr intravenous infusion using a central venous catheter on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. There are the following dose cohorts: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600. It is anticipated that patients will receive 6 treatment cycles. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression, patients have the option of continuing treatment beyond 6 cycles, if the investigator determines that the patient may benefit further from it.</description>
