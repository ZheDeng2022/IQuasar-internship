      Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease characterized by&#xD;
      synovial hyperplasia and joint damage leading to clinically significant functional&#xD;
      impairment. In RA, for some unknown reason, immune cells infiltrate into synovium of joint&#xD;
      and produce the 'rheumatoid factor', prostaglandins, cytokines and other mediators. It&#xD;
      damages joint and cartilage, even other organs. 80% of the RA patients have Rheumatoid factor&#xD;
      which is caused by high expression ratio of auto-antibodies in blood. Produced immune&#xD;
      complexes, immune cells and antigen-presenting cells(including macrophages, B cells,&#xD;
      dendritic cells) activate and release cytokines and then synovial tissue becomes thickened&#xD;
      and damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that synthetic DMARDs(disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) including&#xD;
      methotrexate(MTX), sulfasalazine and biological DMARDs such as tumor necrosis factors(TNF)-α&#xD;
      blockers, abatacept and rituximab, often in combination with MTX, are effective. But they&#xD;
      still are limited by lack or loss of efficacy in certain patients and serious complications&#xD;
      such as serious infections and malignancies. So, there is a need to identify new treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FURESTEM-RA Inj. is composed of allogeneic hUCB-MSC(human Umbilical Cord Blood&#xD;
      derived-Mesenchymal Stem cell). hUCB-MSCs are mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood. Mesenchymal stem cells are well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability&#xD;
      and capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types including osteocytes and&#xD;
      chondrocytes. Therefore, FURESTEM-RA Inj. has huge possibility as cell therapy products for&#xD;
      RA patients.&#xD;
