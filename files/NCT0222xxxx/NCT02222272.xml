  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplantation will continue to be a treatment option for patients with chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukaemia, despite the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, many&#xD;
      patients will have received prior therapy with TKIs, including Nilotinib or Dasatinib at the&#xD;
      time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the use of Imatinib prior to stem cell transplantation seems to have no adverse impact&#xD;
      on the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation little is known on the impact of prior&#xD;
      use of second generation TK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this non interventional prospective study addresses this question and patients&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation after prior use of 2nd generation TKIs will&#xD;
      be followed by the data office office on engraftment, treatment related mortality, relapse&#xD;
      rate and survival, prospectively. Details on TKI therapy will be collected by the&#xD;
      participating centers, retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non interventional prospective study. There is no upper limit to the number of&#xD;
      patients entered, but it is estimated that up to 450 patients will be included in 150 centres&#xD;
      for this non interventional prospective study. The registry will include patients for three&#xD;
      years plus one more year for follow up and data analysis which should then be followed-up&#xD;
      until the projected end of the non interventional prospective study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal disorder characterized by the chromosomal&#xD;
      translocation t(9;22) which produces a fusion gene encoding the chimeric oncoprotein, BCR-&#xD;
      ABL. This protein harbors a deregulated constitutive activated tyrosine kinase (TK) leading&#xD;
      to leukemogenesis [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate, the first potent selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL TK [2] has become the&#xD;
      frontline therapy for newly diagnosed CML patients [3]. It can induce haematologic and&#xD;
      cytogenetic remission in all stages of CML, as well as in Ph positive acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) with minimal toxicity [4, 5]. However, resistance and relapse during&#xD;
      imatinib treatment are increasingly reported [6] and complete molecular remissions, as&#xD;
      measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are rare [7-9]. Loss of response to imatinib is&#xD;
      frequently associated with mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL which lead to impaired&#xD;
      imatinib binding [10-12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib and Dasatinib are orally available kinase inhibitors that can overcome resistance&#xD;
      to Imatinib [13 - 15]. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of both&#xD;
      Nilotinib and Dasatinib in all stages of imatinib resistant CML. However, the long-term&#xD;
      durability of these responses is uncertain yet, and substantial toxicity has been encountered&#xD;
      [16]. Major adverse events observed during Nilotinib therapy were cytopenias, bone marrow&#xD;
      suppression, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, diarrhea, cardiac dysfunction, liver toxicities&#xD;
      and dermatitis [17-19] and during Dasatinib therapy grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and&#xD;
      neutropenia were reported in nearly half of the patients and non-hematologic toxicity&#xD;
      consisted primarily of diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dyspnea and pleural effusion [20, 21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is now used mainly as salvage or curative therapy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced CML who were previously treated with imatinib. While one study&#xD;
      showed higher incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), venoocclusive disease (VOD) and&#xD;
      transplant related mortality (TRM) [22], most studies have demonstrated that imatinib therapy&#xD;
      prior to allogeneic SCT doesn't adversely affect transplantation outcome [23,24] . By&#xD;
      contrast, previously used therapies for CML including busulfan and interferon alpha (if&#xD;
      administrated less than 3 months before allogeneic SCT) have been reported to increase&#xD;
      transplant related toxicities and mortality in CML patients undergoing allogeneic SCT [25,&#xD;
      26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of pre-transplant nilotinib or dasatinib therapy on transplant related&#xD;
      complications, morbidity and outcome is mostly unknown and only two small case series have as&#xD;
      yet been reported on this topic [27, 28]. However, allogeneic SCT will continue to be used as&#xD;
      a salvage or curative therapy for CML especially in cases with resistance to kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors or in patients at high risk of relapse, such as those in second chronic phase&#xD;
      after blast crisis [29]. In the future 2nd generation TKIs may replace at least in part&#xD;
      imatinib as frontline therapy for CML or will continue to be used in imatinib resistant&#xD;
      patients. Nevertheless, in high risk patients allogeneic transplantation appears to remain&#xD;
      the only curative treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, it is important to determine whether these novel treatments will not&#xD;
      compromise transplantation outcome and increase transplant related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non interventional prospective study with regard to SCT and follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      agreeing to SCT will be identified from the EBMT database and from the transplant physicians.&#xD;
      Transplant centres for the non interventional prospective study will be chosen from the EBMT&#xD;
      centers that have transplanted patients with CML over the past 5 years. Transplant centers&#xD;
      willing to participate will be registered with the EBMT Leiden Office. A prospective registry&#xD;
      will keep record of all patients undergoing allogeneic SCT who had received prior treatment&#xD;
      with 2nd generation TKIs and a specific data collection form (MED-B / MED-C) will be sent to&#xD;
      the transplant centre to capture the relevant information at the appropriate intervals (day&#xD;
      +100; 1 year; 2 years). Data will be collected regarding the safety and feasibility of stem&#xD;
      cell transplant after Nilotinib or Dasatinib therapy (see endpoints).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on the treatment of patients with Nilotinib or Dasatinib before SCT will be&#xD;
      collected retrospectively as part of the medical history (retrospective data collection).&#xD;
      Participating centers planning an allogeneic SCT in a patient with CML previously treated&#xD;
      with Nilotinib or Dasatinib will register the patient with the EBMT Leiden Office prior to&#xD;
      transplant (day 0). A specific MED-C form will be sent to the centers immediately after&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients transplanted in an EBMT centre give specific consent for the collection and&#xD;
      release of clinical data to the EBMT registry. Therefore, all patients registered in this non&#xD;
      interventional prospective study would have signed an informed consent to authorise the&#xD;
      release of medical information to the EBMT for the non interventional prospective study. Each&#xD;
      centre will use their own standard consent form and information sheet. No specific consent&#xD;
      form is envisaged for this non interventional prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational non interventional prospective study using the existing framework of&#xD;
      the EBMT to identify and include patients. In 2006 560 patients with CML received an&#xD;
      allotransplant, coming down from 800 in 2003. The percentage of patients transplanted not in&#xD;
      first chronic phase is constantly increasing. Currently no data are available how many of&#xD;
      those had previously been treated with 2nd generation TKI: it is however assumed, that also&#xD;
      the number of patients transplanted after therapy with second generation TKI is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimate number is that for the next three years approximately 1500 allotransplants for&#xD;
      CML will be done. 60% of these pts (n=900) would have received 2nd generation TKI. Assuming&#xD;
      that at least 50% of them will be registered in the non interventional prospective study, it&#xD;
      is expected that up to 450 patients will be identified over the next three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients response status to treatment with second line TKI (e.g. in stable CCyR, MCyR, or&#xD;
      resistant to or progressing under 2nd line TKI) will be recorded to allow for identification&#xD;
      of subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients' features&#xD;
&#xD;

      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All correspondence will go through the data centre in Leiden. The data manager from the&#xD;
      selected centre will complete the study forms. The data manager from the selected centre,&#xD;
      national registry or the Paris office will collect the data forms and will enter the MED-B&#xD;
      specific items. The MED-C items will be collected and entered by the data centre in Leiden.&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done centrally at the CLWP office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of inconsistencies a second check will be performed by a research assistant/data&#xD;
      manager of the CLWP.&#xD;
