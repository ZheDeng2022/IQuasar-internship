      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MicroPort's&#xD;
      Valve and delivery system for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in severe aortic&#xD;
      stenosis who are considered unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement.&#xD;

      1. Evaluate the performance, safety and clinical benefit of MicroPort's aortic valve&#xD;
           prosthesis and delivery system in intervention by peripheral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study Continuous observe 12 months of safety and efficacy. Approximately 89 patients&#xD;
           are recruited in the study with native aortic valve stenosis which are considered&#xD;
           unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement.&#xD;
