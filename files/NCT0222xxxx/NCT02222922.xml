The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR or SD according to the appropriate analysis set. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - Q3W Regimen</title>
        <description>A DLT was any of the following adverse events(AEs) in the first cycle of treatment (within 21 days of first dose or until participant received second infusion if there were treatment delays). (1)Hematologic: including Grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt;7 days; Febrile neutropenia; Grade &gt;=3 neutropenic infection; Grade 4 anemia; Grade &gt;=3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding. (2) Hepatic, including Grade &gt;=3 serum bilirubin, hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;=3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) concurrent with elevation in bilirubin &gt;=2.0 x ULN; (3) Grade &gt;=3 non-hematologic, non-hepatic major organ toxicities; delayed by &gt;2 weeks in receiving the next scheduled cycle due to persisting toxicities attributable to PF-06647020. A participant was on study for at least 21 days to be evaluable for DLT observation, and could be replaced if they terminated study participation earlier than 21 days.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. All AEs were graded by the investigator according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1 AEs are mild AEs; Grade 2 AEs are moderate AEs; Grade 3 AEs are severe AEs, Grade 4 AEs are life-threatening consequences and Grade 5 AEs are deaths related to AEs. Each AE was counted once for the participant in the most severe severity.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent AEs Categorized by Seriousness - Q3W Regimen (All-Causality and Treatment-Related)</title>
          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. All AEs were graded by the investigator according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1 AEs are mild AEs; Grade 2 AEs are moderate AEs; Grade 3 AEs are severe AEs, Grade 4 AEs are life-threatening consequences and Grade 5 AEs are deaths related to AEs. Each AE was counted once for the participant in the most severe severity.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Profile From Time 0 Extrapolated to Infinite Time (AUCinf) for PF-06647020 - Q3W Regimen</title>
        <description>AUCinf is the area under the serum concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time. AUCinf for PF-06647020 was calculated as AUClast + (Clast*/kel), where AUClast was the area under the serum concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, Clast* was the predicted serum concentration at the last quantifiable time point estimated from the log-linear regression analysis. kel was the terminal phase rate constant calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve.</description>

          <description>AUCinf is the area under the serum concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time. AUCinf was calculated as AUClast + (Clast*/kel), where AUClast was the area under the serum concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, Clast* was the predicted serum concentration at the last quantifiable time point estimated from the log-linear regression analysis. kel was the terminal phase rate constant calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve.</description>
