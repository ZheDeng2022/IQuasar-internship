      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the rate of emergency caesarean section can be&#xD;
      reduced if adhering to a dynamic labour progression curve compared to a static progression&#xD;
      curve for first time mothers without jeopardising maternal and neonatal outcomes&#xD;

      1. Introduction The increasing rate of emergency caesarean sections in developed countries&#xD;
           is of great concern as it is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and infant. The&#xD;
           rate of caesarean sections for first time mothers with a singleton foetus in a vertex&#xD;
           position and spontaneous onset of labour at term has increased from 5.7 % to 9.2 % in&#xD;
           Norway. The most common indication for emergency caesarean sections is Labour dystocia,&#xD;
           even if there is no consensus on criteria for the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Labour dystocia is characterised by abnormally slow progress of labour and is among the&#xD;
           most common challenges of birth care especially in first time mothers. When the labour&#xD;
           progression is assessed to be prolonged according to current guidelines, labour dystocia&#xD;
           is treated by amniotomy followed by oxytocin infusion to augment uterus contractions.&#xD;
           Oxytocin is a potent drug and classified by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices&#xD;
           in the USA as one of 12 medications which is &quot;bearing heightened risk of harm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Norway the guidelines for expected progression of labour is based on modifications of&#xD;
           Friedman's curve of cervical dilatation, a linear labour progression curve developed in&#xD;
           1953. Contemporary research by Zhang shows that the dilatation of the cervix can be&#xD;
           substantially slower than earlier expected, especially at an early stage of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: By adhering to the guideline for labour progression presented by Zhang, the&#xD;
           rate of emergency caesarean sections in first time mothers will decrease compared to&#xD;
           adhering to the guideline for labour progression based on a modified Friedman's curve,&#xD;
           without jeopardising the maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and status of knowledge Traditionally the labour process is divided in two&#xD;
           stages; the first stage and the second stage. The first stage is divided in two phases;&#xD;
           the latent phase and the active phase, the latent phase is defined from onset of labour&#xD;
           until the cervix is dilated four centimetres with 3-4 painful contractions per ten&#xD;
           minutes. The active phase is defined from a cervix dilatation of four centimetres until&#xD;
           fully dilated. The second stage is divided in two phases; the deceleration phase where&#xD;
           the baby's head is decelerating towards the pelvic floor and the expulsion phase where&#xD;
           the mother is actively pushing the baby out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To visualize the progression of labour, the status of the cervix dilatation is&#xD;
           traditionally measured and recorded throughout labour on a graphic curve often called a&#xD;
           partogram. The partogram is widely used internationally and facilitates that midwives'&#xD;
           and doctors' can monitor labour progression, and together with criteria for labour&#xD;
           dystocia, consequently carry out necessary interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 1954 Dr. Friedman presented the first progression curve based on examination of 100&#xD;
           first time mothers. Friedman's curve has been widely adopted and applied in practice&#xD;
           internationally for almost 60 years. In 2002 Dr. Zhang presented a new labour curve&#xD;
           based on labour data from 1329 low-risk women. Zhang's findings were confirmed in a&#xD;
           large cohort of 26,838 women in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Zhang's labour curve differs markedly from the Friedman's curve in that the cervix&#xD;
           dilates substantially slower, especially before reaching six centimetres of dilatation,&#xD;
           nor is the distinct deflection of the curve between nine and ten centimetres in&#xD;
           Friedman's curve found in Zhang's curve. These findings may suggest that the diagnostic&#xD;
           criteria for labour dystocia are too stringent following Friedman's curve in&#xD;
           contemporary birth care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A new guideline for normal birth progression is developed according to Zhang's curve and&#xD;
           contemporary research findings. The new guideline differs from the existing ones by not&#xD;
           expecting a linear progression and by defining the progression to be normal if the speed&#xD;
           of cervical dilatation is within the 95 percentile of the duration in Zhang's material.&#xD;
           Active labour is defined when the cervical dilatation is 4 centimetres or more until the&#xD;
           baby is born. In this dynamic labour curve, labour dystocia is defined if time from 4 to&#xD;
           5 cm exceeds six hours and 30 minutes, if time from 5 to 6 cm exceeds three hours and 15&#xD;
           minutes, if time from 6 to 7 cm exceeds two hour and 15 minutes, if time from 7 to 8 cm&#xD;
           exceeds one hour and 30 minutes, if time from 8 to 9 cm exceeds one hour and 30 minutes&#xD;
           or if time from 9 to 10 cm exceeds one hour and 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           New knowledge and competence on labour progression may result in a new guideline&#xD;
           allowing low-risk labours to proceed without unnecessary interventions which will&#xD;
           benefit the population both medically and economically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design and implementation To evaluate if our hypothesis is true, a cluster randomised&#xD;
           trial will be conducted. The objective is to include birth care units by randomising&#xD;
           them to adhere to either of the two guidelines in active labour; F (Standard care&#xD;
           according to Friedman's guideline) or Z; (Experimental care according to Zhang's&#xD;
           guideline) F = Guideline with the following expected labour progression: if the cervix&#xD;
           dilates at least 1 centimetre per hour assessed after 4 hours. Labour dystocia is&#xD;
           diagnosed if progression proceeds slower than this definition throughout the active&#xD;
           phase of the first stage of labour. Labour dystocia in the second stage of labour is&#xD;
           diagnosed if lasting longer than two hours, three hours for women with epidurals or if&#xD;
           the expulsion phase lasts longer than 60 minutes. This guideline is based on an&#xD;
           interpretation of Friedman's expected progression of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z = Guideline which takes into account the dilatation of the cervix on admission and&#xD;
      calculates the expected progression during the active phase of the first stage of labour&#xD;
      based on this finding. Labour dystocia in the second stage of labour is diagnosed if lasting&#xD;
      longer than two hours and 45 minutes, three hours and 30 minutes for women with epidurals or&#xD;
      if the expulsion phase lasts longer than 60 minutes. This guideline is based on the labour&#xD;
      progression curve by Zhang.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen clusters will be included. The choice of cluster randomising, is due to the risk of&#xD;
      contamination if randomised on an individual level. Key elements to specify regarding&#xD;
      allocation of treatment are: The method of generating the allocation sequence is&#xD;
      computer-generated, the allocation ratio is equal to one, and the type of randomisation is&#xD;
      restricted and the factors &quot;size of birth care unit&quot; and &quot;prior rates of caesarean sections&#xD;
      for first time mothers with a singleton foetus in a vertex position, in spontaneous onset of&#xD;
      labour at term&quot; will be used for stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation process will be performed through a central computer assisted programme.&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted according to the CONSORT statement for planning and&#xD;
      implementation of cluster randomised trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clusters will receive a concise edition of the trial protocol and sign the cooperation&#xD;
      agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cluster must also provide one dedicated person (local coordinator) responsible for the&#xD;
      trial during the inclusion period. The local coordinator is responsible for recruitment and&#xD;
      inclusion of participants, monitoring the entries in a web-Case Report Form (web-CRF), record&#xD;
      control of each participant and is responsible for the implementation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each included cluster, all the following criteria must be met: Birth care units that are&#xD;
      willing to adhere to the guidelines in the trial period and who consider that they have the&#xD;
      capacity to participate both logistical and practical. The size of the birth care units&#xD;
      should be more than 500 deliveries per year to secure a reasonable inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and data analysis: The determination of the sample size is based on a&#xD;
      power calculation with the least occurring outcome; emergency caesarean section, which is 9.2&#xD;
      % in the study population (p1). Further, we expect that the emergency caesarean section rate&#xD;
      will be 6.7 % (p2) which id a 25 % reduction, when using the new guideline. With a chosen&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05, a power of 80 % and p1=9.2 % and p2=6.9 %, we will have to&#xD;
      include at least 14 clusters and 6582 individuals. As we are testing a new guideline,&#xD;
      blinding of care givers is not possible. The statistician will perform analyses blinded to&#xD;
      the participant's affiliation to the groups as a control of the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The difference between the randomized groups will be presented with a Risk Ratio&#xD;
      (RR) and a 95 % confidence interval (95% CI). For dichotomous efficacy variables a&#xD;
      significance test taking into account the cluster structure of the data, will be used. For&#xD;
      continuous data an independent sample t-test will be used. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using STATA version 10.1 StataCorp, Texas, //845 USA and SPSS version 18. The&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted according to the principle of intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation All first time mothers with a singleton foetus in a vertex position, in&#xD;
      spontaneous onset of labour at term will adhere to the labour progression guideline that the&#xD;
      cluster is randomised to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will receive written information about the trial when called for&#xD;
      routine ultrasound control, at the routine ultrasound control or at the labour ward. They&#xD;
      will be asked to sign an informed consent permitting her data to be included in the analyses,&#xD;
      and to answer an on-line questionnaire about her childbirth experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment: All women in both arms will be cared for and monitored according to the&#xD;
      procedures at each birth care unit. Necessary interventions due to the mother's or the fetus'&#xD;
      needs, will be conducted regardless of the allocated guideline for labour progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-Case Report Form: Due to different systems for electronic medical records and due to&#xD;
      additional handwritten records, a web based Case Report Form (web-CRF) is being designed by&#xD;
      the Unit of Applied Clinical Research at the Faculty of Medicine at the Norwegian University&#xD;
      of Science and Technology, NTNU. The web-CRF is transferable to the analytical tools; STATA&#xD;
      and SPSS. The local coordinators will ensure that the data required by the protocol is&#xD;
      entered de-identified into the web-CRF. The local coordinators are also responsible for&#xD;
      assuring that data entered into the web-CRF is complete, accurate, and that entry is&#xD;
      performed in a timely manner. The signature of the local coordinators will attest to the&#xD;
      accuracy of the data on each web-CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutively assessments will be recorded in the electronic journal throughout labour,&#xD;
      assessments recorded on the printed version of the partogram will be transmitted to the&#xD;
      web-CRF at each birth care unit. Assessments to be recorded throughout labour are e.g.:&#xD;
      Cervix status on admission (in centimetres), results of regularly vaginal exploration, the&#xD;
      use of oxytocin, pain relief and additional interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial manager shall arrange for the secure retention of the participant identification&#xD;
      and the code list. Participant files shall be kept for the maximum period of time permitted&#xD;
      by each birth care unit. The trial documentation (web-CRF, Site File etc.) shall be retained&#xD;
      and stored during the trial and for 10 years after trial closure. All information concerning&#xD;
      the trial will be stored in a safe place inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator Delegation Procedure: The trial manager is responsible for making and updating a&#xD;
      &quot;delegation of tasks&quot; listing all the involved co-workers and their role in the project. The&#xD;
      principle investigators will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given&#xD;
      to the staff, and that any new information of relevance to the performance of this trial is&#xD;
      forwarded to the staff involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the Clinical Study&#xD;
      Report (CSR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment and/or a new version&#xD;
      of the trial protocol (Amended Protocol) must be notified to and approved by the Competent&#xD;
      Authority and the Ethics Committees according to EU and national regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit and Inspections: Authorized representatives of a Competent Authority and Ethics&#xD;
      Committee may visit the centres to perform inspections, including source data verification.&#xD;
      The purpose of an inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related&#xD;
      activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were&#xD;
      recorded, analysed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The principal investigators will ensure&#xD;
      that the inspectors and auditors will be provided with access to source data/documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication policy: All personnel who have contributed significantly with the planning and&#xD;
      performance of the study according to the Vancouver convention 1988 may be included in the&#xD;
      list&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and regulatory requirements: The trial will be conducted in accordance with ethical&#xD;
      principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements. Registration of participant's data&#xD;
      will be carried out in accordance with national personal data laws. The protocol, including&#xD;
      the patient information and informed consent form to be used, is approved by the ethics&#xD;
      committee in Norway: 2013/1862/REK sør-øst. The principal investigator is responsible for&#xD;
      informing the ethics committee of any serious and unexpected adverse events and/or major&#xD;
      amendments to the protocol as per national requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol must be approved by the management at the birth care units before commencement&#xD;
      of the trial. The protocol will also be registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov before&#xD;
      enrollment of participants.&#xD;
