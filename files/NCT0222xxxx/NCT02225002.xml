  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD40, a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor superfamily, is expressed on many tumor&#xD;
      types, including melanoma, prostate, colon, breast, renal, pancreatic, and nonsmall cell lung&#xD;
      cancers. In preclinical models, activation of CD40 results in increased antigen presentation&#xD;
      and induction of apoptosis. CD40 is also expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) (B&#xD;
      cells, dendritic cells, monocytes) and is a key regulator of both cellular and humoral immune&#xD;
      responses. Activation of CD40 by CP-870,893, an agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      enhances host immune responses and abrogates the growth of tumors independently of the&#xD;
      expression of CD40 on tumor cells. Therefore, it is hypothesized that therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention with CP-870,893 may be beneficial to a large number of cancer patients either&#xD;
      through an immunomodulatory effect or through a direct effect on CD40-positive tumor cells.&#xD;
