      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Viaskin Milk after 12&#xD;
      months of epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) treatment, for desensitizing IgE-mediated cow's&#xD;
      milk allergic children and to assess the long-term safety and therapeutic benefit with&#xD;
