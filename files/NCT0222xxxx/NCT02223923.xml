  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of a new drug targeting the DNA repair pathway AZD6738,&#xD;
      an ATR inhibitor). Many tumours have lost important DNA repair functions and rely more&#xD;
      heavily on a few remaining repair pathways to survive. Preclinical studies indicate that, in&#xD;
      these tumours, preventing the function of the remaining pathways will lead to tumour cell&#xD;
      death, while sparing normal cells. This study aims to investigate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the new drug in patients with advanced cancer, as well as in combination with palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy, where the drug may increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy by preventing&#xD;
      repair of the radiationinduced DNA damage. As the drug has only been given to a small number&#xD;
      of patients, the study will focus on safety and finding the correct dose to proceed to&#xD;
      further studies, although preliminary signs of drug activity will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial part of the study will administer increasing doses of the drug to groups of&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer who have no standard anticancer treatment options available.&#xD;
      Testing will establish whether the drug levels in the body and tumour are adequate for the&#xD;
      drug to have an effect, and any toxicity will be assessed. After the recommended dose is&#xD;
      established, the recommended dose schedule will be stablished by trialing different&#xD;
      schedules. Participants will be tested to see if their tumours lack the main DNA repair&#xD;
      pathway (those who are predicted to have a better response to this drug). Finally, the drug&#xD;
      will be given to patients with advanced cancer who require a course of radiotherapy for&#xD;
      symptom control - the drug will be tested at different doses and with different doses of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects will be monitored and tests will establish whether the drug is enhancing the&#xD;
      radiotherapy effect in the tumours or normal tissues.&#xD;
