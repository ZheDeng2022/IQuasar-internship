  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with HDMP is well tolerated and will&#xD;
      induce similar if not higher response rates than the ones observed in Rituximab plus HDMP&#xD;
      studies (Castro et al., 2009, Castro et al., 2008).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase Ib/II clinical trial to determine the safety and clinical&#xD;
      activity of the GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with high-dose methylprednisone (HDMP).&#xD;
      We will evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first month of therapy as part of&#xD;
      the phase Ib of this study. In the phase II we will determine response rate in an intention&#xD;
      to treat analysis. In this study we will include CLL patients that have never received&#xD;
      treatment as well as patients that have failed previous treatments.&#xD;
