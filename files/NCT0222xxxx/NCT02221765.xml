  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a growing pandemic which affects 1 in 4 adults in the UK, and shortens life by&#xD;
      increasing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Current treatments for obesity have&#xD;
      either poor efficacy or significant side effects. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a promising&#xD;
      new drug target as it produces powerful appetite suppression which, following a 90-minute&#xD;
      infusion continues to act for 24 h in man. We have developed a new long lasting high potency&#xD;
      analogue of PP, PP1420. This is delivered as a once-a-day subcutaneous injection via a&#xD;
      painless fine-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first-time-in-man Phase 1a trial, that PP 1420 proved safe, well tolerated, and had&#xD;
      extended pharmacokinetics compared to PP itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now plan to study the safety and PK of PP1420 up to 64mg. We will also assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Its efficacy in reducing food intake after a single dose in a Phase 1B study in healthy&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Its efficacy in reducing food intake and weight after multiple dosing in a Phase 1C&#xD;
           study in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 25% of people in the UK are obese. People with obesity have a shorter life&#xD;
      expectancy, and have a higher risk of having heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure,&#xD;
      diabetes, and certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment, there is no treatment for obesity that is both effective and safe. Advising&#xD;
      people to change their diet and to exercise more is frequently ineffective, and any loss in&#xD;
      weight seen is usually temporary. There is only one medications licensed for the purpose of&#xD;
      losing weight, but they are limited by side-effects. Finally, gastric bypass and similar&#xD;
      surgeries are effective at reducing weight permanently, but can be risky and restricted only&#xD;
      to very motivated people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Gut hormones&quot; are natural chemicals made by the bowels when you eat. They work to reduce&#xD;
      appetite and hunger when you eat, so that you will eat enough for your needs. We think that&#xD;
      one of the reasons why gastric bypass surgery is so effective is because the surgery causes&#xD;
      an increase in gut hormone secretion into the bloodstream, which suppresses appetite. One of&#xD;
      these hormones is pancreatic polypeptide (PP), which is released into the bloodstream by&#xD;
      cells in the pancreas after eating. When human PP is given to healthy volunteers as an&#xD;
      injection, we see that they have a reduced appetite and food intake with no side-effects such&#xD;
      as feeling sick or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human PP does not last long in the blood stream. In order to make it into a new, safe and&#xD;
      effective drug for obesity, we have developed a new form of PP, which is very similar but not&#xD;
      identical to human PP, that we expect will last longer in the blood. We call this PP 1420.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In testing, PP 1420 reduced food intake in animals, and was safe in them at much higher doses&#xD;
      than those we plan to give in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PP1420 has previously been give to healthy volunteers in single doses up to 8mg without any&#xD;
      serious problems. All doses were well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the safety and tolerability of PP 1420 when given at single doses of&#xD;
      higher doses, up to 64 mg, and the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PP 1420 when given in&#xD;
      multiple doses for up to 28 days.&#xD;
