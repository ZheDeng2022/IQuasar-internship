      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) injures blood vessels in the brain. Endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells (EPCs) help the body form new blood vessels. The drug erythropoietin (EPO) helps the&#xD;
      body make more blood cells and might help make blood vessels. Researchers want to see if EPO&#xD;
      helps people with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see whether erythropoietin increases the number of endothelial progenitor cells&#xD;
      circulating in the blood and changes reactivity of brain vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 70 who had a TBI 3 7 days ago and still have symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and blood tests. Vital signs will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical exam, and blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, and thinking. These include written and&#xD;
           spoken questions, tests on paper or computer, and simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with carbon dioxide. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
           table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. For part of the scan, participants&#xD;
           will wear a breathing mask like a snorkel and wear a nose clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug or placebo injection under the skin of the arm, leg, or buttock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 2, 3, and 4 will be 1 week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of TBI symptoms and any drug side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug or placebo injection under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 will be 1 week after visit 4. Visit 6 will be 6 months after participants start&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of TBI symptoms and any drug side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI with carbon dioxide.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people under age&#xD;
      45 in industrialized countries 5;6. Significant numbers of US veterans from the wars in Iraq&#xD;
      and Afghanistan return with TBI7. However, to date, there are no specific neuroprotective&#xD;
      treatment options with proven clinical efficacy 8. Erythropoietin (EPO) is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA to treat anemia and has comprehensive preclinical data supporting its neuroprotective and&#xD;
      neuroregenerative efficacy following traumatic (TBI) and a wide range of other acquired brain&#xD;
      insults. Injury to small and medium-sized cerebral blood vessels is a well recognized&#xD;
      consequence of TBI. EPO increases production of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) 4;9 and&#xD;
      promotes angiogenesis and neovascularization after TBI. EPO also promotes neurogenesis and&#xD;
      improves functional recovery in animals after experimental stroke10-12 and TBI.13;14&#xD;
      Neovascularization is coupled with neurogenesis, and augmentation of both processes by EPO&#xD;
      may result in lessened cognitive deficits. Neovascularization by EPO may prevent&#xD;
      post-traumatic deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which can be measured&#xD;
      noninvasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is for a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial designed to obtain&#xD;
      data on the effects of EPO in humans with persistent post-concussive symptoms after TBI. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate effect of 4 week administration of recombinant&#xD;
      erythropoietin on numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with&#xD;
      persistent symptoms during the subacute period after TBI. This information will guide the&#xD;
      design of a future definitive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 30 males and females with persistent post-concussive&#xD;
      symptoms continuing up to 7 days after TBI. Participants will be military service members or&#xD;
      civilians presenting as outpatients for clinical management of TBI or post-concussive&#xD;
      symptoms at the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM)-affiliated&#xD;
      hospitals. These include the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Suburban&#xD;
      Hospital (SH), and Washington Hospital Center (WHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be referred to the NIH Clinical Center (CC) from participating hospitals or&#xD;
      will be recruited by advertisements through CNRM Recruitment core to receive EPO or placebo.&#xD;
      Telephone screening will be carried out to determine tentative eligibility. At the baseline&#xD;
      visit, participants will be screened, consented and randomized 2:1 to receive either EPO or&#xD;
      placebo with a dose of 40,000 IU EPO subcutaneously (s.c.) (n=20) once weekly for 4 weeks or&#xD;
      placebo (n=10). Each participant will have 6 outpatient visits (visits 1-6) performed at the&#xD;
      NIH CC. Placebo or active drug will be administered s.c. based on the randomization at visits&#xD;
      1-4; blood will be collected for EPC assays and safety laboratory measurements during each&#xD;
      visit. Brain MRI and neuropsychological tests will be performed during visit 1 (before&#xD;
      administering EPO or placebo), and visit 5 (one week after final drug administration) and&#xD;
      visit 6 (6 months after study enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Effect of 4 weeks of EPO administration on numbers of circulating EPCs in patients&#xD;
           with persistent symptoms during the subacute period after TBI (within subject&#xD;
           comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Comparison of the change of numbers of circulating EPC s between EPO and placebo&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Effect of 4 weeks of EPO administration on MRI biomarkers of TBI recovery (such as CVR&#xD;
           on hypercapnia and global and regional brain volumes by MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Effect of 4 weeks of EPO administration on plasma biomarkers of angiogenesis and&#xD;
           inflammation, such as stem cell factor (SCF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),&#xD;
           stromal-derived factor (SDF-1 ); and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . Effect of 4 weeks of placebo administration on numbers of circulating EPCs in patients&#xD;
           with persistent symptoms during the subacute period after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tertiary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. . Relationship between EPC levels at baseline and after 4 weeks and neuropsychological&#xD;
           performance following TBI.&#xD;
