  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if selegiline and tadalafil (generic for Cialis®) results&#xD;
      in an improvement in Erectile dysfunction (ED) in male patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      and moderate ED. Male PD patients who have an incomplete response to tadalafil alone will be&#xD;
      given both medications to see if the addition of selegiline improves ED symptoms more than&#xD;
      tadalafil alone. It is common practice for a medical doctor to prescribe these two drugs to a&#xD;
      patient like you. However, there have been no studies conducted to examine the effects of&#xD;
      these medications when taken together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selegiline is normally prescribed for PD patients that are taking carbidopa/levodopa who are&#xD;
      not receiving complete benefit from carbidopa/levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tadalafil is normally prescribed to men who have erectile dysfunction and/or benign prostatic&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;
