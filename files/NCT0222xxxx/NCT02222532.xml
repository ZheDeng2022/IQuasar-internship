      Infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery require mechanical support for circulation&#xD;
      called cardiopulmonary bypass. The artificial pump ensures that blood flow to the body is&#xD;
      maintained during surgical procedure on the heart. However, the pump circulation disrupts&#xD;
      regulation of thyroid hormone. This hormone is a critical regulator of heart and circulatory&#xD;
      function. Deficiencies in thyroid hormone adversely affect recovery of the heart after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. A recent study by the principal investigator showed that supplementing&#xD;
      patients younger than 5 months old shortened the time spent on the ventilator (breathing&#xD;
      machine) after surgery. Populations undergoing heart surgery in developing countries such as&#xD;
      Indonesia are different than those in the U.S. and other industrial nations. For many heart&#xD;
      defects children undergo surgery at an older age. They are then sicker for longer periods,&#xD;
      and are often malnourished. These older malnourished children have lower thyroid hormone&#xD;
      levels even prior to surgery, and show dramatic further drops after surgery. Shortening time&#xD;
      on the ventilator should improve their recovery, and also improve overall availability of&#xD;
      resources in developing countries. The formulation of thyroid hormone provided in the U.S and&#xD;
      given intravenous is relatively expensive. However, a much more inexpensive formulation is&#xD;
      available in Indonesia, which can be given through a tube extending from the nose to the&#xD;
      stomach. We propose testing this formulation made in Korea, known as Tetronine, in two&#xD;
      vulnerable populations in Indonesia: children younger than 5 months of age, and those older&#xD;
      than 5 months who are malnourished. All these patients will be undergoing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass for congenital heart defects. This project will be an important collaboration between&#xD;
      U.S and Indonesian investigators. If successful, it will have a general positive impact on&#xD;
      care of the entire population of young children undergoing cardiac surgery in developing&#xD;
      countries by reducing time on the ventilator and improving access to care.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview and Objectives We will perform a randomized double blinded placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial in Indonesian children under 3 years of age, who are undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      procedures for correction or palliation of congenital heart disease. The study is approved by&#xD;
      the Ethic Committee for Medical Research National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK).&#xD;
      Age 3 years was chosen as the cutoff, as the population &lt; 3 years has the highest mortality&#xD;
      rate in Indonesia. Also, this cutoff reduces age-based population heterogeneity, which could&#xD;
      confound the analyses. We will study two independent vulnerable cohorts within this&#xD;
      population as previously noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age &lt; 5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age &gt; 5 months and &lt; 3 years with moderate to severe malnutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate to severe malnutrition is defined as weight more than 15% below the predicted value&#xD;
      for height. The predicted value will be determined using WHO clinical growth charts based on&#xD;
      the patient gender and baseline length and weight measurements. There is no overlap in study&#xD;
      cohorts (patients ≤ 5 months of age and patients &gt; 5 months of age with moderate to severe&#xD;
      malnutrition form mutually exclusive groups). Thus, this study can be viewed as two separate,&#xD;
      independent trials, each with an overall type I error rate of 0.05 (2-sided). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint within each study cohort is a comparison of time to the first of death, 7 days, or&#xD;
      extubation based on the log-rank statistic from separate Cox Proportional Hazards Models.&#xD;
      These models will include Aristotle Score and other baseline covariates imbalanced across&#xD;
      treatment groups. Patients will be monitored until the first of death, withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      or hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints for this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death from any cause prior to hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Death or use of mechanical circulatory life support&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of unexpected adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incidence of any arrhythmia and specific arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1. To establish the efficacy of Tetronine®, Dalim Biotech Korea (oral T3) in&#xD;
      improving clinical outcome for Indonesian children age 0 to 5 months after congenital heart&#xD;
      disease surgery associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Eligible population: The age&#xD;
      distribution of children undergoing cardiac surgery in Indonesia is substantially different&#xD;
      than in the U.S. Very few patients at NCCHK less than 6 weeks age undergo cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass procedures (7/400 sequential patients 2011-12). As the The Triiodothyronine during&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass in Infants and Children (TRICC) trial indicated benefit for T3&#xD;
      supplementation in U.S children under age 5 months, we will study this age group within the&#xD;
      scope of specific aim 1 using Tetronine. This will be a single center study performed in&#xD;
      Indonesia at NCCHK. Historical records show that approximately 170 NCCHK patients will be&#xD;
      eligible for the specific aim 1 portion of the study within the 3 years of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2. Patients older than 5 months will be enrolled if at screening their weight is&#xD;
      equal or less than -2 Z Score for height on WHO DATA Table of Infant Weight for Length Charts&#xD;
      by gender. Historical records at NCCHK show that 160 patients will be eligible for specific&#xD;
      aim 2 over a 3 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies required to achieve these objectives will be run concurrently. Power Analysis: We&#xD;
      determined a requirement of 120 patients for objective 1 and 100 patients for specific aim 2&#xD;
      to achieve reasonable power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Adverse Event (AE) Reporting Although this study will be performed in Indonesia and&#xD;
      does not come under regulation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, we will use FDA&#xD;
      standards to report adverse events. Reporting of adverse events in cardiac surgical trials in&#xD;
      infants is complicated as there is no regulatory guidance specific to conducting clinical&#xD;
      research in critically ill children. We will use The Pediatric Heart Network reported method&#xD;
      with predefined &quot;sentinel events&quot; in place of serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two populations will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ITT Population The primary efficacy analysis population will be based on the principle of&#xD;
      Intention-to-Treat (ITT), and will include all randomized patients who receive any&#xD;
      double-blind study medication. Patients will be grouped according to randomization&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As-Treated Population The As-Treated population will only be used if there are patients who&#xD;
      mistakenly receive the wrong treatment or have other issues with dosing. In the As-Treated&#xD;
      analyses, patients will be grouped according to the treatment actually received. All safety&#xD;
      analyses will consider only the As-Treated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome The primary analysis will be performed using Cox&#xD;
      Proportional Hazards, including terms for stratification factors (age, Aristotle score and&#xD;
      nutrition status). Patients will be included in analyses if they were randomized and received&#xD;
      at least one dose of study drug according to the principal of Intention-to-Treat (ITT).&#xD;
      Occasionally patients are randomized and then surgery is cancelled or rescheduled due to&#xD;
      scheduling conflicts, and not due to patient related issues. This can rarely result in the&#xD;
      patient missing the study medication when the operation is rescheduled at the last minute.&#xD;
      However, since this study is double-blind, the ITT principal is preserved because the&#xD;
      treatment assignment is blinded and so unknown to persons responsible for these decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of missing values/ censoring/ discontinuations In the event that the parents of a&#xD;
      patient withdraw consent prior to extubation, the patient will be censored at the time of&#xD;
      discontinuation. Patients who die prior to extubation will be censored at the time of death.&#xD;
      For the primary efficacy analysis, patients who remain intubated at 7 days post cross-clamp&#xD;
      removal (168 hours) will be censored at 7 days. It is imperative that the date and time of&#xD;
      extubation be recorded accurately. If for some reason the date and time of extubation is not&#xD;
      recorded, patients will be considered intubated through 7 days and censored at 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses The two planned sensitivity analyses will use an identical model to the&#xD;
      primary analysis, but time to extubation may be different for some patients (if extubation&#xD;
      occurs after 7 days and before 30 days, for the first sensitivity analysis, or if the&#xD;
      successful extubation does not coincide with clinical readiness for extubation for the second&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup Analyses For each subgroup variable, a treatment-by-subgroup term will be added to&#xD;
      the primary analysis model to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups.&#xD;
      The primary analysis model will be repeated within each subgroup (removing terms for&#xD;
      stratification factors that are related to the subgroup of interest for individual models).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned subgroups for analysis include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nutritional state (normal, mild, moderate and severe malnutrition as determined by&#xD;
           percent of expected weight for length)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age &lt; 6 weeks versus ≥ 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age &lt; 24 months versus ≥ 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aristotle score category (6.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9, 10.0-15.0 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. High risk versus Lower risk Aristotle score (&lt; 10 versus ≥ 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary efficacy objectives Time on inotropic agents will be analyzed based on&#xD;
      the percent of time in the first 48 hours that inotropic agents were used. Patients who do&#xD;
      not require inotropic agents will be included in the analysis with 0% of the first 48 hours&#xD;
      of use. The distribution of the percent of 48 hours on inotropic agents will be right-skewed,&#xD;
      so the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test will be used to assess treatment differences. Non-parametric&#xD;
      regression may also be used to account for stratification factors. Inotropic score is likely&#xD;
      to also be right-skewed, so similar analysis techniques will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean heart rate and mean systemic mean blood pressure at baseline, 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours post&#xD;
      cross-clamp removal will be assessed using ANCOVA, controlling for stratification factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total and free T3 levels at baseline, 1, 12, 24 and 48 hours post cross-clamp removal will be&#xD;
      right-skewed. Lactate levels will also be drawn at these times points as an indicator of&#xD;
      metabolic status, and often used as a clinical indicator in pediatric cardiac intensive care&#xD;
      units. Differences across treatment groups will be assessed using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test&#xD;
      will be used to assess treatment differences. Non-parametric regression may also be used to&#xD;
      account for stratification factors. Longitudinal analyses may also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative ICU and Hospital stay durations will be right-skewed. Differences across&#xD;
      treatment groups will be assessed using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test will be used to assess&#xD;
      treatment differences. Non-parametric regression may also be used to account for&#xD;
      stratification factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of safety endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will be reported individually, as incidence rates by treatment. Fisher's&#xD;
      Exact Test or the Chi-square test will be used to assess treatment differences. Odds ratios&#xD;
      adjusted for stratification factors may also be produced.&#xD;
