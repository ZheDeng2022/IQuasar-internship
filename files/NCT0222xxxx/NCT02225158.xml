      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a severe disease and a major cause of death in many people worldwide. It&#xD;
      is caused by a bacteria that enters through the lungs and can spread elsewhere in the body.&#xD;
      People with latent TB have the bacteria that lie dormant but can become active and cause&#xD;
      disease. These people are offered treatment to prevent development of active TB. Worldwide, a&#xD;
      lot of people with LTBI also have a parasitic worm called a helminth that can stay in the gut&#xD;
      or the blood. These parasites can affect the immune system and cause diseases like TB to&#xD;
      become worse. Researchers want to see how helminth infection makes it harder for people to&#xD;
      fight TB infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the immune system of people with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) acts to&#xD;
      prevent development of active TB. Also, to study how helminth infection might affect this&#xD;
      immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 18 70 with LTBI as defined by an approved blood test called QuantiFERON TB&#xD;
           Gold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of infections like Hepatitis or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant subjects and subjects taking medications that suppress the immune system are&#xD;
           not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have not received prior treatment for LTBI. Participants might be still eligible if&#xD;
           prior treatment for active TB has been received&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for&#xD;
      other infections/conditions which might affect the immune system. They will have testing for&#xD;
      active TB i.e. blood testing as well as testing of their spit, scans and X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only eligible participants will be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have interviews, medical history, and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn from an arm vein for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will collect stool samples at home for 3 days in a row to test for helminth&#xD;
           infection..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have apheresis. Blood cells are removed by needle. They pass through a&#xD;
           separator machine which returns everything but the cells back to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have procedures at the start and end of the study that let researchers&#xD;
           look into the lungs and collect cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phase, about 2 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be offered treatment for LTBI which lasts 6-9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants being treated for LTBI will have about 11 study visits. They will visit&#xD;
           monthly for 9 months while on treatment, then 6 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants not eligible/refusing treatment for LTBI will be made aware of active TB,&#xD;
           then have 3 other visits, about 6, 12, and 24 months after the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have helminth infection will receive appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have blood drawn at each visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains an important cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide. A problem for eradication efforts is the large reservoir of ~2 billion&#xD;
      people with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) and poor understanding of factors&#xD;
      leading to active disease progression. Helminth infections geographically overlap with Mtb&#xD;
      and induce significant immune-mediated modulation. Although CD4+T cells producing IFN-gamma&#xD;
      and TNF-alpha have been implicated in protective immunity to TB, a detailed description of&#xD;
      the evolution of protective and immunomodulatory responses in LTBI is lacking. Additionally,&#xD;
      there is incomplete understanding of how the immunomodulation caused by helminth co-infection&#xD;
      affects such responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will attempt to fill this knowledge gap through comprehensive longitudinal&#xD;
      immunological analyses of two populations of subjects with LTBI, with or without concurrent&#xD;
      helminth infection (HEL+ and HEL- respectively). In both groups, venipuncture and possibly&#xD;
      apheresis will be performed to understand protective and modulatory T cell and&#xD;
      monocyte/macrophage responses. Subjects will receive treatment for helminth infection and&#xD;
      treatment for LTBI will be offered according to current standard of care guidelines. Two&#xD;
      groups of subjects within the LTBI group will be offered bronchoscopy and lavage --- (a)&#xD;
      those with structural lung damage from prior treated/healed tuberculosis and (b) those with&#xD;
      recent prolonged exposure (greater than or equal to 3 months) to a household contact with&#xD;
      active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate CD4+ T cell responses and regulatory T cell responses in&#xD;
      HEL+ and HEL- subjects with LTBI at the time of diagnosis (baseline). HEL+ subjects will then&#xD;
      receive treatment for parasitic infection and both groups (HEL+ and HEL-) will be offered&#xD;
      LTBI treatment. Evolution of the baseline TB-specific immune responses on and after LTBI&#xD;
      treatment will then be studied. Additionally, baseline immune responses to mycobacteria will&#xD;
      be contrasted in the HEL+ group with all time points post treatment for helminth infection. A&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate the immune phenotype and functionality of tissue resident&#xD;
      immune cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage in subjects with LTBI and structural lung&#xD;
      damage from prior treated/healed pulmonary tuberculosis as well as subjects with recent&#xD;
      prolonged TB exposure from an active TB case irrespective of helminth infection status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective is to evaluate if there are subsets of subjects within the LTBI&#xD;
      group (irrespective of helminth infection status) who have stable pool of long lasting&#xD;
      antigen-specific IL-2 only producing CD4+ central memory T cells and changes to this pool&#xD;
      after receiving LTBI treatment.&#xD;
