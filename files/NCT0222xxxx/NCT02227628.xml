    <textblock>
      A human clinical consumption trial will be performed in volunteers with increased risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular disease (Metabolic Syndrome), which includes obesity and diabetes&#xD;
      and related conditions over a period of 12 weeks with blood draws at baseline (0 weeks), 4,&#xD;
      8, and 12 weeks and a 24 hr urine collection on each blood draw day.&#xD;

      1. Experimental Design: Approximately 50 male and female participants between the ages of&#xD;
           18 and 65 years, who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease but have not had a&#xD;
           hospitalization due to cardiovascular disease, were recruited to participate for 12&#xD;
           weeks in this study. All familiarization and testing were conducted at the Exercise &amp;&#xD;
           Sport Nutrition Laboratory (ESNL) in the Department of Health and Kinesiology at Texas&#xD;
           A&amp;M University. Assays were conducted at the Institute of Obesity and Cancer research&#xD;
           Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening and familiarization Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants expressing interest in the study were interviewed by phone to determine&#xD;
           whether they were qualified to participate. The participants who were believed to meet&#xD;
           the eligibility criteria were invited to attend an entry/familiarization session. During&#xD;
           this session, participants completed medical and personal histories, and signed consent&#xD;
           statements in compliance with the Human Participants Guidelines of Texas A&amp;M University&#xD;
           and the American College of Sports Medicine. Participants then underwent a general&#xD;
           physical examination to verify that they met the eligibility criteria. Participants who&#xD;
           satisfied the criteria were familiarized to the study protocol and received a verbal and&#xD;
           written explanation of the study protocol and design. Following baseline measurements,&#xD;
           participants were matched based on gender, age, and BMI and were randomly assigned in a&#xD;
           double-blind manner into control (n=25) or acai supplementation groups (n=25).&#xD;
           Participants were given an appointment time to perform baseline assessments and three&#xD;
           other sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline assessments and dietary intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to baseline testing, participants were recommended not to take any herbal&#xD;
           supplements or anti-oxidant juices such as orange, pomegranate, or acai juice. Vitamin&#xD;
           pills, supplemented sports/energy drinks and large amounts of berries were also to be&#xD;
           avoided. In addition, spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, garlic, carrots,&#xD;
           chocolate, yellow/orange fruits/vegetables and dark green fruits/vegetables were to be&#xD;
           reduced to no more than one serving for 48 hours. Participants were instructed to&#xD;
           refrain from exercise for 48 hours prior to baseline testing. During the baseline&#xD;
           testing, participants recorded all food intake on dietary record forms for four days.&#xD;
           Participants donated 20ml of fasting blood using venipuncture techniques of an&#xD;
           antecubital vein in the forearm. Participants were then asked to drink one 10 oz serving&#xD;
           of the test beverage. A second blood draw was taken two hours after ingestion. All urine&#xD;
           output for the 24 hours leading up to the baseline testing was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Supplementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants were recommended to consume two servings of the test beverage as part of&#xD;
           their current, non-modified diet. Each serving was supplied in a 10 oz bottle, and was&#xD;
           to be consumed both in the morning and in the evening of each day throughout the&#xD;
           duration of the study (12 weeks). Participants in the control group consumed an equal&#xD;
           amount of placebo juice comprised of artificially colored water containing sugar, citric&#xD;
           acid, and a flavor that was identical to the acai beverage, but had no&#xD;
           phytochemical-based constituents throughout the same time period. Participants were&#xD;
           individually instructed on how to adjust their daily caloric intake to account for the&#xD;
           calories of the beverage. All participants picked up weekly supplies of either the acai&#xD;
           beverage or placebo at the Exercise &amp; Sport Nutrition Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants reported back to the lab for follow-up testing at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
           the baseline testing. During each of those testing sessions, the participants completed&#xD;
           the same full battery of tests that were completed during the initial baseline testing.&#xD;
           Participants were asked to maintain a similar diet three days prior to each testing&#xD;
           session in order to monitor the influence of the test beverage. Participants were given&#xD;
           a list of preferred food groups for these three days and asked to stick to them as&#xD;
           closely as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Body composition:&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each baseline measurement and follow-up testing session, height was measured&#xD;
           using standard anthropometry. Total body weight was measured using a Healthometer&#xD;
           (Bridgeview, IL) self-calibrating digital scale with a precision of +/-0.02 kg. Body&#xD;
           composition (excluding the cranium) was determined using a Dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
           absorptiometry (DEXA, Hologic Inc, Waltham, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Blood and urine collection: During each of the testing sessions, participants donated&#xD;
           approximately 2 teaspoons of fasting venous blood (10 milliliters). Blood samples were&#xD;
           obtained using standard phlebotomy procedures using standard sterile venipuncture of an&#xD;
           antecubital vein by ESNL laboratory technicians or graduate research assistance trained&#xD;
           in phlebotomy in compliance with guidelines established by the Texas Department of&#xD;
           Health and Human Services.&#xD;
