      TITLE: A Phase II Study of Dose Density Regimen with Fluorouracil, Epirubicin and&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide at Days 1, 4 Every 14 Days with Filgrastim Support followed by Weekly&#xD;
      Paclitaxel in Women with Primary Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL CODE: IRST 174.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE: II&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacological, open-label, prospective, not randomized, monocentric trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEC + filgrastim x 3 cycles q 14-21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 and day 4 = FEC (FLUOROURACIL 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes + EPIRUBICIN 60 mg/m2&#xD;
      IV infusion of 1 hour + CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 500 mg/m2 IV infusion of 30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 7 until hematological recovery = Filgrastim 300 microg s.c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 21 days from the last FEC cycle = Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV infusion of 1hour (weekly for&#xD;
      8 cycles, at day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: in the first stage, 11 patients have been planned, with an additional 27&#xD;
      patients to the second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: this trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed regimen with&#xD;
      regard to toxicity and deliverability. Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or&#xD;
      higher nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia, nausea/vomit, and bone pain, which might&#xD;
      be a consequence of the administration of filgrastim). Deliverability is measured as the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who complete the planned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapse-free survival: measured from enrollment to the first date between date of&#xD;
           documented relapse (or death) or date of last tumor assessment (if no documented&#xD;
           relapse), or the date of last tumor assessment before the start of any further antitumor&#xD;
           therapy not planned in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival: measured from enrollment to the date of death of any cause or last&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES: to evaluate retrospectively potential biomarkers of activity and&#xD;
      toxicity of this regimen, blood and plasma samples until 15 mL each one will be collected at&#xD;
      study entry, before first docetaxel administration and 3-4 weeks after last docetaxel&#xD;
      administration. Moreover, a paraffin block or specimens of the primary tumor will be&#xD;
      collected for biological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This trial is designed to assess feasibility of the proposed&#xD;
      regimen with regard to toxicity and deliverability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability is defined as absence of any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity&#xD;
      (excluding alopecia, nausea/vomit, and bone pain, which might be a consequence of the&#xD;
      administration of filgrastim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Simon two-stage design has been used with a 60% tolerability rate considered not promising&#xD;
      and an 80% tolerability rate as promising, and probability of type I and type II errors has&#xD;
      been set to be 0.10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, 11 patients have been planned, with an additional 27 patients to the&#xD;
      second stage if at least 7 patients complete the planned treatment. The regimen would be&#xD;
      considered tolerable and worthy of further study if at the end of the trial 27 out 38&#xD;
      patients complete the planned treatment.&#xD;
