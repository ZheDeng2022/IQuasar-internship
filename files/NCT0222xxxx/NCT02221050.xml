  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study conducted in the laboratory revealed the existence of a &quot;window&quot; during which&#xD;
      patients with renal failure appreciate the protein-rich foods. This period, located&#xD;
      immediately after the dialysis, is likely related to the purification of plasma products&#xD;
      resulting from protein catabolism. It therefore appears necessary to understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms that may explain these changes by measurements of ghrelin (orexigenic hormone),&#xD;
      leptin (anorectic hormone) and plasma amino acids.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 24 patients with renal failure treated by hemodialysis, it is evaluated (at 8:00 am and at&#xD;
      11:00 am), a day without hemodialysis and another day after the hemodialysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hunger sensation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olfactory liking assessed separately for 6 foods (2 carbohydrate-, 2 fat- and 2&#xD;
           protein-rich foods) and 2 non-alimentary products,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food wanting evaluated by the sequential presentation of 18 images of food (6 fat-, 6&#xD;
           carbohydrate- and 6 protein-rich foods),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two blood samples for the assays of leptin, ghrelin, creatinine, albumin and pre-albumin&#xD;
           as well as plasma amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
           24 healthy subjects are also evaluated in order to compare the results from patients to&#xD;
           those of control subjects.&#xD;

    <description>The wanting is determined after the successive presentation (for ten seconds) of 18 pictures of food. For each food the question is &quot;at the present time, do you want to eat this food? &quot;. For each photo, subjects place a vertical line on a 10 cm horizontal line bounded at its ends by &quot;no desire&quot; and &quot;extremely envy&quot; (visual analog scale).The wanting for proteins is the mean score for the desire to eat protein-rich foods.</description>
