      This is a sequential Phase I and IIa study to identify the maximum tolerated dose and to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, tolerability, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral&#xD;
      sphingosine kinase inhibitor ABC294640 specifically in patients with diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL), including virus-associated (e.g., KSHV- or EBV-associated) DLBCL or Kaposi&#xD;
      Sarcoma (KS) after failure of or intolerance to initial standard therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sphingosine Kinase (SK) is an innovative target for anti-cancer therapy due to its critical&#xD;
      role in lipid metabolism which drives cancer cell growth. We have found that the SK inhibitor&#xD;
      ABC294640 (which is formulated for clinical use as an oral agent) significantly inhibits and&#xD;
      reverses progression of virus-associated DLBCL in pre-clinical animal models [Qin et a.,&#xD;
      2014]. In addition, we have found that ABC294640 selectively induces death for virus-infected&#xD;
      endothelial cells in a laboratory model relevant to KS, with selective sparing of uninfected&#xD;
      cells [Dai et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015]. Both DLBCL and KS disproportionately impact&#xD;
      patients with immune-deficiencies, including HIV infection, for whom standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic approaches are less effective and incur greater side effects. Therefore,&#xD;
      this trial which utilizes a well-tolerated, oral agent to inhibit SK for DLBCL and KS&#xD;
      patients may provide a unique approach to treatment.&#xD;

             be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before starting&#xD;
             treatment with ABC294640 and either replaced with another appropriate medication or&#xD;
             not given for the duration of the clinical study. Patients on HAART will be restricted&#xD;
