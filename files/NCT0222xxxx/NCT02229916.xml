  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of testicular cancer patients can be cured with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Mortality has been reduced even more within the last 15 years due to the stringent&#xD;
      application of standard chemotherapy followed by resection of residual disease. This is a&#xD;
      positive development considering that testicular cancer usually affects young men. Active&#xD;
      surveillance has become an acceptable and widely used strategy in stage I testicular cancer.&#xD;
      Thus, it is important to follow these patients in a standardized way and to adhere to a&#xD;
      rationale surveillance strategy. There is no international consensus regarding follow-up of&#xD;
      testicular cancer patients. Stratification according to risks and patterns of relapse would&#xD;
      allow to tailor follow-up schedules, aiming at early identification of relapse without&#xD;
      causing unnecessary harm by using excessive radiation in these young long-term survivors.&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures should not only aim at detecting relapse, but also long-term side&#xD;
      effects from therapy, including hypogonadism, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      secondary malignancies. The Swiss Austrian German Testicular Cancer Cohort Study (SAG TCCS)&#xD;
      will comprise consecutive newly diagnosed testicular cancer patients and is the first study&#xD;
      to prospectively evaluate the initial indictor of relapse in testicular cancer patients, the&#xD;
      frequency and pattern of relapse and document long-term toxicities of the treatment&#xD;
      (cardiovascular, gonadal, hearing impairment, renal function and second malignancies) and&#xD;
      psychosocial aspects. This cohort study will determine the relevance of each test performed&#xD;
      routinely during follow-up. The collected data will have direct implications for the care of&#xD;
      patients with testicular cancer and inform future adaptations of follow-up recommendations.&#xD;
      The dataset will give information on baseline factors of testicular cancer patients patients,&#xD;
      current treatment strategies in Switzerland, Austria and Germany, outcome and late sequelae.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the diagnostic performance and the clinical impact of a&#xD;
      variety of tests, including conventional radiographs, computer tomographies (CT), abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, serum tumour markers (AFP, beta-HCG and LDH) and clinical signs and symptoms&#xD;
      aimed at early detection of relapse after curative therapy with documented complete&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the rate of relapses detected on chest x-ray in seminoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the rate of false positive abnormalities on CT scan and of false positive&#xD;
           tumour marker elevations not due to seminomatous or non-seminomatous germ cell tumour&#xD;
           relapses but due to other processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the modality to rule out testicular cancer relapse in patients with false&#xD;
           positive index tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pattern of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess patient characteristics at baseline and at the time-point of relapse&#xD;
           detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the rate of stage I seminoma and non-seminoma patients undergoing active&#xD;
           surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To obtain an overview of treatment and follow-up strategies in germ cell cancer patients&#xD;
           in Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To collect data on treatment sequelae following testicular cancer treatment in terms of&#xD;
           organ function, cardiovascular risk factors, sexual health and socioeconomic aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To determine the rate of intermediate and poor-prognosis disease at relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To determine the rate of offspring spontaneously conceived after testicular cancer&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres All urologists, radiooncologists and oncologists are motivated to enrol their&#xD;
      patients. We will aim at enrolling the majority of patients treated and followed in private&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Consecutive patients with testicular cancer of any type and any stage (incident&#xD;
      cases). Testicular cancers are generally classified as seminomatous (seminoma) and&#xD;
      nonseminomatous germ cell tumours (non-seminoma) of the testis. Mixed germ cell tumours&#xD;
      belong to the group of non-seminomas. The stage of disease and the choice of treatment&#xD;
      (active surveillance vs. chemotherapy vs. radiotherapy) define the risk of relapse, the&#xD;
      pattern of relapse and the long-term toxicities. Staging in testicular cancer is performed&#xD;
      according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) primary tumor, regional nodes,&#xD;
      metastasis (TNM) staging system for testis cancer. Metastatic testicular cancers are&#xD;
      classified according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) risk&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse of testicular cancer will be defined as rising concentrations of serum&#xD;
      alphafetoprotein (AFP) above the upper limit of normal (typically &gt; 13 Î¼g/l) and/or human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) above the upper limit of normal (typically &gt; 5 U/l) and/or&#xD;
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above the upper limit of normal and confirmation of this rise in&#xD;
      a second test four weeks later and/or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease in typical&#xD;
      locations, and/or the presence of active germ cell tumour established by biopsy, whatever&#xD;
      comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be performed (ordered according to their burden for patients and&#xD;
      cost): symptom assessment, physical examination, tumour marker measurement, chest x-ray,&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed according to the mandatory follow-up schedule by a physician who&#xD;
      has substantial experience in the treatment and surveillance of patients with germ cell&#xD;
      tumours. Follow-up comprises thorough assessment of medical history and patients' symptoms&#xD;
      with a focus on pain, appetite, fatigue, sexual function and activities of daily living;&#xD;
      physical examination includes lung auscultation, abdominal, axillary, supra- and&#xD;
      infradiaphragmatic regional lymph nodes and testicular palpation; serum tumour marker&#xD;
      measurement: AFP, HCG and LDH; chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. Even though&#xD;
      the role of LDH in the follow-up is debatable, due to limited sensitivity and specificity and&#xD;
      a high rate of false-positive tests, it can contribute to identify relapse in a significant&#xD;
      number of cases, as shown in a recent publication. All the laboratory and radiological tests&#xD;
      are performed independently and results are not made available to the investigator prior to&#xD;
      symptom assessment and physical examination. In addition we will ascertain cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors (smoking status, lipid profile, bodymass index, fasting glucose etc.), renal&#xD;
      function, testosterone level, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, lutenizing hormone&#xD;
      (LH) level, and socioeconomic characteristics (education, employment, partnership) in annual&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are approximately 400 newly diagnosed testicular cancer patients in Switzerland per&#xD;
      year. In Germany the annual testicular cancer incidence is about 4000. We aim at including&#xD;
      approximately 300 patients per year in Switzerland over a duration of 3 years, with a total&#xD;
      number of 900 patients. We are also aiming at registration of 2000 patients per year in&#xD;
      Germany. Looking at the Swiss cohort, with an estimated 15% rate of relapses over a follow-up&#xD;
      duration of two years, this will yield approximately 135 cases with relapse. This number will&#xD;
      yield satisfactory statistical precision. An assumed sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of&#xD;
      95% for Beta-HCG, for example, to detect a relapse will yield a positive likelihood ratio&#xD;
      (LR) of 10 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.53. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be 42 to 58% for sensitivity, 93 to 97% for specificity, 7.0 to 14.2 for the positive&#xD;
      likelihood ratio and 0.44 to 0.62 for the negative likelihood ratio. An assumed sensitivity&#xD;
      of 37% and a specificity of 99% for CT scans, for example, to detect a relapse will yield a&#xD;
      positive likelihood ratio of 37 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.64. Corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be 29 to 45% for sensitivity, 98 to 100% for specificity, 17.7 to&#xD;
      77.4 for the positive likelihood ratio and 0.56 to 0.72 for the negative likelihood ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of diagnostic accuracy will be determined in relation to the occurrence and&#xD;
      timepoint of diagnosis of a relapse as specified above. Tests that were positive within the&#xD;
      previous 8 weeks of established diagnosis of relapse will be considered as true positives,&#xD;
      tests that remained negative during this time period as false negatives. Conversely, tests&#xD;
      that were positive before this time period will be considered as false positives, and tests&#xD;
      that were negative before this period as true negatives. We will use a multi-level model with&#xD;
      random effects at the level of patients and time-points to estimate sensitivities and&#xD;
      specificities and likelihood ratios, with the data organised in long format, with each test&#xD;
      outcome (positive or negative) at each time-point represented by one line in the dataset,&#xD;
      determining for each time-point whether it is within the 8-week time-period previous to the&#xD;
      time-point of established diagnosis of relapse. The model takes into account the correlation&#xD;
      of multiple time-points and tests within patients. The positive LR indicates how much more&#xD;
      likely it is to find a positive test in patients with a relapse (sensitivity) as compared&#xD;
      with those without relapse (1-specificity). Conversely, the negative LR specifies how much&#xD;
      less likely it is to find a negative test in patients with relapse (1-sensitivity) as&#xD;
      compared to patients without (specificity). A test will be considered to provide clinically&#xD;
      relevant power to rule in or out a relapse if the positive and negative LRs are above 5 or&#xD;
      below 0.2, respectively. The test will be considered to have a strong power to rule in or out&#xD;
      a relapse if LRs are above 10 or below 0.1, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As measures of the clinical impact of the addition of more extensive tests, we will examine&#xD;
      the net re-classification improvement and the integrated discrimination improvement. The net&#xD;
      re-classification improvement through the addition of a more extensive test is defined as the&#xD;
      improvement of the probability of the appropriate classification of patients according to&#xD;
      relapse status (presence or absence of a relapse), which is afforded by the addition of the&#xD;
      more extensive test. This corresponds to the sum of differences in proportions of individuals&#xD;
      classified positive minus the proportion classified negative for individuals who develop&#xD;
      events, and the proportion of individuals classified negative minus the proportion classified&#xD;
      positive for individuals who do not develop events. The integrated discrimination improvement&#xD;
      is defined as the improvement in average sensitivity afforded by the addition of the more&#xD;
      extensive test minus the potential loss in specificity afforded by the addition of the more&#xD;
      extensive test. All analyses will be done using Stata, Release 11 (Stata Corp LP, College&#xD;
      Station, TX).&#xD;
