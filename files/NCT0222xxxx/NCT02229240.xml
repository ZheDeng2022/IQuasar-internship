    <textblock>
      This Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter,&#xD;
      treat-to-target study of 26 weeks treatment duration will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      once-weekly albiglutide versus placebo as add-on to intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy&#xD;
      (with or without metformin) in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Approximately&#xD;
      450 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: albiglutide&#xD;
      + intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy (with or without metformin) or placebo +&#xD;
      intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy (with or without metformin. The total duration of a&#xD;
      subject's participation will be approximately 32 weeks.&#xD;
