  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Tumor Associated&#xD;
      Peptide Antigen (TAPA) pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines in the treatment of progressive&#xD;
      and/or refractory hematologic malignancies (HM). We hypothesize that treatment of patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and/or refractory HM, without available potentially curative treatment options,&#xD;
      and whose neoplastic cells express at least one (1) TAPA of a defined panel of TAPAs, using&#xD;
      low-dose cyclophosphamide (CYP) followed by an autologous, monocyte-derived, TAPA-pulsed DC&#xD;
      vaccine and low-dose granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), will result&#xD;
      in TAPA-specific T-cell responses without significant toxicities. We also hypothesize CD4+&#xD;
      T-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses generated against specific TAPAs may translate into clinical&#xD;
      antitumor activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with progressive and/or refractory hematologic malignancies, who have&#xD;
      failed conventional therapy and have no potentially curative therapeutic options available,&#xD;
      will be candidates for this Phase I/II study. Following confirmation of disease progression&#xD;
      and/or refractoriness, eligible patients who agree to participate and sign a consent form&#xD;
      will have their neoplastic cells and/or blood analyzed for the expression of a specific panel&#xD;
      of Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPAs), including SP17, Ropporin, AKAP4, PTTG1 and&#xD;
      Span-xb. Patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of these TAPAs will receive three (3)&#xD;
      days of subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to increase&#xD;
      bone marrow production of monocytes and dendritic cell (DC) precursors, and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells will be obtained by phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis for generation of&#xD;
      autologous DCs. Patient's DCs will be generated at Kiromic's Cell Processing GMP facility,&#xD;
      according to established Standard Operating Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them&#xD;
      with the TAPA(s) relevant for each particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of&#xD;
      low-dose cyclophosphamide prior to each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg&#xD;
      activity. TAPA-pulsed DCs will be administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 x 107 DCs at least&#xD;
      two (2) days following cyclophosphamide administration. DC vaccination schedule will be once&#xD;
      every fourteen (14) days via subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) injections for a total of&#xD;
      6 vaccinations. Low dose GM-CSF will also be administered SC for five (5) consecutive days,&#xD;
      starting three (3) to six (6) hours after each TAPA-pulsed DC treatment, to optimize immune&#xD;
      response and DC viability in vivo. Patients will be followed on a weekly basis (or more&#xD;
      frequently if required) to evaluate treatment-related toxicity. Immune responses and&#xD;
      anti-tumor responses will be evaluated per protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping&#xD;
      rules for the study will be defined based on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and/or immune&#xD;
      efficacy (Phase II).&#xD;
