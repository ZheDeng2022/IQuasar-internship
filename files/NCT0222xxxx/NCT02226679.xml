    <textblock>
      The objective of this extension study is to evaluate the safety and potential beneficial&#xD;
      effects of the Algisyl-LVR™ device in patients with established heart failure secondary to a&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy. The results of this study will provide confirmatory evidence of the&#xD;
      long-term safety and effectiveness of the Algisyl-LVR in patients with established heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of Algisyl-LVR&#xD;
      in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic origin. The&#xD;
      evaluation for the primary measure of efficacy (Peak VO2) at 6 months will be&#xD;
      investigator-blinded. The primary safety endpoint, while not blinded, is 30 day all-cause&#xD;
      mortality and an objective assessment. The remaining study endpoints will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of the device through the evaluation of functional, structural, biochemical, and&#xD;
      electrocardiographic evaluations at 6 and 12 months. Evaluation of adverse events and these&#xD;
      assessments will also provide evidence of the safety profile of the device in patients with&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-enrollment baseline patient evaluation will include clinical assessment, assessment of&#xD;
      New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, blood tests, transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography, MRI, electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX), submaximal&#xD;
      exercise testing, and quality of life assessments. Blinded central evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed for measures of cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cardiac imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Note: The local CPX and echocardiography measurements will be used to determine patient&#xD;
      eligibility with respect to the peak V02 values, ejection fraction and the left ventricular&#xD;
      end diastolic dimension indexed to body surface area (LVEDDi). The core lab values for these&#xD;
      same assessments will be used in all statistical analyses of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's eligible for this study completed at least 12 months of follow in the control group&#xD;
      of the lead-in study LSH-10-001 and provided a written informed consent to participate in&#xD;
      study LSH-001. A written informed consent to be enrolled in study LSH-11-001 is required for&#xD;
      all patients electing participation in this roll-over study. After written patient informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained and verification of eligibility, patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria can be included in the study and will have the Algisyl-LVR™ device&#xD;
      (implants) administered during a surgical procedure. Patients will be considered part of this&#xD;
      study cohort as soon as they have been hospitalized to receive the Algisyl-LVR device. The&#xD;
      investigator will complete the &quot;Premature Withdrawal from Follow-up&quot; form in the patient's&#xD;
      eCRF for study LSH-10-001 and indicate &quot;Patient will receive the Algisyl-LVR device&quot; as the&#xD;
      reason for premature withdrawal from LSH-10-001. The acute response to device implant will be&#xD;
      monitored intraoperatively via continuous electrocardiographic cardiac monitoring, arterial&#xD;
      pressure lines, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and pulmonary artery catheter.&#xD;
      Patients receiving the investigational device are expected to remain hospitalized for 5 to 14&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up in this study is divided into two phases. During the first phase, referred to as&#xD;
      the &quot;efficacy phase&quot;, repeat testing of patient functional and cardiac structural parameters&#xD;
      will be conducted at follow-up visits scheduled at 3 months and 6 months, and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter. Follow-up testing will be supplemented by a 30 day (post implant) telephone&#xD;
      contact with all patients. The efficacy phase of the trial will end on a common closing date&#xD;
      after a minimum of 6 months of follow-up (i.e., after the last patient enrolled has been&#xD;
      completed the 6 month visit). At that point data analysis will be performed and an initial&#xD;
      study report will be generated. Following completion of the efficacy phase, long-term&#xD;
      monitoring will continue through each patient's 24-month visit. This second phase is referred&#xD;
      to as the &quot;extended follow-up phase&quot;. During this phase, data collection will be focused on&#xD;
      long-term safety and will be conducted at 6-month intervals.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who completed at least 12 months of follow in the control group of the&#xD;
             lead-in study LSH-10-001 are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have completed all study related procedures for the 12 month, 18 month&#xD;
             or 24 month visit in Protocol LSH-10-001. Study procedures completed for the 12, 18 or&#xD;
             24 month visit in study LSH1-10-001 will be used as the baseline (screening) and&#xD;
             qualifying procedures for study LSH-11-001 if the procedure was performed within 60&#xD;
             days of the date of Algisyl-LVR implant (screening procedures outside this window must&#xD;
             be repeated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patients must be able and willing to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patients will be adult (age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 79 years) males or females&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patients must be on stable, evidence-based therapy for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             Evidence-based therapy for heart failure is defined as an ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I),&#xD;
             and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) for patients at stable doses for 1 month&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, if tolerated, and a beta blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol&#xD;
             succinate, Nebivolol or bisoprolol) for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated.&#xD;
             Recent up-titration of the beta blocker is acceptable if the patient has been stable&#xD;
             on this dose for 1 month prior to enrollment. Stable is defined as no more than a 100%&#xD;
             increase or a 50% decrease in dose. Contraindications or intolerance to therapies&#xD;
             should be documented. In those intolerant to both ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy&#xD;
             with hydralazine and oral nitrate should be considered. Therapeutic equivalence for&#xD;
             ACE-I substitutions is allowed within the enrollment stability timelines. Aldosterone&#xD;
             inhibitor therapy should be added when NYHA Class III or IV symptoms occur on standard&#xD;
             therapy. If aldosterone inhibitor therapy is to be administered in NYHA Class II&#xD;
             patients, it must be initiated and optimized prior to enrollment. Eplerenone requires&#xD;
             dosage stability for 1 month prior to enrollment. Diuretics should be used as&#xD;
             necessary to keep the patient euvolemic. All heart failure therapeutics and dosages&#xD;
             should be documented in the Case Report Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Note: CRT or CRT-D are acceptable co-therapy, if placed &gt; 3 months before implant of&#xD;
             Algisyl-LVR or the investigator does not anticipate within 6 months after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patients will have a left ventricular ejection fraction equal to or less than 35%&#xD;
             via echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, radionuclide scan, or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (measured within the last 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patients will have a left ventricular end diastolic dimension indexed to body&#xD;
             surface area (LVEDDi) of 30 to 40mm/m2 (LVEDD/BSA) (measured within the last 30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have symptomatic heart failure with a Peak VO2 of 9.0 - 14.5 ml/min/kg&#xD;
             (performed using a bicycle ergometer). Patients must perform two CPX tests (within 60&#xD;
             days of the Algisyl-LVR procedure and performed at least 20 hours apart) that differ&#xD;
             by no more than 15% in the observed value for Peak VO2 and have a mean value of 9.0 -&#xD;
             14.5 ml/min/kg from these two tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient's surgical risk must be considered reasonable and the evaluation of surgical&#xD;
             risk should include review of coronary and left ventricular angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If female, the patients must be (a) post-menopausal, (b) surgically sterile, or (c)&#xD;
             using adequate birth control and have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to administration of study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients for whom it is planned to receive CABG, MVR, heart transplantation or LVAD&#xD;
             within the next 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have undergone a previous mid-sternotomy surgical procedure are excluded&#xD;
             unless the surgeon's assessment is that the left sided limited thoracotomy is feasible&#xD;
             and considered reasonable surgical risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients presenting with a restrictive cardiomyopathy such as due to amyloidosis,&#xD;
             sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient with a history of constrictive pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a Q wave myocardial infarction (MI) within the last 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a recent history of stroke (within 60 days prior to the surgical&#xD;
             procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A left ventricular (LV) wall thickness of the LV free-wall, at the mid-ventricular&#xD;
             level, of less than 8 mm (screening echocardiography must confirm a minimum wall&#xD;
             thickness of 8 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with a serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Clinically significant liver enzyme abnormalities, i.e., AST(SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) more&#xD;
             than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of severe COPD (i.e., FEV 1&lt; 1 liter or FEV1 &lt; 50% predicted)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patients will not be receiving concurrently an investigational Product in another&#xD;
             clinical trial or have received an investigational Product in another clinical trial&#xD;
             in the 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A life expectancy of less than 1 year or any other condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the clinical investigator, might compromise any aspect of the trial&#xD;
