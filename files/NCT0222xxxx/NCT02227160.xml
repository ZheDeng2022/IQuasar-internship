  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is conducting a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with low-income African American suicide attempters. Guided by the Theory of Triadic&#xD;
      Influence (TTI), this pilot randomized controlled trial aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if psychosocial group intervention (PGI) is more effective than enhanced&#xD;
           treatment as usual (ETAU) in reducing suicidal behavior (ideation, attempts; primary&#xD;
           outcome) and improving its correlates (depressive symptoms, hopelessness, quality of&#xD;
           life) (secondary outcomes) in low-income African Americans with a recent attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine if PGI is more effective than ETAU at bolstering intrapersonal (I),&#xD;
           social/situational (SS), and cultural/environmental (CE) risk and protective factors&#xD;
           that mediate the condition-suicidal behavior and correlates link and thus serve as&#xD;
           mechanisms of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine I, SS, and CE variables that moderate the condition-suicidal behavior link&#xD;
           and thus serve as predictors of intervention outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for Aim 1: At post-intervention and follow-up, PGI participants will evidence&#xD;
      greater improvements in suicidal behavior and its correlates than those in ETAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for Aim 2: Changes in these risk and protective factors will account for condition&#xD;
      effects on outcomes: (1) psychological distress, aggression, impulsivity, substance abuse,&#xD;
      low self-esteem, and suicide acceptability (I-risk); (2) perceived burdensomeness and&#xD;
      thwarted belongingness, relationship discord, intimate partner violence perpetration and&#xD;
      victimization (SS-risk); (3) access to a weapon and barriers to service utilization&#xD;
      (CE-risk); (4) reasons for living, optimism, positive ethnic identity, effective coping, and&#xD;
      spiritual well-being (I-protective); (5) overall family health and social support from family&#xD;
      and friends (SS-protective); and (6) religious involvement and effectiveness of obtaining&#xD;
      resources (CE-protective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for Aim 3: Individuals (1) having fewer Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders (DSM) disorders and attachment styles characterized by positivity toward the&#xD;
      self and others (I); (2) children and more limited trauma histories (SS); and (3) more daily&#xD;
      hassles and less exposure to community disorder (CE) will evidence greater reductions in&#xD;
      suicidal behavior and its correlates and greater enhancements in quality of life at&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention will be paid to Theory of Triadic Influence intrapersonal, social/ situational, and&#xD;
      cultural/ environmental risk and protective factors that impact outcomes. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that compared to enhanced treatment as usual, through targeting Theory of&#xD;
      Triadic Influence-risk and protective factors the culturally-informed, Theory of Triadic&#xD;
      Influence-driven, empowerment based psychosocial group intervention will more positively&#xD;
      alter trajectories in suicidal behaviors and its correlates. The rationale is that upon study&#xD;
      completion, if data support the psychosocial group intervention value, they will facilitate&#xD;
      our long-term goal of disseminating evidence-based culturally-relevant interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the hypothesis that at post-intervention and 6 and 12-month follow-up,&#xD;
      compared to individuals in ETAU, those in the PGI will endorse less I, SS, and CE risk&#xD;
      factors, reduced suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness, and greater levels&#xD;
      of I, SS, and CE protective factors as well as increased quality of life, the study&#xD;
      procedures will be as follows: Male and female participants between the ages of 18-64 will be&#xD;
      recruited in the medical and psychiatric emergency rooms at GHS. Once the individual has been&#xD;
      medically cleared and has provided informed consent, he/she will be screened for study&#xD;
      appropriateness by trained project team members (10-20 minutes). If he/she meets inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, study participation will include a 3-hour interview. All study measures will be&#xD;
      read to each participant. Measures will assess background variables, suicidal behavior,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, hopelessness, quality of life, and I, SS, and CE risk and protective&#xD;
      factors. All measures are psychometrically sound and appropriate for use with an African&#xD;
      American population. Once the interview is over, the participant will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the PGI (10 group therapy sessions) or the ETAU condition (participation in a support&#xD;
      group focused on suicidal behaviors plus suicidal behavior monitoring and help with accessing&#xD;
      resources). The PGI, conducted in accord with the culturally informed, TTI-guided, and&#xD;
      empowerment based group protocol, and the support group will be unstructured; both groups&#xD;
      will last 120 minutes. Following the completion of the PGI or ETAU condition, the individuals&#xD;
      will be assessed at post-intervention (3 hours), and at 6 month and 12 month follow-ups (3&#xD;
      hours each). To increase retention and reduce suicide risk, reminder phone calls will be made&#xD;
      and texts sent on Relieflink, a suicide prevention app that received 1st prize in an App&#xD;
      Challenge sponsored by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.&#xD;
