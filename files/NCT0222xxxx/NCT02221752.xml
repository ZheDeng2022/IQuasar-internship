  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to a national study in 2002, the prevalence of ID, IDA, and ID+IDA among pregnant&#xD;
      women in China was 42.6%, 9.1%, and 61.7% respectively. A similar study in Hebei province at&#xD;
      the same time showed that the prevalence of IDA among pregnant and lactating mothers was&#xD;
      46.39% and 47.21% respectively. There was a significant difference between urban and rural&#xD;
      areas. Women living in rural areas had higher chances of having IDA (p&lt;0.01). WHO and UNICEF&#xD;
      recommend taking iron, folic acid and multiple micronutrients during pregnancy. However, we&#xD;
      don't know much about their influence on maternal and infant health and their clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness. Health Department of China recommends taking 400ug folic acid before pregnancy&#xD;
      and during early pregnancy. But for various reasons, not all expecting mothers take this&#xD;
      advice. Besides, we don't have a national level technical standard of how to take nutrition&#xD;
      supplements during pregnancy. Therefore, it's crucial for us to study if iron/folic acid or&#xD;
      folic acid only can prevent perinatal complications, as well as their influences on infant&#xD;
      and toddler health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether taking iron/folic acid and folic acid only from&#xD;
      early pregnancy until delivery will lower the chances of pregnancy complications, and to see&#xD;
      how supplements affect gestation results. As well, it will evaluate a) whether taking iron&#xD;
      supplement during pregnancy can prevent IDA during pregnancy; b) whether taking iron&#xD;
      supplement can increase mother and fetus iron storage; and c) how mother's iron level affects&#xD;
      newborn's iron level. We hope to understand nutrition conditions during pregnancy and&#xD;
      investigate the relations between pregnancy diet and complications during pregnancy, weight&#xD;
      gain during pregnancy, and newborn birth weight. We will evaluate the influence of taking&#xD;
      iron and folic acid during pregnancy on the health of infants and toddlers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common single nutrient disorder, differentially&#xD;
      affecting pregnant women and infants everywhere. The study was conducted in China, a rapidly&#xD;
      developing country where ID often occurs among pregnant women and infants in the absence of&#xD;
      generalized undernutrition. The study was a collaboration between Peking University First&#xD;
      Hospital and three local hospitals (Sanhe Maternity and Child Health Care Center [MCHC],&#xD;
      Sanhe General County Hospital, and Sanhe Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine). Eligible&#xD;
      pregnant women were enrolled from June 2009 through December 2011 and randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive iron and folic acid or folic acid only. The study protocol was approved by&#xD;
      the institutional review board of Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China. Women&#xD;
      were recruited (n=2367) at their first prenatal visit at Sanhe MCHC. Those with uncomplicated&#xD;
      singleton pregnancies and first prenatal visits ≤ 20 weeks gestation were invited to&#xD;
      participate. Women were randomized and received 2 supplements: iron/placebo and folic acid.&#xD;
      Project personnel instructed the participants to take two capsules per day (one of each kind&#xD;
      of supplement) from enrollment to delivery. Participants received a 3-month supply of each&#xD;
      supplement upon enrollment and at the second study visit (26-30 weeks). The number of doses&#xD;
      received and consumed or missed was recorded by project personnel. The primary outcomes were&#xD;
      maternal iron status at follow-up visits (26-30 weeks and 36-40 weeks), cord-blood iron&#xD;
      status, and infant gestational age and birth weight. Data analysis compares pregnancy iron&#xD;
      level between two study groups and how it relates to pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy&#xD;
      and delivery complications, preterm rate, perinatal death rate, and birth rate. Data analysis&#xD;
      also includes evaluating pregnancy nutrition conditions and analyzing associations with&#xD;
      weight changes during pregnancy, and rates of pregnancy diabetes, pregnancy high blood&#xD;
      pressure, fetus growth restriction, low birth weight, and fetal macrosomia. Up to 75% of&#xD;
      pregnant women worldwide are anemic, with about half due to ID. The public health&#xD;
      implications of study findings could be profound.&#xD;
