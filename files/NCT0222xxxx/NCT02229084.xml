      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new investigational cancer vaccine, P10s-PADRE in&#xD;
      combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in patients with clinical&#xD;
      stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide&#xD;
      mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with clinical stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, multi-site Phase I/II study designed with the two goals being (1) to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of combining vaccination with the P10s-PADRE formulation with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and (2) to determine if the polymerase chain reaction (pCR) rate&#xD;
      among ER-positive, HER2-negativebreast-cancer patients treated with the combination is&#xD;
      significantly higher than the 8% rate observed among ER-positive breast-cancer subjects in a&#xD;
      pooled analysis of seven randomized clinical trials. P10s-PADRE vaccine with MONTANIDE™ ISA&#xD;
      51 VG as adjuvant will be given in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in female&#xD;
      patients with clinical stage I, II or III ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This combined Phase I/II feasibility-and-efficacy study will have three parts. Part 1 will be a Phase I evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of the Chemovax to assess the timing of vaccination relative to chemotherapy. Five different Chemovax schedules (Schedule A, B, C, D, and E) will be sequentially evaluated. Once such a feasible schedule is identified, the study will proceed with its second and third parts. Part 2 (primary efficacy) and Part 3 (expanded efficacy) will respectively constitute Stages 1 and 2 of the Phase II primary-efficacy evaluation of Chemovax using a Simon optimal two-stage design.</intervention_model_description>
