  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Over one million patients in the US are estimated to undergo mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation every year, and approximately 300,000 of them fail attempts at weaning. The&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of these patients is greater than in patients who are successfully&#xD;
      weaned. It follows that treatments aimed at reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      have the potential to benefit society both in terms of human suffering and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fail attempts at weaning assist their inspiratory muscles during inhalation by&#xD;
      recruiting their expiratory muscles during exhalation. Unfortunately, this recruitment occurs&#xD;
      relatively late during a weaning trial. The knowledge that (a) expiratory muscle recruitment&#xD;
      can assist inspiration, (b) the recruitment of the expiratory muscles is delayed during&#xD;
      weaning, and (c) that the respiratory muscles in patients requiring mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      are in a catabolic state raises the possibility that strategies designed to produce an early&#xD;
      recruitment, and improve the strength, of the expiratory muscles could improve weaning&#xD;
      outcomes in difficult to wean patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigation, which will be conducted in healthy subjects and in ambulatory&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at Edward Hines Jr. VAH (Aims 1&#xD;
      and 2), and in patients who are difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation at RML&#xD;
      Specialty Hospital, Hinsdale, IL (Aim 3), has been designed to develop and assess a novel&#xD;
      triggering algorithm (VentFree), that controls the delivery of non-invasive neuro muscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (NMES) to the abdominal-wall muscles during exhalation, and to study&#xD;
      the physiological (respiratory) responses to such stimulation in assisting respiration in&#xD;
      healthy subjects, in ambulatory patients with COPD and in patients requiring pronged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

        Aim 1 and Aim 2:Healthy Subjects and Ambulatory COPD Patients Studied at Hines VAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects (Hines VAH), Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of acute or chronic respiratory disease, cardiac or neuromuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ambulatory COPD patients (Hines VAH), Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic airway obstruction defined as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of&#xD;
             70% predicted or less, ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital&#xD;
             capacity (FEV1/FVC) of 0.7 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable clinical condition without an exacerbation during the preceding four weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 3: Patients being weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation (RML Specialty&#xD;
        Hospital), Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of neuromuscular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received mechanical ventilation for at least 14 days and the primary&#xD;
             physician judges the patient is ready to start weaning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to breathe spontaneously for more than 5 minutes and less than 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable: oxygen saturation &gt; 90% with a fractional inspired oxygen ≤ 0.40,&#xD;
             external PEEP ≤ 5 cm H2O, temperature ranging from 35.5 to 38.5Co, no intravenous&#xD;
             administration of vasoactive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria for all potential participants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with implanted electronic devices - such as cardiac pacemakers,&#xD;
             defibrillators and intrathecal pumps - will be excluded because NMES could cause&#xD;
             malfunction of those devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only subjects with intact abdominal-wall skin will be enrolled because NMES can cause&#xD;
             discomfort when applied over skin that is irritated or on open wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy will be a contraindication to participate in the study because it is unknown&#xD;
             whether the application of NMES to the abdominal or lumbar area during pregnancy may&#xD;
             produce adverse effects.&#xD;
