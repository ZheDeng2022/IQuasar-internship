  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its prevalence worldwide, osteoporosis is considered a serious public health concern.&#xD;
      The worldwide annual incidence of Osteoporotic fractures is approximately 2 million in the US&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip fracture is associated with serious disability and excess mortality. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that an initial osteoporotic fracture is a major risk factor for a new fracture. An increased&#xD;
      risk of 14.8% for a secondary hip fracture has been demonstrated in people that have already&#xD;
      sustained a fracture in the past 4 years (In average). These data indicate the major&#xD;
      opportunity afforded by secondary fracture prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By responding to the first fracture, we can reduce the incidence of second and subsequent&#xD;
      fractures. However, even after longer medical follow-up according to regular standard of&#xD;
      care, medical treatment and rehabilitation, the medical system has been unable to translate&#xD;
      the eminent risk into an effective preventive treatment.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a treatment, follow up and rehabilitation protocol for patients who suffered&#xD;
           from a hip fracture, in order to prevent a secondary fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that a combined treatment from the Hip Fractures Clinic as well as the&#xD;
           regular standard treatment and rehabilitation suggested by the Bone Health Clinic (both&#xD;
           in addition to standard medication prescribed for osteoporosis) will result in a&#xD;
           significant reduction of second and subsequent fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study protocol will begin after the patients, who have been admitted with a primary&#xD;
           hip fracture (of osteoporotic nature), were surgically treated (as customary standard of&#xD;
           care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. According to hospitalization standard protocol, the patients will be treated with&#xD;
           vitamin D and calcium. For the first month the patient will be given a loading dose of&#xD;
           70,000 units. For the next months the patients will receive 50,000-80,000 units per&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the patient will be treated with Calcium Pills (Caltrate TAB 600mg, once a&#xD;
           day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition to the clinical customary monitoring tests performed during the&#xD;
           hospitalization, Biomarkers and safety assessment will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Vitamin D&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bone Markers - Bone markers will be taken three days after the patient was&#xD;
                admitted, and one more time six months later (as part of follow up visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow up visits after hospitalization due to surgery for primary hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Follow up visits at the Hip Fracture Clinic will occur in intervals of: six weeks,&#xD;
                3 months, 6 months and a year, since the patient had been released from&#xD;
                hospitalization. At follow up visit, the patient will be assessed for physical&#xD;
                examination, hip X-ray and the rehabilitation progression Questionnaire (HHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Follow up visits at the Bone Health Clinic will occur between 6 weeks to 3 months&#xD;
                since the patient had been released from hospitalization (as part of regular&#xD;
                standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A 3cc Serum sample will be taken with the purpose to serve on future studies and&#xD;
                examine new markers such as bone markers SCLEROSTIN. There will be no further use&#xD;
                of these samples. The samples will remain in deep freeze temperature (CËš70-).&#xD;
