    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of the&#xD;
      combination of nilotinib and MEK-162 that can be given to patients with CML or acute&#xD;
      leukemia. Researchers also want to learn if the drug combination can help to control the&#xD;
      disease. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 5 groups of up to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 60 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of nilotinib and MEK-162 you receive will depend on&#xD;
      when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the starting dose&#xD;
      combination level. The next group will receive a higher dose of MEK-162 than Group 1, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. If intolerable side effects are seen, the next group may&#xD;
      receive a lower dose level of nilotinib and/or MEK-162. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable combination dose is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive nilotinib and MEK-162 at the highest dose&#xD;
      that was tolerated in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take nilotinib and MEK-162 two times every day by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in Phase 1 of the study will start taking MEK-162 on Day 1 and&#xD;
      nilotinib on Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Phase 2 of the study will be divided in 2 groups: one group will start&#xD;
      MEK-162 on Day 1 and nilotinib on Day 2, while the other group will start MEK-162 on Day 1&#xD;
      and nilotinib on Day 8. You will be placed in a Phase 2 treatment group based on the&#xD;
      characteristics of your disease type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs&#xD;
      every day. Bring in any unused study drugs and bottles to each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease does not appear to get better after 1 or 3 cycles, you may be able to receive&#xD;
      a higher dose of the study drug as long as you are not already receiving the highest dose&#xD;
      planned for this study. The study doctor will tell you if you can receive a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG and either a MUGA scan or an ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycles 2, 3, and every 3 cycles after that (6, 9, 12, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12, blood (about 3-4 tablespoons each time) will be&#xD;
      drawn for tests to check how the disease is responding to therapy. If the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed, these tests may be performed more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8-12 weeks, you will have a MUGA scan or an ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an eye exam by an eye doctor at the end of Cycles 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months after that until the End of Study Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood draws and/or bone marrow aspirations at any time that the doctor thinks&#xD;
      it is needed while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can take up to 12 cycles of nilotinib and MEK-162 on study. If the disease responds a&#xD;
      certain way (called a hematological response) while you are on study, you may be able to&#xD;
      continue taking the study drugs longer than 12 months, as long as the doctor thinks you are&#xD;
      benefiting from the treatment. Even if the disease has not responded in this way, you may be&#xD;
      able to continue taking the study drugs if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You&#xD;
      will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you come off study before the end of Cycle 12, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG and either an ECHO or a MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an eye exam by an eye doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about how you are feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you come off study at the end of Cycle 12, you will not have the End of Study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side&#xD;
      effects and/or any new treatment(s). This call will last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Nilotinib is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat CML and philadelphia-positive acute leukemia. MEK-162 is not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The&#xD;
      combination of nilotinib and MEK-162 to treat CML and Philadelphia-positive acute leukemia is&#xD;
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 90 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
