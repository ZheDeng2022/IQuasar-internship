    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an increasingly recognized syndrome of unknown&#xD;
      etiology comprised of a collection of disorders that share specific pathologic, serologic,&#xD;
      and clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological analysis of biopsy specimens remains the cornerstone in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      IgG4- related disease. Elevated concentrations of IgG4 in tissue and serum are helpful in&#xD;
      diagnosing IgG4-related disease, but neither one is a specific diagnostic marker. Correlation&#xD;
      with specific histopathological findings is essential, regardless of the serum IgG4&#xD;
      concentration, the number of IgG4-positive plasma cells in tissue, or the ratio of IgG4 to&#xD;
      IgG in tissue. Misdiagnoses of IgG4-related disease are increasingly common because of&#xD;
      excessive emphasis on moderate elevations of serum IgG4 concentration and overreliance on the&#xD;
      finding of IgG4-positive plasma cells in tissue.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IgG4 is a unique antibody in both structure and function. This molecule accounts for less&#xD;
      than 5% of the total IgG in healthy persons and is the least abundant IgG subclass. In&#xD;
      contrast to IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3, serum IgG4 concentrations among ostensibly healthy people&#xD;
      vary by a factor of more than 100 (normal range, 0.01 to 1.4 mg per milliliter), but IgG4&#xD;
      concentrations within individual persons are generally stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an increasingly recognized syndrome of unknown&#xD;
      etiology comprised of a collection of disorders that share specific pathologic, serologic,&#xD;
      and clinical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These different conditions were previously thought to be unrelated [2-4]. The commonly shared&#xD;
      features include tumor-like swelling of involved organs, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate&#xD;
      enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and variable degrees of fibrosis that has a&#xD;
      characteristic &quot;storiform&quot; pattern. In addition, elevated serum concentrations of IgG4 are&#xD;
      found in 60 to 70 percent of patients with IgG4-RD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major presentations of this condition, which often affects more than one organ, are type&#xD;
      1 autoimmune pancreatitis (IgG4-related pancreatitis) and salivary gland disease; the later&#xD;
      may present as salivary gland enlargement or as sclerosing sialadenitis (formerly termed&#xD;
      &quot;Mikulicz disease&quot; and Küttner's tumor, respectively). These conditions often resemble&#xD;
      Sjögren's syndrome but are pathophysiologically distinct from this disorder. The preferred&#xD;
      name for the overall condition is IgG4-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of IgG4-bearing plasma cells is required for a diagnosis of IgG4- related&#xD;
      disease, but IgG4-positive cells are found in a wide variety of inflammatory infiltrates, and&#xD;
      the detection of substantial numbers of IgG4- positive plasma cells is therefore not&#xD;
      diagnostic of IgG4-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissues from patients with IgG4-related disease show diffuse infiltrates of IgG4-bearing&#xD;
      plasma cells, in contrast to the focal aggregates of IgG4-bearing cells that are detected in&#xD;
      most other inflammatory mimickers of this condition. A diffuse plasma-cell infiltrate with&#xD;
      more than 30 IgG4-positive cells per high power field and a ratio of IgG4 to IgG that is&#xD;
      higher than 50% provides compelling evidence of IgG4-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine the clinical data from the computerized database of Meir Hospital for&#xD;
      patient with unknown IGG4-related disease with high serum levels of IGG4 that were admitted&#xD;
      for hospitalization for any reason in a period of 14 years, from January 2000 to June 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since biopsy has proven to be the hallmark in diagnosing IGG4 RD, we decided to complete the&#xD;
      investigation in a pool of patients to whom high IGG4 serum levels where confirmed and to&#xD;
      whom biopsies from any suitable tissue where obtained for other reasons than IGG4 RD and then&#xD;
      to perform specific staining for IGG4 to those samples, by sending them back to the pathology&#xD;
      service at our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore clinical and other laboratory features of each positive patient will then be&#xD;
      correlated from the history of admission of each patient.&#xD;
