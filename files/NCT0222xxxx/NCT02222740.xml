        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Presence of of typical hip and/or knee joint symptoms. Involvement of at least 1 hip or&#xD;
        knee joints that had warranted treatment with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs&#xD;
        (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitors and/or acetaminophen (APAP) for the&#xD;
        last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiographic evidence within the last 6 months of OA in the index joint, with Grade II to&#xD;
        IV severity, as illustrated by the Atlas of Standard Radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects were otherwise in generally good health, as determined by the investigator,&#xD;
             on the basis of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
             screening laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects were either physically incapable of childbearing or were practicing an&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control and had a negative pregnancy test result&#xD;
             demonstrated before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had experienced a suboptimal response to APAP and NSAID therapy (including&#xD;
             COX-2 inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had used opioids for OA pain on an as needed (PRN) or occasional basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects were willing and able to discontinue or modify their current medication used&#xD;
             for management of OA pain per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had steady, not transient, pain and a categorical pain rating of moderate to&#xD;
             severe on a scale of none, mild, moderate, or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects weighed &gt; or = to100 lbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a subject had taken any inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 [CYP450j), these&#xD;
             were discontinued and an appropriate washout period (5 half-lives) had occurred before&#xD;
             entry in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects were able to take oral medication and were willing to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects had known allergies or previous, significant reactions to opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had any laboratory abnormality at screening that was considered clinically&#xD;
             significant by the investigator, or that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             have contraindicated study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects were known to have positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV), hepatitis B antigen, or hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;

          -  Subjects had a history of chronic, scheduled opioid use for OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had any signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had a history of substance or alcohol abuse within 2 years before study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects had received any steroid therapy (e.g., oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or&#xD;
             soft tissue) within 1 month of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had a condition that would contraindicate the use of opioid analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had participated in a study of an investigational drug or device, or had&#xD;
             donated blood, within 30 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects used any medication that the investigator felt would interact unfavorably&#xD;
             with the study medication (e.g., potentiation of sedation with tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects had used opioid analgesics for more than 3 days during the 30 days before&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
