    <textblock>
      RRR is a phase II, randomized, multicenter, clinical study to assess the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of ranibizumab treatment administered in subjects with radiation retinopathy.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of 3 arms; intravitreal (IVT) monthly vs. ranibizumab&#xD;
      treatment administered IVT monthly combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation vs.&#xD;
      ranibizumab treatment administered IVT for three months followed by as needed treatment of&#xD;
      ranibizumab combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation over 48 weeks. From week 52 to&#xD;
      week 101, all 3 treatment arms will employ a treat and extend protocol for IVT ranibizumab&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Subject's will receive monthly treatment of an intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for 48 weeks.&#xD;
Starting at week 52, subject's will enter a treat &amp; extend regime, if a subject achieves a &quot;dry&quot; macula. For a macula to be considered &quot;dry&quot; persistent or recurrent fluid must be resolved on spectral domain (SD)-optical coherence tomography (OCT). The interval between injections will not exceed 12 weeks. After a subject is extended beyond 4-weeks &amp; develops recurrent disease activity, the eye is treated &amp; the treatment interval for the next visit is reduced by 1 week, compared to the previous treatment interval. The interval between treatments will be reduced by 1-week intervals until a dry macula is again established. Once a dry macula is again achieved, the interval between visits will be extended by 1-week intervals again.</description>

          <title>Cohort A</title>
          <description>Subject's will receive monthly treatment of an intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab for 48 weeks.&#xD;
Starting at week 52, subject's will enter a treat &amp; extend regime, if a subject achieves a &quot;dry&quot; macula. For a macula to be considered &quot;dry&quot; persistent or recurrent fluid must be resolved on SD-OCT. The interval between injections will not exceed 12 weeks. After a subject is extended beyond 4-weeks &amp; develops recurrent disease activity, the eye is treated &amp; the treatment interval for the next visit is reduced by 1 week, compared to the previous treatment interval. The interval between treatments will be reduced by 1-week intervals until a dry macula is again established. Once a dry macula is again achieved, the interval between visits will be extended by 1-week intervals again.&#xD;

        <description>Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a common imaging modality used to visualize the layers of the macula. Central mean thickness (CMT) is the length in microns from the internal limiting membrane to Bruch's membrane.</description>

Starting at week 52, subject's will enter a treat &amp; extend regime, if a subject achieves a &quot;dry&quot; macula. For a macula to be considered &quot;dry&quot; persistent or recurrent fluid must be resolved on SD-OCT. The interval between injections will not exceed 12 weeks. After a subject is extended beyond 4-weeks &amp; develops recurrent disease activity, the eye is treated &amp; the treatment interval for the next visit is reduced by 1 week, compared to the previous treatment interval. The interval between treatments will be reduced by 1-week intervals until a dry macula is again established. Once a dry macula is again achieved, the interval between visits will be extended by 1-week intervals again.&#xD;
