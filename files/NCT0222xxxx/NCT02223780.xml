  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and, despite existing treatment&#xD;
      options, progressive lung disease. Patients with COPD often have only limited access to&#xD;
      palliative care. The goal of this research project is to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background In many cases, the symptoms of advanced COPD (including shortness of breath, pain&#xD;
      and depression) are insufficiently alleviated. In addition, often in connection with an&#xD;
      infection, patients frequently suffer from respiratory decompensation; this may lead to&#xD;
      invasive interventions as well as the admission to the emergency room or an intensive care&#xD;
      unit. It may ultimately lead to the death of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim This study aims to show that early palliative care can reduce the number of necessary&#xD;
      invasive interventions and improve the quality of life of patients with COPD. For this&#xD;
      purpose, a group of patients receiving early, standardized palliative care will be compared&#xD;
      to a group of patients receiving customary treatment only, without systematic intervention by&#xD;
      palliative care experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The results of this study should make it possible to efficiently use the medical&#xD;
      resources which are required for the appropriate care of patients with COPD. The goal is the&#xD;
      best possible quality of life and better coordination of the measures taken, especially with&#xD;
      regard to the area of acute care and the wishes of the patient.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the introduction of&#xD;
      early specialized palliative care on hospital, intensive care unit and emergency admissions&#xD;
      of patients with severe and very severe COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of early palliative care on the mood and anxiety of patients with severe and very&#xD;
      severe COPD The impact of early palliative care on the health-related quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with severe and very severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of early palliative care on the prescription of antibiotics during the last month&#xD;
      of life of patients 4. The impact of early palliative care on advance care planning and&#xD;
      end-of-life decision-making will be compared between the two groups Methodology Randomized&#xD;
      study to one of the two groups in a ratio without stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration 3 years Study Center(s) Single-center study Number of Subjects 180 patients&#xD;
      Intervention Early specialized palliative care intervention Significance Given the trends&#xD;
      toward aggressive and costly care near end-of-life among patients with COPD, a timely&#xD;
      introduction of palliative care may limit unnecessary and burdensome personal and societal&#xD;
      costs, and invasive approaches. The results of this study may provide some direction for&#xD;
      future palliative care interventions in this particular population&#xD;
