      - Statement of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      peri-implant bone is affected by excessive mechanical stress, the mechanism of bone formation&#xD;
      is reduced and the bone resorption is increased, leading to MBL. Isidor F. 2006, Warreth A,&#xD;
      009 A drilling sequence using a drill that is smaller than the implant diameter has been&#xD;
      applied as a way to obtain enough initial stability.Bilhan H,2010 However, the implant can be&#xD;
      extremely compressed or exceed the torque, which can be higher than the elastic limit of bone&#xD;
      when a drill that is smaller than the implant diameter is used. This may affect the bone&#xD;
      surrounding the implant and may also lead to a micro fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frost mentioned that alveolar bone density is changed by micro deformation due to&#xD;
      modification of the physical condition. Bone resorption and fibrous tissue production&#xD;
      progress if the micro deformation rate is higher than 3,000 micro strain (με). Also,&#xD;
      continuous bone replacement occurs while woven bone appears. Wolff J.1986 Bone tissue adapts&#xD;
      to the change of stress while minimizing its weight and transforming its structure. Frost&#xD;
      HM,1989 The bone formation mechanism is inhibited and the bone resorption mechanism is&#xD;
      enhanced if excessive mechanical stress is applied to alveolar bone during implantation,&#xD;
      resulting in the progression of marginal bone loss (MBL). Isidor F.2006 , Warreth A,2009-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for carrying out the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success and survival rate of an implant are directly associated with primary stability.&#xD;
      Friberg B,et al 1991 Primary stability is achieved with initial rigid fixation of implants&#xD;
      during the surgery and considered necessary for a successful osseointegration. Sennerby L,et&#xD;
      al 1992, Rodrigo D,et al 2010 There are two different processes of bone formation at implant&#xD;
      sites; contact and distance osteogenesis. Contact osteogenesis infers new bone formation in&#xD;
      direct contact with the implant surface. Distance osteogenesis is the new bone formation on&#xD;
      the surfaces of the parent bone and occurs when primary stability is absent at implant site.&#xD;
      Davies JE.et al 2003, Sivolella S,et al2012&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is a gap between the implant surface and bone, a clot will fill the space and will&#xD;
      be replaced by a provisional connective matrix that will act as scaffold for formation of&#xD;
      woven bone. Berglundh T,et al,2003 , Rossi F,2012 Our study will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      oversized drilling on implant success and secondary stability&#xD;
