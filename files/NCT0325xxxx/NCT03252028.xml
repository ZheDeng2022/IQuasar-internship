      Background: Due to anatomical restrictions, the inflammatory response to intra-cerebral&#xD;
      bacterial infections exposes swollen brain tissues to pressure and ischemia, resulting in&#xD;
      life-threatening damage. However, diagnosing meningitis in patients after neurosurgery is&#xD;
      complicated, due to brain tissue damage and changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by&#xD;
      surgery. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a local, acute-phase protein. Previous studies on&#xD;
      community-acquired septic meningitis reported high levels of intrathecal-produced HGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of present study is to evaluate a new platform for qualitative determination of&#xD;
      HGF in body fluids and revealing the site of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Based on a reverse-methachromacy method, strips are prepared. The surface on the&#xD;
      strip changes colour to blue upon contact with HGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: CSF, urine and sputum of patients that develop fever post neurosurgery are analysed&#xD;
      with the test and the results compared with conventional diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical value: A rapid, equipment-free test gives the opportunity to identify the infectious&#xD;
      focus in the infected organ long before culture results are available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is local acute phase protein with regenerative properties that&#xD;
      become biologic inactive during chronic inflammation and loses the binding affinity to&#xD;
      glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular ma-trix. HGF is excreted into the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract and is not detected in normal urine. Nosocomial meningitis can occur when brain&#xD;
      surgical procedures are complicated by infection. Due to underlying CNS disease processes and&#xD;
      CNS devices in situ, the principal agents of nosocomial bacterial meningitis differ from the&#xD;
      agents of community-acquired meningitis. For example, in nosocomial infections, slow growing,&#xD;
      opportunistic microorganisms predominate. The CSF leukocyte profile is affected by&#xD;
      intracerebral haemorrhage, and CSF lactate might be elevated, due to ischemia. Moreover,&#xD;
      altered consciousness can make it difficult to establish a diagnosis in patients on&#xD;
      ventilators that develop fever after neurosurgical operations. In other words, it is often&#xD;
      difficult to determine whether the injured brain has been invaded by environmental bacterial&#xD;
      flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the challenges in establishing a diagnosis, and the lack of gold standards, physicians&#xD;
      are motivated to treat suspected infections in serious dis-eases with broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics. The emerging problems of multiple-resistance bacteria, high costs, and&#xD;
      complications related to new antibiotics have called for diagnostic tests that can minimize&#xD;
      antibiotic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis remains based on standard methods of direct&#xD;
      microscopy, differential analyses of white blood cells, lactate, and protein, and cultures of&#xD;
      blood and CSF . However, post-neurosurgical infections are difficult to distinguish from the&#xD;
      effects of neurosurgical procedures. Moreover, due to prophylaxis treatments, the cultures&#xD;
      are negative in a large group of patients, and the presence of skin flora, like Coagulase&#xD;
      negative Staphylococcus or Propionbacterium acnes, may indicate either infection or&#xD;
      contamination. Survival from this life-threatening condition depends on a rapid diagnosis and&#xD;
      prompt empirical antibiotic therapy designed to cover the likely pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the focus of infection? Is it a bacterial (septic) meningitis? Is the broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic administration indicated? The background of the project: An invasion of bacteria&#xD;
      into the central nervous system (CNS) is followed by a rapidly evolving inflammatory process&#xD;
      that affects the arachnoid space, the pia mater, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This&#xD;
      condition leads to clinical symptoms of headache, fever, and meningism. The inflammatory&#xD;
      response is caused by the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines from meningeal cells&#xD;
      into the subarachnoid space. As a result, neutrophils move into the subarachnoid space and&#xD;
      cause pleocytosis in the CSF. The consequences include the breakdown of the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier, cerebral oedema, reduced cerebral blood flow, focal areas of hypo perfusion,&#xD;
      vascular thrombosis, ischemia, enhanced glucose metabolism via the anaerobic glycolytic&#xD;
      pathway, and enhanced lactate accumulation in the brain and CSF [1]. Survival from this&#xD;
      life-threatening condition depends on a rapid diagnosis and prompt empirical antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy designed to cover the likely pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other causes of febrile meningitis include acute viral meningitis and non-pyogenic&#xD;
      meningitis, where the clinical picture is typically sub-acute or chronic. The diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures consist of a lumbar puncture to analyse the CSF for cells and bacteria,&#xD;
      microbiological cultures of blood and CSF, serological tests involving PCR and&#xD;
      antigen-detection, and radiographic techniques [2]. In community-acquired meningitis, a&#xD;
      combination of discriminating values from the CSF analysis can differentiate acute bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis from other, non-ambulatory causes with quite high sensitivity [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nosocomial meningitis can occur when brain surgical procedures are complicated by infection&#xD;
      [2]. Due to underlying CNS disease processes and CNS devices in situ, the principal agents of&#xD;
      nosocomial bacterial meningitis differ from the agents of community-acquired meningitis. The&#xD;
      CSF leukocyte profile is affected by intra-cerebral haemorrhage, and CSF lactate might be&#xD;
      elevated, due to ischemia. Moreover, altered consciousness can make it difficult to establish&#xD;
      a diagnosis in patients on ventilators that develop fever after neurosurgical operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is produced by mesenchymal cells during organ injury. It is&#xD;
      produced as a single-chain precursor protein, and it is activated at the site of injury by&#xD;
      proteolysis cleavage, resulting in a double-chained active form of HGF [4]. Active HGF&#xD;
      stimulates cell division [4] and cell motility, and it promotes normal morphogenic structure&#xD;
      [5] in epithelial cells adjacent to injured areas. Thus, HGF induces regeneration and re-pair&#xD;
      of damaged tissue [6]. High levels of systemic HGF have been detected during injuries caused&#xD;
      by infection [7]. In bacterial meningitis, pneumonia and acute bacterial gastroenteritis,&#xD;
      there is local production of HGF at the site of infection [7-9]. HGF produced locally during&#xD;
      bacterial infection is biologically active [10]. Application of biologically active HGF&#xD;
      promoted healing of chronic leg ulcers in a pilot study [11]. Effective antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      reduces systemic HGF levels during infection [12-13]. HGF might be regarded as a local acute&#xD;
      phase protein with healing properties [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of endogenous HGF binding to receptors can be assessed with surface plasmon&#xD;
      resonance (SPR), an optical technique appropriate for clinical studies that can determine the&#xD;
      affinity of a protein for several ligands [15]. SPR-based assessment of HGF binding affinity&#xD;
      for its receptors, c-Met and heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG), could rapidly and&#xD;
      sensitively distinguish HGF variants with different biological activities [16-17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously studied the concentration of HGF in CSF for patients with community-&#xD;
      acquired meningitis [7]. We have also shown that the presence of biologically active HGF at&#xD;
      the site of injury indicates an acute local inflammation [18]. During a recent study we have&#xD;
      assessed whether HGF concentrations and HGF binding affinity for its receptors might serve as&#xD;
      markers to distinguish between meningitis associated with neurosurgery and other causes of&#xD;
      infection. We determined the concentration and binding affinity of HGF in patients with&#xD;
      either community-acquired meningitis or neurosurgery-associated meningitis, and compared the&#xD;
      results to either patients with Alzheimer's disease or controls with normal CSF. We have&#xD;
      shown that determination of HGF in CSF might be used as an indicator, complementary to&#xD;
      clinical status and routine laboratory findings, for diagnosing bacterial invasion into the&#xD;
      CSF at an early stage of disease [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report: 76 years old woman with high blood pressure was found by her neighbours,&#xD;
      unconscious in her garden 28th October 2009. The CT scan revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage&#xD;
      and neuro-angiography revealed 3 aneurysms. She was admitted to the Department of&#xD;
      neurosurgery and operated 29th October with ventricular drainage and endovascular occlusion&#xD;
      of the aneurysms. She was extubated post-surgery however she suffered from left arm and leg&#xD;
      paralysis and tiredness. Since 30th October she had low grade of fever and slightly increased&#xD;
      CRP and procalcitonin. Cerebrospinal fluid showed 170.000 red and 630 white blood cells and&#xD;
      lactate 5.8. The chest X-ray showed a suspect infiltration. The blood and CSF cultures were&#xD;
      secured. The cultures taken from 5th November revealed significant growth of Enterobacter&#xD;
      cloacae and Staphylococcus aurous in urine and growth of Staphylococcus aurous in the&#xD;
      nasopharynx. She received no antibiotic therapy and the parameters decreased spontaneously&#xD;
      but low grade of fever continued. The CSF blood cells increased to 23000 red and 106 white&#xD;
      blood cells (11th November), and CSF lactate was 4.5 (lumbar drainage). Although CRP was in&#xD;
      the normal range she received meropenen 2g x 3 under suspicion bacterial meningitis. First on&#xD;
      19th November the CSF cultures taken on 11th November revealed growth of Propionibacterium&#xD;
      acnes. The antibiotic regime continued until 23th November. She suffered from disorientation,&#xD;
      fatigue, and had hydrocephalus. She underwent shunt operation 23th November. She died 2nd&#xD;
      December 2009. High concentration of HGF and elevated binding affinity to HSPG was found in&#xD;
      CSF analysis already 2nd November.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the challenges in establishing a diagnosis, and the lack of gold standards, physicians&#xD;
      are motivated to treat suspected infections individually because there is no diagnostic&#xD;
      method that can identify the infections focus in time. PCR for bacterial panel and virus&#xD;
      detection in CSF is sensitive method. However it might detect the colonized bacteria as well.&#xD;
      The presence of bacteria is not the same as infection. Therefore in cases of bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis especially post brain surgery and the foreign bodies that are inserted in the&#xD;
      brain we cannot rely on positive or negative cultures totally. A complementary method (for&#xD;
      the standard available methods at laboratory) with high negative predictive value increases&#xD;
      the specificity of tests and decreases the costs, time and complications such as hospital&#xD;
      acquired infections (HAI) profoundly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Method, Reverse Methachromacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N-terminus of HGF (Hairpin Loop) has been identified as the binding site to both c-Met&#xD;
      and HSPG. There is a high correlation between binding of HGF to HSPG and to dextran sulphate&#xD;
      in SPR system (fig 1). Metochromasia is a characteristic colour change that certain aniline&#xD;
      dyes exhibit when bound to chromo trope substances [19].This phenomenon has been widely used&#xD;
      in the study of tissue sections. Methylene blue (O-toluidine) is considered an excellent&#xD;
      metachromatic dye. Upon binding to high molecular weight polysaccharides, such as dextran&#xD;
      sulphate, the colour of the indicator solution changes from blue to red [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of dextran sulphate and O-toluidine in different proportions produce purple-red&#xD;
      coloured solutions of varying intensity. Coated customized filter papers make up surfaces&#xD;
      that are placed on strips. When in con-tact with biological solutions, the sample HGF&#xD;
      competitively replaces O-toluidine for binding to dextran sulphate and the colour of the&#xD;
      surface returns to blue (Fig 2). This platform detects the presence of HSPG-binding proteins&#xD;
      such as HGF in body fluids including expectorant, urine, ulcer secretions, cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid, and joint effusion during infection. High amounts of protein or high pH do not cause&#xD;
      non-specific reactions with this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study leader: Amir Ramezani&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF specimens, urine and sputum (n=500) are collected from patients (1-99 years old) that&#xD;
      have undergone brain tumour surgery, intracerebral haemorrhage, shunt dysfunction or skull&#xD;
      fracture. The specimens are kept frozen in -20° C until analyses were performed. There are no&#xD;
      exclusion's criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls Alzheimer's disease (n=20)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF samples were collected and kept frozen from patients (N=20) that were diagnosed with&#xD;
           Alzheimer's disease at the Memory Clinic, Skåne University Hospital in Malmö. The&#xD;
           revised DSM-III and NINDS-ADRDA criteria were used for diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia&#xD;
           (this study group has been included in previous study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal CSF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This group consists of patients who have undergone lumbar puncture to rule out&#xD;
           meningitis, and they had normal CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of ligand-binding affinity with surface plasmon resonance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biological activity of HGF is analysed with SPR. We measure the binding affinity to&#xD;
           HSPG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and to a c-Met recombinant chimera (R&amp;D&#xD;
           Systems), as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of HGF concentrations in samples A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
           assay (ELISA) kit (Quantikine Human HGF immunoassay, minimum detectable limit: 0.04&#xD;
           ng/mL; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to determine HGF concentrations in&#xD;
           CSF, sputum and urine according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements&#xD;
           were performed with an ELISA reader (Expert96; AsysHitech GmbH, Eugendorf, Austria) at&#xD;
           450 nm, which was calibrated with the recombinant human HGF reference samples and the&#xD;
           standards provided in the kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reverse methachromacy The study strip test is performed on all specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine laboratory assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF is analysed to determine parameter values at the Departments of Clinical Chemistry,&#xD;
           University Hospitals, in Linköping. All cultures, PCR assays, antigen detection assays,&#xD;
           and serological assessments are performed at the Department of Microbiology, University&#xD;
           Hospital, Linköping, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF-cells: Performed by manual phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss) using Jessen Chamber&#xD;
           for counting the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils&#xD;
           and monocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF lactate: Performed using benchtop blood gas analyzer ABL 800 (Radiometer Medical ApS&#xD;
           Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antigen detection: Antigen (Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Neisseria&#xD;
           meningitides group A, group B/Escherichia coli K1, group C and group Y/135,&#xD;
           Streptococcus agalactiae) is detected by latex agglutination method Pastorex Meningitis™&#xD;
           (Bio-Rad, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CSF culture: Performed in aerobe and anaerobe flasks as well as in Hematin plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Virus detection PCR: Herpes virus type 1 and 2 (HSV1, HSV 2) and HZV DNA were detected&#xD;
           by PCR. Human enterovirus (HEV) was analysed by automated instrument (Cepheid&#xD;
           GeneXpert).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because the HGF concentrations and binding affinity data are not normally distributed,&#xD;
           non parametric tests Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test or the&#xD;
           Wilcoxon matched pairs test are appropriate for analysis. The analysis of test&#xD;
           performance shall be performed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation of the Platform in a Dextran Sulphate-Containing Gel Using reverse&#xD;
      methachromacy approach we have studied a total of 656 faeces samples with The sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value as well as the accuracy&#xD;
      were calculated in the following groups: verified infectious gastroenteritis (n=207) and&#xD;
      other causes of diarrhoea, including IBD (n=268). The test could distinguish acute infectious&#xD;
      gastroenteritis with a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity 92.4%, and a positive predictive&#xD;
      value of 90.9% and negative predictive value of 97.2%. The accuracy of test was 94.3%. No&#xD;
      significant correlation between the test results and faeces calprotectin were found&#xD;
      (R2=0·056). No significant correlation was observed between the results of the index test and&#xD;
      the presence of blood in the faeces (R2=0·08) [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of HGF as a marker to distinguish septic meningitis from other causes of&#xD;
      pleocytosis [18] The community-acquired septic meningitis showed significantly higher HGF&#xD;
      concentration (p=0.0133), as well as HGF binding affinity to the c-Met and HSPG receptors&#xD;
      (p=0.0007 and p=0.0009, respectively) compared to nosocomial meningitis. CSF samples from&#xD;
      patients with septic meningitis (including both community-acquired and nosocomial) was&#xD;
      significantly higher in HGF concentrations (p=0.0014), HGF binding to HSPG (p&lt;0.0001), and&#xD;
      HGF binding to c-Met (p&lt;0.0001) compared to samples from patients with aseptic (viral and sub&#xD;
      acute) meningitis. CSF samples from patients with septic meningitis was higher from samples&#xD;
      from the control group (patients with normal CSF) and from patients with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      in HGF concentration (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.0010, respectively), HGF binding to HSPG (p&lt;0.0001 and&#xD;
      p=0.9, respectively), and HGF binding to c-Met (both p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to samples from patients that had undergone neurosurgery and had other infectious&#xD;
      diseases, CSF samples from patients with nosocomial meningitis had significantly higher HGF&#xD;
      concentrations (p&lt;0.0001) and HGF binding affinity to c-Met (p&lt;0.0001) and HSPG (p=0.043)&#xD;
      receptors (Figure 3-4).&#xD;

      The rapid evolution and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in parallel with&#xD;
      insufficient development of new active drugs seriously affect future anti-infective therapy&#xD;
      of bacterial infections, especially those due to Gram-negative rods. Experts in the field&#xD;
      estimate that by the next decade the world will have witnessed the wide dissemination of&#xD;
      untreatable (or next-to untreatable) infections, both within and beyond hospitals. To avoid&#xD;
      or at least attempt to retard this crisis, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to&#xD;
      elucidate factors favouring the emergence and global spread of antimicrobial resistant&#xD;
      bacteria. An effective strategy to limit the emergence of multiple resistant strains might&#xD;
      include directing the antibiotic therapy by identifying cases that should or should not be&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics, avoiding wide-spectrum antibiotic administration, and promoting&#xD;
      more specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is needed is a simple, accurate, cost-effective and feasible test that answers to&#xD;
      crucial questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the clinical relevance and the performance of such a test there is not a&#xD;
      better environment than the Swedish healthcare that provides the relevant and modern&#xD;
      assessment of diseases and evidence-based therapy for nearly all patients. Such an&#xD;
      environment is an opportunity to perform the patient inclusion and evaluation of the study&#xD;
      test in comparison to the most reliable standard tools such as cultures, blood tests and&#xD;
      X-rays. These resources are not available automatically in any other centre with such&#xD;
      reliable, non-commercial and impartial properties.&#xD;
