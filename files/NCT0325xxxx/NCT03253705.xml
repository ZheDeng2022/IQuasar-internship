      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to provide samples to help us study the genes your blood cells are&#xD;
      making as well as the proteins, sugars, fats, vitamins and other metabolites found in your&#xD;
      blood or urine. Blood samples may also be collected to make special cells. These are called&#xD;
      induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be&#xD;
      converted into any type of cell. Researchers want to study in the lab iPSCs that are derived&#xD;
      from blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect samples to help study genes, proteins, sugars, fats, vitamins, and other&#xD;
      metabolites found in blood or urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-time research study participants at NIH will have an initial visit for this study that&#xD;
      should last no more than 1 hour. All other visits should last 20 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a limited history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have routine blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are giving a blood sample, they must have a hemoglobin level checked in the&#xD;
      past 12 months to make sure it is safe for them to give a blood sample for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a venous blood collection. They may do this at several visits. They&#xD;
      will lie on a recliner or couch or sit in a chair. A needle will be placed into a vein in the&#xD;
      hand or arm, using sterile techniques. Blood will be withdrawn into multiple syringes or&#xD;
      tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to provide urine in an appropriate container...&#xD;

      Our department is evaluating various aspects of the cardiovascular system and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and/or inflammation in disease states, such as, but not limited to,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other pulmonary vascular diseases, arteriosclerosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
      transplantation, inflammatory processes and sepsis. The collection of human blood and urine&#xD;
      from both research subjects and healthy volunteers is necessary for the development of&#xD;
      relevant laboratory assays and protocols, and to further research studies requiring such&#xD;
      evaluations. In research subjects undergoing renal replacement therapy who produce limited&#xD;
      urine we may also sample ultrafiltrate as a surrogate for urine. This protocol defines in&#xD;
      general terms the purposes for which blood, urine and ultrafiltrate will be collected by&#xD;
      members of the NIH s Clinical Center (CC), Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) and&#xD;
      collaborating institutions and establishes general conditions under which sampling will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
