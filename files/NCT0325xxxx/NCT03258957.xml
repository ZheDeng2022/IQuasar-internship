      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe inflammatory disorder of the intestine that&#xD;
      primarily affects very low birth weight (&lt;1,500 g)/very preterm infants (≤32 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation); it is also the leading cause of death in the neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (NICU).Perhaps the best form of treatment for NEC is prevention. Mother's breast milk is best&#xD;
      for preventing NEC. Breast milk contains both nutritional components (proteins, amino acids,&#xD;
      fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals) and bioactive components (macrophages, T cells,&#xD;
      cytokines, hormones, and growth factors) that have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties.The current NICU breast milk feeding procedure exists as a means of ensuring that&#xD;
      infants have consistent access to their mother's breast milk even if the mother is not able&#xD;
      to spend time in the NICU. The process also allows for stricter quality and infection&#xD;
      control, as well as computerised inventory and monitoring via electronic health&#xD;
      records.However, the process deprives infants of the benefits of the cellular content of&#xD;
      breast milk, including the stem cells.The primary objective of this study isto evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety ofproviding very preterm infants (born at &lt;30 weeks' gestation) with&#xD;
      fresh milk (within 4 hours of expression).While we acknowledge that as a pilot the study will&#xD;
      not be powered to detect a statistically significant difference, our secondary objective is&#xD;
      to identify if this approach has the potential to improve infant outcomes, particularly with&#xD;
      regards to the occurrence of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that it is feasible for many mothers to provide at least 1 feed of fresh&#xD;
      breast milk (&lt;4 hours post expression per day, and is not frozen, chilled or pasteurized) and&#xD;
      that this may decrease the prevalence of NEC&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe inflammatory disorder of the intestine&#xD;
      that primarily affects very low birth weight (&lt;1,500 g)/very preterm infants (≤32 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation); it is also the leading cause of death in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&#xD;
      The incidence of NEC (≥stage 2) in very preterm infants across Canada is 5% and increases as&#xD;
      gestational age at birth decreases, with an incidence of 13% in infants born at &lt;25 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation and 10% in infants born at &lt;29 weeks' gestation. Overall mortality from the disease&#xD;
      has been reported to range from 15 to 30%, with more severe cases of NEC having a higher&#xD;
      mortality rate.For infants who survive there is a significant risk of long-term complications&#xD;
      and morbidity including neurodevelopmental issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for NEC. Infants are initially managed&#xD;
      medically through bowel rest (cessation of oral feeds), abdominal decompression,&#xD;
      administration of broad spectrum antibiotics, and provision of supportive care including&#xD;
      parental nutrition, ventilator support, and blood transfusions as necessary. Should bowel&#xD;
      perforation occur then surgery is required to remove damaged tissue and gas build up through&#xD;
      laparotomy and/or primary peritoneal drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps the best form of treatment for NEC is prevention. Mother's breast milk is best for&#xD;
      preventing NEC. Breast milk contains both nutritional components (proteins, amino acids,&#xD;
      fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals) and bioactive components (macrophages, T cells,&#xD;
      cytokines, hormones, and growth factors) that have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties. More recently, Hassiotou4 showed that breast milk is also a rich source of&#xD;
      pleuripotent stem cells that when ingested by the infant, enter the blood stream and are&#xD;
      incorporated into major organ systems in the infant. Although their function is unknown, it&#xD;
      is possible that they benefit the infant through growth or regeneration. The evidence&#xD;
      strongly suggests that fresh breast milk may have a protective effect against both infection&#xD;
      and NEC. When mother's own breast milk is not available the options are donor breast milk or&#xD;
      formula. The use of formula in low birth weight/preterm infants has been reported to increase&#xD;
      the risk of developing NEC when compared with donor breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, current practices related to handling and use of human milk raise questions about&#xD;
      whether we are deriving maximum benefit from their use. Currently, in the standard neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) breast milk expressed by mothers of preterm infants is frozen and&#xD;
      stored in the milk bank. When the infant requires oral feeds an order is placed with the milk&#xD;
      bank, the oldest batch of milk defrosted, fortifier added as needed, and the milk then sent&#xD;
      to the NICU for use. The act of freezing breast milk,either at -20°C or -80°C, along with the&#xD;
      passage of time decreases the energy content and reduces the levels of several of the most&#xD;
      useful components in the milk, including fat, carbohydrate,secretory immunoglobulin&#xD;
      A,lactoperoxidase,lysozyme, antibacterial factors,and antioxidants. In addition to the&#xD;
      decrease in these components, any stem cells in the milk have a half-life of 4 hours, so the&#xD;
      defrosted milk does not contain any stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current NICU breast milk feeding procedure exists as a means of ensuring that infants&#xD;
      have consistent access to their mother's breast milk even if the mother is not able to spend&#xD;
      time in the NICU. The process also allows for stricter quality and infection control, as well&#xD;
      as computerised inventory and monitoring via electronic health records.However, the process&#xD;
      deprives infants of the benefits of the cellular content of breast milk, including the stem&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The primary objective of this study isto evaluate the feasibility and safety&#xD;
      ofproviding very preterm infants (born at &lt;30 weeks' gestation) with fresh milk (within 4&#xD;
      hours of expression).While we acknowledge that as a pilot the study will not be powered to&#xD;
      detect a statistically significant difference, our secondary objective is to identify if this&#xD;
      approach has the potential to improve infant outcomes, particularly with regards to the&#xD;
      occurrence of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that it is feasible for many mothers to provide at least 1 feed of fresh&#xD;
      breast milk (&lt;4 hours post expression per day, and is not frozen, chilled or pasteurized) and&#xD;
      that this may decrease the prevalence of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Study design The study will be a prospective cohort analytic design. Mothers who agree&#xD;
      to be enrolled in the study will be assigned to the intervention group. In the intervention&#xD;
      group, mothers will be asked to provide at least 1 feed of fresh milk (i.e. within 4 hours of&#xD;
      milk expression) per day. Mothers who do not agree to provide fresh milk but are willing to&#xD;
      allow their information to be collected and analyzed will be assigned to the control group.&#xD;
      In the control group, the current standards of breast milk handling and feeding apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population will include infants and their mothers admitted to&#xD;
      participating NICUs (Zhengzhou Hospital, Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Nanjing&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, Zhejiang Maternity Hospital, Xiangya Second Hospital, Shanghai First&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital, Nanjing Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Children's Hospital of Fudan&#xD;
      University) which admits, on average, 500 infants per year who would be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. The goal is to enroll 100 infants in each of the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups in the study. Eligible infants will include those born at &lt;30 weeks&#xD;
      gestation,and who have never received infant formula. For inclusion in the intervention&#xD;
      group, the mother must bewilling to commit to providingat least 1 feed of fresh breast milk a&#xD;
      day, 7 days a week. Infants with major congenital anomalies, receiving palliative care, or&#xD;
      where illness of the mother or infant prevents the administration of breast milk feeds in the&#xD;
      first week of the infant's life will be excluded from the trial.Infants whose mothers are&#xD;
      unable to commit to providing at least 1 feed of fresh breast milk a day but who are willing&#xD;
      to have their data collected may be included in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Eligible mothers will be approached at their first visit to the NICU following&#xD;
      their infant's admission. Ideally enrollment should occur before the infant's first oral&#xD;
      feed. All mothers enrolled in the study will follow the standard protocol in their NICU for&#xD;
      feeding their infant breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Outcomes will be measured from birth until discharge or transfer to another neonatal&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomeof the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Feasibility as defined by the percentage of mothers who can provide at least 1 feed of&#xD;
      fresh milk a day from study enrollment until the infants are 32 weeks CGA, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rates of enrollment in the intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of retention in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compliance with the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Number of days with at least 1 feeds of fresh milk (within 4 hours of expression)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Number of feeds per day with fresh milk&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Number of feeds using frozen mother's own milk or donor milk&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Number and type of critical incident reports including feeding errors 2. The&#xD;
                secondary outcomes of the study will be (definitions as per Canadian Neonatal&#xD;
                Network):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1)NEC stage 2 or above (2)NEC stage 1 (3)Mortality (4)Need for surgery for NEC (5)Late-onset&#xD;
      sepsis (6)Growth as measured by weight, length, head circumference (7)Retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (8)Bronchopulmonary dysplasia Study Procedures Feeding protocol Standard&#xD;
      procedures - feeding and milk fortification: Infants born at &lt;30 weeks' gestation are&#xD;
      initially provided with nutrition intravenously (total parenteral nutrition, TPN). If the&#xD;
      infant is not suffering from any condition that affects gastrointestinal system functioning,&#xD;
      oral feeds are introduced as early as possible. Milk is introduced into the stomach through a&#xD;
      nasogastric (NG) tube according to a schedule that is dependent on the infant's weight at&#xD;
      birth. The amount of milk is very small at first and then gradually increased if the infant&#xD;
      tolerates the milk. The frequency of feeding varies but is most often every 2 hours or every&#xD;
      3 hours depending on the weight of the infant. As the amount of milk being fed to the infant&#xD;
      increases, the amount of TPN provided is decreased until the infant is receiving all its&#xD;
      nutrition from milk (see typical Feeding Guidelines appended to this protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the infant is receiving all its nutrition from milk ('full enteral feeds'), fortifiers&#xD;
      and other nutritional supplements are added to each feed. The first supplement added is human&#xD;
      milk fortifier, four days later extra protein is also added , and then a further 3 days later&#xD;
      vitamins and iron are added to each feed (see Feeding Guideline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother's own expressed breast milk is the food of choice, following by donor breast milk, and&#xD;
      then formula. The supplementation or replacement of mother's own milk by donor milk or&#xD;
      formula is dependent on the mother's ability to produce milk in sufficient quantity for all&#xD;
      feeds. Often in the first few days of life very preterm infants are fed donor milk as the&#xD;
      mother may not have started producing breast milk at that point or may still be recovering&#xD;
      from the birth. Mothers may also produce less milk than is needed, either initially or&#xD;
      throughout the breast feeding period, so some feeds may be supplemented with donor milk or&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every case where expressed breast milk is used currently, the milk is collected from the&#xD;
      mother and frozen in the milk bank. Each evening the feeds for the following day are ordered&#xD;
      and the oldest batch of breast milk defrosted and prepared. Infants move from enteral feeds&#xD;
      to breast feeding when they are clinically judged to be able to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol - overview:The exact same standard procedures for feeding (timing of&#xD;
      initiation, amount, frequency, and supplementation with donor milk as needed) and&#xD;
      fortification will be followed for study participants. Only infants who have not previously&#xD;
      received infant formula are eligible. The only difference in feeding will be that for at&#xD;
      least 1 feed per day the breast milk fed to the infant will be fresh, not previously frozen.&#xD;
      'Fresh' breast milk is defined as milk that was expressed less than 4 hours prior to the time&#xD;
      it is fed to the infant, and is not frozen, chilled or pasteurized. The reason for this time&#xD;
      window is that the half-life of stem cellsbreast milk is only about 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol - details: Mothers will be asked to be present in the NICU and pump&#xD;
      breast milk for a 'fresh' feedat least 1 time per day, 7 days a week using the Medela&#xD;
      Symphony pump applied to both breasts.As this is a &quot;real world&quot; study, the actual volume of&#xD;
      fresh milk feeds is not as important as the number of feeds because feed volumes are&#xD;
      determined by a standard protocol in the NICU, and volumes of feeds administered must conform&#xD;
      to the ability of the infant to tolerate the feeds, and cannot be dosed according to a&#xD;
      pre-set amount. Breast milk will be expressed into a sterile plastic container as per&#xD;
      standard NICU protocol. The container will be labelled with the mother's bar code and&#xD;
      immediately given to a nurse dedicated to the implementation of this study (1.0FTE, see study&#xD;
      budget). The nurse will take the milk to the milk preparation area where the details of the&#xD;
      milk and feeds will be entered into a database and then she will prepare and bring the milk&#xD;
      back to the NICU to be fed to the infant. The milk will not be heated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any additional milk expressed by the mother in the NICU or at homethat exceeds the 4 hour&#xD;
      window will be transferred to a sterile container, frozen, and stored in the milk bank for&#xD;
      use when the mother is not available to provide fresh milk. Milk collection and handling for&#xD;
      feeds of previously frozen milk will be as per standard NICU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of breast milk in this manner will commence when the infant is able to tolerate&#xD;
      enteral feeds and continue until the infant is discharged from hospital.Mothers will also be&#xD;
      encouraged to express breast milk when they are away from the unit and bring it into the unit&#xD;
      as per standard NICU protocols. In cases where a mother is not able to produce enough breast&#xD;
      milk for all her infant's feeds, the remaining feeds that are not being provided as fresh or&#xD;
      frozen mother's own breast milk may be supplemented using donor milk.Infants enrolled in the&#xD;
      study who develop NEC will cease the study protocol and receive treatment as per the NICU&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers who provide less than 1 feed of fresh milk every day will remain in the study. This&#xD;
      will enable us to determine the feasibility of expecting mothers to provide at least 1 feed&#xD;
      of fresh milk a day, and the percentage of mothers who can actually do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety For an individual patient, the feeding protocol will be stopped if there is an&#xD;
      occurrence of NEC or any other medical condition that necessitates that feeds be stopped as&#xD;
      per standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases of mortality, NEC, sepsis, and critical incidence reports (including mix-up of milk&#xD;
      destined for individual infants, infection that is related to feeds, missed feeds arising&#xD;
      from delays in milk preparation, and any other incident that raises concerns of the&#xD;
      clinicians) that occur in infants enrolled in the study will be critically reviewed by a Data&#xD;
      Safety and Monitoring Committee and the study stopped if concerns regarding the safety of the&#xD;
      study are raised.Stopping criteria and decisions will be decided by the Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation (2 months): REB approval will be obtained. Education for staff regarding the&#xD;
      study protocol will be developed and rolled out. Education for staff will include in-service&#xD;
      sessions that will be held before the study period begins. The necessary unit policies will&#xD;
      be developed and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment period (9 months): Enrollment into the study will continue until 100 infants and&#xD;
      their mothers have completed the intervention protocoland 100 infants and their mothers have&#xD;
      completed the control protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis (1 month): Data collection will be analysed and results reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Infant outcomes: Outcomes data will be collected on paper and entered into a&#xD;
      database for subsequent analysis. Study-specific variables will include compliance with&#xD;
      intervention protocol, the number and volume of stem cell rich fresh milk feeds provided to&#xD;
      study infants on each day, and the response of the infant following the feed (see attached&#xD;
      data forms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant and maternal characteristics: In addition to infant outcomes, data on maternal and&#xD;
      infant characteristics, as well as predisposing factors will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Justification for sample size:The mean number of infants born at &lt;30&#xD;
      weeks' gestation and admitted to participating NICUs in 2014 was over 500 per year. We expect&#xD;
      that 25% of mothers will consent to be in the intervention group. If the admission&#xD;
      rateremains similar during the study period, there should be ample feasibility to complete&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013 the mean annual rate of NEC was 9.3% in infants born at &lt;29 weeks' gestation, so we&#xD;
      would expect to see 9 cases of NEC in the control group. Although the study will not be&#xD;
      powered to detect a statistically significant difference, the occurrence of 5 or less cases&#xD;
      of NEC in the intervention group may be an indication that further study is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: The primary outcomes of feasibility (rate of consent, rate of enrolment, rate of&#xD;
      retention, and compliance with the intervention protocol) and safety (number of critical&#xD;
      incidence reports) will be reported.The incidence of NEC and other secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups using descriptive methods.&#xD;
