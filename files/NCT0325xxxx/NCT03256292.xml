  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older hypogonadal obese veterans previously participated in a 6 month lifestyle change&#xD;
      (diet-induced weight loss and exercise) study with or without testosterone replacement&#xD;
      therapy before being followed for the following year at the clinic while receiving standard&#xD;
      of care consisting of diet and exercise counseling (for healthy lifestyle change) and&#xD;
      testosterone replacement therapy. This study will determine if long-term lifestyle change and&#xD;
      testosterone replacement therapy with associated improvement in physical and metabolic health&#xD;
      can be maintained in obese older adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: There are studies on long-term testosterone replacement in older adults with&#xD;
      hypogonadism showing benefits on body composition, sexual function and mood but not on&#xD;
      testosterone replacement therapy in combination with lifestyle change (diet-induced weight&#xD;
      loss and exercise) in the specific population of older adults with both obesity and&#xD;
      hypogonadism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine if long-term lifestyle change and testosterone replacement therapy with&#xD;
      associated improvement in physical and metabolic health can be maintained in obese older&#xD;
      adults .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Overweight/obese older veteran patients with obesity and hypogonadism who are being&#xD;
      followed at the endocrine clinic while receiving standard of care consisting of diet and&#xD;
      exercise counseling (for healthy lifestyle change) and testosterone replacement therapy will&#xD;
      be recruited for testing of physical, metabolic, cognitive/mood, quality of life, and body&#xD;
      composition testing.&#xD;

    <description>The primary functional outcome is the modified physical performance test, which includes seven standardized tasks (walking 50 ft, putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg tests) plus two additional tasks (climbing up and down four flights of stairs and performing a 360-degree turn). The score for each task ranges form 0 to 4; a perfect score is 36.</description>
