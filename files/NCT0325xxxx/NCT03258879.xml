  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural, Combined Spinal-Epidural, and more recently dural puncture epidural are forms of&#xD;
      neuraxial anesthesia used to provide pain relief in laboring women . The investigators want&#xD;
      to assess the onset of pain relief with 2 different neuraxial techniques performed at our&#xD;
      center, but which have not yet been compared in the literature: (1) Modified CSE, with only&#xD;
      local anesthetic injected into the spinal fluid to reduce side effects of opioids that are&#xD;
      seen with the traditional CSE and (2) Dural Puncture Epidural (DPE), involving puncture of&#xD;
      the spinal membrane, but without injection of medication into the spinal space. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the onset of labor analgesia will be faster with modified CSE&#xD;
      compared to DPE.&#xD;

      Purpose of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the onset of effective analgesia (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain &lt;/=&#xD;
           1/10 in minutes with the modified CSE and DPE techniques, which is our primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess block quality (time to T10 sensory block, motor block, asymmetric block,&#xD;
           inadequate block) between the 2 techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess incidence of breakthrough pain as determined by number of physician&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of side effects (maternal hypotension, pruritus, nausea, and&#xD;
           fetal bradycardia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess delivery outcomes (vaginal vs. instrumental vs. CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare fetal Apgar scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess maternal satisfaction with pain relief using Likert scale at 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate for potential complications (Post-dural puncture headache, back pain, leg&#xD;
           weakness, numbness and infection) related to the techniques at 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the onset of effective analgesia (NRS pain &lt;/= 1, in&#xD;
      minutes) will be faster with the modified CSE compared to DPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized Double Blinded Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants are consented for the study, usual care is established with IV cannula&#xD;
      insertion, fluid bolus and standard monitors will be applied. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two groups by a computer-generated randomization sequence. Group&#xD;
      assignments will be concealed in opaque numbered envelopes and will be opened by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist performing the block immediately before initiation of analgesia. Group 1&#xD;
      will receive a modified combined spinal-epidural (MCSE) and Group 2 will receive a dural&#xD;
      puncture epidural (DPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidural space will be located at the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace using a midline approach&#xD;
      with a 17-G, 9 cm Touhy epidural needle using a loss of resistance technique. A single dural&#xD;
      puncture with confirmation of free flow of CSF will be performed with a 25-G, 12 cm Whitacre&#xD;
      needle placed through the epidural needle. Subsequent intervention varies with the group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCSE group: 1 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected intrathecally DPE group: No medication&#xD;
      will be injected intrathecally. Both the groups will subsequently have the epidural catheter&#xD;
      placed 4-6 cm into the space and will be checked for a negative aspiration of blood/CSF. In&#xD;
      the DPE group, 15 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine will be given as 5ml fractionated boluses. Both&#xD;
      groups will have patient controlled epidural analgesia started after the study interventions&#xD;
      as follows: Bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL with fentanyl 2 microgram/ml, background infusion at 8&#xD;
      mL/h, demand dose of 4 mL, lockout interval of 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist and nurse will be asked not to reveal the group assignment to the&#xD;
      patient or study co-investigators so that the patients and the study investigators collecting&#xD;
      the data will be blinded to the techniques. The anesthesiologist performing the technique&#xD;
      will prepare the medications according to group allocation and will not be involved in any&#xD;
      data collection. Attending, fellow or resident anesthesiologists will perform all the&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After block completion, an independent blinded co-investigator will assess the numerical&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS) pain scores from 0-10 and other outcomes after the initial dosing, at the&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minute marks. The time taken to achieve a NRS equal to or less&#xD;
      than 1 will be recorded for all the three groups. Sensory levels will be assessed using ice&#xD;
      starting caudad at the S2 dermatome and moving cephalad. Time taken to achieve a block of T10&#xD;
      will be recorded. Patients will be assessed for pruritus and nausea/vomiting every hour, by&#xD;
      grading the severity on a scale ranging from 0-3; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2= moderate and 3 =&#xD;
      severe. Motor strength will be assessed hourly with a modified Bromage score (0 = full&#xD;
      flexion of knees and ankles, 1 = partial flexion of knees, full flexion of ankles, 2 =&#xD;
      inability to flex knees and partial flexion of ankles and 3 = inability to flex knees and&#xD;
      ankles). Presence of motor blockade will be defined as modified Bromage score of more than or&#xD;
      equal to 1. Following the first 30 minutes, assessments will continue at 60-minute intervals&#xD;
      until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be monitored for hypotension and fetal bradycardia during this period&#xD;
      and up to 1 hour after the procedure. Hypotension is defined as a 20% reduction in the&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure from the admission blood pressure in the absence of uterine&#xD;
      contraction and will be treated with vasopressors as per the standard of care. Fetal&#xD;
      bradycardia is defined as a fetal heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute, persisting&#xD;
      for more than 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of inadequate analgesia and a unilateral block defined by a difference of more&#xD;
      than 2 dermatomal levels between the 2 sides, the participant will be placed on the less&#xD;
      blocked side and a supplemental epidural dose will be administered. If the unilateral block&#xD;
      persists, the catheter will be withdrawn 1 cm and an additional supplemental epidural dose of&#xD;
      5 ml 2% lidocaine will be given over 2 min. In the event of inadequate analgesia and the&#xD;
      presence of inadequate sensory level bilaterally, supplemental epidural dose will be&#xD;
      administered. If improvement of analgesia is not observed, the epidural catheter will be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mode of delivery and fetal Agar scores will be recorded for all the patients. All the study&#xD;
      subjects will be visited on postpartum day 1 and will be assessed for satisfaction with labor&#xD;
      analgesia using a Likert scale and any potential complications such as headache, back pain,&#xD;
      leg weakness or numbness and paresthesia.&#xD;
