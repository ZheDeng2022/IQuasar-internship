      Appendicectomy has been the treatment of acute appendicitis for over a hundred years.&#xD;
      Appendicectomy, however, includes operative and postoperative risks despite being a routine&#xD;
      procedure. Several studies have proved promising results of the safety and efficiency of&#xD;
      antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The previous APPAC study by&#xD;
      the investigators, published in 2015 in the Journal of American Medical Association, also&#xD;
      proved promising results with 73% of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated&#xD;
      successfully with antibiotics. None of the patients initially treated with antibiotics that&#xD;
      later had appendectomy had major complications. The results of the APPAC trial suggest that&#xD;
      CT proven uncomplicated acute appendicitis is not a surgical emergency and antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      is a safe first-line treatment option. Reducing unnecessary appendectomies has also been&#xD;
      shown to lead to significant economic savings. On the other hand, antibiotic therapies have&#xD;
      been shown to have an effect on the normal gut microbiota and are considered an increasing&#xD;
      global health threat underlining the importance of evaluating both short- and long-term&#xD;
      effects of the antimicrobial treatment in old and new indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized prospective study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the possible role and differences in the microbiological etiology of&#xD;
           complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of both antibiotic and placebo treatment on the composition of&#xD;
           gut microbiota, and to evaluate how it recovers after the appendicitis-related&#xD;
           antimicrobial treatment (AMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of the duration of the hospital stay on the AMR reservoir of the&#xD;
           gut microbiota.&#xD;

      Appendectomy has been the treatment of acute appendicitis for over a hundred years.&#xD;
      Appendicectomy, however, includes operative and postoperative risks despite being a routine&#xD;
      procedure. Several studies have proved promising results of the safety and efficiency of&#xD;

      shown to lead to significant economic savings. On the other hand, antibiotic therapies have&#xD;
      been shown to have an effect on the normal gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota is an extremely complex ecosystem with both high bacterial density and&#xD;
      diversity. Recent scientific evidence emphasizes that the symbiosis between the host and the&#xD;
      balanced gut microbiota supports good health, and contributes to various biochemical and&#xD;
      metabolic functions occurring in host's body. The possible role of the somehow distorted gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition in addition to its metabolites in the etiopathogenesis of many&#xD;
      diseases such as allergy, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes and obesity related&#xD;
      disorders, has been recently proposed. Further, detected alterations and perturbations both&#xD;
      in the gut microbiota composition and functionality have been linked to the development of&#xD;
      various malignancies such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      To date, the role of the microbes and especially the members of the commensal microbiota with&#xD;
      their structural compartments and metabolites in the pathogenesis and etiology of&#xD;
      appendicitis have not been clarified in detail, despite the recent knowledge that&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis could be treated by antibiotic treatments alone. Further,&#xD;
      there is only limited amount of evidence on the appendix microbial composition in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial overgrowth has been speculated to serve as a secondary consequence in appendicitis.&#xD;
      However, recent accumulating evidence suggests that primary bacterial infection may actually&#xD;
      be an initiating event in the pathogenesis of the disease. Interestingly, it has been&#xD;
      postulated that the appendix could serve as a microbial reservoir for repopulating the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract in times of necessity thus gut microbiota may act as a source for&#xD;
      these pathogenic intruders. Further it has been reported that certain members of the gram&#xD;
      negative Fusobacteria especially F. nucleatum and necrophorum are present in most&#xD;
      appendicitis samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered an increasing global threat.&#xD;
      According to the WHO (World Health Organisation), in 2050s more people will be killed by AMR&#xD;
      bacteria than by all cancers.The use of antimicrobials in humans and especially in animal&#xD;
      health care and production industry are the major causes of increasing AMR worldwide; the&#xD;
      prudent use of antimicrobials is essential to prevent increasing AMR. Antimicrobials are&#xD;
      known to decrease the gut microbiota diversity, richness and species variation and cause the&#xD;
      perturbation of its overall balance and even a short-term antimicrobial treatment has a&#xD;
      long-term impact on its composition underlining the importance of evaluating both short- and&#xD;
      long-term effects of the antimicrobial treatment in old and new indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized prospective study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the possible role and differences in the microbiological etiology of&#xD;
           complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis. The bacterial composition of the complicated&#xD;
           appendix will be compared to the gut microbiota composition determined from the fecal&#xD;
           sample collected from the same individual. Additionally, these results will be compared&#xD;
           to the gut microbiota composition of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of both antibiotic and placebo treatment on the composition of&#xD;
           gut microbiota, and to evaluate how it recovers after the appendicitis-related&#xD;
           antimicrobial treatment (AMT). The bacterial composition and AMR reservoir of the gut&#xD;
           microbiota will be evaluated both pre and post treatment in patients receiving&#xD;
           antibiotic or placebo treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Additionally, the&#xD;
           recovery of gut microbiota composition and disappearance of AMR will be evaluated. We&#xD;
           will compare two variations (i.v.and p.o.) of antibiotic treatment with the placebo&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of the duration of the hospital stay on the AMR reservoir of the&#xD;
           gut microbiota. According to the study protocols of the APPAC II and III trials,&#xD;
           patients will spend either 1 or 3 days in the hospital in order to receive treatment&#xD;
           before continuing the selected treatment at home. We will evaluate the effects of length&#xD;
           of stay on the AMR reservoir of gut microbiota as well as evaluating if and when&#xD;
           possible colonization occurs.&#xD;
