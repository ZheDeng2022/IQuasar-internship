  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEANING trial is a randomized controlled mixed methods pilot designed to compare a novel&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation-based intervention (MEANING) to usual care for adults with&#xD;
      advanced-stage solid malignancies and their family caregivers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness meditation practices have reduced emotional distress, avoidant coping, and&#xD;
      improved spiritual well-being in adult cancer patients. These beneficial effects may occur&#xD;
      through present-moment acceptance of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and circumstances and&#xD;
      adaptive coping through self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence. Most&#xD;
      mindfulness trials in cancer have focused on early-stage survivors; however, preliminary&#xD;
      evidence suggests that mindfulness may help reduce distress in patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      and their family caregivers (FCGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients with an advanced-stage solid malignancy and their FCGs (60 dyads) will be&#xD;
      randomized in equal numbers to receive either the 6-week mindfulness intervention or usual&#xD;
      care. Both groups will receive standard cancer care throughout the study period. Dyads&#xD;
      randomized to the mindfulness arm will learn mindfulness meditation practices (e.g., body&#xD;
      scan, sitting meditation) and mindful communication practices to enhance quality of life,&#xD;
      support advance care planning engagement, and improve a variety of secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a mixed methods 2-arm randomized design to examine the effects of the&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention compared to usual care and seek to explain trial results using&#xD;
      insights gleaned from post-intervention qualitative interviews.&#xD;

    <description>The Mindfulness intervention sessions are designed to cultivate present-moment awareness in everyday life to facilitate adaptive and non-reactive relating to thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Participants will be provided with 10-20 minute audio recordings of each of 5 mindfulness practices covered in class, recorded in the facilitator's voice. Participants will be encouraged to practice mindfulness at home 10-20 minutes per day, 6 days per week. Participants will be provided with weekly diaries on which to record type and amount of home practice of mindfulness skills.</description>
