  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often associated with myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis evidenced by peri-procedural troponin release. This is a surrogate for subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. There is no study on the effect of peri-PCI oxygenation in in&#xD;
      myocardial protection and cardiopulmonary fitness outcome. Patients with higher baseline&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness will have lower mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to assess the utility of oxygen to reduce ischaemia in patients with&#xD;
      significant stable coronary artery disease scheduled for elective PCI. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate further effect of peri- PCI oxygenation on cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      and autonomic response.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the utility of oxygen to reduce ischaemia in patients with&#xD;
      significant stable coronary artery disease scheduled for elective PCI. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate further effect of peri- PCI oxygenation on cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      and autonomic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized double blinded prospective pilot study SAMPLE SIZE: 30 patients&#xD;
      scheduled for elective for PCI randomized to 2 groups, oxygen group ( 15L/min) and air group&#xD;
      METHOD: Patient whom fulfil inclusion criteria were recruited and randomized to 2 groups via&#xD;
      computer allocation system. The assigned inhaled gas will be delivered via high-flow mask at&#xD;
      15L/min for a minimum of 30 minutes immediately prior to and continued throughout the PCI&#xD;
      procedure. Patients were blinded throughout the procedure but the practising cardiologist and&#xD;
      staff nurses were not blinded. Routine care continued post PCI. Blood sampling for Troponin I&#xD;
      was taken at 6 hours and 24 hours following stent implantation. Patients were discharged one&#xD;
      day after the procedure as per current routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were given routine follow up with the cardiac rehabilitation clinic in 4 weeks time&#xD;
      post discharge. EST was arranged 6 weeks post procedure PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Troponin I&#xD;
      at 6 and 24 hours SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: METs, Heart Rate Recovery, Chronotropic Index&#xD;
