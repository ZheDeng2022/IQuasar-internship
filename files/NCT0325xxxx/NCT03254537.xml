      Results from a small number of human cohort studies are also available and indicate that&#xD;
      there are positive associations between organic food consumption and reduced risk/incidence&#xD;
      of certain acute diseases (e.g. pre-eclampsia, hypospadias) and obesity/overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from animal dietary intervention studies suggest that (i) switching to organic food&#xD;
      consumption results in significant changes in hormonal balances and an increase in immune&#xD;
      system responsiveness and (ii) differences in pesticide residue, cadmium, protein and&#xD;
      antioxidant concentrations between organic and conventional foods are major drivers for&#xD;
      hormonal balances and immune system parameters in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is virtually no published data from (i) long-term cohort studies focusing on&#xD;
      chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      conditions) and (ii) controlled human dietary intervention studies comparing effects of&#xD;
      organic and conventional diets. It is therefore currently not possible to assess whether and&#xD;
      estimate to what extent organic food consumption may affect human health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The most recent systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses have indicated significant&#xD;
      and nutritionally-relevant composition differences between organic and conventional foods&#xD;
      (crops, meat and dairy products). Specifically, these systematic reviews reported that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      organic crops have 17% higher antioxidant activity and between 18% and 69% higher&#xD;
      concentrations of a range of individual antioxidants; increased intakes of polyphenolics and&#xD;
      antioxidants has been linked to a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      conventional crops have 48% higher levels of the toxic metal cadmium, and are 4-times more&#xD;
      likely to contain detectable pesticide residues; there are general recommendations to&#xD;
      minimise the intake of pesticides and cadmium to avoid potential negative health impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      conventional crops also have 15%, 10%, 30%, and 87% higher concentrations of protein,&#xD;
      nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, respectively; increased intakes of these compounds have been&#xD;
      linked to both positive and negative health impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      organic meat, milk and dairy products have approximately 50% higher concentrations of&#xD;
      nutritionally-desirable omega-3 fatty acids; intakes of very long chain omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      in Western diets and there are EFSA recommendation to at least double their intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      organic milk has 70% lower concentrations of iodine and slightly lower concentrations of&#xD;
      Selenium, which is nutritionally undesirables especially in the UK where (a) the Se content&#xD;
      of cereals has decreased (due to reduced import of cereals grown on Se-rich soil (b) Iodine&#xD;
      fortified table salt is not widely available and used and the iodine supply relies more on&#xD;
      mineral fortification of animal, and especially dairy feeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a small number of human cohort studies are also available and indicate that&#xD;
      there are positive associations between organic food consumption and reduced risk/incidence&#xD;
      of certain acute diseases (e.g. pre-eclampsia, hypospadias) and obesity/overweight .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from animal dietary intervention studies suggest that (i) switching to organic food&#xD;
      consumption results in significant changes in hormonal balances and an increase in immune&#xD;
      system responsiveness and (ii) differences in pesticide residue, cadmium, protein and&#xD;
      antioxidant concentrations between organic and conventional foods are major drivers for&#xD;
      hormonal balances and immune system parameters in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is virtually no published data from (i) long-term cohort studies focusing on&#xD;
      chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      conditions) and (ii) controlled human dietary intervention studies comparing effects of&#xD;
      organic and conventional diets. It is therefore currently not possible to assess whether and&#xD;
      estimate to what extent organic food consumption may affect human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the study is to get a quantitative understanding of (a) the uptake (and&#xD;
      therefore potential to affect health) of food composition components (pesticide residues,&#xD;
      toxic metals such as cadmium, antioxidants) that differ between organic and conventional&#xD;
      foods and (b) the effect of organic vs conventional food consumption on selected&#xD;
      physiological parameters in plasma linked to health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be essential to (a) carry out accurate statistical power analyses&#xD;
      (based on uptake [=estimated from blood and urine concentrations] rather than food&#xD;
      composition data) and (b) optimise designs for longer-term dietary intervention studies,&#xD;
      designed to identify impacts of organic food consumption on health related physiological&#xD;
      markers in humans and mechanisms for potential health impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the proposed study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Carry out a human dietary intervention study comparing the effects of switching to&#xD;
           Mediterranean diets based on organic and conventional foods on concentrations of&#xD;
           pesticides, toxic metals, mineral nutrients (e.g. Fe, Cu, Se, I) and antioxidants, and&#xD;
           antioxidant activity and selected health-related markers in urine and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify concentrations of pesticide residue, mineral, toxic metal and antioxidants in&#xD;
           both organic and conventional food samples consumed during the intervention period&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Carry out both univariate and redundancy analyses to both quantify effects of different&#xD;
           diets on urine and blood composition and to identify the most important food composition&#xD;
           drivers for differences in urine/blood composition and health markers.&#xD;
