      RAGE is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, post-market study. The RAGE study is&#xD;
      designed to determine the safety and occlusion rates of hydrogel coils in the ruptured&#xD;
      aneurysm study population. Secondary objectives include determining clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      packing density, occlusion stability, rates of recurrence, rebleed, retreatment, and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patient is ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a previously untreated, ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysm 2 - 15 mm&#xD;
             in diameter for which the clinical decision to treat with hydrogel coil embolization&#xD;
             has been made independent of the decision to participate in the study described in&#xD;
             this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a baseline Hunt and Hess Score of I, II, or III.&#xD;

          4. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative has provided written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;

          5. Patient must be considered by the treating physician to be available for and able to&#xD;
             complete all followup visits.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Target aneurysm is dissecting, fusiform, mycotic, blister-like, tumoral, or&#xD;
             AVM-related.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Target aneurysm was previously treated via clipping or coiling.&#xD;

          7. Target aneurysm is deemed by the treating physician to be unsuitable for coiling or&#xD;
             unlikely to be successfully treated by endovascular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the source of SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Planned use of a flow diverter or intrasaccular device as a component of the target&#xD;
             aneurysm treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;

             plan, unless use of a stent is 1) planned as a subsequent stage of a staged coiling&#xD;
             procedure or 2) used for bailout purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a known, untreatable hypersensitivity to contrast dye, iodine, hydrogel,&#xD;
             or any other component of the treatment device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a contraindication to heparin or aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has vascular anatomy/tortuosity preventing access to the target aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient is unable to undergo DSA or DSA is determined unsuitable or outside standard&#xD;
             of care by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient has a serious or life-threatening comorbidity that could confound study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is at high risk of noncompliance due to a history of substance abuse,&#xD;
             psychosocial issues, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patient is unable to complete scheduled followup assessments due to comorbidities,&#xD;
             geographical limitations, or a life expectancy of less than 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant prior to completion of&#xD;
             followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
