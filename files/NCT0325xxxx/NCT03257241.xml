      The study will include newly-diagnosed AML patients, not suffering acute promyelocytic&#xD;
      leukemia; aged 18-60 years, who are eligible for standard induction chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one standard induction regimen (DAC or DA-90). At day seven&#xD;
      after completion of induction, a bone marrow aspiration with MRD will be performed for an&#xD;
      early evaluation of response to treatment. Patients without bone marrow blast reduction below&#xD;
      10% at day seven after induction will be given a second early induction course. Patients who&#xD;
      do not achieve CR after two induction courses will be randomized to one of the standard&#xD;
      salvage regimens (FLAG-IDA or CLAG-M). Postremission treatment intensity will be adjusted to&#xD;
      risk group based on cytogenetic and molecular risk factors at diagnosis and AML biology&#xD;
      (secondary AML, therapy related AML). Patients with a low risk of relapse will be allocated&#xD;
      to consolidation, with three courses of high doses of Ara-C (HiDAC), or two courses of HiDAC&#xD;
      with subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation. Intermediate- or high-risk patients&#xD;
      will be referred for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if they have a matched donor.&#xD;
      Until transplantation, consolidation with HiDAC will be continued.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The successful treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depends on the ability to achieve&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) and to prevent relapse. Both may be affected by the efficacy of&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy. The gold standard for treatment since 1982 has been DA, a regimen of&#xD;
      three days of daunorubicin (DNR) and seven days of cytarabine (Ara-C) which results in&#xD;
      complete remission in 50 to 75% of patients; this is typically administered intravenously,&#xD;
      with daunorubicin administered at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area daily&#xD;
      for three days, and cytarabine given at a dose of 100 mg per square meter daily for seven&#xD;
      days. Neither substituting DNR with another anthracycline nor the addition of thioguanine or&#xD;
      etoposide has been demonstrated to improve outcome. Recently it has been proved that&#xD;
      high-dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m2) in induction (DA-90) resulted in a higher rate of complete&#xD;
      remission (70.6% vs. 57.3%, P&lt;0.001) and improved overall survival (median, 23.7 vs. 15.7&#xD;
      months; P = 0.003) without any increase in serious adverse events, compared with the standard&#xD;
      dose of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method to intensify induction treatment is by the addition of the purine&#xD;
      analog cladribine. Cladribine was demonstrated to increase cellular uptake of Ara-C and&#xD;
      accumulation of Ara-CTP in leukemic blasts by 50% to 65% and to have direct antileukemic&#xD;
      activity based on incorporation of metabolites into the DNA of proliferating cells. In two&#xD;
      randomized trials by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG), the investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      that the combination of cladribine with DNR (60 mg/m2) and Ara-C (DAC) resulted in a&#xD;
      significantly increased CR rate after a single induction course compared with the standard&#xD;
      two-drug induction (DA-60). The DAC arm was found to have a survival advantage over the DA-60&#xD;
      arm for patients aged 50 years or older (P =. 005), those with an initial leukocyte count&#xD;
      above 50G /L (P &lt; .03), and those with an unfavorable karyotype (P &lt; .03). Both induction&#xD;
      protocols have the same level of recommendation by the National Cancer Comprehensive Network&#xD;
      (NCCN) for routine use (level I), and are commonly used for the treatment of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      AML in Poland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no randomized comparison of these two standard protocols has yet been performed, the aim&#xD;
      of the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of these two standard induction protocols in&#xD;
      terms of achievement of CR, early leukemia elimination (at day seven, post induction) and&#xD;
      quality of remission measured by minimal residual disease level. Additionally, overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) will be analyzed. It&#xD;
      is also intended to compare the hematological and non-hematological toxicity of both&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in younger adults with AML treated with standard induction chemotherapy, 20-35% do&#xD;
      not achieve CR and 50-70% with CR may be expected to relapse within three years. Patients&#xD;
      with primary refractory disease and with relapses following CR1 have a significantly poorer&#xD;
      outcome. The optimum strategy at the time of relapse or for patients with refractory disease&#xD;
      remains uncertain. Allogeneic transplantation can be curative for the minority of patients&#xD;
      who achieve second CR (2CR) and for whom a suitable donor is available. For the majority of&#xD;
      patients, additional chemotherapy is given in the hope of achieving remission. Most salvage&#xD;
      therapies utilize high or intermediate doses of arabinoside cytosine (Ara-C) in combination&#xD;
      with other agents to overcome resistance in leukemic cells. Previous studies have shown that&#xD;
      a combination of the purine analog fludarabine (FA) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)&#xD;
      increases the accumulation of Ara-C-5' triphosphate (Ara-CTP) responsible for the cytotoxic&#xD;
      effect in leukemic blasts. This combination of FA plus Ara-C was initially explored in&#xD;
      refractory and relapsed AML patients with satisfactory results. It is also likely that these&#xD;
      results can be improved by the addition of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).&#xD;
      Such a combination of FA, Ara-C, idarubicin and G-CSF (the FLAG-IDA regimen) has been used in&#xD;
      the treatment of refractory and relapsed AML and poor prognosis myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
      (MDS), with CR rates of between 30-80% being reported. Recent studies have shown that another&#xD;
      purine analog, cladribine (2-CdA), is also able to enhance Ara-CTP accumulation in leukemic&#xD;
      blasts and that the combination of 2-Cda with Ara-C exhibited synergistic effect on&#xD;
      inhibition of myeloid leukemic cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and on disruption&#xD;
      of mitochondrial membrane potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two previous PALG studies have confirmed that the CLAG-M regimen (a combination of&#xD;
      cladribine, Ara-C, G-CSF and mitoxantrone) has high efficacy and low toxicity in&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed AML patients. This salvage regimen was particularly effective in a very&#xD;
      poor-risk subgroup with primary refractoriness, early relapse or relapse after stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Both salvage protocols, CLAG-M and FLAG-Ida, are wildly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory AML and both have the highest level of NCCN recommendation.&#xD;
      However, these two standard salvage protocols have yet to be examined as part of any&#xD;
      randomized study. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of these two&#xD;
      standard reinduction protocols (CLAG-M vs FLAG-IDA) in terms of achievement of CR, and&#xD;
      quality of remission measured by minimal residual disease level. Additionally, the overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) will be analyzed.&#xD;
      The study will also compare the hematological and non-hematological toxicity of both&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include newly-diagnosed AML patients, not suffering acute promyelocytic&#xD;
      leukemia; aged 18-60 years, who are eligible for standard induction chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one standard induction regimen (DAC or DA-90). At day seven&#xD;
      after completion of induction, a bone marrow aspiration with MRD will be performed for an&#xD;
      early evaluation of response to treatment. Patients without bone marrow blast reduction below&#xD;
      10% at day seven after induction will be given a second early induction course. Patients who&#xD;
      do not achieve CR after two induction courses will be randomized to one of the standard&#xD;
      salvage regimens (FLAG-IDA or CLAG-M). Postremission treatment intensity will be adjusted to&#xD;
      risk group based on cytogenetic and molecular risk factors at diagnosis and AML biology&#xD;
      (secondary AML, therapy related AML). Patients with a low risk of relapse will be allocated&#xD;
      to consolidation, with three courses of high doses of Ara-C (HiDAC), or two courses of HiDAC&#xD;
      with subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation. Intermediate- or high-risk patients&#xD;
      will be referred for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if they have a matched donor.&#xD;
      Until transplantation, consolidation with HiDAC will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of the study is CR rate after one and two induction courses. The&#xD;
      secondary end-points are the quality of CR (MRD), OS, DFS, PFS, CR rate after salvage&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 582 patients with newly-diagnosed AML. This will allow a 10%&#xD;
      difference in CR rate between DAC and DA-90 induction regimens to be confirmed with a power&#xD;
      of 80% and level of significance 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes neither any experimental drug nor procedures that are not of the standard&#xD;
      of treatment for AML.&#xD;
