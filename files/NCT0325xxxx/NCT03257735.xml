  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China, with 57 percent of&#xD;
      patients being diagnosed at advanced stage. At present, advanced lung cancer has entered the&#xD;
      era of precise treatment. So it is very important to determine the gene mutation status of&#xD;
      the tumor and prescribe drugs at the targets. Liquid biopsy is a suitable alternative when&#xD;
      tumor tissues are difficult to obtain. Liquid biopsy technique refers to the use of human&#xD;
      body fluid as a sample source to detect the information of related diseases, including blood,&#xD;
      urine, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. It is non-invasive, fast and simple, and can avoid the&#xD;
      problem of insufficient sample size and support for repeated sampling to continuously monitor&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the increasing incidence of lung cancer and the development of diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      technology, the survival period of patients has been extended, and the incidence and&#xD;
      diagnosis rate of the brain metastasis of lung cancer have increased year by year. The brain&#xD;
      metastasis of lung cancer is the most common type of brain metastatic tumor. The incidence&#xD;
      rate is about 40-50%, and the prognosis is poor--the natural median survival period is about&#xD;
      1-2 months. Because of the impractical intracranial tumor biopsy and very low level of DNA in&#xD;
      peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, which makes close contact with brain tumors, becomes&#xD;
      potential available samples. Several studies have shown that genetic testing of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid is feasible. Therefore, this study aims to test the cerebrospinal fluid, blood and&#xD;
      tissue by the latest second-generation sequencing technology at different time points, to&#xD;
      dynamically monitor the gene mutation status of cerebrospinal fluid, blood and tissue, to&#xD;
      explore the role of cerebrospinal fluid biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer with brain metastases.&#xD;

    <description>Patients' cerebrospinal fluid, blood and tumor tissue were collected within 3 days before treatment at diagnosis.&#xD;
Patients' cerebrospinal fluid and blood were extracted at the time of first evaluation of efficacy after treatment (TKI began after 1 month or chemotherapy after 2 cycles).&#xD;
Patients' cerebrospinal fluid and blood were extracted at first time of tumor progressionï¼Œand re-biopsy of tumor tissue was done as much as possible.&#xD;
All the samples were tested by next-generation sequencing.</description>
