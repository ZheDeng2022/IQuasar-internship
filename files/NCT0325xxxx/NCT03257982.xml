  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of therapist-caregiver-patient training to use BCI&#xD;
      and FES technology with a view to the inexpensive equipment eventually being used for home&#xD;
      use by tetraplegic patients as a continuing rehabilitation method for sub-acute patients&#xD;
      discharged from hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects a person's ability to move and feel sensation in the body.&#xD;
      People with injury around the neck, suffer from tetraplegia, which affects function of both&#xD;
      upper and lower limbs. Although these patients often have a caregiver, their main priority is&#xD;
      to regain some upper limb function to increase independence. About half of patients with&#xD;
      tetraplegia have an incomplete injury, i.e. have some sensation and control of muscles&#xD;
      preserved. Natural recovery takes about a year and is typically accompanied by intense&#xD;
      physical therapy while patients are in a hospital. Patients spend on average 4 months in&#xD;
      hospital and, once they go home, there are very limited options for further therapy, in&#xD;
      particular those living in rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the feasibility of patient and caregiver self-managed hand therapy based&#xD;
      on the combination of brain computer interface (BCI) and functional electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (FES). BCI is a system which consists of an electroencephalographic device (EEG), a computer&#xD;
      and software that can analyse EEG while it is being recorded. To ensure that the knowledge&#xD;
      stays within hospital, occupational therapists will first be trained who will then train&#xD;
      patients and caregivers. The BCI-FES therapy is based on a previous clinical study with&#xD;
      hospitalised patients, in which a researcher administered the therapy. In this study, a&#xD;
      portable BCI-FES system will be used with an inexpensive consumer BCI, which is designed for&#xD;
      non-professionals. The primary objective is to assess whether it is feasible for caregivers&#xD;
      and patients to learn to operate the portable BCI-FES system on their own within 5 training&#xD;
      sessions. The secondary objectives are to collect feedback from patients and therapists of&#xD;
      their views via semi-structured interviews and questionnaires; to assess how stable the&#xD;
      system parameters (EEG parameters, electrode location, FES stimulation parameters)are over&#xD;
      time; to assess whether there is any functional and neurological recovery.&#xD;
