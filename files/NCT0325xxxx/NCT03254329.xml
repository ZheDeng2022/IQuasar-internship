    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the proposed research is to establish Reference Values (RVs) for&#xD;
      micronutrients (MN) and macronutrients in human milk. The investigators' research to date has&#xD;
      revealed highly variable milk MN concentrations among populations, and very low values in&#xD;
      some low income countries (LICs) likely caused by poor maternal status and/or diet but RVs&#xD;
      are needed to interpret these values. During the past year the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      review of human milk nutrient composition, and formed a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) which&#xD;
      developed the current proposal. Here, the investigators are conducting a longitudinal project&#xD;
      on well-nourished women and infants. The Mothers, Infants and Lactation Quality (MILQ) study&#xD;
      is a multi-center cohort project, investigating breast milk nutrient composition in&#xD;
      well-nourished women across the first 8.5 months of lactation in four different populations.&#xD;
      The countries involved are Denmark, Brazil, Bangladesh and The Gambia. Exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding is an eligibility criterion up until the second post-partum study visit&#xD;
      (between 1 - 3.4 months postpartum), with the exception of the first week after delivery.&#xD;
      Other data collected on mothers and infants, including maternal and infant nutrient intake&#xD;
      and status, morbidity, milk volume, and infant development, will inform interpretation and&#xD;
      support application of the results. While the priority is to develop RVs for MN, other&#xD;
      analyses will include human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and proteins, and free amino acids&#xD;
      (FAA) in infant plasma. Thus, with the samples obtained the investigators will perform (a)&#xD;
      laboratory analyses of milk, plasma and urine nutrients to construct RVs for global&#xD;
      application, (b) analyses of HMOs and proteins in milk, and (c) metabolomic analysis of FAA&#xD;
      and other metabolites in infant plasma. By request of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#xD;
      (BMGF), colostrum and fecal microbiota samples will also be collected and stored for later&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect breast milk samples at four visits, at 2-3 days after birth&#xD;
      (colostrum) and at 1-3.4, 3.5-5.9, and 6-8.5 months of lactation from well-nourished mothers&#xD;
      age ≥18 to ≤40 years, in a systematic, identical way in four countries. The four sites are:&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Denmark; Banjul, The Gambia; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Mirpur, Dhaka,&#xD;
      Bangladesh. The most important site selection criteria were that multiple micronutrient&#xD;
      supplements are not consumed after week 28 of pregnancy; maternal diet is adequate but&#xD;
      consumption of highly fortified foods is limited; and exclusive breastfeeding is 60% at 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have 250 women and infants per site complete the study at 8.5 months,&#xD;
      approximately 500 women will be recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. This&#xD;
      should allow for mothers and infants not meeting study eligibility criteria in pregnancy or&#xD;
      early lactation, and drop-outs from the study. Recruitment during pregnancy will increase the&#xD;
      opportunity to locate and recruit women since recruitment in the immediate post-delivery&#xD;
      period will be difficult. It will also enable the women to be counselled on the importance of&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Colostrum will be collected at 2-3 days postpartum for future&#xD;
      analysis. The first collection of mature milk will occur between 1 and 3.4 months postpartum,&#xD;
      when maternal and infant blood samples will also be collected on all participants. At the&#xD;
      final two visits, in addition to milk collection, blood will be taken from all mothers but&#xD;
      only half of the infants each time, primarily for the assessment of micronutrient status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A requirement is that infants must be EBF in the 1-3.4 month period, and breastfed (BF) in&#xD;
      the second and third period. Longitudinal measurements on the same mother after the BF period&#xD;
      are not necessary for statistical reasons, as the investigators are not creating RVs for&#xD;
      change in milk composition. The investigators expect that due to attrition and cessation of&#xD;
      BF, the sample size will need to be augmented in later months; the alternative would have&#xD;
      been to recruit and measure many more women in earlier stages in order to have an adequate&#xD;
      sample size in the 7-8.5 month interval, which would be a much less efficient approach.&#xD;
      Therefore after 6 months, if women are not breastfeeding, additional lactating women will be&#xD;
      recruited from the group that was not EBF in the 3.4 month period, or from the local health&#xD;
      center or community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all three points of mature milk collection the investigators will measure breast milk&#xD;
      volume; diet, anthropometry and morbidity of the mother and infant; and infant development at&#xD;
      3.5-5.9 and 6 to 8.5 months; and will collect infant fecal samples for future analyses of the&#xD;
      microbiome. Milk volume will be measured at three sites using the International Atomic Energy&#xD;
      Agency's protocol that requires dosing the mother with deuterated water and collecting&#xD;
      maternal and infant saliva urine samples at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 13 and 14 days after the dose. In&#xD;
      Denmark breast milk volume will be measured by 24 hour infant weighing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the laboratory analyses will be conducted at the United States Department of&#xD;
      Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC)&#xD;
      in Davis, California. Other analyses will be performed in the Department of Chemistry at&#xD;
      University of California, Davis (HMOs and other bioactive compounds in milk), and the Swiss&#xD;
      Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (iodine status). RVs will be constructed following&#xD;
      the methods and principles developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth&#xD;
      Standards and the Intergrowth-21st Project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An add-on study &quot;Evaluation of maternal insulin resistance, metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers for prediction of successful initiation and duration of breastfeeding&quot; is being&#xD;
      conducted at the Danish site and was approved by The Regional Committee on Health Research&#xD;
      Ethics with (H-17015174).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the add-on study are to evaluate if maternal metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers can predict successful initiation and duration of breastfeeding in a population of&#xD;
      healthy non-obese Danish women, to evaluate the impact of maternal inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      during pregnancy on the offspring's growth and risk factors for later disease, and to relate&#xD;
      the impact of maternal metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers during pregnancy on&#xD;
      breastfeeding behavior and on the offspring's growth and risk factors for later disease in&#xD;
      this population to corresponding outcomes in an established cohort of infants born of obese&#xD;
      mothers.&#xD;
