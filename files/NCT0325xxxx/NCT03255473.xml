      Compare hearing outcomes between treatment with dexamethasone versus prednisone in&#xD;

      loss).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) affects approximately 5 to 20 per 100,000 persons&#xD;
      with spontaneous recovery seen in 32% to 65%. Many different treatments have been&#xD;
      investigated in attempt to improve hearing outcomes, with oral corticosteroids having some&#xD;
      success. Steroid regimens are highly variable, however, retrospective data has suggested&#xD;
      greater improvement in hearing outcomes with the use of high dose oral steroids&#xD;
      (dexamethasone) in the setting of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss compared to&#xD;
      traditional medical therapy with lower dose oral prednisone. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients with unilateral SSNHL who are randomized to treatment with high doses of oral&#xD;
      dexamethasone will show better hearing outcomes than patients who are randomized to the more&#xD;
      common standard clinical practice treatment with lower doses of oral prednisone.&#xD;
