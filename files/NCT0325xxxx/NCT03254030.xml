    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised controlled trial to assess an intervention of inspection&#xD;
      during both phases of colonoscopic examination ( insertion and withdrawal) improve adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate when compared to inspection only during withdrawal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful implementation of colorectal screening programmes and improvement in colonoscopic&#xD;
      technology have resulted in significant decrease in colorectal cancer incidence and&#xD;
      mortality. Effectiveness of colonoscopy largely depends on detection and removal of adenomas&#xD;
      before they become cancerous. Despite the vast improvement in colonoscopy training and&#xD;
      technology, it remains as an imperfect tool. It has been reported that the adenoma miss rate&#xD;
      during colonoscopy varies between 6-27% in clinical practice. Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) is&#xD;
      a surrogate marker of efficient colonoscopy. Researchers continue to explore various methods&#xD;
      and technologies to improve adenoma detection such as frequent position changes, routine use&#xD;
      of antispasmodics and devices to improve the mucosal visibility (third eye retro view scope,&#xD;
      Transparent cap, Endocuff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all the techniques are focused on the withdrawal stage of the examination. Colonic&#xD;
      examination is traditionally performed with rapid passage of colonoscope to the caecum and a&#xD;
      careful examination of mucosa is carried out during the withdrawal phase. Polyps are removed&#xD;
      during the withdrawal phase. It is well known from expert opinion that some polyps are&#xD;
      detected during the insertion phase rather than withdrawal phase especially in sigmoid and&#xD;
      transverse colon. This could be due to different anatomical configuration of colon during&#xD;
      insertion and withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During insertion phase colonic mucosa is stretched and the folds are splayed due to the&#xD;
      formation of loops and angulation hence affects the visualised area of the mucosa ahead of&#xD;
      the colonoscope. During withdrawal, the colon is shortened and the adjacent folds are brought&#xD;
      closer to each other. On withdrawal colon is much straighter. Therefore, it may expose&#xD;
      different portions of colonic mucosal surface on insertion and withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible sigmoidoscopy Bowel cancer screening programme (Bowel Scope) has been successfully&#xD;
      implemented since May 2013. Initial reports suggest ADR within Bowel Scope screening varies&#xD;
      considerably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose a simple technique to improve ADR in Bowel Scope Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent report suggests that ADR within Bowel Scope screening (BSS) varies considerably. We&#xD;
      propose a small technical alteration to improve ADR in BSS. A recent prospective trial&#xD;
      highlighted that if polypectomy was performed only during Withdrawal Phase (WP) when compared&#xD;
      to performing careful inspection and polypectomy during Inspection Phase (IP) plus WP, polyps&#xD;
      could be missed in about 7% of patients. We hypothesised that careful inspection and&#xD;
      polypectomy during both phases would be complementary and it would increase ADR by complete&#xD;
      visualisation of recto sigmoid mucosa during Bowel Scope.&#xD;
