  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of using autologous,&#xD;
      engineered urethral constructs for the treatment of urethral strictures in adult males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is a prospective non-randomized and uncontrolled single-center&#xD;
      investigation. Autologous urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), obtained&#xD;
      from enrolled male subjects' bladder tissue samples, will be culture expanded in vitro and&#xD;
      used to seed tubular PGA scaffolds to create autologous urethral constructs for the repair of&#xD;
      urethral strictures.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of using autologous,&#xD;
      engineered urethral constructs for the treatment of urethral strictures in adult males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is a prospective non-randomized and uncontrolled single-center&#xD;
      investigation. Autologous urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), obtained&#xD;
      from enrolled male subjects' bladder tissue samples, will be culture expanded in vitro and&#xD;
      used to seed tubular Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) scaffolds to create autologous urethral&#xD;
      constructs for the repair of urethral strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male patients, aged 21-65 years old, seen in the Wake Forest Baptist Health urology clinic,&#xD;
      referred to or self-referred to the study team, with recurrent urethral stricture, previously&#xD;
      treated with dilation, internal urethrotomy, or urethroplasty, will be approached and offered&#xD;
      consent to participate in in the trial. Up to 20 men may undergo screening procedures to&#xD;
      identify 10 eligible subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible&#xD;
      subjects will undergo full thickness bladder tissue biopsies at Wake Forest Baptist Medical&#xD;
      Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to obtain UCs and SMCs, which will be cultured and&#xD;
      expanded and then seeded on tubular PGA scaffolds. Approximately 6 weeks after biopsy, the&#xD;
      subjects will return to undergo surgical removal of the stricture and implant of the urethral&#xD;
      construct. Subjects will be followed through 36 months.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects enrolled will undergo a full-thickness bladder biopsy as an out-patient surgical procedure. Urothelial and Smooth Muscle Cells recovered from the biopsy will be isolated and expanded over the next 4-6 weeks, and then seeded onto a tubular scaffold to create the autologous engineered urethral construct. Subjects will undergo a second surgical procedure to excise the urethral stricture and implant the urethral construct. All subjects will be followed for 3 years for safety and efficacy.</description>
