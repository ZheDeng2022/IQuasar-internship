      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many medical conditions such as Alzheimer s disease limit the ability of people to think&#xD;
      clearly. For medical scientists to best study these medical conditions, they need to enroll&#xD;
      some people who may not be able to consent to participate in research on their own. Before&#xD;
      these individuals enroll in research it is important to assess whether they are able to&#xD;
      consent or whether someone else will need to consent for them. The NIH Clinical Center has a&#xD;
      team that performs these assessments. A team like this can be useful for two reasons. First,&#xD;
      it helps to protect the rights of research participants. Second, it makes it possible to&#xD;
      study medical conditions that could not be studied otherwise. In this study we will look back&#xD;
      at the records of the NIH Clinical Center team to review the process and results of these&#xD;
      assessments. We expect to learn how the capacity assessments were done. We will learn what&#xD;
      factors make people more or less able to consent. We will learn who consented for the&#xD;
      research participants when they could not consent on their own, for example a spouse or an&#xD;
      adult child. These results are likely to be useful to other researchers who wish to study&#xD;
      diseases that limit cognitive ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the process and outcomes of capacity assessments of people who may not be able to&#xD;
      consent to research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of all ages, genders, races, ethnicities, and languages whose ability to consent was&#xD;
      assessed at the NIH Clinical Center at some time during the years 1999-2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will only review existing records. There will not be any active participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records will be reviewed for research only. This will take place in the Clinical Center. It&#xD;
      will be done by staff of the Department of Bioethics and the Human Subjects Protection Unit&#xD;
      (HSPU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect data from the Bioethics Consult database. It will also collect data&#xD;
      from HSPU records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will look at demographic data. They will look at details of capacity evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will not be extracted from existing records.&#xD;

      Objective: To characterize the process and outcomes of capacity assessments of individuals&#xD;
      who may be unable to consent to participate in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: all individuals who came to the NIH Clinical Center for possible enrollment&#xD;
      in research whose capacity to consent or assent was evaluated by the Bioethics Consultation&#xD;
      Service (BCS), the Human Subjects Protection Unit (HSPU), or the Ability to Consent&#xD;
      Assessment Team (ACAT), and all surrogate decision makers of individuals who were unable to&#xD;
      consent and were allowed by protocol to give surrogate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Retrospective record review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be whether prospective research&#xD;
      participants were judged to be able to consent or not. Secondary measures will include:&#xD;
      whether the consulting team considered it ethically acceptable to enroll the participant in&#xD;
      research; how consent was obtained for doing so; and descriptive features of the consults&#xD;
      such as the Institute that requested the consult, protocols for which consults were&#xD;
      requested, and diseases that prompted capacity assessments, among other descriptive&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
