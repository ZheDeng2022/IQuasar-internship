  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the interactions between the genes and diet&#xD;
      interventions varying in macronutrient intake on glycemic, waist circumference, body weight,&#xD;
      visceral fat and lipids changes. In the POUNDS LOST, all of the 811 participants DNA was&#xD;
      extracted from the buffy coat fraction of centrifuged blood using the QIAmp blood kit&#xD;
      (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using the OpenArrayâ„¢&#xD;
      SNP genotyping system (BioTrove, Woburn, MA). The study is only accepting participants in the&#xD;
      Boston, Massachusetts or Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. For further enrollment information in&#xD;
      Boston or Baton Rouge, see Eligibility Criteria or Design Narrative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, the investigators integrated novel pathway analyses in large cohorts and&#xD;
      comprehensive genetic analyses on long-term weight loss and mechanisms in randomized diet&#xD;
      intervention trials would provide very important evidence to unravel the etiology of obesity,&#xD;
      and have significant public health and clinical implications. Establishing relationship&#xD;
      between genetic variants and diets in determining weight change will help identify&#xD;
      individuals at high risk for obesity especially when adherent to specific diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of obesity has become a major public health problem. Obesity is a multifactorial&#xD;
      abnormality that has a genetic basis but requires environmental influences to manifest.&#xD;
      Common-form obesity is underpinned by both environmental and genetic factors. Recent&#xD;
      genome-wide association studies have identified several genes convincingly related to obesity&#xD;
      risk. Testing gene-environment interaction is a relatively new field. Evidence from&#xD;
      association studies and intervention trials continues to mount, indicating that genetic&#xD;
      components may modify lifestyle effects on the development of obesity. However, these&#xD;
      findings are at most preliminary. The interplay between genetic and environmental components&#xD;
      may facilitate the choice of more effective and specific measures for obesity prevention&#xD;
      based on personalized genetic make-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to examine whether the genetic variation affected glycemic, waist&#xD;
      circumference, body weight, visceral fat and lipids changes in response to weight-loss&#xD;
      dietary intervention varying in macronutrient intake (target percentages of energy derived&#xD;
      from fat, protein, and carbohydrate in the 4 diets were as follows 20%, 15% and 65%; 20%,&#xD;
      25%, and 55%; 40%, 15%, and 45%; and 40%, 25%, and 35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to test the interactions between the genes and diet interventions&#xD;
      varying in macronutrient intake on body weight changes. The secondary outcome is to test the&#xD;
      interactions between the genes and diet interventions varying in macronutrient intake on&#xD;
      glycemic, waist circumference, visceral fat, and lipids changes. Understanding gene-diet&#xD;
      interactions in relation to weight loss hold great promise for delivering more efficient&#xD;
      prevention and treatment on obesity and related metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, besides gene-diet interactions, the investigators will also conduct other&#xD;
      precision nutrition analysis. These analyses include interactions between pretreatment&#xD;
      factors with diet intervention adiposity traits, initial changes induced by diet intervention&#xD;
      with various outcomes measured in POUNDS Lost, including body weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      body composition, ectopic fat, and bone health.&#xD;
