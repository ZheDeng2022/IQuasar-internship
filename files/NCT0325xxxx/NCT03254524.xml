  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to create predictive models of emergency care and metrics for&#xD;
      population health that can be used to analyze how events like hospital closures or disasters&#xD;
      like Hurricane Sandy affect health care utilization by patients in specific populations or&#xD;
      geographic regions. Additionally, it will allow the development of metrics for population&#xD;
      health that can act as surveillance mechanisms to measure disease prevalence and identify&#xD;
      patterns in emergency department use that can be used to identify specific geographic regions&#xD;
      where health care is either optimized to promote health or needs to be improve so that&#xD;
      population health can be improved.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to analyze the geographic patterns of emergency department&#xD;
      utilization. This study will look at the relationship that geographic proximity and local&#xD;
      population factors have on patient use of emergency departments. Geographic proximity of&#xD;
      alternative hospitals and elicit other patient and hospital specific factors, such as&#xD;
      demographic, insurance type, diagnosis, and socioeconomic factors that lead patients to&#xD;
      choose specific hospitals for emergency care or generally lead to patients accessing&#xD;
      emergency care will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patterns of emergency department utilization by patients will be identified in specific&#xD;
      geographies such as Census tracts to determine clusters of high and low emergency department&#xD;
      use. We also analyze the patterns of emergency care use based on specific disease&#xD;
      conditions.Investigators will analyze the rate of emergency department use for patients with&#xD;
      diabetes to determine population prevalence of diseases using emergency department data.&#xD;
      Studying the pattern of use by specific geographies or disease conditions will also allow us&#xD;
      to understand how emergency department use varies among populations by geographies and the&#xD;
      socioeconomic and health care factors local to those regions.&#xD;
