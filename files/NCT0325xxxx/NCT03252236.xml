  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with stroke suffer from different impairments, including the ability to dual-tasking,&#xD;
      increased arterial stiffness, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The decrement&#xD;
      in dual-tasking performance has been found among stroke survivors, and the deterioration has&#xD;
      been related to increased risk of fall in the population. No coherent result has been&#xD;
      concluded from previous studies investigating the effect of different types of exercise&#xD;
      training on enhancing dual-tasking performance among healthy older adults and stroke&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased arterial stiffness and impaired functioning of the autonomic nervous systems, which&#xD;
      have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality, are common in stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Studies have been suggesting the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on both&#xD;
      decreasing arterial stiffness and regulating the autonomic nervous system among healthy older&#xD;
      people. However, only a few studies concerning such topic have been conducted among stroke&#xD;
      survivors, yet the results were inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai Chi is a Chinese traditional martial art and has been employed as a rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercise in recent decades. Tai Chi practitioners should perform the physical movement and&#xD;
      plan the Tai Chi forms simultaneously. The involvement of cognitive functioning gives Tai Chi&#xD;
      a dual-tasking character. Prior studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of Tai Chi&#xD;
      training on dual-tasking performance in healthy older adults, but would the effect extend to&#xD;
      stroke survivors has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, Tai Chi is considered as a mind-body exercise. It is suggested that one should keep a&#xD;
      relaxed status of mind and breathe gently and slowly. Moreover, Tai Chi is an exercise with&#xD;
      moderate intensity. These features have been found to decrease arterial stiffness and benefit&#xD;
      functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, studies have been showing Tai Chi&#xD;
      reduces arterial stiffness and improves regulation of the autonomic nervous system among&#xD;
      healthy population. Whether such effect can be observed in stroke survivors is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed at investigating the effects of Tai Chi training on dual-tasking&#xD;
      performance, arterial stiffness, and autonomic system functioning among stroke survivors.&#xD;
      Given the special features of Tai Chi and its advantageous effects on the mentioned&#xD;
      functioning, it is expected that stroke survivors may also benefit from Tai Chi training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have been showing a deterioration of dual-tasking performance among stroke&#xD;
      survivors, especially when a dynamic physical task is involved. Dual-tasking performance has&#xD;
      been associated with risk of fall among stroke survivors. Results of prior studies on&#xD;
      investigating the effect of conventional exercise on dual-tasking performance in the&#xD;
      population have not been reaching a consistent conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the ability to dual-tasking, cardiovascular functioning, such as increased&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and dysfunction of the cardiac autonomic system, has also been found&#xD;
      compromised in stroke survivors. Such deterioration has been related to increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and mortality. Research has been suggesting the beneficial effect of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise with moderate or high intensity on improving both the arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      autonomic functioning in healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai Chi is a Chinese traditional martial art and has been adopted as a rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercise in recent decades. Tai Chi can be considered as a dual-tasking exercise as its&#xD;
      practitioners should perform the physical movement, monitoring their action, and plan for the&#xD;
      next Tai Chi form simultaneously. Besides, Tai Chi is an exercise with moderate intensity. It&#xD;
      is also a mind-body exercise which emphasizes on maintaining a relaxed status of mind during&#xD;
      the practice. The mental status can be achieved by its meditation feature, as well as&#xD;
      synchronizing the Tai Chi movement with gentle, slow and deep breathing. The mind-body&#xD;
      characteristics of Tai Chi were similar to those factors proposed to improve the functioning&#xD;
      of the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, previous studies have been suggesting the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of Tai Chi training on dual-tasking performance, arterial compliance, and autonomic&#xD;
      regulation among healthy older adults. However, its effects on these functioning among stroke&#xD;
      survivors have not yet been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the characteristics of Tai Chi and previous studies on its therapeutic effects among&#xD;
      healthy older adults, the exercise may also benefit stroke survivors. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, therefore, is designed to investigate the effect of Tai Chi training on&#xD;
      dual-tasking performance, arterial compliance, and functioning of the cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system among stroke survivors. The investigators expected that these functions would&#xD;
      be improved after Tai Chi training and the training effects would be better than those of the&#xD;
      conventional exercise in stroke survivors. If Tai Chi is found beneficial to dual-tasking,&#xD;
      vascular function, and autonomic regulation, the exercise may incorporate into the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects (please refer to the 'Eligibility' part for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria) were randomized into one of the three groups: Tai Chi, conventional exercise, or&#xD;
      control (please refer to the 'Arms and Interventions' part for details of each group). The&#xD;
      dual-tasking performance was assessed with three different physical tasks:&#xD;
      turning-while-walking, stepping back, and stepping down. These physical tasks were included&#xD;
      as they are common in daily life among community-dwelling stroke survivors but can also be&#xD;
      challenging to them. Moreover, these activities were among the most prevalent reasons for&#xD;
      fall among stroke survivors. Other assessment employed in this study can be found in the&#xD;
      'Outcome Measures' part. Assessment was conducted before, after, and one month after the&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
