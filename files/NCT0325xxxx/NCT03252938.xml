  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial aims to investigate a potential enhancement of IMP321 immune-activating&#xD;
      effects by new routes of administration: direct injection of IMP321 into the tumor tissue;&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal therapy; combination of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy/targeted therapy&#xD;
      with active immunotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, IMP321 is solely administered by sub-cutaneous injection (e.g. on the anterior&#xD;
      face of the thigh). In this study, we investigate whether a direct injection of IMP321 into&#xD;
      the tumor tissue will be a useful option to improve anti-tumor immune response by placing the&#xD;
      immune-therapeutic agent in direct vicinity of immune infiltrates in the tumor bed. This&#xD;
      bypasses processes necessary for drug delivery to cells of solid tumors following systemic&#xD;
      administration, like transport within vessels, transport across vasculature walls into&#xD;
      surrounding tissues, and - in cases of peritoneal metastases - transport through the&#xD;
      interstitial space within a tumor. For the latter case, we will also explore if an&#xD;
      intra-peritoneal therapy represents a feasible alternative by means of delivering high drug&#xD;
      concentrations directly to tumors located in the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will explore the possibility to extend the positive results obtained by&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of IMP321 in metastatic renal cell and breast carcinomas to further&#xD;
      solid tumor entities. In this part of the study, patients will be treated with the&#xD;
      standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy/targeted therapy for their tumor&#xD;
      entity along with subcutaneous injections of IMP321.&#xD;
