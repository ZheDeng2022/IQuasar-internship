  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) is a surgical procedure known to be associated with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Mechanisms of cognitive impairment are complex but may include&#xD;
      insufficient oxygenation and inflammation due to exposure to the bypass circuit. Currently&#xD;
      there are no approved therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small peptide, Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], is known to decrease inflammation in the&#xD;
      brain in animal models. Early studies in humans have shown it to be safe. This peptide is&#xD;
      naturally produced by the body and has anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects.&#xD;
      Investigators believe that Ang-(1-7) may be able to help lower the risk of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients undergoing CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to explore effects of the experimental peptide Angiotensin-(1-7)&#xD;
      (Ang-(1-7) in patients undergoing an elective CABG surgery to determine its safety and&#xD;
      efficacy to prevent cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing CABG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 104 participants (ages 60-80) undergoing elective CABG surgery at the Banner University&#xD;
      Medical Center in Tucson, AZ or at Suburban Hospital/NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD,&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of&#xD;
      Angiotensin-(1-7). Subjects who have a pre-operative neurologic, learning or psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder will be excluded. In addition, a concurrent group of 20 age-matched adults will be&#xD;
      recruited as a neuropsychological control group and will undergo neuropsychological testing&#xD;
      at baseline, Day 21 and Day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to undergo a screening process to confirm eligibility and to rule&#xD;
      out depression, dementia and contraindications to MRI. Prior to randomization, baseline&#xD;
      measures will include neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, quality of life questionnaires,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and DNA/RNA sample collection. Participants will be treated for 21 days&#xD;
      with a daily dose of subcutaneous Ang-(1-7) (100 mcg/kg/day) (n=60) or placebo (n=30). These&#xD;
      measures will then be repeated at Day 21 and Day 90. The MRI will be repeated at Day 21 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic measurements will be obtained prior to administration of Ang-(1-7) or placebo&#xD;
      and hourly for 6 hours following the first 6 doses. Delirium testing will occur on a daily&#xD;
      basis post surgery until discharge. Serum study drug level will be obtained at Day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, subjects will be followed on a weekly basis by telephone for all 12 weeks of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 21 days of subcutaneous&#xD;
           (s.c.) once daily administration of Ang-(1-7) in eligible participants undergoing&#xD;
           first-time, elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine the pharmacokinetics of 21 days of treatment with Ang-(1-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To determine if 21 days of treatment with 200 mcg/kg/day of Ang-(1-7) improves&#xD;
                memory function measured as a change in performance from baseline to follow up on a&#xD;
                composite score comprised of memory, executive functioning, language and processing&#xD;
                speed in Ang-(1-7) treatment group compared to placebo controls and non-surgical&#xD;
                controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To determine if treatment with 200 mcg/kg/day Ang-(1-7) decreases postoperative&#xD;
                delirium length and severity as measured with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)&#xD;
                D2 to D7 ( or discharge) after surgery as compared to treatment with placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To determine if 21 days of treatment with 200 mcg/kg/day Ang-(1-7) improves&#xD;
                participant self-reported outcomes using standardized Kansas City Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
                Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) measurement&#xD;
                tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To determine if 21 days treatment with 200 mcg/kg/day Ang-(1-7) results in changes&#xD;
                in suicidal ideation and behavior as assessed by The Columbia Suicide Severity&#xD;
                Rating Scale (C-SSRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. To compare postoperative mortality and morbidity at 90 days in the 200 mcg/kg/day&#xD;
                Ang-(1-7) treatment group with the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. To determine if 21 days of treatment of 200 mcg/kg/day Ang-(1-7) decreases&#xD;
                postoperative observable changes in brain fractional anisotropy as measured by&#xD;
                diffuse on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Demonstrate 21 days daily administration of Ang-(1-7) in participants undergoing 1st time CABG surgery is safe and efficacious as assessed by the number of related AEs grade 3 or &gt; and change in composite neuropsychological score up to Day 90.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored from the time of enrollment through Day 90. The number of AEs, withdrawals due to AE, and withdrawals for other reasons will be tabulated. Additional assessments include: serum blood levels of the Ang-(1-7) at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5 or Discharge and Day 21. Lastly blood pressuring monitoring pre and post treatment will occur Day 1 to discharge.&#xD;
Change in performance on composite scores of memory, executive functioning, language and processing speed in the treatment arm compared to placebo arm and non-surgical controls measured at 3 time points will assess the effectiveness of Ang-(1-7) in reducing postoperative cognitive impairment in CABG patients.</description>

    <measure>Demonstrated change in the neuropsychological component scores assessed at baseline, Day 21 and Day 90 in the treatment and placebo arms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The component scores to be analyzed will include Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), assessment of general intellectual functioning (North American Adult Reading Test), prospective memory (MIST; Memory Intentions Test) , Visual Paired Associates, Object-Spatial Locations, three areas of executive functions including updating (Keep Track), shifting (Letter-Number), and inhibition (Stroop Color-Word), and psychomotor speed (Deary Simple and Complex Reaction Times, Trials A and B).</description>
