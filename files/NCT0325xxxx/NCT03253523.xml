  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occipital neuralgia and subsequent headaches are associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      impact quality of life and ability to work. Treatment is primarily medical and consists of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and medications to treat neuropathic pain. Many&#xD;
      patient exhaust medical management options and suffer from persistent symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management of chronic headaches including occipital neuralgia is emerging as a tool&#xD;
      to relieve pain and the burden of morbidity associated with this condition. Dr. Bahman&#xD;
      Guyuron has been reporting positive results in the literature for the past 20 years. In a&#xD;
      systematic review of 14 papers it has been demonstrated that peripheral nerve surgery for&#xD;
      migraines is effective and leads to an improvement of symptoms for 86% of patients.&#xD;
      Complication rates were low across all studies included. Additionally, Dr Ivica Ducic has&#xD;
      reported success specifically treating occipital neuralgia headaches, with significant&#xD;
      improvements in subjective pain outcomes post-operatively. The mechanism behind this is&#xD;
      thought to be similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, whereby peripheral nerve compression causes&#xD;
      nerve irritation and pain. The ensuing inflammatory response to tissue injury can cause&#xD;
      sensitization of nociceptors, resulting in hyperalgesia or allodynia. Surgical release of&#xD;
      tight surrounding soft tissues results in nerve decompression and relief of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are multiple case series and empiric evidence supporting the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of occipital migraine surgery, there are no randomized controlled studies comparing&#xD;
      surgical intervention with continued medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the present study, the investigators intend to randomize patients who have&#xD;
      exhausted maximal medical treatment of post-traumatic occipital headaches to either a&#xD;
      surgical management group or a continued medical management group. Surgical intervention will&#xD;
      consist of neurolysis, or release, of the occipital nerves.&#xD;

    <description>The Migraine Headache Index (MHI) is a commonly used metric in the plastic and reconstructive surgery literature to assess pre- and postoperative headache severity. The score is a product of headache duration (in days), frequency (in days per month), and severity (on a scale from 1 to 10). The score ranges from 0 to 300, with higher scores corresponding to worse migraine symptoms. Change in MHI score between pre-operative and 6-month postoperatively will be assessed.</description>
