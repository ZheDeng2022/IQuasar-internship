      Innovative and novel HIV prevention interventions are urgently needed for African American&#xD;
      (AA) young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the South, and in Mississippi in particular.&#xD;
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a newer HIV prevention strategy that consists of a&#xD;
      daily oral antiretroviral pill taken on an ongoing basis by HIV-uninfected but at-risk&#xD;
      individuals. Although acceptability studies have demonstrated high interested in PrEP in the&#xD;
      US, uptake remains limited. To date, studies of PrEP initiation have largely been limited to&#xD;
      settings in which PrEP is provided free of charge. Barriers to PrEP initiation and retention&#xD;
      in PrEP care in real world settings are likely more complex, since payment for PrEP can be a&#xD;
      substantial financial burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAPT_ITT approach (an approach to adapting behavioral interventions to new populations:&#xD;
      Assessment, Decision, Administration, Production, Topical Experts - Integration, Training,&#xD;
      Testing) will be used to develop and pilot test a RAMP (Retain African American Men in PrEP)&#xD;
      intervention that aims to promote PrEP adherence and retention in care in Jackson, MS and&#xD;
      focuses on recruiting AA YMSM in a city with some of the highest HIV infection rates in the&#xD;
      country. This study will include formative research to understand the cultural and social&#xD;
      contexts that influence AA YMSM's PrEP use patterns and the acceptability of our proposed&#xD;
      intervention. Results from these qualitative interviews will inform the study intervention&#xD;
      which will be tested and refined in a dynamic open pilot evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic in the&#xD;
      United States (US), and the number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM is increasing every year.&#xD;
      Despite HIV incidence remaining relatively stable overall, HIV incidence is increasing among&#xD;
      MSM, and among Black/African American (hereafter AA) young MSM (YMSM) in particular. Black/AA&#xD;
      MSM represent less than 1% of the population but account for 25% of new HIV diagnoses.&#xD;
      Compared to MSM of other races, AA MSM are 3 times more likely to be HIV infected. Among&#xD;
      YMSM, the disparities are greatest; AA MSM aged 20-29 have an HIV prevalence of 34%, whereas&#xD;
      White MSM in the same age range have an HIV prevalence of 5.5%. Additionally, the American&#xD;
      South accounts for 46% of new HIV diagnoses in the US and 45% of new AIDS diagnoses.&#xD;
      Mississippi is ranked 7th in the country in HIV case rates, with an overall rate of 20.7 per&#xD;
      100,000 persons; however, some census tracts have rates of 2-5%, which is comparable to some&#xD;
      sub-Saharan African countries. There are alarming racial disparities related to HIV/AIDS; in&#xD;
      Mississippi, AAs comprise 37% of the population but accounted for 76% of HIV infection&#xD;
      reported in 2013. Between 2011 and 2013, the number of infections among MSM in Mississippi&#xD;
      increased 43%, with an even sharper increase among AA YMSM, who have among the highest rates&#xD;
      of infection in the nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the disproportionate burden of HIV, worse HIV outcomes, and current social climate,&#xD;
      innovative and novel HIV prevention interventions are urgently needed for AA YMSM in the&#xD;
      South, and in Mississippi in particular. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a newer HIV&#xD;
      prevention strategy that consists of a daily oral antiretroviral pill taken on an ongoing&#xD;
      basis by HIV-uninfected but at-risk individuals. Its efficacy has been well established in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials and open-label studies for MSM and other groups. Although&#xD;
      acceptability studies have demonstrated high interest in PrEP in the US, uptake remains&#xD;
      limited. To date, studies of PrEP initiation have largely been limited to settings in which&#xD;
      PrEP is provided free of charge. Barriers to PrEP initiation and retention in PrEP care in&#xD;
      real world settings are likely more complex, since payment for PrEP can be a substantial&#xD;
      financial burden. Although most health insurance programs are covering the cost of PrEP, and&#xD;
      the industry-sponsored PrEP Medication Assistance Program exists to assist people who do not&#xD;
      have insurance, these programs require patient and clinician awareness, sufficient staffing&#xD;
      and appropriate infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A body of evidence is only beginning to emerge related to PrEP adherence and little is known&#xD;
      about retention in PrEP care, most of which is in the context of either RCTs or open-label&#xD;
      studies in which PrEP is provided free of charge. The efficacy of PrEP is closely tied to&#xD;
      adherence, and evidence suggests that efficacy decreases exponentially with fewer doses of&#xD;
      PrEP per week; maximum efficacy is achieved when 6-7 doses are taken per week, but PrEP&#xD;
      provides high protection with at least 4 doses per week. In an open label study of PrEP&#xD;
      uptake and adherence in MSM, 71% of participants receiving PrEP had drug detected after&#xD;
      initiation of PrEP. AA YMSM in Jackson, MS face many challenges to optimal adherence and&#xD;
      retention in care, including inconsistent routines, socioeconomic challenges, and logistical&#xD;
      difficulty in returning for follow-up visits. MSM may not want to disclose use of PrEP to&#xD;
      family or friends, due to the potential for unintended disclosure of sexual orientation,&#xD;
      which may result in reduced social support for PrEP adherence or returning for care.&#xD;
      Understanding barriers and facilitators to adherence and retention in care for AA YMSM, and&#xD;
      subsequently the development of interventions to improve them, will be necessary to ensure&#xD;
      maximum PrEP effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAPT_ITT approach will be used to develop and pilot test a RAMP intervention that aims&#xD;
      to promote PrEP adherence and retention in care in Jackson, MS and focuses on recruiting AA&#xD;
      YMSM in a city with some of the highest HIV infection rates in the country. This study will&#xD;
      include formative research to understand the cultural and social contexts that influence AA&#xD;
      YMSM's PrEP use patterns and the acceptability of our proposed intervention. Results from&#xD;
      these qualitative interviews will inform the study intervention which will be tested and&#xD;
      refined in a dynamic open pilot evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews (Phase 1) will &quot;assess&quot; individual, interpersonal and structural&#xD;
      contexts of sexual risk behavior, anticipated adoption and use of new prevention&#xD;
      technologies, barriers and facilitators to PrEP initiation and adherence, and optimal content&#xD;
      and format for a PrEP initiation and adherence intervention. Using results of the qualitative&#xD;
      interviews and input from key opinion leaders, the investigators will &quot;decide&quot; on&#xD;
      intervention components and structure of the intervention package. The investigators will&#xD;
      then &quot;adapt&quot; the Life-Steps intervention to be responsive to the unique context and complex&#xD;
      needs of AA YMSM in Jackson, and &quot;produce&quot; a draft of the intervention manual. Our study team&#xD;
      is made up of &quot;topical experts&quot; who will all have a central role in developing the&#xD;
      intervention manual. Moreover, the open pilot evaluation (Phase 2) will be used to obtain&#xD;
      further input on the draft intervention manual and protocol. After &quot;integrating&quot; the feedback&#xD;
      obtained from the open pilot evaluation and exit interviews into the intervention manual and&#xD;
      protocol, study staff will be &quot;trained&quot; in all final study procedures, and a provisional&#xD;
      theory-based intervention to overcome barriers to PrEP adherence and retention, and reduce&#xD;
      sexual risk behavior, among AA YMSM will be &quot;tested&quot; in a pilot Randomized Control Trial&#xD;
      (RCT) (Phase 3). This intervention will have broad generalizability for AA YMSM across the&#xD;
      South and the country as PrEP programs expand nationwide.&#xD;
