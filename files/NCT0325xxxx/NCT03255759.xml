  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of rapid panel-based molecular assays for direct organism identification and&#xD;
      resistance characterization in positive blood culture bottles are now commercially available.&#xD;
      They have been shown to improve accuracy and decrease the time-to-result, allowing targeted&#xD;
      treatment in hospitalized patients with bacteraemia, in high-income countries (HICs).&#xD;
      However, these molecular assays are add-on tests performed in addition to conventional&#xD;
      testing, increasing the complexity of diagnostic algorithms and costs of patient care.&#xD;
      Conventional organism identification includes performing a Gram stain, biochemical&#xD;
      identification and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. The FilmArray Blood Culture&#xD;
      Identification (BioFire, USA) is an example of a rapid panel-based molecular assay that&#xD;
      combines nesting and multiplexing of PCR (nested multiplex PCR) to detect multiple pathogens&#xD;
      simultaneously. There are limited data on how such tests impact patient management, health&#xD;
      care costs and how they can better be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the added value and acceptability of a multiplexed&#xD;
      molecular diagnostic assay in the identification of pathogens in patients presenting with&#xD;
      bacteremia at hospitals in LMICs, and to assess health care providers' satisfaction with the&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What impact can we project if additional diagnostic information were to be provided to&#xD;
           clinicians in terms of patient outcomes, costs, and antibiotic use?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the workflow constraints on returning diagnostic results to clinicians and/or&#xD;
           antibiotic stewardship programs? Overall, the aim is to assess the added value and&#xD;
           acceptability of a multiplexed molecular diagnostic assay in the identification of&#xD;
           pathogens in patients presenting with bacteremia at hospitals in LMICs and to assess&#xD;
           health care providers' satisfaction with the assay.&#xD;

    <description>The judgment as to whether antimicrobial treatment was effective or optimal will be assessed by two members of the study team (infectious disease specialists and/or microbiologists) blinded to treatment group.
