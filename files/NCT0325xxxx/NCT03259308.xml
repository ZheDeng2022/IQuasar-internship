          -  Participants with colonic dysplasia or neoplasia. (Participants with prior history of&#xD;
             adenomatous polyps will be eligible if the polyps have been completely removed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with past medical history or presence of toxic megacolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with colonic stricture, past medical history of colonic resection, a&#xD;
             history of bowel surgery within 6 months before screening, or who are likely to&#xD;
             require surgery for UC during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants at risk for colorectal cancer must have a colonoscopy performed during&#xD;
             the screening period with results available within 10 days before the baseline visit,&#xD;
             unless the participant has had a surveillance colonoscopy performed within 1 year&#xD;
             prior to screening, and any adenomatous polyps found at that examination have been&#xD;
             excised. Colonoscopy report and pathology report (if biopsies are obtained) from the&#xD;
             colonoscopy performed during screening or in the prior year confirming no evidence of&#xD;
             dysplasia and colon cancer must be available in the source documents.&#xD;

             investigational product(s), closely related compounds, or any of the stated&#xD;
             ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants have received anti-TNF treatment within 60 days before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants have received any biologic with immunomodulatory properties (other than&#xD;

&#xD;
             - Participants have received any nonbiologic treatment with immunomodulatory&#xD;
             properties (other than their current background UC treatment) within 30 days before&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants have ever received anti-integrin/adhesion molecule treatment (example&#xD;
             (eg): natalizumab, vedolizumab, efalizumab, etrolizumab, or any other investigational&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Participants have received parenteral or rectal glucocorticoids, or rectal 5-ASA,&#xD;
                  within 14 days before screening endoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants have received leukocyte apheresis or selective lymphocyte, monocyte,&#xD;
                  or granulocyte apheresis or plasma exchange within 30 days before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants have participated in other investigational studies within either 30&#xD;
                  days or 5 half-lives of investigational product used in the study (whichever is&#xD;
                  longer) before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants have received a live (attenuated) vaccine within 30 days before the&#xD;
                  baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with active enteric infections (positive stool culture and&#xD;
                  sensitivity), Clostridium difficile infection or pseudomembranous colitis&#xD;
                  [Participants with C. difficile infection at screening may be allowed re-test&#xD;
                  after treatment], evidence of active cytomegalovirus infection or Listeria&#xD;
                  monocytogenes, known active invasive fungal infections such as histoplasmosis or&#xD;
                  parasitic infections, clinically significant underlying disease that could&#xD;
                  predispose the participants to infections, or a history of serious infection&#xD;
                  (requiring parenteral antibiotic and/or hospitalization) within 4 weeks before&#xD;
                  the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with abnormal chest x-ray findings at screening, such as presence of&#xD;
                  active tuberculosis (TB), general infections, heart failure, or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium TB or&#xD;
                  participants with this history who have not completed a generally accepted full&#xD;
                  course of treatment before randomization are excluded. All other participants&#xD;
                  must have either the Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD]) tuberculin skin&#xD;
                  test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have no history of previously diagnosed active or latent TB are excluded&#xD;
        if they have a positive Mantoux (PPD) tuberculin skin test (ie &gt;=5 millimeter [mm]&#xD;
        induration) or a positive IGRA (the latter to be tested at the site's local laboratory)&#xD;
        during screening or within 12 weeks before screening. If IGRA test cannot be performed&#xD;
        locally, a central laboratory may be used, with prior agreement from the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An IGRA is strongly recommended for participants with a prior Bacillus Calmette-Guerin&#xD;
             (BCG) vaccination, but may be used for any participant. Documentation of IGRA product&#xD;
             used and the test result must be in the participant's source documentation if&#xD;
             performed locally. Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON TB Gold Plus In-Tube&#xD;
             Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a&#xD;
             negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. In participants with no history&#xD;
             of treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the&#xD;
             participant. Participants with a history of active or latent TB infection must follow&#xD;
             instructions for &quot;Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are&#xD;
             excluded unless both of the following criteria are met&quot; in this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history, may be&#xD;
             enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who&#xD;
             determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be acceptable for&#xD;
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action). This&#xD;
             consultation must be included in source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Results from a chest x-ray, taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening must show&#xD;
        no abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a qualified medical&#xD;
        specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are excluded unless both of the&#xD;
        following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The participant has previously received an adequate course of treatment for either&#xD;
             latent (eg, 9 months of isoniazid or an acceptable alternative regimen, in a locale&#xD;
             where rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are &lt;5%. Participants from regions with&#xD;
             higher rates of primary multidrug TB resistance are excluded) or active (acceptable&#xD;
             multidrug regimen) TB infection. Evidence of diagnosis and treatment must be included&#xD;
             in source documentation. Consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease&#xD;
             specialist to confirm adequate treatment (ie, participant would be acceptable for&#xD;
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action) must be&#xD;
             performed during the screening period. The consultation report must be included in&#xD;
             source documentation prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A chest x-ray performed within 12 weeks before screening or during screening indicates&#xD;
             no evidence of active or recurrent disease, and documentation of interpretation by a&#xD;
             qualified medical specialist must be included in source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with a pre-existing demyelinating disorder such as multiple&#xD;
                  sclerosis or new onset seizures, unexplained sensory motor, or cognitive&#xD;
                  behavioral, neurological deficits, or significant abnormalities noted during&#xD;
                  screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with any unexplained symptoms suggestive of progressive multifocal&#xD;
                  leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on the targeted neurological assessment during&#xD;
                  the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with a transplanted organ. Skin grafts to treat pyoderma gangrenosum&#xD;
                  are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with a significant concurrent medical condition at the time of&#xD;
                  screening or baseline, including, but not limited to, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any major illness/condition or evidence of an unstable clinical condition (eg, renal,&#xD;
             hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal (except disease under study), endocrine,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty's syndrome], or local active&#xD;
             infection/infectious illness) that, in the investigator's judgment will substantially&#xD;
             increase the risk to the participant if he or she participates in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cancer or history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within the previous 5 years&#xD;
             (other than resected cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix that has been treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of acute coronary syndrome (eg, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris) within 24 weeks before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of significant cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants who have had significant trauma or major surgery within 4 weeks before&#xD;
             the screening visit, or with any major elective surgery scheduled to occur during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants with evidence of cirrhosis with or without decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants with primary sclerosing cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants with evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If a participant tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for HBcAb, the&#xD;
             participant would be considered eligible if no presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA&#xD;
             is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reflex testing performed in&#xD;
             the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (positive HCV antibody [HCVAb]&#xD;
                  and HCVRNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Participants who are HCVAb positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be&#xD;
             considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured&#xD;
             [defined as no evidence of HCVRNA at least 12 weeks prior to baseline]).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with any of the following abnormalities in hematology and/or serum&#xD;
                  chemistry profiles during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Screening laboratory tests, if the results are considered by the investigator to&#xD;
             be transient and inconsistent with the participant's clinical condition, may be&#xD;
             repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results must be reviewed&#xD;
             for eligibility prior to the screening endoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels &gt;=3.0×upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Total bilirubin level &gt;=1.5×ULN or &gt;2.0×ULN if the participant has a known documented&#xD;
             history of Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hemoglobin level &lt;=80 gram per liter (g/L) (8.0 gram per deciliter [g/dL]).&#xD;

          4. Platelet count &lt;=100×10^9 per liter (/L) (100,000 cells per cubic millimeter [mm^3])&#xD;
             or &gt;=1000×10^9/L (1,000,000 cells/mm^3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. White blood cell count &lt;=3.5×10^9/L (3500 cells/mm^3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&lt;2×10^9/L (2000 cells/mm^3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 × ULN or estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30&#xD;
             ml/min/1.73m^2 based on the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study&#xD;
             Equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If platelet count is &lt;150,000 cells/mm^3, a further evaluation should be&#xD;
             performed to rule out cirrhosis, unless another etiology has already been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on&#xD;
                  documented history, with positive serological test, or positive HIV serologic&#xD;
                  test at screening, tested at the site's local laboratory in accordance with&#xD;
                  country requirements or tested at the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A documented negative HIV test within 6 months of screening is acceptable and&#xD;
             does not need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants who have, or who have a history of (within 2 years before screening),&#xD;
             serious psychiatric disease, alcohol dependency, or substance/drug abuse or dependency&#xD;
             of any kind, including abuse of medical marijuana (cannabis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Participants with any other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition&#xD;
             or laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Female participants who are planning to become pregnant during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who do not agree to postpone donation of any organ or tissue,&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Remission Based on Composite Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Remission was defined as a composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as stool frequency sub-score of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline, rectal bleeding sub-score of 0 and endoscopic sub-score of 0 or 1 (modified, excluded friability). The composite score was a recommended measure derived from the Mayo score without the physician global assessment (PGA) sub-score and ranged from 0 to 9 points. The Mayo score was a measure of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) disease activity. It ranged from 0 to 12 points and consisted of 4 sub-scores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The sub-scores were stool frequency (0-3); rectal bleeding (0-3); findings of endoscopy (0-3); PGA (0-3).</description>

          <description>Clinical response based on composite score was defined as a decrease from baseline in the composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of at least 2 points and at least 30 percent (%), with an accompanying decrease in the sub-score for rectal bleeding greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 point or a sub-score for rectal bleeding less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1. The composite score was a recommended measure derived from the Mayo score without the PGA sub-score and ranged from 0 to 9 points. The Mayo score was a measure of UC disease activity. It ranged from 0 to 12 points and consisted of 4 sub-scores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease The sub-scores were stool frequency (0-3); rectal bleeding (0-3); findings of endoscopy (0-3); PGA (0-3).</description>

        <description>Mucosal healing was defined by centrally read endoscopic sub-score 0 or 1 (modified, excluded friability) and centrally read Geboes score of &lt;=2. The centrally read endoscopic sub-score of Mayo score ranged from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Geboes score grading system, was a validated score for evaluating histologic disease activity in UC as follows: grade 0 equal to (=) structural and architectural changes; grade 1 = chronic inflammatory infiltrate; grade 2 = lamina propria neutrophils and eosinophils; grade 3 = neutrophils in the epithelium; grade 4 = crypt destruction; grade 5 = erosions or ulceration. A higher Geboes score indicating more severe disease.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Worst Abdominal Pain Score Based on Patient Reported Outcome-ulcerative Colitis (PRO-UC) Daily e-Diary at Week 12</title>
        <description>PRO-UC signs and symptom data were collected using a daily e-diary during treatment period. Collection of daily e-diary data was begun at least 10 days before the baseline visit. Participants were asked to record the signs and symptom data of abdominal pain worst severity, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e-diary. Participant's signs and symptom average scores at each scheduled visit were calculated based on data recorded over the most recent 3 days (consecutive or non-consecutive) of last 10 days prior to the scheduled visit start date excluding the following days: day of any bowel preparation, day of endoscopy, any days between day of bowel preparation and day of endoscopy, and the 2 days after the day of endoscopy. Abdominal pain's worst severity assessment was based on an 11-point numerical rating scale with 0 anchor at &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 at &quot;Worst Imaginable Pain&quot; as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e-diary. Higher scores indicating more severe pain.</description>

Participant's signs and symptom average scores at each scheduled visit were calculated based on data recorded over the most recent 3 days (consecutive or non-consecutive) of last 10 days prior to the scheduled visit start date excluding the following days: day of any bowel preparation, day of endoscopy, any days between day of bowel preparation and day of endoscopy, and the 2 days after the day of endoscopy. Abdominal pain's worst severity assessment was based on an 11-point numerical rating scale with 0 anchor at &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 at &quot;Worst Imaginable Pain&quot; as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e-diary. Higher scores indicating more severe pain.</description>

        <description>IBDQ was a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease-specific HRQL in participants with inflammatory bowel disease, included UC. The IBDQ consisted of 32 items, which were grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. The 4 domains were scored as follows: Bowel symptoms: 10 to 70; Systemic symptoms: 5 to 35; Emotional function: 12 to 84; Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranged from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicating better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points was considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

          <description>IBDQ was a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease-specific HRQL in participants with inflammatory bowel disease, included UC. The IBDQ consisted of 32 items, which were grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. The 4 domains were scored as follows: Bowel symptoms: 10 to 70; Systemic symptoms: 5 to 35; Emotional function: 12 to 84; Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranged from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicating better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points was considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>
          <population>FAS consisted of all participants in the randomized set who had received at least 1 dose of IP. Here, overall number of participants analyzed signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and number analyzed refer to participants evaluable at specific time point.</population>

        <description>SF-36 was a generic quality-of-life instrument that had been widely used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) of participants. SF-36 consisted of 36 items that were aggregated into 8 multi-item scales (physical functioning [1=yes, limited a lot to 3=no, not limited at all], role-physical [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time], bodily pain [1=very severe to 6=none], general health [1=poor to 5=excellent], vitality [1=none of the time to 5=all of the time], social functioning [1=all of the time: to 5=none of the time], role emotional [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time] and mental health [1=all of the time to 5=none of the time]). Four domains comprised physical component summary (PCS) score (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health) and remaining 4 domains comprised mental component summary (MCS) score (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). The scores ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicating better HRQL.</description>
