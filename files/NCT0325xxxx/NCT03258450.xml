    <textblock>
      Studies have reported about one-third to half of advanced cancer patients experience&#xD;
      psychological distress yet the mental healthcare needs of these patients are not properly&#xD;
      assessed and addressed. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer can face unique challenges&#xD;
      that are stoma- or bowel-related in addition to other symptom burden such as pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      and existential distress that have deleterious consequences on their psychological and social&#xD;
      functioning. This pilot study aims to test an intervention for patients specifically with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer that incorporates culturally-appropriate topics. Using a&#xD;
      randomized selection design, we will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention and obtain an initial estimate of efficacy of the intervention. This pilot study&#xD;
      will yield useful information to inform the preparation of a larger, phase III confirmatory&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death in Singapore and colorectal cancer is the most&#xD;
      frequently diagnosed cancer in males and second most frequently diagnosed cancer in females,&#xD;
      accounting for 17% and 13% of all cancers respectively. Such high incidence rates are&#xD;
      consistent with reports of colorectal cancer being a disease of ageing and developed nations&#xD;
      . A total of 8931 new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in Singapore from 2009 and&#xD;
      2013, with data indicating a steep increase in incidence rate for patients aged 50 and above.&#xD;
      Given that the number of adults aged 65 years and older to double from 2009 to 2030&#xD;
      (Singapore Department of Statistics), the number of colorectal cancer cases are also expected&#xD;
      to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced colorectal cancer refers to stage IV cancer of the colon or rectum that cannot be&#xD;
      cured and has metastasized to at least one distant organ or set of lymph nodes, and that will&#xD;
      likely continue to spread, leading to end of life (National Cancer Institute). In Singapore&#xD;
      between 2009 and 2013, approximately 25% of colorectal cancer cases were at stage IV.&#xD;
      According to the U.S. NCI's SEER database of patients from 2004-2010, 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      for stage IV colon and rectal cancer were 11% and 12% respectively, suggesting these patients&#xD;
      are or will soon be managing symptoms of their disease like pain while psychologically&#xD;
      confronting end-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The news of metastatic disease, treatment failure, and/or bleak prognosis can be demoralizing&#xD;
      for some patients and characterized by shock, denial, anger, anxiety, and depression which&#xD;
      can interfere with everyday living. Studies have reported about one-third to half of advanced&#xD;
      cancer patients experience psychological distress and existential crises, yet studies&#xD;
      indicate the needs of these patients are not properly assessed and addressed as healthcare&#xD;
      providers tend to focus more on patients' physical problems and do not have the time and&#xD;
      perceived competency to address emotional distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer comes with its own set of challenges that can significantly alter patients'&#xD;
      daily living and affect patient psychological well-being and quality of life. Bowel-related&#xD;
      issues have been reported to present physical, psychological, and social challenges to&#xD;
      patients and survivors. For instance, patients with surgically-created stoma as part of&#xD;
      treatment may face complications of leakage, skin, and odour issues that can lead to anxiety,&#xD;
      disturbance in body image, low self-esteem, and social isolation. Furthermore, clinical&#xD;
      anecdotes have pointed toward this patient population being concerned about lifestyle factors&#xD;
      influencing their disease progression, especially diet. Psychological care has been&#xD;
      increasingly recognized as an important part of treatment for this population at such a&#xD;
      vulnerable time. Psychological care aims to address patients' mood and worries as they deal&#xD;
      with their illness and to help patients find a sense of meaning in their life despite their&#xD;
      cancer-related suffering. Unfortunately, psychological care as part of oncology supportive/&#xD;
      palliative services is still very rudimentary in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioural therapy is a widely used, evidence-based therapy that focuses on&#xD;
      cognitions, emotions, and behaviour change to address patient distress. This framework has&#xD;
      been successfully applied in the treatment of many disorders, including anxiety disorders,&#xD;
      depression, chronic pain, and insomnia. It is posited that psycho-behavioural interventions&#xD;
      (PBIs) that are based on cognitive-behavioural frameworks can be designed to meet the needs&#xD;
      of cancer patients by targeting and modifying their maladaptive thoughts about the disease&#xD;
      and treatment (e.g., irrational beliefs, negative attitudes, unrealistic expectations) and&#xD;
      their behaviour (e.g., maladaptive coping strategies, isolation, self-negligence). This can&#xD;
      be done by teaching patients strategies such as cognitive restructuring, meaning-making,&#xD;
      relaxation, activity-pacing, effective communication with others, and utilization of social&#xD;
      support. By learning these skills, patients are expected to have increased health-related&#xD;
      self-efficacy (i.e., belief in the capacity to manage one's health) that may act as a buffer&#xD;
      from them prematurely adopting the &quot;sick role&quot;. Self-efficacy can be extremely important in&#xD;
      the context of advanced cancer as it allows patients to feel more in control of a situation&#xD;
      that is often distressing because of the uncertainty associated with the illness. This in&#xD;
      turn may have an effect on patient psychological well-being, symptom management, and&#xD;
      utilization of healthcare services such as emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of PBIs in alleviating physical symptoms in early-stage cancer has been&#xD;
      well-documented. However, the role of such intervention for advanced cancer patients is less&#xD;
      clear due to lack of well-designed studies. Advanced disease has unique challenges; for&#xD;
      instance, more severe physical symptoms and confrontation of existential meaning as patients&#xD;
      approach end of life. This can be associated with greater distress and suffering for&#xD;
      patients. A recent review noted that interpretation of the efficacy/effectiveness of PBIs for&#xD;
      advanced cancer is limited by the paucity of randomized-controlled studies and lack of&#xD;
      racial/ethnic diversity in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a PBI designed for&#xD;
      advanced colorectal patients implemented in a Singapore context. The intervention will be&#xD;
      facilitated by clinical psychologists whose specialty area is psycho-oncology, so as to allow&#xD;
      in-depth discussions about suffering associated with cancer and confrontation of end-of-life&#xD;
      issues. In this early phase trial, we think it is prudent to conduct the pilot intervention&#xD;
      with a homogeneous cancer site so that we can teach symptom management skills that are&#xD;
      specific to colorectal cancer. Additionally, we prefer to keep the disease characteristics,&#xD;
      prognosis, and indicated treatments as similar as possible across our sample. Such&#xD;
      homogeneity prevents the dilution of the intervention effects and facilitates the aim of&#xD;
      obtaining an initial estimate of intervention efficacy. The intervention will be unique in&#xD;
      that it will include a) therapeutic discussion on legacy building as a way to open discussion&#xD;
      about fear of death; b) addressing changed family dynamics, which is important in an Asian&#xD;
      context, and c) discussing adaptation to living with bowel-related issues that are a common&#xD;
      cause of distress for this patient population. It will be important to use a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled design, which is the gold-standard, to provide a definitive answer on&#xD;
      the role of PBIs for advanced cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the significance of the study is twofold. Firstly, the proposed PBI pilot study&#xD;
      will provide essential, useful information on feasibility and acceptability of providing&#xD;
      low-cost, psychological care to advanced colorectal cancer patients that have the potential&#xD;
      to address their distress and reduce unnecessary healthcare utilization in Singapore.&#xD;
      Secondly, this would be an opportunity to add to the larger body of knowledge on the role of&#xD;
      PBIs in provision of supportive care in an Asian setting and beyond. The results will be&#xD;
      informative in deciding the worthiness of a phase III confirmatory study. Patients require&#xD;
      support throughout the course of their cancer treatment, and currently there are gaps in&#xD;
      provision of psychological care for patients with advanced cancer in Singapore's healthcare&#xD;
      system. Our long-term goal is to implement evidence-based, cost-effective and scalable&#xD;
      psychosocial support as a standard part of supportive care in Singapore.&#xD;
