      The goal of this research study is to determine if union rates are affected by early&#xD;
      weight-bearing after Lapidus Arthrodesis using the Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the union rate for those who undergo a Lapidus Arthrodesis&#xD;
      procedure with the Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail and participate in an early weight-bearing&#xD;
      protocol will be non-inferior to union rates previously published for this procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will undergo a Lapidus Arthrodesis which entails cartilage removal from the 1st&#xD;
      TMT joint, subchondral bone preparation, deformity correction, temporary fixation and&#xD;
      permanent fixation with the Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail. The Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail is&#xD;
      inserted by drilling a hole for the nail at a specified location using instrumentation and a&#xD;
      targeting guide. The nail is inserted into the drill hole and is fixated to the medial&#xD;
      cuneiform and 1st metatarsal using three threaded pegs and a locking screw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subchondral drill and chisel are provided in the system with the Lapidus Nail. Subchondral&#xD;
      drilling and feathering of the subchondral bone with a chisel are standard ways to prepare&#xD;
      the subchondral bone and elicit bleeding bone prior to arthrodesis. Use of this&#xD;
      instrumentation is encouraged for this study to ensure that proper bone preparation is&#xD;
      performed for arthrodesis. A torque indicating driver is also encouraged to be used for this&#xD;
      procedure to help guide the surgeon to appropriate compression to apply across the joint.&#xD;
      Alternatively, a standard driver and handle can be used with two-finger tightness when&#xD;
      compressing the joint to achieve a similar effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, it is common for people who undergo a Lapidus Arthrodesis to be&#xD;
      non-weight-bearing for 6-8 Weeks following the surgical procedure. This time allows the bones&#xD;
      to properly fuse together. During this 6-8 week period, people can be limited in the typical&#xD;
      day-to-day activities they participate in, such as walking, shopping and working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail may allow subjects to bear weight earlier than traditional&#xD;
      procedures without negatively effecting fusion. By allowing people to bear weight earlier&#xD;
      than traditional methods, it is possible that people will have the opportunity to resume&#xD;
      typical day-to-day activities faster than usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study in question will investigate the Phantom™ Intramedullary Nail with the following&#xD;
      early weight-bearing protocol (see &quot;Post-Operative Protocol for Study Participant&quot; below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study preference is that subjects are placed in a splint from 0-2 Weeks. However, a cast&#xD;
      may be substituted according to surgeon preference. No casts are permitted beyond 2 Weeks,&#xD;
      unless deemed as a medical necessity in which case the subject would no longer follow the&#xD;
      early weight-bearing protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study preference is that subject will be placed in a walking boot at 2 Weeks. However, an&#xD;
      immobilizing shoe may be substituted according to surgeon preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Operative Protocol for Study Participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Level Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary: Most activities are done seated or lying down. Surgically repaired foot should be&#xD;
      raised when in seated or reclined position. Standing limited to less than 15 minutes per&#xD;
      hour. Moving is limited to necessary activities such as going to the bathroom or food&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light Activity: Standing limited to less than 30 minutes per hour. Movement is mostly limited&#xD;
      to in-home movement such as folding laundry or wiping counters. Short time periods of&#xD;
      movement to leave the house can be performed for necessary activities (such as the grocery&#xD;
      store), but should be limited to less than 30 minutes of standing time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate Activity: No limits on standing. Walking limited to 45 minute time periods no more&#xD;
      than 3 times per day. No running, jumping or heavy lifting (more than 25 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heavy Activity: No limits on walking, running and jumping. No lifting limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0-2 Weeks After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Footwear: You will have a splint (or cast) on your surgically repaired foot/leg. The&#xD;
           splint (or cast) should not be removed. You will wear a comfortable shoe on the other&#xD;
           foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-Bearing: Do not put any weight on your surgically repaired foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility Aid: You will use a walking aid such as crutches, rolling knee scooter or&#xD;
           wheelchair to keep all weight off of your surgically repaired foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of Motion Exercises: None.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity level: Sedentary after surgery working up to light activity over two Weeks&#xD;
           (restarting activities of daily living without putting weight on your foot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-6 Weeks After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Footwear: A restrictive boot (or shoe) will be given to you by your doctor. This should&#xD;
           not be removed other than for range of motion exercises and bathing (seated). Wear a&#xD;
           comfortable shoe on the other foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-Bearing: Put weight on your foot as you can tolerate in the restrictive boot (or&#xD;
           shoe). Do not walk without the restrictive boot (or shoe).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility Aid: If possible, no walking aid should be used. If needed for pain, use a&#xD;
           walking aid as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of Motion Exercises: You will do range of motion exercises without the restrictive&#xD;
           boot (or shoe) with no weight on your foot, as instructed by your doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity level: Light activity with restrictive boot (or shoe). 6 Weeks-3 Months After&#xD;
           Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Footwear: You will wear a restrictive boot (or shoe) working up to supportive shoe&#xD;
           (preferably a lace-up or Velcro shoe including sneakers, running shoes, work boots or&#xD;
           soft leather shoes without a heel) by 8 Weeks after your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-Bearing: Put weight on your foot as you can tolerate. Barefoot walking is not&#xD;
           encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility Aid: No help from crutches, scooter, or wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of Motion Exercises: You will do range of motion exercises as instructed by your&#xD;
           doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity level: Light activity working up to moderate activity (low impact) as you can&#xD;
           tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-6 Months After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Footwear: At Month 3-4, move from a supportive shoe to footwear of your choice, as you&#xD;
           can tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-Bearing: Put weight on your foot as you can tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility Aid: No help from crutches, scooter, or wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity level: Moderate activity for 3-4 Months post-operative, slowly moving into&#xD;
           heavy activity as you can tolerate after Month 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 Months - 2 Years After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Footwear: You have no restrictions on footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight-Bearing: Put weight on your foot as you can tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mobility Aid: No help from crutches, scooter, or wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity Level: No activity limits.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of adults age 18 and older with a painful bunion&#xD;
        deformity. The most common age demographic to have surgery for hallux valgus correction is&#xD;
        age 50-59. Additionally, the prevalence of hallux valgus in females is greater than males,&#xD;
        so a higher percentage of female subjects seeking treatment is likely to be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This population is suitable for the purpose of the investigation, as groups most likely to&#xD;
        seek treatment (surgical) for hallux valgus correction will be represented in this study.&#xD;
