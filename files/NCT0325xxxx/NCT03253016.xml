      Cervical insufficiency is primarily a clinical diagnosis, characterized by painless cervical&#xD;
      dilation leading to recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses/births of otherwise normal&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse perinatal events associated with cervical insufficiency include prolapse of the fetal&#xD;
      membranes into the vagina, intra-amniotic infection, preterm premature rupture of membranes,&#xD;
      preterm labor and fetal loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital and acquired cervical abnormalities increase the risk of cervical insufficiency;&#xD;
      Acquired risk factors are more common and include cervical trauma during delivery, rapid&#xD;
      mechanical cervical dilation before a gynecologic procedure or treatment of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (1). Congenital abnormalities include genetic disorders affecting&#xD;
      collagen, uterine anomalies and in the past - in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure (2,&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of cervical insufficiency is based on either&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of painless cervical dilatation with preterm (midtrimester) delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of prior second-trimester pregnancy losses or preterm births and cervical length&#xD;
           ≤25 mm on transvaginal ultrasonography examination or advanced cervical changes on&#xD;
           physical examination before 24 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of cervical insufficiency is usually limited to singleton gestations. In&#xD;
      addition, preterm labor, infection, abruptio placenta, and bleeding placenta previa should be&#xD;
      excluded, as these disorders could account for biochemically mediated cervical ripening&#xD;
      leading to second-trimester pregnancy loss or preterm delivery independent of&#xD;
      structural/anatomic cervical weakness [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) defines cervical insufficiency&#xD;
      as the inability of the uterine cervix to retain a pregnancy in the second trimester in the&#xD;
      absence of clinical contractions, labor, or both [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a history of cervical insufficiency should be considered for history-indicated&#xD;
      cerclage in future pregnancies at 12 to 14 weeks of gestation (6, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerclage placement is considered a benign proce¬dure, the risks of such procedure include -&#xD;
      cervical lacerations at the time of delivery, the need for cesarean delivery because of the&#xD;
      inability of the cervix to dilate secondary to cervical scarring and dystocia, infection,&#xD;
      cervical cerclage displacement Nonsurgical interventions have been advocated for patients&#xD;
      with presumed cervical insufficiency. Progesterone supplementation appears to reduce the rate&#xD;
      of spontaneous singleton preterm birth in women who have had a previous spontaneous preterm&#xD;
      singleton birth and in women with a short cervix on ultrasound examination in the current&#xD;
      pregnancy (8). In women with a prior preterm birth, continuing progesterone supplementation&#xD;
      after placement of a cerclage has not been proven to be useful, but available data are&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most cerclages are placed via a transvaginal approach. The transabdominal approach is more&#xD;
      invasive, but allows higher placement, while transvaginal cerclages often end up distal to&#xD;
      the internal os. The two most common transvaginal techniques for cerclage are McDonald&#xD;
      procedure and Shirodkar procedure. The McDonald procedure is easier to perform and remove.&#xD;
      The bulk of data show no significant differences in pregnancy outcome between the two&#xD;
      procedures (6, 9, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      McDonald cerclage -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure is begun by grasping the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix with&#xD;
           one or two ring forceps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A curved needle loaded with large caliber non-absorbable synthetic suture (at least&#xD;
           number 1 or 2 braided or monofilament) is inserted at 12 o'clock, at least 2 cm above&#xD;
           the external os.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four to six passes of a purse-string suture are taken circumferentially around the&#xD;
           entire cervix as high as safely possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two ends of the suture are then tied securely and cut, leaving the ends long enough&#xD;
           to grasp with a clamp when it is time to remove it (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During gestation, the female body undergoes hormonal, immunological, and metabolic changes to&#xD;
      support fetal growth and development. There are noticeable changes in the microbiota at&#xD;
      different body sites during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human vaginal microbiota is a key component in the defense system against microbial and&#xD;
      viral infections. The vaginal microbiome is dominated by many species including Lactobacillus&#xD;
      and members of the Clostridiales, Bacteriodales, and Actinomycetales. Specifically, these&#xD;
      lactic acid producing bacteria can create a barrier against pathogen invasion by maintaining&#xD;
      a low pH (&lt; 4.5) and by secreting metabolites that play an important role in inhibition of&#xD;
      bacterial and viral infection in the urogenital tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal microbiome undergoes significant changes during pregnancy, including a&#xD;
      significant decrease in overall diversity, increased stability and enrichment with&#xD;
      Lactobacillus species (12). These correlate with a decrease in the vaginal pH and an increase&#xD;
      in vaginal secretions. Vaginal microbial compositions were found to differ according to&#xD;
      gestational age, while the communities at the later stages of pregnancy resembled those of&#xD;
      the non-pregnant state. The dominant Lactobacillus species in pregnancy varies according to&#xD;
      ethnic group. In women whose vaginal microbiota is not lactobacilli-dominated anti-bacterial&#xD;
      defense mechanisms are reduced. The enhanced proliferation of pathogenic bacteria plus&#xD;
      degradation of the cervical barrier increase bacterial passage into the endometrium and&#xD;
      amniotic cavity and trigger preterm myometrial contractions (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 million cervical cerclages are performed annually to prevent preterm birth. Two types&#xD;
      of suture material are used for cerclage: monofilament or multifilament braided. Braided&#xD;
      sutures are most frequently used, although no evidence exists to favor them over monofilament&#xD;
      sutures. Birth outcomes in a retrospective cohort of 678 women receiving cervical cerclage in&#xD;
      five UK university hospitals showed that braided cerclage was associated with increased&#xD;
      intrauterine death (15% versus 5%; P = 0.0001) and preterm birth (28% versus 17%; P = 0.0006)&#xD;
      compared to monofilament suture. A prospective study explored the vaginal microbiome in women&#xD;
      at risk of preterm birth because of short cervical length (≤25 mm) who received braided (n =&#xD;
      25) or monofilament (n = 24) cerclage under comparable circumstances (14). Braided suture&#xD;
      induced a persistent shift toward vaginal microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced&#xD;
      Lactobacillus spp. and enrichment of pathobionts. Vaginal dysbiosis was associated with&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine and interstitial collagenase excretion into cervicovaginal fluid and&#xD;
      premature cervical remodeling. Monofilament suture had comparatively minimal impact upon the&#xD;
      vaginal microbiome and its interactions with the host. The shift of the human vaginal&#xD;
      microbiome toward dysbiosis correlated with preterm birth (14).&#xD;
