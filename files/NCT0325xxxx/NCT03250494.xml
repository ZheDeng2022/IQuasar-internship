      75 female patients were randomly allocated into one of three equal groups. Group I(GI)&#xD;
      received Dulox 60 mg orally and 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (NS) intravenous&#xD;
      infusion (IVI) over 15 min, group II(GII): received combined Dulox capsule 60 mg orally and&#xD;
      Dex 0.1mg/kg mixed with 100 ml NS IVI and group III(GIII) received identical placebo&#xD;
      duloxetine capsule and 100 ml NS IVI as a placebo for Dex, 2 hours preoperatively. Patients'&#xD;
      vitals, VAS and sedation score were assessed at 30 minutes, 1h, 2 h, 6h and 12h&#xD;
      postoperatively. Total pethidine requirements, plasma cortisol, PONV and patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction were recorded.&#xD;

      This study was designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded parallel study&#xD;
      and this study was carried out at Ain-Shams university hospitals, from December 2014 to&#xD;
      January2016, on 75 female patients aged between 25 and 35 years old of the American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II scheduled for elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynecological surgeries (for infertility) under general anesthesia. Approval was obtained&#xD;
      from the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were not admitted to the study if any of the following criteria were present: (1)&#xD;
      patient's refusal, (2) duration of surgery more than 90 minutes, (3) allergy to any drugs of&#xD;
      the study, (4) smokers, history of drug or alcohol abuse, (5) treatment with antidepressants,&#xD;
      (6) history of diabetes or epilepsy, (7) , history of chronic pain or daily intake of&#xD;
      analgesics within 24 h before surgery, (8) treatment with systemic glucocorticoids within 4&#xD;
      weeks before surgery and (9) impaired kidney or liver functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated into 3 equal groups, group (I) (GI) (n=25) each patient&#xD;
      received Dulox capsule (60mg) orally with sips of water 2 hours preoperatively and 100 ml&#xD;
      0.9% sodium chloride solution (NS) intravenous infusion (IVI) over 15 min (Placebo), group&#xD;
      (II) (GII) (n=25) each patient received combined Dulox capsule (60 mg) orally with sips of&#xD;
      water and Dex 0.1mg/kg diluted in 100 ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 min, 2 hours preoperatively and&#xD;
      group (III) (GIII) (control group) (n=25) each patient received a placebo capsule identical&#xD;
      to Dulox capsule and 100 ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 min, as a placebo for dexamethasone 2 hours&#xD;
      preoperatively. Dulox was presented as CYMBALTAÂ® capsules manufactured by Lilly del Caribe&#xD;
      Inc. Imported by Elco and Dex was presented as dexamethasone sulphate ampoules 8mg in 2ml.&#xD;
      (Medical Union Pharmaceutical, Egypt MUP). Randomization was done using computer-generated&#xD;
      number table of random numbers in a 1:1 ratio and conducted using sequentially numbered,&#xD;
      opaque and sealed envelope (SNOSE). Active Dulox capsules were indistinguishable from placebo&#xD;
      capsules and placebo capsules contained starch. The study drugs were prepared by the hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy and follow-up of patients was conducted by the anesthesia residents not involved in&#xD;
      any other part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preoperative anesthetic evaluation, patients were familiarized with 10 cm marked&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) for PO assessment of pain, where 0 cm defines no pain and 10 cm&#xD;
      defines the maximum intolerable pain. Patients were also assured that they would receive&#xD;
      intramuscular injection (IM) of pethidine 0.5 mg / kg once they experienced pain&#xD;
      postoperatively (patients with (VAS &gt; 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general anesthesia technique was standardized for all the patients as well as monitors&#xD;
      including 5 lead ECG, non- invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      capnography after intubation using Datascope monitors. Neuromuscular function was monitored&#xD;
      using a peripheral nerve stimulator. After establishing an intravenous (IV) line, induction&#xD;
      of general anesthesia with fentanyl (2 ug/kg) and sleeping dose of propofol followed by&#xD;
      rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate orotracheal intubation was done. Anesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained using isoflurane in oxygen and air. Ranitidine (50 mg/ampoule) was given diluted&#xD;
      in 10 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (NS) slowly (IV) over 10 minutes as a gastroprotective&#xD;
      regimen. At the end of the surgery, the residual neuromuscular paralysis was antagonized with&#xD;
      neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg). After satisfactory recovery, patients&#xD;
      were extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) where they were&#xD;
      monitored with ECG, NIBP and pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of patients' vitals (HR, MAP), arterial SpO2, sedation score, visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), the first analgesic requirement time and adverse effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV), pruritis) were done at 30 minutes, 1h, 2 h, 6h and 12h postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PO pain was evaluated at rest based on visual analogue scale, first time to ask for rescue&#xD;
      analgesia and total pethidine requirements in 12 hours (mg) postoperatively were recorded.&#xD;
      Assessment of sedation was according to sedation score (Ramsay sedation scale) (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension was considered if there was 20% decrease below the baseline for MAP and was&#xD;
      treated with IV bolus of ephedrine (3-6 mg). Bradycardia was considered if the heart rate &lt;&#xD;
      55 beats/min and was treated with IV atropine (0.01mg/kg). Respiratory depression was defined&#xD;
      as a respiratory rate less than 10 breaths/min-1 or peripheral oxygen saturation less than&#xD;
      95% and was treated with oxygen through a transparent face mask and the intermittent doses of&#xD;
      IV naloxone (0.4 mg). IV granisetron (1mg) was given in case of vomiting or after 2&#xD;
      successive episodes of nausea. Pruritus was evaluated with a 4-point scale (0=absent, 1=mild,&#xD;
      2=moderate, 3=severe or requiring treatment), and patients with severe pruritus were treated&#xD;
      with IV clemastine (TavegylR) (2 mg / ampoule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's satisfaction was done by asking the patient to answer the question, 'How would you&#xD;
      rate your experience after the surgery?' using a 7-point Likert verbal rating scale (15) and&#xD;
      acceptable satisfaction score of the patient being 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal stress response was assessed through recording plasma cortisol (micrograms / dl) 2&#xD;
      hours postoperatively. Serum cortisol was measured by a Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay&#xD;
      Technology (FPIA) by the Abbott AXSYM system with the following reference ranges (morning&#xD;
      serum cortisol 4.2-38.4 ug/dl) and evening serum cortisol 1.7-16.6 ug/dl).&#xD;
