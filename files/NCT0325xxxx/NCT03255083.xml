  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined&#xD;
           with osimertinib in the study population and to determine the recommended dose for&#xD;
           expansion of DS-1205c when combined with osimertinib in the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Dose Expansion, to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1205c when combined with&#xD;
           osimertinib in the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Dose Escalation, after a 7-day run in period (Cycle 0), there will be 21-day cycles (Cycle&#xD;
      1 onward). In Dose Expansion, there will be 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study&#xD;
      treatment until they decide not to (withdraw consent), their disease gets worse [progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD)], or side effects become unacceptable (unacceptable toxicity).&#xD;
