  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cause of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) .As for brain&#xD;
      parenchymal metastases, the incidence of LM seems to be increasing, due to the growing&#xD;
      incidence of metastatic BC, the improvement of survival and the poor diffusion of therapeutic&#xD;
      agents into the central nervous system (CNS). Several prognostic factors have been&#xD;
      identified, including the age at diagnosis, the functional and neurological status, the delay&#xD;
      between the diagnosis of cancer and that of LM. The survival of patients is poor, less than 6&#xD;
      months in most published series. Several neuronal biomarkers could also be good candidates,&#xD;
      such as the neurogranin CSF and/or serum levels or the CNS neurofilaments (NF), that seem to&#xD;
      be a good reflect of axonal injury and neuronal loss. CNS NF have been investigated in&#xD;
      several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, but not yet in CNS metastases. Indeed, the creation&#xD;
      of a clinico-biological collection seems to be of high value in order to investigate future&#xD;
      biomarkers of interest&#xD;

      Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cause of leptomeningeal metastases (LM). As for brain&#xD;
      parenchymal metastases, the incidence of LM seems to be increasing, due to the growing&#xD;
      incidence of metastatic BC, the improvement of survival and the poor diffusion of therapeutic&#xD;
      agents into the central nervous system (CNS). Several prognostic factors have been&#xD;
      identified, including the age at diagnosis, the functional and neurological status, the delay&#xD;
      between the diagnosis of cancer and that of LM. Other CSF biomarkers have been evaluated for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. Finally, the CellSearch® technique allows for the&#xD;
      characterisation of proteins expressed by CSF tumors cells (E.G., HER2) and will make&#xD;
      possible a better understanding of the physiopathology of tumor dissemination to the CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other neuronal biomarkers could be interesting for the diagnosis of LM in BC patients. Among&#xD;
      them, the protein Tau (total-Tau or T-Tau) is involved in several neurological diseases.&#xD;
      However, to date, no study has evaluated CSF or serum T-Tau in LM from solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several neuronal biomarkers could also be good candidates, such as the neurogranin CSF and/or&#xD;
      serum levels or the CNS neurofilaments (NF), that seem to be a good reflect of axonal injury&#xD;
      and neuronal loss.&#xD;

    <description>The CSF samples will be taken at the occasion of the first lumbar puncture performed for clinical purposes (suspected LM). If necessary for the routine diagnosis, a second and a third lumbar puncture will be performed according to the gold standard Two EDTA tubes (5 mL) and two dried tubes (5mL) will be will be taken the same day as the first lumbar puncture and transferred at ambient temperature to the Biological Resource Center of the ICM (Jean-Pierre Bleuse, Biobank number BB-0033-00059) to be processed within 1 hour Blood samples will be centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and will be aliquoted in 4 plasma and 4 serum aliquots and then stored at -80°C. Aliquots must be anonymized.</description>
