      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug Nivolumab has been approved to treat some cancers. Researchers want to see if it can&#xD;
      slow the growth of other cancers. They want to study its effects on cancers that may have not&#xD;
      responded to chemotherapy or other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if Nivolumab slows the growth of some types of cancer or stops them from getting&#xD;
      worse. To test the safety of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 12 and older who have Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-positive lymphoproliferative disorders&#xD;
      or EBV-positive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with no standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor and bone marrow biopsies (sample taken)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan with a radioactive tracer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks, participants will get Nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour. They will also&#xD;
      have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and pregnancy tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of side effects and medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will repeat most of the screening tests. They may also have&#xD;
      other biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stopping treatment, participants will have a visit every 3 months for 1 year. Then they&#xD;
      will have a visit every 6 months for years 2-5, and then once a year. They will have a&#xD;
      physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a chronic viral infection associated with a heterogeneous&#xD;
           group of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The shared pathobiology of EBV-positive LPDs and NHLs includes a defect in host&#xD;
           mechanisms of immune tolerance and immunosurveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a surface protein present on T cells, B cells, and&#xD;
           macrophages that serves a co-inhibitory role to negatively regulate immune responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are overexpressed in EBV-positive&#xD;
           lymphoproliferative disorders and are markers of aggressive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blockade of the PD-1 pathway induces T-cell responses against tumor antigens in a&#xD;
           variety of cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma, that lead to clinical remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal anti-PD-1 receptor antibody with clinical&#xD;
           activity in both indolent and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the best overall response rate of nivolumab in subjects with EBV-positive LPD&#xD;
      and EBV-positive NHL&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBLITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of an EBV-positive B-cell LPD or an EBV-&#xD;
           positive NHL confirmed by Laboratory of Pathology, NCI&#xD;
&#xD;
           --NOTE: LPD subjects may be previously untreated or relapsed from prior therapy;&#xD;
           patients with EBV-positive B-cell NHL subjects must have relapsed from previous&#xD;
           treatment with an anthracycline and rituximab-based regimen or be considered not&#xD;
           eligible for the same&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate bone marrow function (unless disease-related) defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 750/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin greater than 9g/dL (transfusion permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mcL (transfusion not permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II study of subjects with EBV-positive LPD and EBV-positive NHL, both relapsed and&#xD;
           untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be treated with nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 2 years if&#xD;
           responding disease with clinical improvement and no unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All responding subjects (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse&#xD;
           or progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for&#xD;
           re-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An optimal two-stage phase II trial design will be used to rule out a best overall&#xD;
           response rate of 20%. If fewer than 3 of the first 17 subjects respond, the study would&#xD;
           accrue no more subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects withboth EBV-positive LPD EBV-positive NHL will be enrolled on this protocol&#xD;
           for a total of 37 evaluable subjects. In order to allow for inevaluable subjects and&#xD;
           screen failures, the accrual ceiling will be set at 40 subjects..&#xD;

                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) during&#xD;
                  screening and within 48 hours prior to the first dose of nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP and men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (e.g., hormonal or 2 barrier methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year&#xD;
                  or abstinence) prior to study entry and throughout study drug administration.&#xD;
                  WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
                  period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving&#xD;
                  nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
                  contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
                  product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or&#xD;
                  surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
                  undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
                  ligation, or bilateral ophorectomy), and who is not postmenopausal. Post&#xD;
                  menopause is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months without another&#xD;
                       cause, and a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35&#xD;

                    2. Women with irregular menstrual periods and a documented serum follicle&#xD;
                       stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL or NOTE: FSH level testing is&#xD;
                       not required for women greater than or equal to 62 years old with amenorrhea&#xD;
                       of greater than or equal to 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab is an IgG monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab.&#xD;
