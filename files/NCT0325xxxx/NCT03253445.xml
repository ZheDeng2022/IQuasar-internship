      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of using Acceptance and commitment&#xD;
      therapy for smoking cessation for schizophrenic patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Amongst people with mental disorders, the prevalence of smoking has been reported&#xD;
      to be the highest among people with schizophrenia, ranging from 54%-90%. It is more than two&#xD;
      to three times (20%-30%) of the general population. The co-occurrence of schizophrenia and&#xD;
      smoking will lead to a higher chance of smoking-related diseases such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, liver diseases and reduced life expectancy. Currently, there is a large gap in&#xD;
      knowledge regarding smoking cessation in people with schizophrenia; there has been few&#xD;
      studies examining non-pharmacological interventions in smoking cessation on people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for mental health disorders has found&#xD;
      that it has in general positive outcomes for the clients; improvements were consistently&#xD;
      found in a number of studies. ACT is more encouraging compared to traditional methods of&#xD;
      smoking cessation, where the individual is seen to be at fault for the habit. To date, no&#xD;
      randomized trial has been conducted to compare the effects of ACT in smoking cessation among&#xD;
      people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in enhancing&#xD;
      smoking cessation among people with schizophrenia living in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a randomised controlled trial. Individual, face to face, assessor-blinded&#xD;
      with assessments will be conducted before intervention, after intervention, and at the 6th&#xD;
      and 12th month after the initial session of ACT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and setting: 160 individuals aged 18 years or older, currently smoking but not&#xD;
      undergoing any smoking cessation or similar programme, who were diagnosed with schizophrenia&#xD;
      and were referred to 4 community-based mental health rehabilitation settings by medical&#xD;
      doctors will be included in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Six Core Processes in Intervention (Flaxman, Blackledge &amp; Bond, 2010) Acceptance By&#xD;
      acceptance, ACT does not mean by the traditional sense of &quot;letting go&quot;, &quot;admitting faith&#xD;
      passively&quot;, or &quot;do something after acknowledging the facts&quot;. Since psychological avoidance&#xD;
      toward distress, which can be unfavorable thoughts, emotions, will inevitably push individual&#xD;
      to evade such experiences, ACT attacks the problem by accepting the psychological distress as&#xD;
      it is, without distorting, interpreting or re-interpreting it through verbal constructs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defusion Patients frequently, if not inevitably, fall into the trap of fusing their thoughts&#xD;
      and appraisals with their self-concept. They are often so identified with the internal&#xD;
      dialogues that whenever a thought of judging themselves arise, they treat them as a valid&#xD;
      statement of evaluation on themselves. Cognitive defusion aims at creating a space between&#xD;
      the thought and its relation with the individual, with the effect that the words, thoughts,&#xD;
      and emotions are down-valued as a reference rather than a valid description of who we are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self as context Our sense of self is often derived from our experienced thoughts, emotions,&#xD;
      memories and physical sensations. This is called the self-as-content and is a readily&#xD;
      accessible self-concept most of us would refer to. By addressing the above experience,&#xD;
      especially the more frequent ones, we draw the conclusion that we are the person defined by&#xD;
      them. On the contrary, ACT adopts the notion of self-as-context and defines the self as that&#xD;
      stable, ever-present part of you that notices the transient thoughts, emotions, memories and&#xD;
      sensations that enter in and out of awareness. When the self-as-context is embraced, the self&#xD;
      is no longer defined as the various thoughts, feelings, and sensations, but as the person who&#xD;
      is having or noticing those experiences. Although ACT makes no attempt to discern which one&#xD;
      is a better representation of the self, it does appreciate self-as-context as a way to&#xD;
      examine the distance between those internal experiences and the self.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact with the Present Moment Making a closer contact with the present moment is the key to&#xD;
      seeing how effectively or ineffectively what we are behaving in the moment, and that places&#xD;
      us in a better position to change our behaviors as well as a higher motivation to do so.&#xD;
      However, thoughts are always pulling us away from the present moment and we are either in the&#xD;
      past or future. In fact, thoughts are about anything and everything except now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Values Values are perhaps the most powerful reinforcers in driving us to our goal and at the&#xD;
      same time a valuable asset for individuals who are trying to live what they expect from life.&#xD;
      Instead of swamping oneself in numerous problems, issues, regrets, and longings, values&#xD;
      provide a powerful drive for patients to act according to what they want to become.&#xD;
      Therapist, on the other hand, have a consistent measure as to the way the patients have to&#xD;
      live up to their own expectations. Still more, therapist and patients are to endeavor&#xD;
      collaboratively in working out the qualities in realizing patients' values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Committed Action If value is the train, commitment is the fuel that drives the person&#xD;
      forward. Value, together with commitment, is a non-binding guideline that points to the way&#xD;
      an individual can act. Therapist, on the other hand, is supposed to reinforce and encourage&#xD;
      behaviors that are consistent with the values. Any behaviors inconsistent with the values are&#xD;
      to be accepted as they are in a non-judgmental attitude, and the patient is encouraged to&#xD;
      choose again in accordance to his values. Commitment is not only viewed as a promise but also&#xD;
      actions that realize what one believes and upholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency of therapist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are extracted from the core competencies self rating form posted at the website&#xD;
      of Association for Contextual Behavioral Science (Luoma, n.d.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic competency in ACT The therapist is able to take heed of the patient's schizophrenic&#xD;
      background and introduce the concepts and skills of ACT in a simple language that is&#xD;
      compatible with the level of cognition and intelligence of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist helps the patient to realize his beliefs, thoughts, desires, fears and worries&#xD;
      with smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist assists the patient in addressing in-depth his/her motivations and values&#xD;
      regarding smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist is capable of leading the patient to apprehend the futility of the attempts to&#xD;
      control the cravings and accept the urges as it is without necessarily yielding to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By guiding the patient to see the hopelessness of controlling craving, the therapist is able&#xD;
      to guide the patient to the ultimate solution-doing nothing, i.e., the mindfulness strategy&#xD;
      of observing the cravings without the need to do anything.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist assists the patient to bring about actions in executing his/her values in a&#xD;
      practical manner amidst even the most unfavorable circumstances as perceived by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist is able to master the six core processes of ACT and uses them flexibly by the&#xD;
      flow of the therapy and the need of the patient.&#xD;
