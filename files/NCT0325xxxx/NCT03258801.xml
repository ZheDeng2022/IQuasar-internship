  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is currently one of the most common&#xD;
      diagnoses for patients under evaluation for lung transplantation. In recent years, an&#xD;
      absolute increase in prevalence/ incidence of IPF has been observed. There is evidence that&#xD;
      patients with IPF on waiting list for lung transplantation might benefit from pirfenidone&#xD;
      treatment. Until now, no data are published regarding this important issue in lung&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to determine whether there is a difference in the duration time of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (weaning) directly after lung transplantation between patients treated&#xD;
      with pirfenidone and patients without pirfenidone treatment. The Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      determine whether there are differences between the pirfenidone treatment group and the&#xD;
      control group regarding survival after LUTX, the score on the Saint Georges Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC%) In this Investigator initiated,&#xD;
      non- interventional single center study , patients on the waiting list for transplant&#xD;
      pirfenidone treatment receive oral pirfenidone at the standard dose of 2403 mg per day. The&#xD;
      treatment duration will range from 6 to 12 months. A control group will be used to correlate&#xD;
      the outcome-parameters for a descriptive comparison. The control group includes patients with&#xD;
      IPF on the waiting list who were on another IPF specific (or no) treatment for IPF The Study&#xD;
      Population are Patients aged between 40-70 years who are admitted to the lung transplantation&#xD;
      department and fulfill the international criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (&#xD;
      existence of a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in the high-resolution computed&#xD;
      tomography (HRCT) is necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: Duration of mechanical ventilation after LUTX (hours), Forced Vital capacity&#xD;
      relative to reference value at baseline (FVC0%), Forced Vital capacity relative to reference&#xD;
      value after 6 months (FVC6%),Forced Vital capacity relative to reference value after 12&#xD;
      months (FVC12%) Study Size: 30 patients in the Pirfenidone group, 20 patients in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary Endpoint, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum of the&#xD;
      weaning time of patients who received a pirfenidone treatment, as well as of patients from&#xD;
      the control group will be computed and presented in a table. Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      curve will be estimated and plotted alongside the respective 95% CI calculated using the&#xD;
      method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. Furthermore, a stepwise linear regression using forward&#xD;
      selection and Age, RBMI, FVC0%, (FVC6%-FVC0%), TLC, FEV1% and ECMO, as well as the&#xD;
      pirfenidone treatment as predictors will be computed. The null hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      pirfenidone treatment has no influence on the weaning time. The according model coefficient&#xD;
      estimate and standard error will be used to test the null hypothesis using a t-test at&#xD;
      significance level Î±=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum of&#xD;
      patients who received a pirfenidone treatment, as well as of patients from the control group&#xD;
      will be computed and presented in a tableStepwise Cox Regression using forward selection and&#xD;
      Age, RBMI, FVC0%, (FVC6%-FVC0%) and ECMO, as well as the pirfenidone treatment as predictors&#xD;
      will be computed in order to compare the treatment and the control group a . If p-values are&#xD;
      calculated for the secondary endpoint analysis, they serve only descriptive purposes.&#xD;
      Therefore no multiple testing corrections are applied.&#xD;
