      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two hemispheres of the brain are connected. Changes in one hemisphere affect the other&#xD;
      through this connection. Research has shown that training new skills in one hand improves the&#xD;
      same skills for the other hand. Researchers want to learn more about how the brain works to&#xD;
      transfer the skills to the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how changes on one side of the brain affect the other side. To study the activity of&#xD;
      the left and right sides of the brain in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 18-55 years old who are right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their handedness. This may be done on paper or on a computer.&#xD;
      Participants may have urine pregnancy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRI uses a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder&#xD;
      in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the&#xD;
      cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Two wire coils will be placed&#xD;
      on the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil and creates a magnetic pulse&#xD;
      that affects brain activity. Participants may be asked to tense certain muscles or do simple&#xD;
      tasks during TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have electromyography. Small sticky pad electrodes will be attached to the&#xD;
      skin on the hands. Muscle activity will be recorded during the TMS procedure.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of long-term potentiation (LTP)-like&#xD;
      cortical plasticity induced by parieto-motor cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation&#xD;
      (cc-PAS) on the contralateral hemisphere and interhemispheric interactions in normal brain&#xD;
      using dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We will explore the ipsilateral and&#xD;
      contralateral effects of cc-PAS over the left primary motor cortex (M1). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the motor evoked potential (MEP) at S50 (the motor evoked potential) will change after cc-PAS&#xD;
      in the left hemisphere, which stimulates M1 after PPC (effective cc-PAS), not only on the&#xD;
      right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, but also the left FDI muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we hypothesize that the MEP at S50 will change after cc-PAS in the left&#xD;
      hemisphere, which stimulates PPC after M1 (ineffective cc-PAS), on the right FDI muscle but&#xD;
      not the left FDI muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 15 healthy-volunteers to have 12 who complete the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete up to one screening visit and two study visits involving two intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come for one screening visit and two outpatient study visits. The screening&#xD;
      visit and the first study visit can be performed the same day. The second study visit will be&#xD;
      done approximately 1 week after the first one. TMS-induced electromyographic (EMG) activity&#xD;
      of hand muscles will be recorded as MEPs. Using single TMS measure on both the left and right&#xD;
      M1, we will measure MEPs and input-out (I-O) curve for the right and left FDI muscle and&#xD;
      abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle, respectively. Using a paired-pulse TMS paradigm,&#xD;
      interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the left M1 to the right M1, short-interval&#xD;
      intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) will be measured on the&#xD;
      left FDI and ADM muscles. Then, the subjects will undergo two plasticity induction procedures&#xD;
      of the parieto-motor cc-PAS sessions. One of those is the hypothesized efficacious cc-PAS&#xD;
      session and the other one is the control, a hypothesized ineffective cc-PAS session. The two&#xD;
      sessions will be separated by approximately one week. Each session consists of 100 pairs of&#xD;
      double stimulation to the left PPC and left M1. MEPs, I-O curve on the bilateral M1, IHI from&#xD;
      the left M1 to the right M1, SICI and ICF will be remeasured during the 60 min after&#xD;
      receiving cc-PAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be MEP amplitude from the bilateral M1 with respect to time&#xD;
      (before, immediately and 30-45 min after intervention) after induction of cc-PAS plasticity&#xD;
      over the left hemisphere in each session. The amplitude of MEPs on each side of M1 will be&#xD;
      compared between before and after cc-PAS with respect to time, using ANOVA in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of IHI from the left M1 to the right M1, SICI and ICF with respect to time&#xD;
      (before, immediately and 30-45 min after intervention) will be compared by the ANOVA test.&#xD;
      The degree of IHI and the change of IHI will be correlated with the primary outcome as&#xD;
      measured with a correlation analysis.&#xD;
