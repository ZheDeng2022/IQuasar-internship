  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial to assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD of&#xD;
      JS001+GP in advanced/metastatic TNBC patients, and to determine the recommended Phase II dose&#xD;
      and the best combination regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 3 stages in this trial. Stage 1 is the dose escalation stage. JS001 will be&#xD;
      tested in combination with GP in 3 dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1: 120mg Level 2: 240mg Level 3: 480mg Patients will receive JS001+GP for 6 cycles and&#xD;
      JS001 maintenance therapy for up to approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JS001 will be given on d1 every 3 weeks with GP and every 2 weeks in maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of JS001 at 120mg. Each&#xD;
      new group will receive a higher dose of JS001 than the group before it until 480mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 is the dose expansion stage. Dose expansion will be carried out to expand to 12&#xD;
      patients in the highest dose level at which the patient can tolerate well. This dose will&#xD;
      also be recommended as phase 2 dose(RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 is the sequential treatment stage. Patients receive 6 cycles of GP without JS001 and&#xD;
      then receive JS001 maintenance therapy for up to approximately 2 years.&#xD;
