      Single-centre open-label prospective study, enrolling 128 children and adolescents aged 6-17&#xD;
      years, who receive medication for ADHD of any subtype (presentation). Long-term results are&#xD;
      evaluated with tests of ADHD symptoms (Qb-test), intellectual ability (Wechsler scales;&#xD;
      WISC), adaptive functioning (Vineland scale), everyday functioning (Weiss Functional&#xD;
      Impairment Scale; WIFRS), and quality of life (Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition&#xD;
      Scale; CHIP-CE) during 24 months of ADHD treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Single-centre open-label prospective study, including 128 subjects over a period of 2 years.&#xD;
      Children and adolescents (6-17 years) who have been diagnosed with ADHD will be enrolled and&#xD;
      followed during 24 months of ADHD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments include medical, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric history, clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and definition of the ADHD diagnosis and its subtypes or presentations (according&#xD;
      to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV and DSM 5), ADHD symptom severity and global&#xD;
      functional impairment (by the investigator-rated ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity and Improvement; CGI-S and CGI-I), comorbidities&#xD;
      (by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) clinical&#xD;
      interview), intellectual ability (by the WISC-IV test), and general level of functioning (by&#xD;
      the Vineland interview). Subjects previously assessed and diagnosed will be re-assessed at&#xD;
      the screening visit to ascertain a current evaluation and definition of these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, a Qb-test and an assessment of symptom severity and global functional impairment&#xD;
      will be made by the investigator-rated ADHD-RS-IV and CGI-S, everyday functioning by&#xD;
      parent-rated WIFRS, and quality of life by parent-rated CHIP-CE. An adverse events report&#xD;
      will be collected by interview with open-ended questions. Assignment to treatment will be&#xD;
      individualized according to clinical picture and patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At subsequent visits (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) the following assessments will be&#xD;
      performed: Investigator-rated ADHD-RS-IV, CGI-S, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement&#xD;
      (CGI-I) scales for symptom severity, global functional impairment and improvement. Adverse&#xD;
      event report. Compliance assessment through pill count. Assessment of comorbidity status&#xD;
      according to DSM-IV and DSM 5 checklist/interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Qb-test will be performed at the 1 and 12 month visits. Everyday functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life will be assessed by parent-rated WIFRS and CHIP-CE scales at the 12 and 24 month visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study treatment per subject is 24 months. Medication dosage is 1-3 doses daily as&#xD;
      needed to optimize symptom control. Medications (methylphenidate, amphetamine, atomoxetine)&#xD;
      will be provided by the pharmacy according to routines in standard clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cluster analysis of Qb-test results, retrospective data from at least 50 patients&#xD;
      previously diagnosed at our clinic will be added to the data from the subjects participating&#xD;
      in the prospective study, to increase sample size to ascertain sufficient power for subgroup&#xD;
      (cluster) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations Adverse event (AE) reports will be collected at all visits through&#xD;
      open-ended questions. Vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, pulse) will be assessed at&#xD;
      all visits. AE severity should be graded: Mild, Moderate or Severe, and all AEs must be&#xD;
      followed until an outcome is known, ensuring the subject's safety. All AEs will be recorded&#xD;
      in the subject's medical records and in the Clinical Report Form (CRF), and also reported to&#xD;
      the Medical Products Agency according to local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Approximately 100 subjects from our centre will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective data for the cluster analysis will be collected from at least 50 patients&#xD;
      previously diagnosed at our centre.&#xD;
