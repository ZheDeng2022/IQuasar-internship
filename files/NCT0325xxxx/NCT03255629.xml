      To assess the efficacy of a closed loop glucagon system to prevent and treat hypoglycemia&#xD;
      occurring in patients with Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH) in response to meals and&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A control system for sensor-guided delivery was previously developed and tested in a&#xD;
      Proof-of-Concept (POC) study in a clinical research setting during 9 mixed meal tolerance&#xD;
      tests in 8 unique patients with severe hypoglycemia following bariatric surgery. This&#xD;
      optimized algorithm will now be implemented to deliver stable glucagon in a closed-loop&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, placebo-controlled, masked trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      the closed loop system to prevent and treat hypoglycemia occurring in patients with PBH in&#xD;
      response to meals (part 1). Part 2 will test whether the closed loop system can also prevent&#xD;
      and treat hypoglycemia in patients with PBH in response to exercise. A manufacturing program&#xD;
      from our collaborating team at Xeris Pharmaceuticals will continue to produce supplies of&#xD;
      glucagon for the clinical trial in a cGMP facility, with continued shelf-life stability&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
