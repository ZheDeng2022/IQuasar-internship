    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of white blood cells that are found in lymph nodes. Some kinds of&#xD;
      these cancers, such as gray-zone and extra-nodal, are rare and often aggressive. They are&#xD;
      usually resistant to current treatments. Researchers want to see if a drug called&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may treat these types of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data to see if it may be effective to give pembrolizumab to people with certain&#xD;
      types of rare, aggressive B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have a B-cell lymphoma, including gray-zone lymphoma or&#xD;
      extra-nodal lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans. They will lie in a machine that takes images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tissue sample from a previous procedure will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done in 21-day cycles. During the study, participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will get the study drug as an infusion into a vein over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will have a cheek swab and/or saliva sample collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May have a bone marrow aspiration. A needle will be put into the hipbone, and a small amount&#xD;
      of bone marrow will be taken out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May have a lumbar puncture. If cerebrospinal fluid is collected, researchers will study it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May provide tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May have tumor samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit about 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. They will&#xD;
      then have 4 visits in year 1, 2 visits a year in years 2-5, and once each year thereafter.&#xD;
      They will also be contacted by phone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gray-zone lymphomas (GZL) are rare, aggressive lymphomas that share clinical and&#xD;
           biological features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard upfront therapy for GZL is dose-intensive chemotherapy, though disease is often&#xD;
           resistant; consolidative radiation therapy reserved for patients who are relapsed or&#xD;
           refractory, and patients who fail radiation therapy have a poor prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), primary testicular lymphoma (PTL),&#xD;
           primary breast lymphoma (PBL), primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg-type, and intravascular&#xD;
           B-cell lymphoma (IVBCL) are rare, aggressive extranodal subsets of DLBCL that usually&#xD;
           have gene expression signatures of activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABC-DLBCL has cure rates below 40% after standard therapy, and is associated with late&#xD;
           recurrences, often involving the CNS where treatment options are limited by chemotherapy&#xD;
           resistance and an inability of many agents to cross the blood-brain barrier&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular biology studies of GZL and extranodal DLBCL have identified potentially&#xD;
           targetable genetic features involving the programmed death-1 (PD-1) signaling pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high proportion of GZL, PCNSL, and PTL cases have copy number alterations or&#xD;
           chromosomal rearrangements involving the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, is a&#xD;
           rational therapeutic target for patients with relapsed and refractory GZL, PCNSL, PTL,&#xD;
           and other extranodal DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the best overall response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, relapsed from or refractory to prior:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1: B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between&#xD;
                diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., Gray-zone&#xD;
                lymphoma or GZL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2: Extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving one or more of the&#xD;
                specified extranodal sites (i.e., extranodal DLBCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg (flat dose) IV every 3 weeks provided&#xD;
           they have clinical benefit and no unacceptable toxicity; patients who achieve a complete&#xD;
           response (CR) will have the option stop after 1 year of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All responding patients (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse&#xD;
           or progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for&#xD;
           re-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 20 evaluable patients each with GZL and DLBCL will be evaluated on this&#xD;
           protocol for the primary endpoint (overall accrual ceiling of 52 patients)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Cohort 2: Extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving one or more of the&#xD;
                  specified extranodal sites (i.e., extranodal DLBCL). The following subtypes are&#xD;
                  included (they do not have to be confirmed as non-GCB subtype for study entry):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL)&#xD;

        classification of lymphoid malignancies. Patients diagnosed with other extranodal DLBCL&#xD;
        subtypes or that are not otherwise specified (NOS) must involved at least 1 extranodal site&#xD;
        and must be considered non-GCB by local immunohistochemistry algorithms. Cases that are&#xD;
        non-GCB by the Hans criteria are considered eligible as well as cases of DLBCL that are&#xD;
        both CD10+ and MUM1+.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evaluable disease by clinical exam (i.e., palpable lymphadenopathy, measurable skin&#xD;
             lesions, etc.), laboratory assessment (i.e., lymphoma involvement of bone marrow or&#xD;

             (measurable lymph nodes or masses on CT or MRI and/or evaluable FDG-avid lesions on&#xD;
             PET)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate tumor tissue (archival or fresh) must be available for correlative studies.&#xD;
             NOTE: Tumor tissue may be from any previously collected tissue and adequacy is at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Principal Investigator. If prior tissue is not available, patient&#xD;
             must be willing to undergo baseline tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 years of age or older on day of signing informed consent&#xD;

                  greater than or equal to 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years with an ECOG PS of 2 and Karnofsky greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 60 will be considered eligible at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
        Investigator if decreased ECOG performance status is felt to be related to residual&#xD;
        neurologic deficits caused by CNS disease involvement that are not progressive or&#xD;
        anticipated to cause clinical managemnt problems during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory parameters (unless&#xD;
        related to lymphoma infiltration at the discretion of the investigator):&#xD;

        ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 3 times ULN (less than or equal to 5 X&#xD;
             ULN if liver involvement)&#xD;
&#xD;
             - The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;

             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not be planning to conceive or father children within the projected&#xD;
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening/screening visit through 120&#xD;
             days after the last dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;

             dexamethasone or equivalent at the same dose for at least 7 days). Patients who&#xD;
             recently discontinued systemic steroids must have completed them at least 7 days prior&#xD;
             to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
                  years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;

                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of&#xD;
                  interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Known mental or physical illness that would interfere with cooperation with the&#xD;
                  requirements of the trial or confound the results or interpretation of the&#xD;
                  results of the trial and, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make&#xD;
                  the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding must be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. NOTE:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist ) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pembrolizumab unless felt to be in the best interests of the patient in&#xD;
