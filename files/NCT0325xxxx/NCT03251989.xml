      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary tumors of the brain and spine are those that start in the brain or spine. These&#xD;
      tumors are rare, accounting for &lt;2% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. Some of&#xD;
      these tumors occur in less than 2,000 people per year. Researchers want to study a large&#xD;
      group of people with this kind of tumor. They want to learn more about the tumors, including&#xD;
      the risk factors related to how they develop in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To collect health and gene data to learn about what changes are associated with a&#xD;
      rare CNS Tumors, to eventually screen for these changes or target the genes in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Adult participants (Bullet) 18 years of age who self- identify as being&#xD;
      diagnosed with one of 12 rare CNS tumors, including: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT);&#xD;
      Brainstem and midline gliomas; Choroid plexus tumors; Ependymoma; High grade meningioma;&#xD;
      Gliomatosis cerebri; Medulloblastoma; Oligodendroglioma / Anaplastic oligodendroglioma;&#xD;
      Pineal region tumors; Pleomorphic xanthroastrocytoma / Anaplastic pleomorphic&#xD;
      xanthroastrocytoma; PNET (Supratentorial embryonal tumor); Primary CNS sarcoma / Secondary&#xD;
      CNS sarcoma (Gliosarcoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: (Registered Trademark)Participants will be invited to participate through an ad on&#xD;
      the CERN Foundation website (ependymoma), information on the Neuro-Oncology Branch website&#xD;
      and other identified advocacy and social media sites and direct mailer to those who have&#xD;
      already participated in the EO projects. (Registered Trademark)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interested participants will complete an enrollment form that will be sent to the study&#xD;
           coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The coordinator will then send the participant a consent form and schedule a time for&#xD;
           phone consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the Rare CNS tumors Outcomes Survey and once completed, the&#xD;
           Rare CNS tumors Risk survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questions on the Outcomes Survey will include treatment history, symptoms social and&#xD;
           clinical information and it should take about 25-35 minutes. The Risk survey will cover&#xD;
           their demographic information, personal medical history, family medical history and&#xD;
           environmental exposures. This should take about 52 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have physical problems can have help with the surveys and forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the surveys are completed, participants will be mailed a kit to collect saliva for&#xD;
           germline DNA. Participants will ship the sample to the study team in a prepaid envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the sample is not sufficient, participants will be contacted to give provide an&#xD;
           additional sample.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare cancers are defined as those with &lt;40,000 cases per year. There are over 130 separate&#xD;
      types of primary CNS tumors, all of which meet the definition of a rare cancer. However, some&#xD;
      CNS cancers have incidences of less than 1,000 cases per year. Because of its relative&#xD;
      rarity, limited reports of the presentation and clinical course have been completed. With the&#xD;
      support of the CERN-Foundation, the Adult Ependymoma Outcomes Projects (AEO) was launched to&#xD;
      address this lack of information for one type of rare CNS tumor- ependymoma. Using an online&#xD;
      platform, participants and families from across the world have participated, providing&#xD;
      information that has helped elucidate the presentation and ongoing health of individuals with&#xD;
      this disease. To date, over 300 adults have participated with over 95% reporting interest in&#xD;
      continuing and expanding their participation. Results from the AEO baseline survey and a&#xD;
      follow-up survey (AEOII addressing socioeconomic impact of the disease) have been published.&#xD;
      The most recent data from the AEO has been presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO)&#xD;
      annual meetings in 2015 and 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional consequence of the relative rarity of these CNS tumors, studies to evaluate&#xD;
      risk factors for the occurrence of these rare CNS tumors or predicting the clinical course of&#xD;
      these rare CNS tumors are also limited. Rare CNS tumors like other cancers, occur when there&#xD;
      are changes to genes that control the way cells grow and divide often as a result of exposure&#xD;
      to other environmental risk factors. Therefore, exploring genetic changes in persons with&#xD;
      rare CNS tumors will allow us to begin to understand what changes are associated specifically&#xD;
      with these tumors. To date, these participants are often included as part of larger cohorts&#xD;
      which include other types of brain tumors. We now understand that even among gliomas, the&#xD;
      risk factors differ. Therefore, identifying the risk factors specifically associated with&#xD;
      rare CNS tumors is critical for primary prevention and early detection. This knowledge would&#xD;
      allow scientists and physicians to eventually screen for these changes or target the genes or&#xD;
      the processes they control for treatment purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;

           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;

           the rare CNS tumor participant population.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study represents an ongoing effort to systematically evaluate outcomes in a large&#xD;
           group of participants with these rare tumors. It will provide descriptive data which can&#xD;
           be used to design further studies evaluating interventions related to identified health&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Participants will be invited to participate through an ad on the CERN Foundation website&#xD;
           (ependymoma), information on the Neuro-Oncology Branch website and other identified&#xD;
           advocacy and social media sites and direct mailer to those who have already participated&#xD;
           in the EO projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of adding the Rare CNS tumors Risk Survey is to implement a survey to further&#xD;
           evaluate participants in the EO for several known and suspected risk factors for rare&#xD;
           CNS tumors and to obtain germline DNA to interrogate genomic susceptibility to the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interested participants will complete an enrollment form that will be sent to the study&#xD;
           coordinator. Once submitted, the study coordinator will then send the participant a&#xD;
           consent form and schedule a time for phone consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once consent is obtained, the study coordinator will send the participant instructions&#xD;
           and a unique identifier that they will use to access and complete the survey(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the surveys are completed, the study coordinator will mail the participant a&#xD;
           request for medical records related to care for their Rare CNS tumor diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the survey(s) are completed, the participant will be mailed a kit to collect saliva&#xD;
           for germline DNA.&#xD;
