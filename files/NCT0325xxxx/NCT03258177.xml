  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate postoperative virtual care visits for&#xD;
      patients who undergo a laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or robotic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. The investigators aim to better understand whether postoperative virtual&#xD;
      care visits will not result in a greater composite measure of the occurrence of hospital&#xD;
      encounters within Atrium Health (AH) for the 30 days following surgery than standard&#xD;
      in-person clinic care. The investigators also aim to better understand whether postoperative&#xD;
      virtual care visits provide time and cost savings, and provide equal or improved patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and convenience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be randomized to complete either a postoperative follow-up visit using&#xD;
      virtual care technology or by attending a standard in-person visit at the clinic. The virtual&#xD;
      visit uses a camera-enabled device and internet access to provide live access to the medical&#xD;
      professional. Surveys to assess patient satisfaction and convenience will be administered by&#xD;
      email on the day of the postoperative follow-up visit. Additional information including&#xD;
      demographics, hospital encounters within 30 days of surgery, length of time of the follow-up&#xD;
      visit, travel cost and time, whether additional follow-up care is required, and complications&#xD;
      after surgery will be collected to evaluate postoperative virtual care visits. Subject&#xD;
      participation in the study will end after follow-up care is complete or at 30 days, whichever&#xD;
      occurs last.&#xD;
