    <textblock>
      Waterpipe smoking is a tobacco use method in which smoke passes through a partially-filled&#xD;
      water jar. Burning charcoal heats the waterpipe tobacco which produces the smoke that the&#xD;
      user inhales. Waterpipe smoking was associated with increased risk for coronary heart and&#xD;
      pulmonary diseases. This Waterpipe Study will inform the FDA on regulating waterpipe tobacco&#xD;
      products and reduce the harm of it use. This study will be conducted at homes of hookah&#xD;
      smokers, in natural settings, aimed to determine the effects of waterpipe smoking practices&#xD;
      on physiological injury markers and biomarkers of toxicity of waterpipe tobacco smoking. The&#xD;
      investigators will employ a repeated measures design. The investigators will recruit a sample&#xD;
      of 50 adult male and female exclusive waterpipe smokers and a control sample of 25 male and&#xD;
      female non-smokers via intercept interviews from San Diego County, California communities.&#xD;
      Waterpipe smokers will smoke one waterpipe tobacco head (10g) of Starbuzz during 3 separate&#xD;
      sessions with a 7-day washout period before each session, as follows: Session 1, Smoking&#xD;
      waterpipe tobacco using 1 quick-light charcoal and room temperature water in the waterpipe&#xD;
      jar, Session 2, Smoking waterpipe tobacco using 1 quick-light charcoal and adding ice cubes&#xD;
      to the water in the waterpipe jar, and Session 3, Smoking waterpipe tobacco without charcoal&#xD;
      using a charcoal-free electrically heated waterpipe head to heat the tobacco, and room&#xD;
      temperature water in the waterpipe jar. The following data will be collected: a) Tobacco Use&#xD;
      History, b) 4-week Tobacco Exposure Diary, c) Waterpipe Use Session Form, d) Carbon monoxide&#xD;
      (CO) exposure: Micro+ SmokerlyzerÂ® CO monitor will be used for exhaled CO pre and 2 minutes&#xD;
      post each smoking session, e) Pulmonary function testing and measuring blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and respiratory rate, and f) 6 first morning urine samples: pre and post the 3 sessions&#xD;
      to measure urinary cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-&#xD;
      (3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-glucuronides (total NNAL), metabolites of the lung&#xD;
      carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP), a&#xD;
      metabolite of the genotoxic carcinogen pyrene, and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), a&#xD;
      metabolite of the human hematotoxicant and leukemogen benzene. The investigators will explore&#xD;
      exposure levels to furan, a liver toxicant and carcinogen, among waterpipe smokers via&#xD;
      measuring its urinary metabolite Furan-BDA-NAL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, 1 in 3 adults or 1.2 billion people smoke. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      estimated that tobacco is responsible for the death of 1 in 10 adults worldwide, about 6&#xD;
      million premature deaths each year. In the United States (U.S.), cigarette smoking is&#xD;
      responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year, including nearly 42,000 deaths resulting&#xD;
      from secondhand smoke exposure. Tobacco use is the single leading most preventable cause of&#xD;
      disease, disability, and mortality in the U.S. Tobacco research tends to focus on cigarettes;&#xD;
      however, the rise in waterpipe (WP) tobacco use globally warrants studying all aspects of its&#xD;
      toxicity. In 2005, the WHO called for a better understanding of WP tobacco smoking. In 2007,&#xD;
      the American Lung Association labeled WP smoking as an emerging deadly trend. WP tobacco use&#xD;
      was associated with increased risk for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart&#xD;
      diseases, lung cancers, oral and esophageal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is a major public health problem leading to airflow obstruction. In the U.S., tobacco&#xD;
      smoke is a key factor in the development of COPD, which was the third leading cause of death&#xD;
      in the U.S. in 2014. WP smoking decreases respiratory quality of life in adults. Studies&#xD;
      found that pulmonary function following WP smoking was impaired as measured by forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and Forced Expiratory Flow&#xD;
      (FEF25-75%). Studies investigating acute cardiovascular injury markers due to WP smoking&#xD;
      showed significant increases in heart rate, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated regulation WP tobacco. The FDA&#xD;
      proposed that the manufacturers of WP tobacco disclose to the FDA their products' ingredients&#xD;
      and report harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). A review study showed that&#xD;
      exposures to HPHCs are 10-100 times higher in WP tobacco smoke than in cigarette smoke. To&#xD;
      inform the FDA on the regulation of WP tobacco products, and reduce the harm of it use, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a Waterpipe Project in a natural setting to determine the differential&#xD;
      effects of WP smoking practices on physiological injury markers, and biomarkers of toxicants&#xD;
      and carcinogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, the WP is used in Africa, Asia, China, India, and the Middle East. Adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults in the U.S. are experimenting with WP smoking. The 2014 U.S. National College&#xD;
      Health Assessment II found that nearly one third of U.S. undergraduate college students&#xD;
      (38.2% of men and 31.4% of women), reported ever using WP tobacco, and 11.6% of men and 8.3%&#xD;
      of women reported current use (past 30 days). Among high school students, the 2013 U.S.&#xD;
      National Youth Tobacco Survey showed that 15.1% of boys and 13.5% of girls reported ever WP&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WP (hookah) consists of a head, a body, a hose, and a water jar. The tobacco is placed in&#xD;
      the head and covered with a perforated aluminum foil to allow air-flow. Burning charcoal is&#xD;
      placed on top of the aluminum foil. Upon deep inhalation via the WP hose, suction forces hot&#xD;
      air through the head, heating and combusting the tobacco to produce the smoke that is forced&#xD;
      down the WP body, into and out of the water in the airtight jar, and through the hose into&#xD;
      the smoker's mouth and respiratory system. Smokers inhale charcoal toxicant emissions in&#xD;
      addition to those from the WP tobacco. Charcoal combustion contributes greatly to benzene,&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (CO) and carcinogenic yields. CO is a smoke toxicant that reduces the blood's&#xD;
      ability to transport oxygen to various organs, including the brain, and can cause dizziness,&#xD;
      headache, syncope and nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A charcoal-free electrically heated WP head is commercially available. Users were satisfied&#xD;
      with this device because they did not have to deal with charcoal fire hazardous ambers and&#xD;
      ashes, in addition to enjoying the feeling of reduced harm. WP smokers normally use room&#xD;
      temperature water in the WP jar. However, other liquid media are gaining in popularity.&#xD;
      According to anecdotal evidence, &quot;adding ice cubes in the WP jar has an enjoyable cooling&#xD;
      effect to the inhaled smoke&quot;. Smokers practice adding ice cubes at home, and for an extra&#xD;
      charge hookah lounges provide this option for customers. Toxic chemicals in WP tobacco smoke&#xD;
      include cotinine, a metabolite of the addictive drug nicotine;&#xD;
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-glucuronides (total NNAL);&#xD;
      metabolites of the lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK);&#xD;
      1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP), a metabolite of the genotoxic carcinogen pyrene; and&#xD;
      S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), a metabolite of the human hematotoxicant and leukemogen&#xD;
      benzene; and Furan-BDA-NAL, a metabolite of the carcinogen furan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. will compare exhaled CO, pulmonary functions, blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and urinary levels of cotinine, NNAL, SPMA, and 1-HOP in first void WP&#xD;
      smoker urine samples the morning of, and the morning after a WP smoking session across 3&#xD;
      smoking practices. The investigators will recruit a sample of 50 adult male and female&#xD;
      exclusive WP smokers and a control sample of 25 male and female non-smokers. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited and qualified via random intercept screen interviews from San Diego County,&#xD;
      California communities. Over a 3-week study period, WP smokers will smoke one WP tobacco head&#xD;
      (10g) of Starbuzz during 3 separate sessions with a 7-day washout period before each session&#xD;
      in their home in a natural setting: Week 1-Session 1, WP smokers will smoke using 1&#xD;
      quick-light charcoal and room temperature water in the WP jar, Week 2-Session 2, WP smokers&#xD;
      will smoke using 1 quick-light charcoal but adding ice cubes to the water in the WP jar, Week&#xD;
      3-Session 3, WP smokers will smoke WP tobacco without charcoal using the electric WP head and&#xD;
      room temperature water. The investigators will collect the following forms: a) Tobacco Use&#xD;
      History; b) 3-week Tobacco Use and Exposure Diaries; c) WP Smoking Session Day and Exposure&#xD;
      Form; and will measure d) CO exposure: Micro+ SmokerlyzerÂ® CO monitor will be used for&#xD;
      exhaled CO two minutes pre and post each smoking session; e) Pulmonary function testing and&#xD;
      measuring blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate pre and post each smoking session;&#xD;
      and f) 6 first morning urine samples: pre and post the 3 sessions to measure urinary&#xD;
      cotinine, NNAL, 1-HOP, SPMA, and Furan-BDA-NAL. Efforts will be made to recruit equal samples&#xD;
      of males and females. Flexible scheduling for study activities where applicable. Proration of&#xD;
      incentives will apply for completed activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-Week Study period: comprised of 3 WP smoking sessions with 7-day wash-out periods&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP Smoking Session 1. Day 1 - Office Visit: The Office Visit is expected to take between 60&#xD;
      and 90 minutes where potential participants will be trained on the study activities. Consent&#xD;
      will be obtained, study forms will be completed, and study related materials such as forms&#xD;
      and urine cups will be provided. Scheduling will be arranged for the 3 WP smoking sessions&#xD;
      and corresponding home visits. Saliva Test: Trained by the PI, the RAs will use NicAlert, an&#xD;
      accurate and valid commercial semi-quantitative instant saliva cotinine test, to validate&#xD;
      non-smoking status, which the investigators used successfully in their previous studies. The&#xD;
      following physiological baseline data will be collected: pulmonary functions, blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and respiratory rate. Days 2 - 6: The RAs will contact participants by phone on&#xD;
      the 4th day to confirm adherence to the 7-wash-out period and diaries, and on the 6th day to&#xD;
      remind participants to collect the first morning urine sample on day 7, and to arrange for a&#xD;
      home visit for the first WP smoking session. Day 7: WP smoking session 1. WP smokers will&#xD;
      provide one first morning urine sample and store it in their refrigerator (freezer section).&#xD;
      WP smokers will smoke WP tobacco (10 grams) as they normally do using charcoal and room&#xD;
      temperature water in the water jar. The RAs will collect expired CO levels 2 minutes before&#xD;
      and 2 minutes after concluding smoking, and will measure pulmonary functions, blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and respiratory rate thereafter. Day 8: Participants will provide a first morning&#xD;
      urine sample. The RAs will pick up the 2 urine samples (frozen in a cooler to transfer them&#xD;
      to the research center laboratory), and arrange for the 2nd WP smoking session home visit,&#xD;
      provide forms, urine cups package for week 2 of the study. WP Smoking Session 2. Days 1&#xD;
      through 7 are similar to session 1 with the exception that the RAs will add one tray of ice&#xD;
      cubes and water in the WP jar. The RAs will arrange for a training session to use the&#xD;
      charcoal-free electrically heated WP head. WP Smoking Session 3. Days 1 through 7 are similar&#xD;
      to session 1 using room temperature water in the WP jar, however using the charcoal-free&#xD;
      electrically heated WP head instead of using charcoal. During the last visit, the day after&#xD;
      the 3rd smoking session, the RAs will interview participants to complete the Illnesses and&#xD;
      Health Care History Form, pick up the final urine samples, and thank the participants.&#xD;
