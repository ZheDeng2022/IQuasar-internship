  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 80% of acute heart failure (AHF) patients admitted to the hospital are initially&#xD;
      treated in the emergency department (ED). Once admitted, within 30 days post-discharge, 27%&#xD;
      of patients are re-hospitalized or die. Attempts to improve outcomes with novel therapies&#xD;
      have all failed. The evidence for existing AHF therapies are poor: No currently used AHF&#xD;
      treatment is known to improve outcomes. ED treatment is largely the same today as 40 years&#xD;
      ago. Congestion, such as difficulty breathing, weight gain, and leg swelling, is the primary&#xD;
      reason why patients present to the hospital for AHF. Treating congestion is the cornerstone&#xD;
      of AHF management. Yet half of all AHF patients leave the hospital inadequately decongested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is the investigators' belief patients are often inadequately decongested in the&#xD;
      ED, it is common teaching within emergency medicine to focus on vasodilators and avoid or&#xD;
      minimize diuretics, especially in those patients with elevated blood pressure. This practice&#xD;
      is largely driven by retrospective analyses or small studies suggesting vasodilators are&#xD;
      efficacious and IV loop diuretics may be associated with harm. The evidence base to guide&#xD;
      early ED management is poor, and the AHA/ACC guidelines provide little to no guidance for ED&#xD;
      treatment. This reflects the lack of high quality data, a critical unmet need that the&#xD;
      investigators will address in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using clearance of LUS B-lines as the study endpoint, the investigators will study whether a&#xD;
      diuretic intense vs. nitrate intense strategy achieves better decongestion. Although nearly&#xD;
      two decades old, a small study of 100 patients suggested a nitrate intense strategy led to&#xD;
      better outcomes in AHF patients with pulmonary edema when compared with a diuretic intense&#xD;
      strategy. The investigators aim to perform a small pilot study, in hypertensive patients (SBP&#xD;
      &gt; 140mmHg) to test such a strategy to inform a larger, more definitive multicenter randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the N-FURIOUS pilot trial is to determine whether a nitrate intense&#xD;
      strategy safely reduces congestion, defined by LUS B-lines, better than a diuretic intense&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial is designed to provide the necessary and sufficient information for a&#xD;
      larger, definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over one million hospitalizations for AHF occur every year in the US. Within 30 days after&#xD;
      hospitalization, over 25% of AHF patients will be dead or re-hospitalized. By one year after&#xD;
      hospitalization, up to 67% of patients will be re-hospitalized and 36% will be dead.&#xD;
      Worldwide, the costs of AHF exceed 100 billion annually. For patients aged 65 years and&#xD;
      older, AHF is the most common and most expensive reason for hospitalization. Despite major&#xD;
      reductions in morbidity and mortality for chronic HF, considerably less progress has been&#xD;
      seen in AHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergency department (ED) initiates diagnosis and management for the vast majority of AHF&#xD;
      patients. Nearly 80% of all admissions originate from the ED. Delays in diagnosis,&#xD;
      misdiagnosis, and delayed or improper treatment are costly, associated with greater morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Despite this crucial starting role, ED AHF pharmacological management today is&#xD;
      largely the same as 40 years ago. In fact, guidelines state: &quot;the treatment of AHF remains&#xD;
      largely opinion-based with little good evidence to guide therapy.&quot; Consensus statements from&#xD;
      the American Heart Association as well as a working group from the NHLBI on ED AHF management&#xD;
      further corroborate this lack of evidence: &quot;the evidence base on which this foundation of&#xD;
      acute care is built is astonishly thin.&quot; There remains a critical unmet need for evidence&#xD;
      based ED AHF management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of Current AHF Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no Class I, Level of Evidence A therapeutic guideline recommendations for&#xD;
      AHF, highlighting the unmet need. In fact, therapeutic recommendations from the ACCF/AHA&#xD;
      begin with hospital based management, highlighting the absence of ED based evidence. The last&#xD;
      ED based guidelines were published in 2007 and have yet to be updated. The investigators&#xD;
      argue this lack of evidence leads to tremendous variation in ED care. Combined, this&#xD;
      contributes to worse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting Congestion in AHF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freedom from congestion is associated with improved outcomes; yet many patients leave the&#xD;
      hospital inadequately decongested. In fact, many patients leave the hospital without a&#xD;
      pre-discharge assessment of congestion. The investigators would argue, many ED AHF patients&#xD;
      are poorly assessed prior to hospitalization. The absence of robust, reliable methods to&#xD;
      assess congestion is a primary reason why it is not assessed. A recent consensus statement&#xD;
      published in 2010 highlights this fact: &quot;â€¦no method to assess congestion prior to discharge&#xD;
      has been validated.&quot; While physical exam is currently the cornerstone of congestion&#xD;
      assessment, it lacks sensitivity and inter-rater reliability. The ED is the beginning of AHF&#xD;
      management for &gt;75% of admitted patients; delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and resultant&#xD;
      delays in management are associated with greater morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV loop diuretics are the mainstay of AHF management. Yet emergency physicians are often&#xD;
      reluctant to use IV loop diuretics, largely influenced by small studies and retrospective&#xD;
      studies suggesting an association with harm. Nitrates are either recommended above diuretics&#xD;
      or even to replace diuretics in popular blogs, podcasts, or online forums. Arguably, neither&#xD;
      IV loop diuretics nor nitrates have definitive outcome data regarding efficacy or harm. This&#xD;
      is evident in guidelines, where IV loop diuretics receive a class I, B indication, and&#xD;
      nitrates a IIb, A recommendation. The evidence that does exist supports their use. Whether&#xD;
      one should be used before another, both, how to combine them, and in whom, is not well&#xD;
      defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Ultrasound as an Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For years, the lungs have been considered 'off-limits' to ultrasound: with aerated lungs, the&#xD;
      ultrasound beam is reflected and scattered due to acoustic mismatch. However, in the setting&#xD;
      of pulmonary congestion, extra vascular lung water (EVLW) can be directly visualized and&#xD;
      quantitated. Lung ultrasound measurement of B-lines are an objective, semi-quantitative&#xD;
      measure of extra vascular lung water (EVLW). B-lines are well-defined, vertical echogenic&#xD;
      lines, originating from water-thickened interlobular septa. They are a marker of congestion.&#xD;
