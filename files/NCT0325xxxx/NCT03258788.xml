  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Performance Status (PS) 0-2, not&#xD;
      suitable for concurrent Chemo-Radiotherapy (CTRT), will be treated with standard radiotherapy&#xD;
      (radical or palliative). Archival tumour biopsies will be analysed for baseline Programmed&#xD;
      Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Some participants will have a biopsy before radiotherapy&#xD;
      if the archive biopsy is not suitable. Participants will be required to undergo an additional&#xD;
      mandatory biopsy of the irradiated site during the second week of radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, multicentre, non-randomised translational study is to&#xD;
      provide proof of feasibility of achieving paired biopsies for PD-L1 assessment in patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC treated with palliative or radical radiotherapy. This is a non-CTIMP study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a minimum of 1 mandatory biopsy (during radiotherapy [irradiated&#xD;
      site]) and the potential to have a pre-treatment biopsy if archival biopsy does not meet the&#xD;
      suitability criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to a maximum of 2 additional optional biopsies (during radiotherapy&#xD;
      [within the RT field e.g supraclavicular fossa node], [outside RT field e.g. skin met]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be taken on study at specified time points for immune monitoring&#xD;
      (exploratory endpoints).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in two stages as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the enrolment of the first 15 evaluable participants, an interim analysis will take&#xD;
      place by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC will make a recommendation on whether&#xD;
      recruitment should continue to the Trial Management Group (TMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further 15 evaluable participants will be recruited onto the study to achieve a total of 30&#xD;
      evaluable participants.&#xD;

    <description>Archival tumour biopsies will be analysed for baseline PD-L1 expression. Some participants will have a biopsy before radiotherapy if the archival biopsy is not suitable.&#xD;
Participants will be required to undergo an additional mandatory biopsy of the irradiated site during the second week. Patients must have completed at least 1 week of the planned treatment before taking the biopsy.&#xD;
Participants will also be asked for consent to donate 50ml blood pre biopsy (at baseline and week 2) and at the end of radiotherapy; as well as 10ml blood before #2 radiotherapy and weekly throughout treatment.</description>
