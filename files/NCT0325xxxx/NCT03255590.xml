      This study plans to determine whether training can change abnormal flexion synergy in chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether motor training in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients can change their abnormal flexion synergy. The investigators will study chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients , who are defined as patients that sustained a stroke at least 6 months prior&#xD;
      to our testing date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three functional aspects of each finger will be tested: maximal voluntary contraction (MVC),&#xD;
      finger dexterity, and hand posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to intervention, participants will have a baseline assessment including clinical tests,&#xD;
      MVC, the individuation task, and the configuration task. Following the baseline assessment&#xD;
      patients will receive intervention, training on the configuration task for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days. On the sixth day and as a one week follow-up after, subjects will have a&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment containing the same tests performed in baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design will allow us to determine speed and accuracy during the configuration task, the&#xD;
      individuation index, and possible changes in abnormal flexion synergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We initially registered the study as two arms (anodal tDCS and sham tDCS groups) but decided&#xD;
      to make it one arm due to the number of participants we were able to recruit.&#xD;

Scoring:&#xD;
0 No increase in muscle tone&#xD;
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.&#xD;
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the Range of motion (ROM).&#xD;
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved.&#xD;
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.&#xD;

    <description>Chronic stroke patients (i.e. great than 6 months) with ischemic stroke confirmed by CT or MRI, residual unilateral upper extremity weakness, able to give informed consent, and able to understand the tasks involved.&#xD;
Participants trained for 5 consecutive days, 3 to 4 h/d, on a multi-finger piano-chord-like task that cannot be performed by compensatory actions of other body parts (e.g., arm). Participants had to learn to simultaneously coordinate and synchronize multiple fingers to break unwanted flexor synergies.</description>
