  <brief_summary>

      This proposed research will use randomized control trial (RCT) methodology and compare&#xD;
      micronutrients with placebo in 135 children with ADHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines a broad spectrum micronutrient treatment for children with ADHD. The goal&#xD;
      is to broaden the scope of evidence-based treatments, and to address the public desire for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment options. This study will use a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design, comparing micronutrients with placebo in 135 children, ages 6-12, with ADHD plus&#xD;
      irritability or anger based on parent-report of symptoms. The study will also collect&#xD;
      biological samples (saliva, stool, urine, hair, and blood) from the children to examine&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms of micronutrient effects. If the micronutrient treatment&#xD;
      successfully diminishes symptoms, the clinical implication is to offer this as a legitimate&#xD;
      non-pharmacological alternative to stimulant medication.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CASI-5 Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measure, defined a priori, reflecting the often-comorbid ADHD symptoms of emotional dysregulation irritable mood, anger or aggression), are the parent-rated Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5) subscales of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) and peer conflict. The CASI-5 is based on the DSM-5 symptom criteria. Item range is 0-3 (never, sometimes, often, very often). Higher scores represent a worse outcome. The subscales for ADHD, ODD, and DMD will be composite scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Second primary measure is the blinded clinician-rated CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) is a subscale of the CGI that rates overall improvement of symptoms based on all relevant data. Item range is 1-7 (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse); lower score is better. A treatment responder is defined as a participant who is rated a 1 or 2 on the CGI-I. The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) subscale will also be scored at baseline and week 8, with scores compared at the two time points. Item range is 1-7 (normal, borderline ill, mildly ill, moderately ill, markedly ill, severely ill, among the most extremely ill patients); lower score is better; most participants will be a 4 or 5 at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biological Samples</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 3 time points; optional at one year</time_frame>
    <description>Collect and store biological samples of blood, hair, saliva, urine, and stool at three time points. The blood samples are being collected per a request from the FDA for safety screening. Additional blood will be collected to look at nutrient level changes and metabolomics, both targeted and untargeted, blood. Collection of other biological samples will enable future examination of nutrient mechanisms including markers of methylation, inflammation, metabolism, and microbiome biodiversity, as funds are available. Outcome is mechanistic investigation of cytokines (IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1) and neurotransmitter levels (DA, NE and GABA) in urine and blood.</description>

             doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological disorder involving brain or other central function (e.g., history of or&#xD;
             suspected intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, narcolepsy) or other major psychiatric condition requiring hospitalization&#xD;
             (e.g. significant mood disorder, active suicidal ideation, or psychosis), based on&#xD;
             parent/guardian self-report of child's condition and responses to category M on the&#xD;
             CASI-5 subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition, including inflammatory bowel disease, history of&#xD;
             cancer, kidney or liver disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes Type I or II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to any ingredients of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known abnormality of mineral metabolism (e.g., Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking any other medication with primarily central nervous system activity, including&#xD;
             stimulants, within the last two weeks prior to in-person assessment; participants must&#xD;
             be off these medications for a minimum of two weeks prior to the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe separation anxiety that would preclude separating from parent/guardian to&#xD;
             answer study questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disability that would interfere with participant answering questions verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or sexually active at baseline. Exclusion criteria 1-6 and 9, will be based&#xD;
             on parent/guardian self-report of child's condition. If the parent/guardian reports&#xD;
             medical exclusion criteria, or concerns about eligibility, data provided by&#xD;
             parent/guardian will be confirmed by review of medical records with release of&#xD;
             information signed by parent/guardian. Potential participant may be reviewed in-person&#xD;
             by a study physician in the case of any concerns about participation.&#xD;
