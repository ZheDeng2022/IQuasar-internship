  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) is brief, structured modification of Interpersonal&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (IPT). IPC was developed as a brief triage manual to treat depression in&#xD;
      primary care, family practice and non-mental health programs, and work and educational&#xD;
      settings. College and university students are at the age where first episodes of depression,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, or psychosis may occur. IPC is relevant for this population as many&#xD;
      university students' distress are related to profound life changes, role transitions,&#xD;
      loneliness and social/cultural isolation, which are focuses of treatment in IPC. While there&#xD;
      is considerable evidence for the efficacy of IPT and IPC, this adaptation for university&#xD;
      students has not yet been studied. The investigators propose to administer IPC to across&#xD;
      several college campuses, and to recruit 20 participants at each counseling center.&#xD;
      Participants will receive 3-6 one-hour therapy sessions, and will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures of depression, psychosocial functioning, college adjustment, and treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction. IPC has the potential to reduce depressive symptoms and prevent presenting&#xD;
      symptoms from worsening. For these reasons, developing and testing a brief, yet comprehensive&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention for distressed college students has tremendous importance.&#xD;

      Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is a short term, evidence-based treatment approach that has&#xD;
      shown benefits in treating major depressive disorder as well as other psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
      IPT focuses on the patient's current life events, including social and interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning, as a means of understanding and treating maladaptive symptoms. Interpersonal&#xD;
      Counseling (IPC) is a modification of the Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) protocol.&#xD;
      Subsequently, IPC was developed as a brief intervention for depression to be used in primary&#xD;
      care, family practice and non-mental health programs, educational and work settings. IPC is a&#xD;
      treatment approach ready for dissemination and implementation by non-mental health workers&#xD;
      who have direct contact with individuals at risk for depression and other pathologies. IPC&#xD;
      has been used for efficient training, for preventative and screening purposes in doctor's&#xD;
      offices, schools, community based centers and organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPC synthesizes the fundamental principles of IPT into 3-6 sessions. Individuals receiving&#xD;
      IPC are initially assessed for symptoms of pathology, and then encouraged to identify&#xD;
      interpersonal problem areas which may be contributing to their presenting symptoms. The key&#xD;
      principles and techniques standard to IPT are also applied in IPC, so that the protocol can&#xD;
      act not only as an assessment tool, but also as a brief intervention. After identifying an&#xD;
      interpersonal problem area, the IPC clinician works with the client to mobilize social&#xD;
      support and rehearse more effective communication strategies. Once the IPC protocol is&#xD;
      completed, clinical decisions can be made regarding clients' need for follow-up psychotherapy&#xD;
      or alternative referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, college and university counseling centers are reporting that students&#xD;
      are seeking psychiatric services under more distress and with more severe disorders.&#xD;
      College-age students are generally at increased risk for experiencing psychopathology; they&#xD;
      are at the age where first episodes of depression, bipolar disorder, or psychosis often&#xD;
      occur. Secondly, college students are often away from their social and family networks for&#xD;
      the first time, and may experience less instrumental social support when experiencing periods&#xD;
      of psychological distress. To date, most college counseling centers conduct psychological&#xD;
      assessments of students presenting for services and provide supportive counseling, often for&#xD;
      a finite number of sessions due to the heavy volume of student referrals. For these reasons,&#xD;
      it is important to have a brief, yet comprehensive protocol for screening and intervening&#xD;
      with distressed college students. Such protocols should be structured and accessible to&#xD;
      implementation by a range of professionals: clinical social workers or psychologists,&#xD;
      practicum students and interns training in these fields. IPC, a systematic, brief evaluation,&#xD;
      support and triage approach may help university counseling centers in both their treatment&#xD;
      and intervention.&#xD;
