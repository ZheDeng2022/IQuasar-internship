    <textblock>
      Electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep is a condition in which the epileptic&#xD;
      patient starts to develop neurocognitive deterioration, any type of seizures and continuous&#xD;
      electrical activity in the EEG during non rapid eye movement sleep. It is an age related&#xD;
      condition and will resolve spontaneously at around the age of puberty. However if left&#xD;
      untreated or treatment is delayed, it may lead to permanent neurocognitive deterioration.&#xD;
      Thus early diagnosis and treatment is essential in these children to preserve neurocognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), also known as continuous spikes and waves&#xD;
      during slow sleep (CSWS), is an age related, self - limiting disorder characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. epilepsy with different seizure types,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. neuropsychological regression, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. typical EEG pattern of continuous epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement&#xD;
           sleep (NREM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During wakefulness, the EEG shows focal/multifocal spikes that increase in frequency during&#xD;
      the acute stage. During sleep, ESES appears and is characterized by (1) marked potentiation&#xD;
      of epileptiform discharges during non-REM sleep, leading to (2) a (near)-continuous,&#xD;
      bilateral, or occasionally lateralized slow spikes and waves, (3) and these spikes and waves&#xD;
      occur &quot;during a significant proportion&quot; of the non-REM sleep with a threshold ranging from&#xD;
      25% to 85%&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact incidence of CSWS is not known. In pediatric neurology clinics, a reported&#xD;
      frequency of 0.2% of childhood epilepsies most probably underestimates the incidence of CSWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSWS is a devastating syndrome, which requires prompt treatment, the efficacy of which is&#xD;
      checked with regular intervals, e.g. three or six months. Although epilepsy resolves with&#xD;
      time in most cases, many children are left with significant cognitive or language impairment.&#xD;
      Longer duration of ESES appears to be the major predictor of poor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, early recognition and effective therapy are necessary to improve long-term prognosis in&#xD;
      this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of treatment is not only to control clinical seizures but also to improve&#xD;
      neuropsychological functions and prevent potential cognitive deterioration. There was no&#xD;
      agreement on best treatment, but potential candidates included high-dose benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      valproate, levetiracetam, and corticosteroids.&#xD;

        Those patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria attending the neurology unit at Assiut&#xD;
        University Children Hospital will be administered the following treatment: 1. Nocturnal&#xD;
        diazepam for three months 2. Corticosteroids tapered over one months 3. Antiepileptic drug&#xD;
        other than sodium channel blockers which will be continued for at least two years. During&#xD;
        the course of the treatment the patients will be followed up by sleep EEG and IQ before and&#xD;
        at least one month after the start of treatment and regularly every three months for at&#xD;
        least one year after discontinuation of benzodiazepines and steroids.&#xD;
