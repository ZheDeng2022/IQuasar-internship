  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating the&#xD;
      anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody TSR-033 alone, in combination with the&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody dostarlimab, and in combination with dostarlimab, modified folinic acid&#xD;
      (FOL)/leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (OX) (mFOLFOX6) or FOL/leucovorin,&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil and irinotecan (IRI) (FOLFIRI), and bevacizumab in participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors in a broad range of solid tumors. Participants with disease types selected for&#xD;
      evaluation in this study are expected to derive clinical benefit with addition of an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1. The study will be conducted in two parts with Part 1 consisting of dose escalation&#xD;
      to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TSR-033 as a single agent (Part 1a) and&#xD;
      in combination with dostarlimab (Part 1c). RP2D decisions will be based on the occurrence of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK), as well as pharmacodynamics (PDy)&#xD;
      data. Part 2A of the study will investigate the anti-tumor activity of TSR-033 and&#xD;
      dostarlimab in combination in participants with advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC). Part 2B of the study will investigate the safety and anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of TSR-033 and dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy (Cohort B1: mFOLFOX6 and&#xD;
      Cohort B2: FOLFIRI) and bevacizumab in participants with advanced or metastatic MSS-CRC.&#xD;
