  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, in which the perception threshold and / or sensory evoked potentials at&#xD;
      different points of the lower urinary tract were examined and measured by means of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, a clear increase in the volume of the bladder and thus the urine excretion under&#xD;
      the stimulation could be observed. This observation is now to be investigated more closely in&#xD;
      a separate study, in order to strengthen the observation with further measured data and to&#xD;
      find possible physiological connections. A detectable influence of electrical stimulation in&#xD;
      the lower urinary tract on renal urine production would have a significant relevance both&#xD;
      therapeutically and for the neurophysiological understanding of interactions between the&#xD;
      lower and upper urinary tracts.&#xD;

    <description>The ICIQ-FLUTS (&quot;International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Module&quot;) questionnaire assesses female lower urinary tract symptoms and impact on quality of life. It consists of 12 items covering 3 domains, namely filling symptoms, voiding symptoms and incontinence symptoms. The filling symptoms subscale is the sum of is the sum of item 2 to 5, the voiding symptom subscale is the sum of item 6 to 8 and the incontinence symptoms subscale is the sum of item 9 to 13. The lowest possible score is 0 for all subscales, while the highest possible score is 16 for the filling symptoms subscale, 12 for the voiding symptoms subscale and 20 for the incontinence symptoms subscale. The higher the score, the more symptomatic.</description>

    <measure>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once at screening visit</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS (&quot;International Prostate Symptom Questionnaire&quot;) score is based on questions concerning urinary symptoms and quality of life (QoL). It consists of 8 items covering 7 urinary symptoms related dimensions (subscales) and 1 additional item assessing quality of life. Each item is rated on a 6-point scale (0=not at all; 5=almost always). The lowest possible score in the total IPSS score is 0 (asymptomatic); the highest possible score is 35 (symptomatic). The QoL index is rated on a 7-point scale, with 0 indicating &quot;delighted&quot; and 6 &quot;terrible.&quot;</description>

    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Once at screening visit</time_frame>
    <description>The IIEF (&quot;International Index of Erectile Function&quot;) is based on questions concerning erectile dysfunction. It consists of 15 items covering 5 domains, namely erectile functioning, orgasmic functioning, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction along with a fifth component which encompasses the concept of overall sexual satisfaction. While items 1-10 are rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale from 0 to 5, items 11-15 are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 to 5. Higher scores are reflecting less dysfunction. Domain scores are computed by summing the sores for individual items in each domain.</description>

    <description>The FSFI (&quot;Female Sexual Function Index&quot;) is based on questions concerning female sexual functions. It consists of 19 items covering 6 domains, namely sexual desire, arousal (both subjective and physiologic), lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The lowest possible score in the total FSFI is 2 (asymptomatic); the highest possible score is 36 (symptomatic).</description>

    <description>Qualiveen-30 assesses the Specific Impact of Urinary Problems (SIUP) on Quality of Life. It consists of 30 items covering 4 domains, namely inconvenience (9 questions), restrictions (8 questions), fears (8 questions), and impact on daily life (5 questions). Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale (0=asymptomatic; 4=symptomatic). The index of the SIUP on Quality of Life is the mean of the four individual scores. The lowest possible overall score in the Qualiveen-30 is 0 (Urinary problems have no specific impact on QoL); the highest possible score is 30 (Urinary problems have a huge specific impact on QoL).</description>
