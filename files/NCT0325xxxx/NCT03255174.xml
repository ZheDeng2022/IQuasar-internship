  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and hemostatic effectiveness of&#xD;
      EVARREST as an adjunct to controlling mild to moderate soft hepatic parenchyma or soft tissue&#xD;
      bleeding during open hepatic, abdominal, pelvic, retroperitoneal, and thoracic (non-cardiac)&#xD;
      surgery in pediatric population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of EVARREST in controlling mild or moderate bleeding in hepatic parenchyma or soft tissue for&#xD;
      which standard methods of achieving hemostasis are ineffective or impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be treated with EVARREST. Subjects will be followed post-operatively&#xD;
      through discharge and at 30 days (+/-14 days) post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be staggered by age. The first group will include 31 subjects ≥1 years to &lt;18&#xD;
      years of age and the subsequent group will include 4 subjects from 1 month (≥ 28 days from&#xD;
      birth) to &lt;1 years of age. Ongoing safety assessment will ensure adequate safety monitoring&#xD;
      occur during the staged enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least thirty-five (35) qualified pediatric subjects with an appropriate mild or moderate&#xD;
      bleeding TBS will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pediatric subjects aged ≥28 days (≥1 month) to &lt;18 years, requiring non-emergent open&#xD;
             hepatic, abdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic or thoracic (non-cardiac) surgical&#xD;
             procedures; i) The first 31 subjects to be enrolled will be subjects aged ≥1 years to&#xD;
             &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii) The next 4 subjects to be enrolled will be subjects aged ≥28 days to &lt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject's parent/legal guardian must be willing to give permission for the subject&#xD;
             to participate in the trial, and provide written Informed Consent for the subject. In&#xD;
             addition, assent must be obtained from pediatric subjects who possess the intellectual&#xD;
             and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the trial. If the&#xD;
             pediatric subject is not able to provide assent (due to age, maturity and/or inability&#xD;
             to intellectually and/or emotionally comprehend the trial), the parent/legal&#xD;
             guardian's written Informed Consent for the subject will be acceptable for the subject&#xD;
             to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of an appropriate mild or moderate bleeding soft tissue or hepatic parenchyma&#xD;
             Target Bleeding Site (TBS) identified intra-operatively by the surgeon;&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the&#xD;
             study product or is unwilling to receive blood products;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subjects, of childbearing age (i.e. adolescent), who are pregnant or nursing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is currently participating or plan to participate in any other investigational&#xD;
             device or drug study without prior approval from the Sponsor;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are known, current alcohol and/or drug abusers&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects admitted for trauma surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with any pre or intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may&#xD;
             preclude conduct of the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject with TBS in an actively infected field (Class III Contaminated or Class IV&#xD;
             Dirty or Infected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. TBS is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall&#xD;
             requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in&#xD;
             persistent exposure of EVARREST to blood flow and pressure during healing and&#xD;
             absorption of the product;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony&#xD;
             confine.&#xD;
