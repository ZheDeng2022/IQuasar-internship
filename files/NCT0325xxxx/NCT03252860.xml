      Multicentre prospective cohort study in five of Uganda's referral Hospitals in Uganda&#xD;
      including the referral private not for profit (PNFPs) hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Patients undergoing surgery in Uganda's referral hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Surgical operations being performed in Uganda's referral hospitals over a&#xD;
      4-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive sampling of the hospitals was done based on their geographical location, their&#xD;
      influence in the areas where they are situated and the presence of an anaesthesiologist in&#xD;
      the hospital. The surgeries were enrolled into the study by probability proportional to the&#xD;
      size sampling. The sampling unit was surgical operations done in the eligible hospitals.&#xD;
      Surgical operations were enrolled into the study systematically during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the extent of compliance to the WHO surgical safety checklist&#xD;
      among Uganda's referral hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this objective was calculated using the Modified Kish &amp; Leslie method&#xD;
      (1965)&#xD;
&#xD;
      N= [Z² p (1-p)] / d² where;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z= is a percentile of the standard normal value determined by the 95% confidence level&#xD;
      (1.96).&#xD;
&#xD;
      N= minimum required sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      d= desired precision for the study = 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      p= is the estimated proportion of hospitals that had poor compliance to SSC = 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion used to compute the sample size was the proportion of hospitals which had poor&#xD;
      compliance to the SSC. This proportion was obtained from the WHO recommendation when no&#xD;
      previous proportions are available = 50% n= 384 participants, since the study was done in&#xD;
      several hospitals, adjustment for clustering was done by applying a cluster effect of 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size = 768&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusting for a 10% loss to follow up, N = n (100+10)/100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size = 845&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The categorical variables included patient demographics, urgency of the surgery, actual use&#xD;
      of the WHO SSC, qualification of staff and the team leader present in the operating room&#xD;
      during the use of the checklist, the team member who initiated the checklist, timing of the&#xD;
      performance of the different domains and post-operative complications within a 24 hour period&#xD;
      after the surgery and daily until discharge or 30 days of in hospital stay, while the ordinal&#xD;
      variables included percentage of items checked among the 19 parameters and 3 broad domains of&#xD;
      the WHO SSC. These variables were ticked off the questionnaire by the research assistant as&#xD;
      they observed the surgery. Compliance was expressed as the percentage of items that has been&#xD;
      completed per checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected using standardized sheets and stored safely using waterproof boxes and&#xD;
      treated with utmost confidence. All patients undergoing surgical operations were recruited&#xD;
      into the study regardless of their age, surgical specialty and the urgency of the surgical&#xD;
      operation provided consent to participate in the study was given. The research assistant&#xD;
      present in the operating room observed the activities in the room and completed a structured&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding demographics, the 19 parameters and 3 domains of the WHO SSC, near&#xD;
      misses, qualification of the staff present in the operating room, and intraoperative&#xD;
      variables. Technical and intraoperative complications were recorded as well. The patients&#xD;
      were followed up and questioned on the occurrence of complications at 24 hours and daily&#xD;
      until discharge or 30 days post-surgery whichever came first. The nurses on the ward reported&#xD;
      any immediate post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications were recorded as defined by the American College of Surgeons National&#xD;
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program database ; Bleeding: overt frank bleeding from the&#xD;
      surgical site, heavy soiling of the surgical site dressing with blood or need to change&#xD;
      dressing within the first 24 hours due to soiling with blood, respiratory complications;&#xD;
      acute airway obstruction, inability to saturate above 92% off oxygen therapy within the first&#xD;
      24 hours after surgery with absence of previous hypoxemia on room air and prolonged&#xD;
      intubation, post-operative nausea and vomiting, loss of consciousness or altered&#xD;
      consciousness within the first 24 hours after surgery based on GCS scores before and after&#xD;
      the surgery, cardiac and hemodynamic complications such as hypotension which were defined as&#xD;
      a blood pressure of less than 90/60 mmHg, need for unanticipated blood transfusion&#xD;
      intraoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively cardiac arrest, pain and death. The patients&#xD;
      were then followed prospectively for any other complications in the perioperative period. Any&#xD;
      other occurrences that the ward nurses considered complications attributed to the&#xD;
      perioperative period were reported to the research assistants and this was recorded in the&#xD;
      questionnaire. The patients exited the study at discharge or at 30 days of in hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checklist compliance was defined as &quot;non compliance&quot; (none of the 19 items checked off),&#xD;
      &quot;partial compliance&quot; (at least 1 to 9 items checked off) and &quot;high compliance&quot; (10 to 19&#xD;
      items checked off) and was expressed as a percentage of the number of the expected checked&#xD;
      off items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raw data sources were received from the different hospitals and stored in safe waterproof&#xD;
      boxes. An electronic data entry tool was formulated and used to store the data on multiple&#xD;
      storage devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were double-entered in an entry tool created using Epidata software version 3.1. This&#xD;
      had in-built checks. The data were validated and inconsistencies cleared accordingly. The&#xD;
      data were backed up and a copy was sent to the data analysis program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analysed using STATA version 13 (StataCorp.2013.Stata Statistical Software: Release&#xD;
      13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptives: Descriptives were summarised using means and standard deviations for the&#xD;
      parametric continuous data. Categorical data were summarised using proportions and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Comparisons for variables between participants with poor and good surgical&#xD;
      outcomes were made. For the parametric continuous data, the student t test was used and for&#xD;
      the non-parametric data, Mann-Whitney- U test was employed. For the categorical data, the&#xD;
      Chi-Square test of Fisher's exact test was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of compliance was calculated as follows; the numerator was the number of checked&#xD;
      off items on the checklist. The denominator was the total number of expected checked off&#xD;
      items. We expressed compliance as a percentage completion of the items comprising the&#xD;
      checklist. There is a total of 19 items in the checklist, therefore high compliance involved&#xD;
      adhering to at least 10 of them while non-compliance involved not adhering to any of the&#xD;
      items. We assigned each of the items of the checklist a score of 1 then calculated a&#xD;
      percentage of the compliance by dividing the score attained out the 19 which is the expected&#xD;
      score. We presented the mean percentage compliances with their corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivariate analysis: Binary logistic regression model was used to assess for association of&#xD;
      each of the predictors with mortality while a linear regression model was used to asses for&#xD;
      the association with the length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis: All factors with p value of 0.2 or less at bivariate analysis were&#xD;
      simultaneously entered in multivariate linear and logistic regression models respectively.&#xD;
      Confounding was assessed for at a 10% or more difference between the unadjusted and adjusted&#xD;
      models. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysed data were presented in figures, tables and text. Results of the linear regression&#xD;
      were expressed as coefficient and the ones of logistic regression expressed as OR with a&#xD;
      confidence interval of 95%.&#xD;
