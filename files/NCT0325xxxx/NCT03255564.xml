    <textblock>
      Infants born with heart problems are at risk of developing gut disease due to reduced blood&#xD;
      flow to the intestines which can result in poor weight gain, surgery and even death. At&#xD;
      present, doctors are often unaware of any gut problems until clinical symptoms present (poor&#xD;
      feed tolerance, blood stained stools or bloated stomach) which is often too late to prevent&#xD;
      gut damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier diagnosis of gut disease may now be possible; calprotectin is produced when the gut&#xD;
      is inflamed and can be found in faeces and blood. Calprotectin levels have been shown to be a&#xD;
      reliable marker in diagnosing gut disease in premature infants. To date, calprotectin levels&#xD;
      have not been monitored in infants with cardiac defects, who like premature infants are at&#xD;
      high risk of gut disease but the cause of gut disease is different to that seen in premature&#xD;
      infants and therefore requires specific monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will implement a high risk feeding protocol which has been adapted from current&#xD;
      feeding practices from the United States; the aim being to promote weight gain without&#xD;
      increasing the risk of gut inflammation. Furthermore, the study will validate whether faecal&#xD;
      calprotectin is a useful non-invasive marker in identifying gut disease in infants with&#xD;
      cardiac defects. Currently, infants are diagnosed with necrotising enterocolitis by an&#xD;
      abdominal X-ray (current 'Gold Standard'); infants who have a positive diagnosis will have&#xD;
      faecal calprotectin levels cross-checked. From this data, cut-off values will be established&#xD;
      which will provide data to diagnose necrotising enterocolitis eliminating the need for X-rays&#xD;
      (radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, faecal calprotectin levels will be measured at strategic time points (longitudinal&#xD;
      data) linked to increased risk of gut damage (following cardiac surgery and feeding) which&#xD;
      will then be cross-checked against infants that developed NEC to identify whether high risk&#xD;
      infants had raised calprotectin levels earlier.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect in the U.K., affecting between&#xD;
      0.3-1.5% (9 in every 1000 live births) of infants (Hoffman and Kaplan 2002), and requires&#xD;
      immediate surgical intervention. Infants with heart defects are known to exhibit early and&#xD;
      progressive falls in their growth trajectory compared to healthy infants, increasing risk of&#xD;
      death post-surgery (Eskedal, Hagemo et al. 2008). Lifesaving cardiac surgery and feeding can&#xD;
      increase the infant's risk of developing gut inflammation and necrotising enterocolitis&#xD;
      (NEC). NEC is a severe gastrointestinal disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (Kelleher, Laussen et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with cyanotic heart defects are at particular high risk of developing NEC due to&#xD;
      impaired cardiac output which reduces blood flow to the gut, resulting in poor tissue oxygen&#xD;
      perfusion, leading to gut ischemia (Neu and Walker 2011). It has been proposed that enteral&#xD;
      feeding and lifesaving cardiac surgery - in particular the length of cardio-pulmonary bypass&#xD;
      can further compromise the integrity of the gut wall (Golbus, Wojcik et al. 2011); however,&#xD;
      the extent to which these interventions cause gut damage is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial clinical manifestations of NEC are nonspecific and indistinguishable from other&#xD;
      type of sepsis. As a precautionary measure feed is often stopped in infants with suspected&#xD;
      gut inflammation until symptoms have resolved, further contributing to poor growth. A six&#xD;
      stage classification system has been devised to identify differing severity of NEC (Bell's&#xD;
      Classification), stage six being the most severe level (Bell, Ternberg et al. 1978). A&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis (Gold standard) of NEC is confirmed radiographically from abdominal&#xD;
      X-Ray - signs include intramural gas, pneumatosis, and portal venus gas. The disease often&#xD;
      has a rapid onset and therefore early detection of gut inflammation could avert severe gut&#xD;
      damage and prolonged periods of parenteral nutrition on the cardiac intensive care unit&#xD;
      (Sharma and Hudak 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between feeding and the development of NEC has been well described in&#xD;
      preterm infants with few incidences of NEC developing before feeding commences. However, this&#xD;
      distinction is less clear in infants with cyanotic heart defects as compromised blood flow to&#xD;
      the gut and cardiopulmonary bypass can result in damage before feeding commences (Iannucci,&#xD;
      Oster et al. 2013). In light of the link between feeding and NEC it is imperative that the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is not overloaded by over feeding infants. Overfeeding can cause&#xD;
      stasis of milk substrate in the gastrointestinal tract due to dysmotility leading to&#xD;
      intestinal dilatation with fluid and gas and possibly to the impairment of the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosal barrier. Intestinal dilatation in the presence of abnormal microbial colonisation&#xD;
      (dysbiosis) can distort normal signal transduction across the intestinal wall barrier&#xD;
      resulting in excessive inflammation and intestinal wall death (necrosis) (Ravindranath,&#xD;
      Yoshioka et al. 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite improvements in survival rate of infants undergoing palliative cardiac surgery, one&#xD;
      issue that remains is poor weight gain. The pattern of poor growth following surgery has been&#xD;
      well described with the poorest growth occurring during the early post-operative phase but&#xD;
      continuing up until discharge. Poor growth and longer hospital stay are risk factors for&#xD;
      death in infants with congenital heart disease (Medoff-Cooper, Irving et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2011). S100/ A8 - Calprotectin Recently, a non-invasive faecal biomarker (calprotectin) has&#xD;
      been used to diagnose NEC and is also a potential predictive marker of NEC in preterm infants&#xD;
      (Pergialiotis, Konstantopoulos et al. 2016). However, to date, faecal calprotectin has not&#xD;
      been used to diagnose or predict infants at risk of NEC with cardiac defects, who have a&#xD;
      different aetiology compared to preterm infants. The manifestation of NEC in infants with&#xD;
      cardiac defects is driven by compromised blood perfusion to the splanchnic area which is&#xD;
      further exacerbated by cardiac surgery, particularly the length of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (Typpo, Larmonier et al. 2015). Whereas preterm infant's aetiology for NEC is associated with&#xD;
      gut immaturity, alimentation, microbiota and host defence mechanisms (Pergialiotis,&#xD;
      Konstantopoulos et al. 2016). In light of this differing pathogenesis of NEC in preterm and&#xD;
      cardiac infants, it is essential to establish specific validation for infants with cardiac&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calprotectin is a neutrophil activation marker and therefore distinguishes between acute&#xD;
      bacterial and viral infection. Calprotectin (36.5kDa) is a calcium and zinc binding protein&#xD;
      of the S100/ calgranulin family. It is mainly exhibited in the cytoplasm of neutrophils&#xD;
      (about 5% of their total protein content) and expressed on activated monocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages (Yui, Nakatani et al. 2003). Furthermore, it participates in leukocyte&#xD;
      interactions with the endothelium and cellular adhesions, leading to the recruitment of&#xD;
      leukocytes to inflamed intestinal tissue Therefore, elevated levels are evident in infectious&#xD;
      and inflammatory diseases such as NEC (Stroncek, Shankar et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review of the current evidence (13 studies) suggests that faecal calprotectin is&#xD;
      elevated in preterm infants suffering from NEC. (Pergialiotis, Konstantopoulos et al. 2016).&#xD;
      Five studies evaluated the efficacy of faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker which&#xD;
      ranged from 792ug/g (76% sensitivity; 92% specificity; P-value &lt;0.001) (Aydemir, Aydemir et&#xD;
      al. 2012) to 480ug/g (100% sensitivity; 84% specificity) (Bin-Nun, Booms et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum calprotectin has also been shown to be an accurate marker of gut inflammation in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (Lehmann, Burri et al. 2015). Furthermore, a study by Reisinger et al (2014)&#xD;
      monitored serum calprotectin (Amyloid A) concentrations in 29 neonates with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      NEC and monitored its usefulness in identifying disease severity and established a cut-off&#xD;
      value of &gt; 27.8ng/ml (71% sensitivity; 83% specificity) (Reisinger, Kramer et al. 2014).&#xD;
      However, infants with heart defects pose a unique clinical presentation in that their gut may&#xD;
      be inflamed from birth due to compromised gut perfusion and therefore warrant specific&#xD;
      investigation and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective chart review I performed a retrospective chart review at Great Ormond Street&#xD;
      Hospital (GOSH) on infants with single ventricle heart defects and identified a 20% incidence&#xD;
      rate of NEC Bell's stage 1 and a 12% incidence rate of NEC Bell's stage 2. In all but one&#xD;
      case NEC developed within seven days post-surgery. Furthermore, infants that developed NEC on&#xD;
      average stayed on CICU 16 days longer than infants that did not. Moreover, 56% of infants had&#xD;
      their feed temporally stopped (24-72hrs) at least once due to suspected gut inflammation.&#xD;
      This has a huge implication on the nutritional intake of these already nutritionally&#xD;
      compromised infants. By differentiating between what is potentially bacterial gut&#xD;
      inflammation and other systemic issues (non-specific viral infection) could dramatically&#xD;
      reduce the unnecessary stopping of infants feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Faecal calprotectin levels will not be different among infants with or without&#xD;
      necrotising enterocolitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA: Faecal calprotectin levels are different among infants with and without necrotising&#xD;
      enterocolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline faecal calprotectin levels are not associated with the development necrotising&#xD;
      enterocolitis in infants with heart defects&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the above hypotheses a cross-sectional study will be performed to validate&#xD;
      whether faecal calprotectin can be used as a diagnostic tool for necrotising enterocolitis.&#xD;
      Additionally, a longitudinal study will measure faecal calprotectin a specific time points to&#xD;
      ascertain whether there is an association between calprotectin levels after surgery and&#xD;
      during feeding with the development of necrotising enterocolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will involve reviewing information relating to diagnosis and plan for surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the parents wish to find out more about the study they can discuss with the principle&#xD;
      investigator; written Parent/ legal guardian information sheet will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are happy to proceed, the formal consent process will be initiated. Signed&#xD;
      copies will be placed in the medical notes and research file&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Term infants (&gt;37 weeks gestation) delivered vaginally (bacterial colonisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth weight &gt; 2.0kg (low birth weight classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk infants - cyanotic heart defect (univentricular heart - hypoplastic left heart&#xD;
           syndrome and hypoplastic right heart, or truncus arteriosus or coarctation of Great&#xD;
           arteries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any gastroenterological complications such as gastro schisis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mother or infant received antibiotics 2 weeks prior to delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Specific data relating to cardiac surgery will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected during surgery include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant age and weight at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of surgery performed (Norwoods procedure or modified Blalock- Taussig shunt [mBTS]&#xD;
           or right ventricle to right pulmonary artery conduit (Sano)) including the size of mBTS&#xD;
           or Sano&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of time on cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of stay on CICU after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per current feeding practice infants will commence intravenous nutrition post cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with the introduction of enteral nutrition within 72hrs post-surgery. However, this&#xD;
      is highly dependable on the medical state of the infant and will be controlled as much as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expressed breast milk (EBM) is the preferred feed of choice and once milk is expressed&#xD;
      bottles will be labelled and stored in the ward fridge and used as required. If EBM is not&#xD;
      available then a hydrolysed feed will be used called Pepti- Junior (standard concentration&#xD;
      13.8% Cow&amp;Gate) which will be prepared by a technician in the hospitals special feeds unit.&#xD;
      Feed bottles will be changed every four to six hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine treatment - Infants will commence on a high risk feeding protocol (adapted from&#xD;
      published guidelines (Slicker, Hehir et al. 2013). Nasogastric tube feeds will start at&#xD;
      0.5ml/kg for 8hrs. If aspirates are less than 5ml/ kg feed will be increased by 0.5ml/kg and&#xD;
      Continued to increase by 0.5ml/kg every 8hrs until achieved fluid allowance of 100ml/ kg&#xD;
      (worked example below). The number of days taken to meet 100ml/ kg will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worked Example - 4kg Infant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start at 0.5ml/kg = 2ml x 8hr = total 16ml in 8hrs Increase by 0.5ml/ kg/ = 4ml x 8hrs =&#xD;
      32ml; totals 48ml in 16hrs Increase by 0.5ml/ kg = 6ml x 8hrs = 48ml; total 96ml in 24hrs&#xD;
      Increase by 0.5ml/ kg = 8ml x 8hrs = 64ml; total 160ml in 32hrs Increase by 0.5ml/ kg = 10ml&#xD;
      x 8hrs = 80ml; total 240ml in 40hrs Increase by 0.5ml/ kg = 12ml x 8hrs = 96ml; total 336ml&#xD;
      in 48hrs (84ml/ kg) Continue increasing until at fluid allowance (100ml/ kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine treatment - Stomach contents will be aspirated every 4hrs using a 20ml syringe and&#xD;
      volume will be measured and recorded. Aspirated contents will be replaced into the stomach&#xD;
      once recorded&#xD;
      http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/health-professionals/clinical-guidelines/nasogastric-and-orogastric-tu&#xD;
      be-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine treatment - Weights will be measured on an infant-weighing scale (kg), which will be&#xD;
      calibrated weekly for accuracy. Infant's occipital frontal circumference (OFC) should not be&#xD;
      performed before 36 hours of age. It should be done after 36 hours of age or preferably at&#xD;
      7-10 days (Lindley, Benson et al. 1999). To obtain the measurement, loop the measuring tape&#xD;
      and place over the child's head. The measuring tape should be placed above the ears and&#xD;
      midway between the eyebrows and the hairline to the occipital prominence at the back of the&#xD;
      head. Pull the measuring tape so that any hair is compressed. The measurement should be taken&#xD;
      to the nearest millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - Gut inflammation monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - To monitor the impact of cardiac surgery and enteral feeding on gut&#xD;
      inflammation, biomarkers (faecal Calprotectin) will be measured 24-48hrs after surgery and&#xD;
      24-48hrs after enteral feed commences. Additionally, infants that are diagnosed with NEC will&#xD;
      have calprotectin levels measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal calprotectin - 50-100mg of faeces will be collected in plastic containers from&#xD;
      infant's nappies. Samples will then be homogenised by shaking, and supernatants and then sent&#xD;
      to laboratories for immediate analysis.&#xD;
