    <textblock>
      Data are limited regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic velpatasvir plus&#xD;
      sofosbuvir (VEL/SOF) with or without ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. We aim to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of VEL/SOF with and without RBV for 12 weeks in HIV/HCV-coinfected&#xD;
      and HCV-monoinfected patients The antiviral responses and the adverse events (AEs) are&#xD;
      compare between the two groups. The characteristics potentially related to sustained&#xD;
      virologic response 12 weeks off therapy (SVR12) are analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the lack of effective vaccination and the shared routes of transmission, hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) infection remains a challenging co-morbidity in patients with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people&#xD;
      are coinfected with HIV and HCV (HIV/HCV) in the world. Compared to patients with HCV&#xD;
      monoinfection, HIV/HCV-coinfected patients tend to have higher serum HCV viral loads, faster&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis progression, and higher risks of hepatic decompensation. Following the&#xD;
      commencement of scale-up antiretroviral therapy (ART) that decreases the HIV-related&#xD;
      opportunistic infections and malignancies, the liver-related complications have now become&#xD;
      the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the survival rate is improved if these patients achieve sustained virologic response&#xD;
      (SVR) by anti-HCV agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of excellent efficacy and safety, treatment by interferon (IFN)-free direct&#xD;
      acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has made a paradigm shift for HCV care. Velpatasvir (VEL) is&#xD;
      an HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor and sofosbuvir (SOF) is an HCV NS5B&#xD;
      nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Both agents are active against HCV with pan-genotypic&#xD;
      potency. A fixed-dose combination of VEL at a daily dosage of 100 mg and SOF at a daily&#xD;
      dosage of 400 mg (VEL/SOF) with or without weight-based ribavirin (RBV) has been approved by&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1-6 patients with compensated and decompensated liver diseases, respectively.&#xD;
      Recently, a phase 3 study of VEL/SOF to treat HCV infection in HIV-coinfected patients&#xD;
      reveals that this regimen is safe and provides a high and comparable SVR rate to&#xD;
      HCV-monoinfected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although treatment of HCV by IFN-free DAAs is considered highly efficacious and well&#xD;
      tolerated, numerous HCV-infected individuals have limited access to the brand-name agents due&#xD;
      to the lack of universal governmental reimbursement or private insurance support. Therefore,&#xD;
      allowing the generic version of patented DAAs for HCV through voluntary or compulsory&#xD;
      licensing may provide patients with greater access to new HCV treatment, particularly in&#xD;
      resource-constrained countries. Regarding the real-world experiences of generic IFN-free&#xD;
      DAAs, a recent report from China evaluated the effectiveness of a generic version of&#xD;
      ledipasvir (LDV) plus SOF (LDV/SOF) with or without RBV for 8-12 weeks in 192 HCV genotype 1b&#xD;
      (HCV-1b) patients. The overall SVR rates were excellent (96.8%-96.9%) and most patients&#xD;
      tolerated the treatment well. Based on the encouraging results, we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of a generic version of pan-genotypic VEL/SOF-based therapy for HCV&#xD;
      in HIV-coinfected patients, and compare the performance of such a regimen in HCV-monoinfected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
