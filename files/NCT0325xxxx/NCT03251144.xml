    <textblock>
      Increased comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), are emerging problems in HIV&#xD;
      infection but the mechanisms are unclear. Understanding how antiretrovirals can minimize&#xD;
      morbidity in treated HIV infection is a research priority. Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are included in all HIV treatment regimens. Tenofovir (TFV)&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity and&#xD;
      bone disease compared with other NRTIs. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an oral prodrug of&#xD;
      TFV, but is more stable in plasma as compared with TDF and lower plasma levels of TFV are&#xD;
      thought to lead to the favorable safety profile of TAF. Mitochondrial dysfunction has a key&#xD;
      role in HIV pathogenesis and may be the common denominator that drives pathogenesis of&#xD;
      several comorbidities. Despite the better safety profile of newer (such as TDF) compared to&#xD;
      older NRTIs, there are concerns for the potential for longer term toxicity of NRTIs since the&#xD;
      exact cellular effects of NRTIs remain unclear. It is unknown whether a four-fold increase in&#xD;
      intracellular drug levels seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with TAF may&#xD;
      increase toxicity in mitochondria. Better understanding of these effects could provide&#xD;
      insights into mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis and selection of NRTIs that improve morbidity in&#xD;
      chronic HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Despite higher intracellular levels, TAF has minimal mitochondrial toxicity&#xD;
      compared to TDF in vivo. This research will explore the relative mitochondrial toxicity of&#xD;
      newer NRTIs (TAF, TDF) as a possible mechanism for differential NTRI-related toxicities.&#xD;
      These data will allow selection of NRTIs that may improve morbidity in chronic treated HIV&#xD;
      infection. Towards this aim, the investigators will use a robust experimental approach to&#xD;
      study NRTI-related mitochondrial dysfunction using novel methods, human cell lines and PBMC.&#xD;
      Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To evaluate the relative in vitro effects of TAF and TDF&#xD;
      compared to an older NRTI (ddC) on 5 independent measures of mitochondrial function in the&#xD;
      human cell line HepG2 and PBMC. Aim 2: To explore in vivo whether there is increased&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction with the use of TAF vs. TDF in chronic treated HIV infection. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that the proposed experimental approach will set the basis for&#xD;
      future large scale studies to directly compare subtle potential mitochondrial toxicities of&#xD;
      newer NRTIs in large HIV cohorts.&#xD;

      Increased comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), bone and kidney disease are&#xD;
      emerging problems in HIV infection but the mechanisms are unclear. Understanding how&#xD;
      antiretrovirals can minimize morbidity in treated HIV infection is a research priority.&#xD;
      Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are included in all HIV&#xD;
      treatment regimens. Tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of nephrotoxicity and bone disease compared with other NRTIs. Tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide (TAF) is an oral prodrug of TFV, but is much more stable in plasma as compared&#xD;
      with TDF and markedly lower plasma levels of TFV are thought to lead to the favorable safety&#xD;
      profile of TAF. Mitochondrial dysfunction has a key role in HIV pathogenesis and may be the&#xD;
      common denominator that drives pathogenesis of several comorbidities. Despite the better&#xD;
      safety profile of newer (such as TDF) compared to older NRTIs, there remain concerns for the&#xD;
      potential for longer term toxicity of the current NRTIs especially since the exact cellular&#xD;
      effects of NRTIs remain unclear. It is unknown whether a four-fold increase in intracellular&#xD;
      drug levels seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with TAF may increase toxicity&#xD;
      in mitochondria. Better understanding of these effects could provide insights into mechanisms&#xD;
      of HIV pathogenesis and selection of NRTIs that improve morbidity in chronic HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Despite higher intracellular levels, TAF has minimal/no overall mitochondrial&#xD;
      toxicity compared to TDF in vivo. The investigators anticipate that the preliminary data and&#xD;
      the proposed experimental approach will set the basis for future large scale studies to&#xD;
      directly compare subtle potential mitochondrial toxicities of newer NRTIs in large HIV&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: This research application will explore the relative mitochondrial toxicity&#xD;
      of newer NRTIs (TAF, TDF) as a possible mechanism for differential NTRI-related toxicities.&#xD;
      These data will allow selection of NRTIs that may improve morbidity in chronic treated HIV&#xD;
      infection, given the known possible role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathogenesis of&#xD;
      HIV-related comorbidities. Towards this aim, the investigators will use a robust experimental&#xD;
      approach to study NRTI-related mitochondrial dysfunction using novel methods, human cell&#xD;
      lines and PBMC. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: To evaluate the relative in&#xD;
      vitro effects of TAF and TDF compared to an older NRTI (ddC) on 5 independent measures of&#xD;
      mitochondrial function in the human cell line HepG2 and PBMC. Hypothesis: Despite higher&#xD;
      intracellular levels, TAF has minimal/no overall mitochondrial toxicity compared to TDF in&#xD;
      both the HepG2 line and PBMC. ddC will be used as a positive control for NRTI-induced&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Aim 2: To explore in vivo whether there is increased mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction with the use of TAF vs. TDF in chronic treated HIV infection. The overall goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of TAF on mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen: Healthy HIV-uninfected &gt; 18 years old with no known comorbidities&#xD;
      including metabolic disease will be recruited for PBMC isolation for the in vitro studies&#xD;
      described in Aim 1 (n=30). For Aim 1, cells will be exposed to 10 μM (and other dose that&#xD;
      will be determined after discussions with Gilead) NRTIs (TDF, TAF, ddC) for up to 14 days of&#xD;
      treatment. To evaluate the relative mitochondrial toxicity of TDF vs. TAF in vivo (Aim 2), an&#xD;
      open-label switch study will be conducted in virologically-suppressed, HIV-1 positive&#xD;
      participants. The switch regimen will be Stribild® (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150&#xD;
      mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; E/C/F/TDF) to Genvoya®&#xD;
      (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg;&#xD;
      E/C/F/TAF). For inclusion and exclusion criteria see respective sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Overall, the above in vitro and in vivo measurements of mitochondrial&#xD;
      function before and after TAF and TDF will test the hypotheses that newer NRTIs have minimal&#xD;
      overall mitochondrial toxicity in humans. From all the measures of mitochondrial function,&#xD;
      cellular oxygen consumption (COC; as determined by Seahorse technology) will be considered&#xD;
      the &quot;gold standard&quot; given it is a measure of the most important mitochondrial function&#xD;
      (oxidative phosphorylation) that relates to clinical outcome. Given the uncertainty of what&#xD;
      measure of mitochondrial function can best predict NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity,&#xD;
      comparison of relative fold induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in PBMC vs. HepG2 cells in&#xD;
      response to a specific concentration of a known NRTI inducer of mitochondrial dysfunction&#xD;
      (ddC) will be used to guide analysis. The baseline measurement will be used to control for&#xD;
      confounders of NRTI-related mitochondrial dysfunction (each person will serve as his/her own&#xD;
      control) and results will be expressed as relative-fold change compared to baseline. In&#xD;
      addition, using similar approach, Aim 2 will explore whether switch from TDF to a TAF-based&#xD;
      regimen will induce any changes in measures of mitochondrial function. This approach ensures&#xD;
      that any changes in the mitochondrial function at 6 and/or 12 months will be secondary only&#xD;
      to the NRTI switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: It is accepted that two independent measures of mitochondrial function&#xD;
      can more reliably predict mitochondrial dysfunction compared to each one of the measures&#xD;
      separately. The investigators will define NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity as significant&#xD;
      change in any of other major measures of mitochondrial toxicity [reduction in membrane&#xD;
      potential (Δψm), increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS), decrease in&#xD;
      the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), abnormal mitochondrial dynamics (increase&#xD;
      fragmentation of mitochondria)). Finally, other exploratory secondary endpoints (based on&#xD;
      available left-over resources) will be measurement of intracellular levels of TAF&#xD;
      metabolites. Flow cytometry and live cell imaging will be determined as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will define NRTI-induced mitochondrial toxicity as significant change in&#xD;
      any of the measures of mitochondrial toxicity (COC, Δψm, mito-ROS, mtDNA, mitochondrial&#xD;
      dynamics). The baseline measurement will be used to control for confounders of NRTI-related&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction (each person will serve as his/her own control) and results will be&#xD;
      expressed as relative-fold change compared to baseline. In addition, using similar approach,&#xD;
      Aim 2 will explore whether switch from TDF to a TAF-based regimen will induce any changes in&#xD;
      measures of mitochondrial function. This approach ensures that any changes in the&#xD;
      mitochondrial function at 6 and/or 12 months will be secondary only to the NRTI switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since each donor will contribute samples to all experimental groups (baseline, follow up&#xD;
      measurement), paired t-test, linear mixed effects model and nonparametric test (as needed)&#xD;
      will be used to compare expression measures between groups adjusting for donor effects (age,&#xD;
      sex, race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this research will yield useful information on NRTI-related overall&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction that can further be validated in large studies with data on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
