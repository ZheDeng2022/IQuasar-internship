  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the safety of rescue peanut oral immunotherapy followed&#xD;
      by the introduction of dietary peanut for patients with peanut allergy who have lost&#xD;
      desensitization during a peanut immunotherapy trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Salvage Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study is a single-arm, open label trial of peanut flour&#xD;
      oral immunotherapy (OIT) administered for 6 months followed by introduction of dietary peanut&#xD;
      for an additional 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peanut OIT phase will involve approximately 3 months of dose escalation up to a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 300 mg peanut protein. This is followed by 3 months of daily maintenance&#xD;
      dosing with 300 mg of peanut protein. Patients are then transitioned to the dietary peanut&#xD;
      phase ingesting common foods containing approximately 300 mg of peanut protein daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed during both peanut OIT and dietary peanut phases with adverse events&#xD;
      recorded including gastrointestinal side effects. They will also be monitored for any&#xD;
      anaphylaxis or injectable epinephrine administration. Data regarding compliance with peanut&#xD;
      OIT will be collected as well.&#xD;

    <description>As epinephrine is typically used only for more severe or potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, its use can be another measure of the safety of a protocol. This outcome involves an unblinded evaluation of the specific incidence of epinephrine use for the treatment of allergic reactions during a 2-stage peanut OIT and dietary peanut protocol.</description>

    <description>As GI side effects are the most commonly reported side effect of published oral peanut treatment protocols and have been reported to lead to treatment failure and withdrawal, this outcome involves an evaluation of the incidence of study withdrawals specifically due to GI adverse events during a 2-stage peanut OIT and dietary peanut protocol.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given increasing doses of the peanut flour as peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) with increasing doses every 2 weeks over a period of 3 months up to a 300 mg target dose. This 300 mg peanut OIT maintenance dose is then continued daily for 3 months. Participants will then introduce dietary peanut of approximately 300 mg of peanut protein and continue daily ingestion for an additional 6 months.</description>
