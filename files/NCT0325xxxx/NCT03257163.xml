  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works with capecitabine and radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with mismatch repair deficient and Epstein-Barr virus positive&#xD;
      gastric cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab, capecitabine and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may work better at treating gastric cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess efficacy (disease-free survival) of operable gastric cancer treated with PD-1&#xD;
      blockade using pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in the preoperative setting&#xD;
      and postoperative setting with chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate response rates, recurrence rates, and patterns of recurrence/metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize adverse events (AE) of pembrolizumab in combination with radiation&#xD;
      therapy and capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate overall survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess T cell responses and pathological responses in the tumor specimen. II. To&#xD;
      correlate PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue and stroma with tumor tissue response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression via Nanostring technology with tumor&#xD;
      tissue response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks, patients undergo surgery. Beginning up to 56 days after surgery,&#xD;
      patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks of resting, patients&#xD;
      continue to receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Beginning course 4, patients undergo radiation therapy over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5 for up&#xD;
      to 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 16 weeks for 2 years, every 4 months for year 2, and every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
