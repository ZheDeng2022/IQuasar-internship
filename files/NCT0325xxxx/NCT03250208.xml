  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy pre-menopausal female volunteers in the community. These&#xD;
      subjects will act as their own controls. The subjects will collect voided urine and&#xD;
      peri-urethral swab specimens daily for several months. They will also be asked to collect&#xD;
      vaginal and peri-rectal swab specimens at various time points. Subjects will document various&#xD;
      lifestyle variables daily. During the middle of the study, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      probiotic vs placebo. Using bacterial culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the study will&#xD;
      measure the bacterial populations of several anatomic sites longitudinally: voided urine,&#xD;
      peri-urethra, vagina, and peri-rectal. The study hypothesizes that oral probiotic usage will&#xD;
      alter the bacterial populations and ratio of Lactobacillus to E. coli within each of these&#xD;
      sites. Additionally, the study hypothesizes that the changes within each site will occur&#xD;
      first in the rectum (i.e. GI tract), followed by the vagina, and then the urethra and&#xD;
      bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the prospective design of daily sampling and lifestyle variable documentation, the&#xD;
      study may be able to identify possible influences on microbiome stability within the sampled&#xD;
      sites. The lifestyle variables recorded include: diet, medication usage, menstruation, sexual&#xD;
      activity, and alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will establish the variance of the outcome variables among healthy women and&#xD;
      confirm the emergence of the probiotic with the recommended dose. With this information,&#xD;
      future researchers will be able to calculate the power needed for a larger randomized trial.&#xD;
      This trial would also randomize patients who may be at risk for a UTI to receive a probiotic&#xD;
      vs placebo. The primary outcome measurement will be the change in the ratio of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      to E. coli. As a secondary aim, the study will evaluate the incidence of UTI in the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the primary aim is to identify the change in the Lactobacillus E. coli ratio&#xD;
      within the lower urinary tract, the vagina, and the peri-rectal area in response to an oral&#xD;
      probiotic as well as to evaluate the stability of these changes following cessation of an&#xD;
      oral probiotic. Voided urine and peri-urethral, vaginal, and peri-rectal swab samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for their Lactobacillus E. coli ratio using bacterial culture as well as 16S&#xD;
      ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The study will compare the ratios present before, during, and&#xD;
      after oral probiotic usage. The study will also compare the change in ratios between subjects&#xD;
      taking the oral probiotic and those taking an oral placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to identify the normal daily changes (i.e. stability) in the bacterial&#xD;
      populations within the voided urine, including whether host intrinsic (e.g. diet, hygiene,&#xD;
      and sexual activity) and extrinsic (e.g. menstruation) factors affect the stability of&#xD;
      bacterial populations. The bacterial populations defining the voided urine samples will be&#xD;
      correlated to various daily subject-reported lifestyle variables. These include diet,&#xD;
      hygiene, sexual activity, medication usage, alcohol usage, menstruation, and urinary-related&#xD;
      symptoms. These lifestyle variables will be recorded each day for the entire duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
