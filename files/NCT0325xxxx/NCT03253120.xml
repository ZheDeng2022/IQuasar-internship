    <textblock>
      The Postural Tachycardia-Syndrome (POTS) is a form of autonomic dysregulation, typically&#xD;
      accompanied by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (OI). OI is defined by the inability to&#xD;
      tolerate the upright position and is improved by lying down. POTS is considered a syndrome&#xD;
      that may include a number of several disorders. Symptoms should be persistent for at least 6&#xD;
      months to reach a diagnosis. It is characterized by a sustained heart rate (HR) increment of&#xD;
      30 beats/min or more within 10 min of standing or head-up tilt (HUT) in adults, in the&#xD;
      absence of orthostatic hypotension and with the presence of symptoms of OI. In children and&#xD;
      adolescents a diagnosis requests a HR increment of at least 40 beats/min. The increment in HR&#xD;
      when moving to an upright posture is often a response to a reduction in venous return,&#xD;
      causing excessive blood pooling in the lower limbs. The symptoms present in POTS vary&#xD;
      greatly. Typical symptoms are lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, mental clouding&#xD;
      (&quot;brain fog&quot;) or cognitive dysfunction. Other symptoms may present as palpitations or chest&#xD;
      pain. Additional symptoms consist of postural headaches, nausea, sleep disturbances, fatigue&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The manifestation of symptoms in POTS varies in severity,&#xD;
      frequency and combination, resulting in POTS being a very heterogenous and subjective&#xD;
      disorder. Symptoms can be severe and often make simple daily activities difficult to an&#xD;
      extent that compromises the patients quality of life. Typically symptoms exacerbate in the&#xD;
      mornings, after physical activity, after eating and during menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study objective is to examine the occurrence, mechanisms and causes of impaired&#xD;
      attention in POTS as well as to test the effect of acute water ingestion for attention in&#xD;
      POTS. The investigators therefore conduct a study including patients with POTS and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a dossier of five self-assessment questionnaires after giving&#xD;
      informed consent. Clinical examination includes 2 HUT-tests while standing for 15 minutes,&#xD;
      conventional measuring of blood pressure, continuous recording of NIRS signals during&#xD;
      testing, determination of pupil size, the diameter of the optic nerve and Neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing (Test of Attentional Performance, mobility version&quot; (TAP-M), Go/NoGo Test, Divided&#xD;
      Attention Test)&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a form of autonomic dysregulation, typically&#xD;
      accompanied by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (OI). OI is defined by the inability to&#xD;
      tolerate the upright position and is improved by lying down. POTS is considered a syndrome&#xD;
      that may include a number of several disorders. Symptoms should be persistent for at least 6&#xD;
      months to reach a diagnosis. It is characterized by a sustained heart rate (HR) increment of&#xD;
      30 beats/min or more within 10 min of standing or head-up tilt (HUT) in adults, in the&#xD;
      absence of orthostatic hypotension and with the presence of symptoms of OI. In children and&#xD;
      adolescents diagnosis requests a HR increment of at least 40 beats/min. The increment in HR&#xD;
      when moving to an upright posture is often caused by a reduction in venous return because of&#xD;
      excessive blood pooling in the lower limbs. Clinical symptoms present in POTS vary greatly.&#xD;
      Typical symptoms are palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, mental&#xD;
      clouding (&quot;brain fog&quot;) or cognitive dysfunction . Additional symptoms consist of postural&#xD;
      headaches, nausea, but also non-orthostatic symptoms such as sleep disturbances, fatigue and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction. The manifestation of symptoms in POTS varies in severity,&#xD;
      frequency and combination, resulting in POTS being a very heterogenous and subjective&#xD;
      disorder. Symptoms can be severe and make simple daily activities difficult. Typically&#xD;
      symptoms exacerbate in the mornings, after physical activity, after eating and during&#xD;
      menstruation. The onset of the syndrome is associated with a variety of possible causes, e.g.&#xD;
      a recent viral illness or autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, some of the most frequent reported symptoms are concentration- and&#xD;
      attentional problems so called &quot;brain fog&quot; or &quot;mental clouding&quot;. Previous research indicates&#xD;
      an actual deficit in cognitive functioning, which is, same as other POTS symptoms, exclusive&#xD;
      to the upright position. However, there is no overall accepted and recognized definition of&#xD;
      what &quot;brain fog&quot; is or what components it consists of. The majority of studies examined,&#xD;
      amongst other things, aspects of attention and working memory. Ross et al. compared it to&#xD;
      mental fatigue and showed that 67% of all POTS patients experience this symptom on a daily&#xD;
      basis, which indicates that routine daily activities and consequent quality of life are&#xD;
      reduced even further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative therapy in POTS consists in a high intake of water (2-3L) and salt on a daily&#xD;
      basis, wearing compression stockings and regular endurance training. Severely affected&#xD;
      patients may profit from additional drug treatment. A previous research group of the&#xD;
      investigators' unit showed in 2010 the improvement of OI in POTS after acute water and clear&#xD;
      soup intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the occurrence, mechanisms and causes of impaired&#xD;
      attention in POTS as well as to test the effect of acute water ingestion for attention in&#xD;
      POTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four different assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methode:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a dossier of five self-assessment questionnaires after giving&#xD;
      informed consent. The dossier consists of: Beck's Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) for&#xD;
      assessing depression, Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) for assessing health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for assessing sleep quality,&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for assessing personal physical activity&#xD;
      and a questionnaire designed to measure specific symptoms in POTS (POTS Questionnaire) to&#xD;
      assess and objectify the symptomatology of POTS patients. The completion is expected to take&#xD;
      approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of four different assessments. For the examination all POTS medication&#xD;
      will be stopped prior to the examination. All participants have no dietary restrictions&#xD;
      during the days before the study, but will have to ingest nil by mouth after midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For autonomic function testing, beat-to-beat BP and HR are measured (with the Finometer&#xD;
      device). At the beginning of each assessment, intermittent brachial BP and HR values will be&#xD;
      simultaneously recorded (using an automated Dinamap Pro 100 sphygmomanometer) on the right&#xD;
      arm. In addition, continuous recording of NIRS signals during testing will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with a supine rest on an electrical tilt table for at least 10 minutes,&#xD;
      whilst BP and HR settle and sufficient correlation between Finometer and Dinamap readings are&#xD;
      achieved. A baseline assessment of attention in supine position follows, before tilting the&#xD;
      participants to a 60°upright position. In the upright position participants will again&#xD;
      perform the same assessment of attention. Patients will be at a tilt angle of 60° for a&#xD;
      maximum of 20 minutes. HUT will be terminated earlier in case of pre-syncope. After a short&#xD;
      recovery in the supine position, participants will be asked to drink 5 dl of commercially&#xD;
      available still mineral water within 5 minutes. To facilitate rapid drinking, the upper body&#xD;
      will be transiently elevated for 45-60°. After drinking, participants will again be supine&#xD;
      for 20 minutes before a second assessment of attention in the supine position. Subsequently&#xD;
      participants will again be tilted to 60° and complete the second assessment of attention in&#xD;
      the upright posture. HUT will be terminated earlier in case of pre-syncope. The duration of&#xD;
      tolerated HUT at baseline and after fluid ingestion will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to rate their experienced symptoms in the upright position both before&#xD;
      and after the intake of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing will consist of three subtests of the automated computer-based&#xD;
      test battery &quot;Test of Attentional Performance, mobility version&quot; (TAP-M). Second the&#xD;
      investigators will use the &quot;Go/NoGo&quot; task for assessing the specific ability of subjects to&#xD;
      suppress undesired responses. Reaction times and errors are recorded in a simple test with&#xD;
      two stimuli. Using the subtest of &quot;Divided Attention&quot;, deficits of divided attention will be&#xD;
      measured, which are frequently diagnosed in neuropsychological practice. This can be assessed&#xD;
      in a &quot;dual-task&quot; paradigm, in which two stimuli have to be attended to simultaneously. The&#xD;
      test battery is computer-based; the screen will be placed in a distance of 30 cm from the&#xD;
      participants face and the button for reaction responses will be held in the dominant hand.&#xD;
      For capturing a possible decrease in attentional performance participants will complete the&#xD;
      sequence of the three subtests two times in two respective blocks, resulting in a total&#xD;
      duration time of 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diameter of the optic nerve is measured with a 7-15 MHz linear array transducer in&#xD;
      transorbital B-mode ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a study duration of approximately four hours.&#xD;
