  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression is a significant public health concern, and effective interventions for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment are needed. Insomnia and inflammation are modifiable targets for&#xD;
      depression prevention, and this study is significant in using an experimental approach (i.e.,&#xD;
      inflammatory challenge) to probe acute inflammatory- and depression responses as a function&#xD;
      of insomnia, which will inform identification of molecular targets for pharmacologic&#xD;
      interventions, and improvement of insomnia treatments to prevent depression in older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an inflammatory challenge (i.e., endotoxin) to probe acute inflammatory-&#xD;
      and depression responses (primary outcome) in older adults as a function of insomnia. Older&#xD;
      adults with insomnia show chronic inflammation; sleep disturbance also activates inflammatory&#xD;
      signaling; chronic inflammation primes acute inflammatory responses; chronic inflammation, as&#xD;
      well as acute inflammatory reactivity, predict depression over the following year; and&#xD;
      finally, endotoxin induces acute inflammation along with depressive symptoms, with&#xD;
      preliminary evidence that &quot;two-hits&quot; (i.e., sleep disturbance and inflammatory challenge) are&#xD;
      associated with exaggerated increases in depression, especially in women. In this&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of low dose endotoxin in older adults&#xD;
      (60-80 y; stratified by sex) with insomnia (n=80) vs. comparisons without insomnia (n=80),&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that older adults with insomnia will show heightened&#xD;
      inflammatory- and affective responding to inflammatory challenge as compared to those without&#xD;
      insomnia. The investigation aims to: 1) examine differences in depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      measures of negative affect responding as a function of insomnia and inflammatory challenge;&#xD;
      2) examine differences in measures of positive affect responding as a function of insomnia&#xD;
      and inflammatory challenge; and 3) examine differences in experimentally-induced inflammation&#xD;
      in relation to depressive symptoms and measures of negative- and positive affect responding&#xD;
      as a function of insomnia.&#xD;

    <description>The Depressed Mood Subscale of the POMS is a self-reported assessment of depressed mood in which subjects rate severity of depressed mood using a visual analog scale from 1 to 5 (5 being most severe). Each timepoint is scored and analyses examine the temporal profile of change with assessment every hour</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reward Learning Task</measure>
    <time_frame>about 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is a probabilistic reward task that is administered using computerized reward-learning task rooted in signal detection theory that yields an objective measurement of participant's ability to modulate behavior as a function of rewards.
