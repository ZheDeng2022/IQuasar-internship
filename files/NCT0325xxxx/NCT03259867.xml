  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label phase IIA study that investigates the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Trans-arterial Tirapazamine Embolization (TATE) treatment of liver cancer&#xD;
      followed by a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Patients with&#xD;
      four types of cancers will be enrolled, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC), metastatic gastric cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer. All&#xD;
      enrolled patients need to have liver lesions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate whether tumor necrosis induced by Trans-arterial&#xD;
      Tirapazamine Embolization (TATE) treatment can boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance the&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Patients with advanced liver cancers&#xD;
      (primary HCC or metastatic liver cancer derived from colorectal, gastric and NSCLC) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Liver lesions will be treated with up to 4 TATE treatments for optimal&#xD;
      debulking, which also serve as a vaccination process toward tumor. Lesion not treated with&#xD;
      TATE will be used for monitoring the response toward a PD-1 inhibitor (either Nivolumab or&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab per investigator decision). If a patient subsequently develops an &quot;escape&quot; to&#xD;
      the PD-1 inhibitor, patient can have another 2 TATE treatments of the escaped tumor lesion.&#xD;
      Dosing of the PD-1 inhibitor is per standard FDA-approved dosing schedule and continues until&#xD;
      progressive disease. The efficacy will be assessed by the response rate (RR) using RECIST and&#xD;
      irRC for the non-TATE treated lesion, and compared with the historic RR of the PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      in HCC (~16%) and mCRC (almost 0% for those without mismatch repair defect), advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer (15%) and metastatic NSCLC who failed to respond to an immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;

             organ due to any reason, which could lead to distal extremity hypoxia, as evidenced by&#xD;
             any gangrenous change in distal limbs or requiring resection for this reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with major gastrointestinal bleeding in the prior 2 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
