      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. Radiation is an&#xD;
      effective treatment for most patients with localized prostate cancer, but sometimes the tumor&#xD;
      returns. Researchers want to see if a highly focused type of radiation can help. It is given&#xD;
      in only 5 treatments. It is called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the maximum tolerated dose and side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      in people with a local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men at least 18 years old who have recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy and no&#xD;
      evidence of distant metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood tests, physical exam, and medical history. They may&#xD;
      also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate..&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT scan. Participants will get an injection of 18F-DCFPyL for the PET scan. They will lie&#xD;
      very still on their back on the scanner table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small samples of prostate tumor tissue will be taken by a needle through the skin or rectum&#xD;
      to see if the cancer is in the prostate. Small metal seeds will be placed into the prostate&#xD;
      at the same time to help guide the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks later, participants will have a radiation treatment planning CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their urine function, bowel function, erectile&#xD;
      function, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive SBRT. They will have 5 radiation treatments over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits. They will have a physical exam, blood tests, and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after ending SBRT, the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participantes will continue to have routine visits until two years after treatment is&#xD;
      completed....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer that recurs after prior radiation treatment can be challenging to cure&#xD;
           due to the side effects of available treatments such as surgery and cryoablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-irradiation with brachytherapy or stereotactic approaches has shown excellent rates&#xD;
           of prostate cancer disease control with tolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using image guidance to allow highly conformal focal re-irradiation may potentially&#xD;
           increase the efficacy of re-irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of image guided, focally dose escalated prostate&#xD;
      radiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with a local recurrence&#xD;
      of prostate cancer after prior radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histological confirmation of recurrent prostate cancer after prior irradiation (external&#xD;
           beam or brachytherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of distant metastases of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is greater than or equal to18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
           60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I trial of focal dose escalation with SBRT using image and pathologic&#xD;
           guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Areas in the prostate shown to have tumor on biopsy or with advanced imaging studies&#xD;
           will be treated with highly conformal SBRT over a period of two to three weeks.&#xD;
           Treatment will be guided and gated by fiducials implanted in the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated to escalating doses based on tolerability of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life and functional outcomes such as urine, bowel, and erectile function will&#xD;
           be assessed with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 52 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
