  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-arm, multicenter intermediate access protocol which&#xD;
      provides treatment access to selumetinib for eligible patients with neurofibromatosis type 1&#xD;
      (NF1) who have inoperable, progressive/symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PN) without any&#xD;
      alternative therapeutic options. All patients will continue to receive drug while they are&#xD;
      deriving clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 patients in the US will be treated as part of this protocol&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have received a clinical diagnosis of NF1 and have inoperable,&#xD;
      progressive/symptomatic PN, where inoperable is defined as PN that cannot be surgically&#xD;
      completely removed without risk of substantial morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population are patients with NF1 who have inoperable, progressive/symptomatic PN aged ≥&#xD;
      2years with onset of disease before they were 18 years and who have demonstrated an ability&#xD;
      to swallow whole capsules, who have no further treatment options and are not eligible for&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no maximum duration for selumetinib treatment. Patients may continue to receive&#xD;
      selumetinib as long as they continue to show clinical benefit, as judged by the treating&#xD;
      physician, and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients have been discontinued from treatment, other available treatment options will&#xD;
      be at the discretion of the physician&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and have inoperable,&#xD;
             progressive/symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of inoperable PN , defined as a PN that cannot be surgically completely&#xD;
             removed without risk for substantial morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients aged ≥2 with onset of disease before they were 18 years and a BSA ≥ 0.55 m2&#xD;
             who are able to swallow whole capsules. (approx. length 15.4 mm, diameter 5.4 mm). A&#xD;
             swallow test must be performed before requesting drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Normal cardiac function defined as normal ejection fraction (ECHO, MUGA or cardiac&#xD;
             MRI) as per institutional normal and absence of prior heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate blood pressure as defined in line with local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has exhausted all available approved therapies as appropriate for NF1 with&#xD;
             inoperable progressive/symptomatic PN&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Provision of a signed informed consent prior to any protocol specific procedures.&#xD;
             Patients already receiving selumetinib through single patient access who enroll in&#xD;
             this protocol must be reconsented and sign the consent form for this intermediate&#xD;
             access protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For female patients of childbearing potential, have evidence of a post-menopausal&#xD;
             status, or a negative urinary or serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unresolved chronic toxicity ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 from previous therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients eligible for any ongoing clinical trials with selumetinib in the indication&#xD;
             in question&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ophthalmological conditions: Current or past history of retinal pigment epithelial&#xD;
             detachment (RPED)/central serous retinopathy (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
             Intraocular pressure (IOP) should not be &gt; 21 mmHg for adults or outside the range of&#xD;
             normal for children or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male or female patients of reproductive potential and, as judged by the investigator,&#xD;
             are not employing an effective method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients who are breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that,&#xD;
             as judged by the treating physician, makes it undesirable for the patient to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any evidence of a severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g. unstable or&#xD;
             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease, active infection&#xD;
             (including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV), active bleeding diatheses or renal&#xD;
             transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would adversely&#xD;
             affect the absorption / bioavailability of the orally administered study medication&#xD;
