      Mechanical ventilation (MV) in intensive care units (ICUs) essential in the management of&#xD;
      respiratory failure, can result in respiratory dysfunction and inspiratory muscle weakness.&#xD;
      Like any other striated muscle, respiratory muscle mass is affected by contractile&#xD;
      inactivity. In fact, the respiratory muscles appear more sensitive to the effects of disuse&#xD;
      compared with other striated muscles .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, relatively brief periods of diaphragm disuse (&lt;3 days) due to controlled&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation are associated with diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy , force-generating&#xD;
      capacity of the diaphragm was reduced by ±32 % after 5-6 days of controlled mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the degree of weakness is correlated with the duration of ventilation. One case-control study&#xD;
      demonstrated that MV results in increased proteolysis and atrophy in the diaphragm muscle,&#xD;
      while other skeletal muscles are spared .Respiratory muscle weakness is associated with&#xD;
      adverse clinical outcomes, including difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation, increased&#xD;
      mortality, and increased risk of ICU/hospital readmission .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been used in patients with chronic lung disease for&#xD;
      many years, resulting in not just increased inspiratory muscle strength but also increased&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle endurance, reduced dyspnoea and increased exercise tolerance and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early rehabilitation of MV patients in the ICU has been claimed not only to be safe but to&#xD;
      reduce ICU length of stay, decrease time spent on MV, and improve outcomes after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is To compare the effect of early rehabilitation program on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilated COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) patient in RICU&#xD;
      (respiratory intensive care unit )to those using current standard care as regarding :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morbidity and thirty day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diaphragm function and weaning outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease exacerbation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration spent on machine .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary aim is to Establish the HRQoL and physical function critical care survivors up&#xD;
      to six months after ICU discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial assessment: (general and local chest examination, laboratory investigations in&#xD;
           the form of: arterial blood gases serum electrolytes, liver and kidney functions, blood&#xD;
           glucose, complete blood picture, chest radiography (Antro-posterior view),ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. standard medical treatment in the form of: (antibiotics bronchodilators corticosteroids&#xD;
           expectorants, prophylactic anticoagulant) participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
           receive either standard care plus comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation or standard&#xD;
           care alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be categorized into 2 groups according to simplicity of weaning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: ) participants will be receive standard care plus comprehensive pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation Group II: ) participants will be receive current standard care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      sedation hold then assessment of the patient using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation&#xD;
      Scale(RASS). to achieve a sedation level of 'easily aroused and cooperative'(RASS of -1, 0 or&#xD;
      +1). If the sedation hold is successful, the participant will be screened for safety to start&#xD;
      of rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting any of the following criteria will fail the safety screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;65 mm Hg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart rate &lt;40 or&gt;130 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory rate &lt;5 or &gt;40 breaths/min;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  marked ventilator asynchrony;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oxygen saturation &lt;88%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  active gastrointestinal bleeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute myocardial ischemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  agitation requiring increased sedatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant must be able to obey at least three of the following commands:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. opening eyes in response to voice;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. using eyes to follow investigator on request;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. squeezing hand on request and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. protruding tongue on request. If the participant can follow at least three of these&#xD;
           commands and has a RASS of -1, 0 or +1, they will be achieved 'wakefulness', and&#xD;
           pulmonary rehabilitation will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper and lower limb exercise activity events: sit on the edge of hospital bed without back&#xD;
      support, sit in a chair after transfer from the hospital bed, and ambulate with or without&#xD;
      assistance using a walker and/or support from the RICU staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual physiotherapy care typically involves - Percussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  deep breathing exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  manual hyperinflation ( delivery of a slow inspiration, a 2-3 s inspiratory hold, and a&#xD;
           fast uninterrupted expiratory flow that mimics a forced expiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  secretion clearance techniques,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In mechanical ventilated patient Respiratory muscle training will be based on increasing&#xD;
           the trigger sensitivity gradually in order to I increase muscle endurance. The trigger&#xD;
           sensitivity was adjusted to 20% of the first recorded MIP at the start of training (In&#xD;
           the first session), inspiratory muscle training (IMT) was limited to 5 min; afterwards&#xD;
           the duration was increased by 5 min at every session until it reached 30 min . . If a&#xD;
           patient tolerated 30 min of IMT, The next session would be performed with increasing&#xD;
           trigger sensitivity by 10% of the initial MIP .Patients who could not tolerate IMT with&#xD;
           20% of MIP for 5 min were trained with 10% of MIP IMT sessions stopped after 5 days and&#xD;
           trial of weaning was done&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training session was interrupted when the treating therapist observed any of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths/min or 50% higher than at the start of the&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. oxygenated haemoglobin saturation less than 90%; systolic pressure greater than 180 mmHg&#xD;
           or less than 80 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. heart rate more than 140beats/min or 20% higher than at the start of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. paradoxical breathing; agitation; depression haemoptysis; arrhythmia or sweating&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulmonary rehabilitation program (include patients on non invasive ventilation and&#xD;
           patient weaned from mechanical ventiltion&#xD;
&#xD;
           ) Duration period: at least 6 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Breathing Exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Have the patient assume a comfortable, relaxed position and loosen restrictive&#xD;
           clothing. Initially, a semi-Fowler's position with the head and trunk elevated&#xD;
           approximately 45, is desirable. By supporting the head and trunk, flexing the hips and&#xD;
           knees, and supporting the legs with a pillow, the abdominal muscles remain relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other positions, such as supine, sitting, or standing, may be used initially or as&#xD;
                the patient progresses during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pay attention to relaxation of the sternocleidomastoids, upper trapezius, and&#xD;
                levator scapulae muscles . Never allow a patient to force or prolonged expiration.&#xD;
                Expiration should be relaxed or lightly controlled Do not allow the patient to&#xD;
                initiate inspiration with the accessory muscles and the upper chest Allow the&#xD;
                patient to perform deep breathing for only three or four inspirations and&#xD;
                expirations at a time to avoid hyperventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
           GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL BREATHING It is a technique that is performed by using the muscles of&#xD;
           mouth, cheeks, lips, tongue, soft palate, larynx and pharynx to piston boluses of air&#xD;
           into the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diaphragmatic breathing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diaphragmatic breathing enhance diaphragmatic descent during inspiration and&#xD;
           diaphragmatic ascent during expiration 5 minutes about 3 times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pursed Lip Breathing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Have the patient breathe in slowly and deeply through the nose and then breathe out&#xD;
           gently through lightly pursed lips as if blowing on and bending the flame of a candle&#xD;
           but not blowing it out Teaching an Effective Cough Have the patient assume a relaxed,&#xD;
           comfortable position for deep breathing and coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sitting or leaning forward usually is the best position for coughing. The patient's neck&#xD;
           should be slightly flexed to make coughing more comfortable. Teach the patient&#xD;
           controlled diaphragmatic breathing, emphasizing deep inspirations Have the patient place&#xD;
           the hands on the abdomen and make three huffs with expiration When the patient has put&#xD;
           these actions together, instruct the patient to take a deep but relaxed inspiration,&#xD;
           followed by a sharp double cough&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Manual-Assisted Cough • If a patient has abdominal weakness (e.g., as the result of a&#xD;
           mid-thoracic or cervical spinal cord injury), manual pressure on the abdominal area&#xD;
           assists in developing greater intra-abdominal pressure for a more forceful cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sandbag Breathing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the last 2 days of the rehab program. Done three times daily use light weighted&#xD;
           sandbag, about 1-2 kilograms The sandbag is put on the patient's upper abdomen just&#xD;
           below the xiphoid process and the patient is asked to practice diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
           for 2 minutes followed by a minute off weight breathing. Repeat the previous step once&#xD;
           again.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Research outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
                a. Primary (main): effect of pulmonary rehabilitation in comparison to standard&#xD;
                care group by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-the duration of the period of weaning from mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay and&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-RICU morbidity and thirty day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-1st readmission in ER, ward, ICU during 1st 6 months of discharge. 4-.Respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and function by I) Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) will be measured to evaluate&#xD;
      global respiratory muscle strength High values for MIP exclude clinically significant&#xD;
      weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Chest Ultrasonography for assessment of diaphragm function using these views:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-. subcostal view:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduced caudal movement of the diaphragm during unassisted breathing is (weakness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paradoxal movement (diaphragm paralysis). 2 Mid axillary view Diaphragm atrophy will be&#xD;
           assessed by measuring diaphragm thickness in the mid axillary line at the level of the&#xD;
           diaphragm dome and its thickening fraction during inspiration to asses contractile&#xD;
           activity 5-Physical and mental health as measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey&#xD;
           (SF-36)&#xD;
