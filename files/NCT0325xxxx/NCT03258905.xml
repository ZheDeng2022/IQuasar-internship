  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to continue to develop a smartphone application (&quot;app&quot;) to help&#xD;
      youth from ages 18-25 who have a substance abuse problem. The app will engage them in&#xD;
      grounding, which is a sensory-based experience to help them feel calm by reducing intense&#xD;
      negative feelings and impulses (such as the urge to use a substance or hurt themselves or&#xD;
      others).&#xD;

      Substance use disorder (SUD) is the second most common psychiatric diagnosis in the U.S.&#xD;
      population. Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-25 are especially vulnerable to substance&#xD;
      use and SUD. This time period represents a distinct stage separate from adolescence and later&#xD;
      adulthood. It includes tasks such as leaving home to enter college, the workforce, or the&#xD;
      military; clarifying vocational goals; and attaining legal drinking age. This period is also&#xD;
      prime for experimentation with substance use and associated risks such as driving under the&#xD;
      influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, and vulnerability to sexual assault. This&#xD;
      project focused on a major strategy, grounding, to help TAY de-escalate (reduce) intense&#xD;
      negative emotions and impulses. Grounding has long been used in psychiatric hospitals to&#xD;
      provide a safe, quick, and powerful way to reduce any intense negative feeling such as&#xD;
      impulses to hurt self or others, substance craving, anger, anxiety, etc. Described in detail&#xD;
      in the book Seeking Safety (SS), grounding using three pathways to focus the mind (mental),&#xD;
      body (physical), and heart (soothing). Grounding provides a way to regulate emotion, which is&#xD;
      a major challenge for TAY, especially given their hormone changes and emotional intensity.&#xD;
      Indeed substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion. Grounding is&#xD;
      a key module of SS, a widely-implemented, evidence-based SUD treatment model. In phase 1 the&#xD;
      investigator developed a beta version of a grounding app. The app promotes the use of&#xD;
      grounding in any environment in which emotions and impulses need to be regulated. It&#xD;
      capitalizes on TAYs' widespread use of mobile devices; and because grounding is a stand-alone&#xD;
      skill and sensory-oriented, it lends itself wonderfully to an app approach. An iterative&#xD;
      product development methodology was used based on end-user feedback and the impact of the app&#xD;
      was studied in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 24 TAY. Half received the app&#xD;
      and the other half received grounding handouts. Results showed that the app was consistently&#xD;
      more positively rated than the handouts and was associated with significantly more use of&#xD;
      grounding and a higher score on a grounding knowledge test. All phase 1 benchmarks were met.&#xD;
      In phase 2 the investigator proposes to scale up both the app and the evaluation of it. There&#xD;
      are two specific aims: (1) To enhance the mobile grounding app by using exciting, innovative&#xD;
      technology approaches as well as expanding the grounding content in amount and type. (2) To&#xD;
      conduct an RCT with 68 TAY to evaluate the grounding app versus a control app. The control&#xD;
      app would control for both the use of a mobile device and the grounding content. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is based on power analysis from the phase 1 pilot; other outcomes and measures are&#xD;
      also included. The RCT uses rigorous scientific methods in its design, measures, and&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
