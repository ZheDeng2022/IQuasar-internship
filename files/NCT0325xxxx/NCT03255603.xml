  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are rising across the&#xD;
      world. This is especially true in industrialized countries like Canada and the USA. Even&#xD;
      though there are many possible causes for these increases. One prominent cause is our refined&#xD;
      diet, which greatly lacks dietary fiber. This 'fiber gap' between the amount of fiber&#xD;
      actually eaten and the amount that should be eaten is likely promoting these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that a high fiber diet can benefit health and the health of the gut bacteria. It&#xD;
      is also know that these gut microbes can help cause and prevent diseases. When fiber is&#xD;
      eaten, it gets broken down not by us, but by our gut microbes. During this process&#xD;
      by-products called short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are made. These SCFA have been shown to&#xD;
      promote health. Therefore, it is thought that fiber changes the gut microbes to produce more&#xD;
      SCFA, which may improve overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to aid our microbes and improve our health we need to find ways to reduce this&#xD;
      'fiber gap'. One possibility is to add fiber to our refined diet. To do so we must first&#xD;
      learn how different fibers perform in our gut. This includes how our gut tolerates increasing&#xD;
      amounts of fiber, and how our microbes respond. The purpose of this study is to learn how&#xD;
      different types of resistant starch perform in our gut, including gastrointestinal tolerance.&#xD;
      By doing so we will determine the ideal dose and type of these fibers to use in future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 4 week gastrointestinal (GI) assessment study to determine both&#xD;
      the ideal dose and type of resistant starch to use in future studies. The following specific&#xD;
      aims are offered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: GI Tolerance. Preform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-four-arm human intervention study to assess the GI tolerance of 3 novel resistant&#xD;
      starch type IV (RS4) at dose up to 50 g per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be asked to attend a screening visit at Human Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Unit, where lifestyle and anthropometric information will be collected to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible participants (N = 40) will be stratified based on gender and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 4 groups, where they will be asked to supplement their diet for 4 weeks with&#xD;
      either a RS4 (experimental arms) or a digestible starch (control arm). The weight of total&#xD;
      starch (digestible plus RS) provided in each experimental arm will be dependent on the purity&#xD;
      of the individual RS4 products. Subjects will supplement their diet with 10 g, 20 g, 35 g and&#xD;
      50 g of total dietary fiber (as RS) daily over the course of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4,&#xD;
      respectively. The amount of digestible starch provided in the control arm will be equal to&#xD;
      the mean amount of total starch provided across the 3 experimental arms. All starch products&#xD;
      will be provided in powder form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies previously described by Maki et al. will be employed to evaluate the overall GI&#xD;
      tolerance of the RS4 products by assessing changes in GI symptom, bowel movement frequency,&#xD;
      and bowel movement consistency, and by comparing these changes to those changes observed in&#xD;
      the control arm (digestible starch - Maki et al., Int J Food Sci Nutr, 2013). Participants&#xD;
      will keep a daily study journal, which included a bowel habits questionnaire, over the course&#xD;
      of the 4 week study, and they will also complete weekly GI tolerance and satiety&#xD;
      questionnaires during their weekly study visits. Participants will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      two 24-h recalls, both prior to starting the dietary intervention and during week 4. All 24-h&#xD;
      recalls will be completed online through the Canadian Automated Self-Administered 24h (ASA24)&#xD;
      recall system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Evaluate prebiotic and dose dependent effect on the microbiome. Evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the 3 distinct RS4 types on gut microbiota composition and structure in a dose dependent&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected at baseline and at the end of each intervention week (weeks&#xD;
      1-4). Fecal samples will be used to both characterize the fecal microbial community via 16S&#xD;
      ribosomal RNA next-generation sequencing, and to quantify fecal short-chain fatty acid&#xD;
      concentrations via gas chromatography. Short-term characterization of the fecal microbiome&#xD;
      will provide a systematic assessment of the individualized response between 3 structurally&#xD;
      distinct types of RS4, while further allowing an intricate assessment of the prebiotic dose&#xD;
      effect upon significantly increasing the dose of RS towards 50 g per day. This analysis will&#xD;
      provide critical information on how distinct types of RS4 shape the gut microbiome in humans,&#xD;
      and which dose is necessary to achieve such effects.&#xD;
