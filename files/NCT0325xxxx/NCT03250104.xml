      Throughout project, the investigators design, evaluate and disseminate infection control and&#xD;
      antibiotic stewardship (ABS) measures aimed at reducing the incidence of Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile infection (CDI). The measures will focus on known departments with high incidence&#xD;
      of CDI, i.e. a) hematology/oncology, b) other departments/wards demonstrating above-average&#xD;
      infection rates, which were identified throughout previous studies. The infection control&#xD;
      package will include staff training, hand hygiene programs and disinfection measures.&#xD;
      Throughout the ABS package, investigators will develop and implement ABS measures&#xD;
      specifically designed for patients at the highest risk of developing hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infections, i.e. those treated on hematological/oncological wards. Potentially useful ABS&#xD;
      actions even in critically ill patients are early reduction of exposure based on&#xD;
      microbiological results, timely cessation of anti-infective treatment, thoughtful&#xD;
      implementation of screening measures and biomarkers, defined approaches to patients known to&#xD;
      be allergic to penicillins, and vigorous enforcement of clinical and microbiological&#xD;
      diagnosis of infection focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IC and ABS measures aim at educating and assisting clinical personnel in realizing&#xD;
      treatments according to official guidelines. There will not be a direct contact between study&#xD;
      personnel and patient. There will be no direct recruitment of patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, a distinct group of healthcare-associated pathogens (HPs) has become highly&#xD;
      prevalent among hospital inpatients worldwide. Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant&#xD;
      enterococci (VRE), and multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MRGN) today are an immediate&#xD;
      threat to hospitalized patients in Western countries, given inferior outcomes and prolonged&#xD;
      treatment associated with such infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two key clinical strategies to prevent transmission and reduce the overall&#xD;
      incidence of infections by Clostridium difficile and other gut-derived HPs. Infection control&#xD;
      (IC) measures act by avoiding in-hospital transmissions using various interventions,&#xD;
      including hand hygiene, contact isolation and environmental cleaning/disinfection. Antibiotic&#xD;
      stewardship (ABS) on the other hand aims at reducing selective pressure by ascertaining&#xD;
      adequacy of treatment duration, dose, and selection of antibiotics.However, there is a&#xD;
      scarcity of studies showing effectiveness of these strategies in actually reducing nosocomial&#xD;
      infection by HPs. Single room contact isolation has deleterious implications, i.e. increased&#xD;
      cost, decreased patient contacts and quality of life, but has not been proven effective for&#xD;
      most HPs. Current ABS concepts are usually not aimed at the patients with the highest&#xD;
      antibiotic consumption and the highest risk of contracting nosocomial infection by HPs, e.g.&#xD;
      patients with neutropenia following chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABSOLUTE is a comprehensive clinical study programme assessing IC/ABS measures to reduce&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) on high-incidence HP/CDI wards in a stepped-wedge&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial. The study will focus on known departments with high incidence of&#xD;
      CDI, i.e. a) hematology/oncology, b) other departments/wards demonstrating above-average&#xD;
      infection rates, which will be identified throughout previous study by the German Center for&#xD;
      Infection Research (DZIF). This design was chosen as high-risk groups allow optimal resource&#xD;
      utilization by expedited observation of target outcomes and because there is a translational&#xD;
      gap towards implementing established strategies of infection control and ABS in critically&#xD;
      ill patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each partner site will identify eight observation wards. To allow measurement of secondary&#xD;
      endpoints relevant to the IC/ABS bundle, especially safety, at least three of the sites&#xD;
      should include their hematology/oncology department into the analysis. The other&#xD;
      wards/departments will be selected based on CDI epidemiology. Incidence of CDI on candidate&#xD;
      study wards/departments should exceed the 75 percentile based on R-Net (DZIF study) data&#xD;
      collected during the preparation phase. The study coordinators will make the ultimate&#xD;
      decision on the participating wards based on discussion with the local team of investigators.&#xD;
      Besides the above-mentioned entry criteria, knowledge of current practices and&#xD;
      approachability of the ward and the related staff may be regarded during the discussion. In&#xD;
      total, each site will perform the analysis on at least ten wards of at least three&#xD;
      departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection control measures for Clostridium difficile are well established and can be easily&#xD;
      applied into hospital routine. This work package can therefore start ahead of the ABS bundle&#xD;
      with measures aimed at reducing transmission of Clostridium difficile. The infection control&#xD;
      bundle will include staff training, hand hygiene programs, disinfection measures, and contact&#xD;
      isolation. Physicians will be discouraged to prescribe proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) where&#xD;
      not explicitly needed. The bundle will be defined based on current literature. During the&#xD;
      preparation phase of the study, investigators and other personnel from each site will receive&#xD;
      central training courses in infection control measures targeted at reduction of effective&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile transmission. It will be their task to train local staff (ward&#xD;
      physicians, nurses) for compliance with the infection control bundle. For implementation, the&#xD;
      investigator will adapt the bundle to specific local needs, discuss with the responsible&#xD;
      department heads and ward staff, perform training and disseminate standards of care. The&#xD;
      following indicators of process quality will be measured be the investigator in collaboration&#xD;
      with the local hygiene staff: compliance observations (contact isolation, hand hygiene),&#xD;
      education assessment (surveys), and PPI consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the ABS work package, the investigators will develop and implement an ABS bundle&#xD;
      specifically designed for patients at the highest risk of developing hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infections, i.e. those treated on hematological/oncological wards. Potentially useful ABS&#xD;
      measures even in critically ill patients are early reduction of exposure based on&#xD;
      microbiological results, timely cessation of anti-infective treatment, thoughtful&#xD;
      implementation of screening measures and biomarkers, defined approaches to patients known to&#xD;
      be allergic to penicillins, and vigorous enforcement of clinical and microbiological&#xD;
      diagnosis of infection focus. The study hypothesis is, that the consumption of glycopeptides,&#xD;
      carbapenems, daptomycin, tigecycline, and linezolid can be significantly reduced without&#xD;
      jeopardizing patient outcomes. Reduction of these antibiotics will save last resort&#xD;
      antimicrobials for documented breakthrough infections, reduce colonization and blood stream&#xD;
      infections (BSI) with VRE and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negatives&#xD;
      (ESBL), and reduce the incidence of CDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first step, the investigators will guide a consensus process to develop specific ABS&#xD;
      guidelines for hematology/oncology wards. They will develop this guideline primarily as&#xD;
      German S2k (consensus) guideline, but will also seek publication in an international&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journal. For the consensus process, relevant German medical societies and&#xD;
      groups will be invited to send delegates. External experts will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the process and comment on the guideline as needed. The consensus process will consist of a&#xD;
      kick-off face-to-face meeting with discussion and distribution of work packages, monthly&#xD;
      telephone conferences and finally, a consensus meeting. The guidelines will contain advice on&#xD;
      specific strategies to avoid excessive or wrong usage of anti-infectives and also on quality&#xD;
      indicators of appropriate antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study sites will receive comprehensive training in the defined ABS criteria as part of a&#xD;
      3-day course program. In addition, sites without established ABS groups or trained ABS&#xD;
      experts will receive standard three-week training by the ABS Initiative&#xD;
      (www.antibiotic-stewardship.de). Afterwards, implementation of the ABS measures will start.&#xD;
      Antibiotic stewards will develop local standards of procedure based on the provided training&#xD;
      and guidelines. They will then train the responsible staff and disseminate guidelines as best&#xD;
      suited for the local work environment, e.g. as pocket cards, posters, or electronically.&#xD;
      Point-prevalence investigations will assure adherence to guidelines.&#xD;
