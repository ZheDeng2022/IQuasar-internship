      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is in the early stages. But it usually comes back after&#xD;
      treatment. The drugs Vicineum and Durvalumab may help the immune system find and destroy&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the drugs Durvalumab and Vicineum together are safe and effective to treat people&#xD;
      with bladder cancer that has not spread to the muscle in the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have bladder cancer that has not spread to the muscle in the&#xD;
      bladder and was treated unsuccessfully with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample from previous surgery. If one is not available, they will have a biopsy: A small&#xD;
      piece of tumor is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystoscopy to examine the inside of the bladder. This may include a biopsy or removing&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT or MRI: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram to test heart function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive Durvalumab and Vicineum in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First phase: Durvalumab every 4 weeks and Vicineum once a week for 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase: Durvalumab every 4 weeks and Vicineum once every other week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tumor samples taken every 3 months. They will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit about 30 days after their last treatment. This includes blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. It may include a cytoscopy or additional biopsies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, it is estimated that there will be 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390&#xD;
      deaths associated with bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is associated with the highest costs&#xD;
      among all types of cancer, due to the need for lifelong routine monitoring and treatment.&#xD;
      Approximately 70% of cases are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) at presentation and&#xD;
      are treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical&#xD;
      treatment with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) or mitomycin C. However, in the setting of high&#xD;
      grade disease, these therapies can become ineffective over time in up to two-thirds of&#xD;
      patients and disease progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) can occur. In&#xD;
      patients who present with CIS (carcinoma in situ) rates of progression are greater than 50%.&#xD;
      Progression to MIBC portends a poor outcome as only 50% of patients will survive five years&#xD;
      despite undergoing radical cystectomy. Clearly, there is a large unmet need in therapeutic&#xD;
      options for NMIBC that recurs or progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vicineum(TM) is a recombinant fusion protein, VB4-845, that contains a humanized single-chain&#xD;
      antibody fragment specific for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antigen linked&#xD;
      to ETA (252-608), a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA). EpCAM is overexpressed on&#xD;
      the surface of urothelial carcinoma cells and therefore represents a good target for&#xD;
      Vicineum(TM) to bind to. In a previous phase II study in BCG refractory or BCG intolerant&#xD;
      patients with high grade bladder cancer, 16% of patients treated with induction and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with Vicineum(TM) remained disease-free at 1 year. As a result,&#xD;
      Vicineum(TM) is currently being evaluated as a single agent in a phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical work with a drug called Proxinium, an earlier version of Vicineum(TM),&#xD;
      demonstrated an abscopal effect and synergy with the use of a checkpoint blockade inhibitor.&#xD;
      Although it was done in a NSCLC model, the results were impressive in causing tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (MAb) that inhibits binding of&#xD;
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (B7 homolog 1 [B7-H1], cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      [CD]274) to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). Durvalumab has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to have activity against advanced metastatic urothelial bladder cancer whose&#xD;
      tumor has progressed during or after one standard platinum-based regimen in a phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial will take two agents with single agent activity against urothelial&#xD;
      cancer and combine them in a Phase I trial for patients with high-grade NMIBC Previously&#xD;
      Treated with BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and Vicineum when administered in&#xD;
      combination to subjects with BCG-refractory high-grade NMIBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a histologically-confirmed high-grade non-muscle invasive urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) of the bladder as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-grade Ta or T1 disease based on a biopsy/TURBT performed within 12 weeks of the initial&#xD;
      dose of study treatment. If multiple bladder biopsies/TURBTs are required to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility, the timing of the last bladder biopsy to the initial dose of study treatment&#xD;
      must be within 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with BCG unresponsive disease as defined by the Society of Urologic Oncology and the&#xD;
      FDA: Subjects must have received at least two courses of intravesical BCG (at least 5 of 6&#xD;
      induction doses of BCG and at least 2 of 3 maintenance doses of BCG under a maintenance&#xD;
      regimen or at least 2 doses of a repeat induction course). See exception below for persistent&#xD;
      T1 disease below. There is no upper limit on the amount of prior BCG a subject may have&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with persistent T1 high grade disease on TURBT following a single induction course&#xD;
      of BCG (at least 5 of 6 doses) may also be eligible for this trial provided that the patient&#xD;
      is surgically unfit for cystectomy as deemed by the investigator or the patient declines&#xD;
      cystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label study of the combination of durvalumab and Vicineum in subjects&#xD;
      with high-grade NMIBC previously treated with BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive Vicineum intravesically and durvalumab systemically at the standard&#xD;
      doses for both drugs as determined by Phase II trials for each drug, as no synergy or&#xD;
      additive effect is expected for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vicineum is administered in a 12-week Induction Phase followed by a Maintenance Phase for at&#xD;
      least one year with an option for a total of up to 2 years of treatment. During the Induction&#xD;
      Phase, Vicineum is administered once weekly for 12 weeks. During the Maintenance Phase,&#xD;
      Vicineum is administered every other week. The dose of Vicineum is 30 mg in 50 mL of saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab 1500 mg is administered intravenously (IV) once every 4 weeks for 12 months with&#xD;
      an option to continue therapy for an additional 12 months (total of 24 months) provided that&#xD;
      patient is tolerating therapy and remains free of recurrent high grade NMIBC (see Treatment&#xD;
      Period below). The dose of durvalumab is 1500 mg. If optional maintenance therapy continued&#xD;
      in the second year, durvalumab 1500 mg will be administered intravenously once every 3 months&#xD;
      to provide an immune boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vicineum will be given as monotherapy for 1 week followed by treatment with the combination&#xD;
      of Vicineum and durvalumab starting week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial six patients, three subjects at a time will enroll at these doses and&#xD;
      schedules. Dose-liming toxicity (DLT) for each subject will be determined during the initial&#xD;
      6-week period that the subject is on treatment (i.e., the DLT period). When all subjects in&#xD;
      the initial cohort have been on treatment through the DLT period, all available safety data&#xD;
      will be considered in decisions to enroll additional subjects at this dose level, or to&#xD;
      de-escalate the dose(s) of study drug(s), based on a standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design. There will be&#xD;
      no dose-escalations in this study. The dose of durvalumab will remain at 1500 mg every 4&#xD;
      weeks, and the dose of each intravesical Vicineum treatment can be reduced to 20 mg if the&#xD;
      initial doses in combination induce DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first six patients, an additional 18 subjects will be enrolled at the initial doses&#xD;
      or at the reduced doses (if DLTs resulted in the first 6 patients) in order to obtain&#xD;
      additional safety data, biomarker data and preliminary anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject s course will consist of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline Period: The subject is consented and undergoes screening assessments to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period: The subject is treated and monitored for safety. Biomarker data will be&#xD;
      obtained prior to treatment and at periodic intervals during treatment. Subjects who remain&#xD;
      free of high-grade NMIBC after 12 months of study treatment may continue to receive treatment&#xD;
      for an additional 12 months until they develop recurrent high-grade disease, disease&#xD;
      progression, or intolerable toxicity, or meet another withdrawal criterion (e.g., consent&#xD;
      withdrawal, pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment. The subject will return to the study site monthly for up to 90 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of immunotherapy for end-of-treatment assessments. Subjects with ongoing&#xD;
      clinically-significant related AEs or SAEs will have additional follow-up after the initial&#xD;
      post-treatment visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia s formula (QTcF) &gt;=470 ms. (Any&#xD;
             clinically significant abnormalities detected require triplicate ECG results and a&#xD;
             mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia s formula (QTcF) &gt;=470 ms&#xD;
             calculated from 3 ECGs.)&#xD;

             hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other anticancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             targeted therapy, endocrine therapy, radiation therapy, intravesical therapy,&#xD;
             investigational agent) within 28 days of the first dose of study therapy (and within 6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin C) other than a single dose of intravesical&#xD;
             chemotherapy which is permitted between 28 days and 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before the first dose&#xD;
             of study treatment, except for superficial skin cancer, localized prostate cancer on&#xD;

             with systemic anticancer therapy and not expected to require anticancer therapy in the&#xD;
             next 2 years i.e., while the subject may be taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or&#xD;

             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease [e.g. colitis or Crohn s disease], diverticulitis [with the&#xD;
             exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or&#xD;
             Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]). The following are exceptions to this&#xD;

             indicated), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result, hepatitis&#xD;
             C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with HIV&#xD;
             are excluded from participating on this clinical trial because their immunodeficiency&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of adverse events which would hinder meeting the primary&#xD;
             objective. Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of&#xD;
             hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Subjects&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             is negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade &gt;=2 from previous anticancer therapy with the&#xD;

             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with Grade &gt;=2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
                  after consultation with the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by&#xD;
                  treatment with durvalumab may be included only after consultation with the&#xD;
