    <textblock>
      Fifty six patients of CRU attending the urticaria clinic in the department of Dermatology,&#xD;
      Venereology and Leprology at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,&#xD;
      Chandigarh will be recruited in the study calculated by using equivalence analysis assuming&#xD;
      power of 90%, significance level of 5% and standard deviation of 1 and adjusting 5% of&#xD;
      expected drop-outs after taking written informed consent. This study is undertaken with an&#xD;
      intention to treat the patients of chronic refractory urticaria completely. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups A and B using computer generated random number tables, group A&#xD;
      will receive Cyclosporine and group B will receive Azathioprine; wherein, 28 random single&#xD;
      and double-digit numbers from 1-56 will be selected before recruitment, and patients coming&#xD;
      on these numbers will be randomized in a particular group. Random number generation,&#xD;
      recruitment and randomization, were all done by the same investigator..&#xD;

      Available definition for chronic refractory urticaria (CRU) is chronic spontaneous urticaria,&#xD;
      with disease duration of at least 6 months or above, which is not controlled with four fold&#xD;
      increased dosage of antihistamines (as per EAACI guidelines), given for at least three&#xD;
      consecutive months and requiring repeated courses of oral corticosteroids. There is no strict&#xD;
      number of oral corticosteroids intake courses before the patient can be labeled as chronic&#xD;
      refractory urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end- points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary end-point :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Change in urticaria activity score (UAS7) i.e decrease more than 75% from baseline to&#xD;
           week 12 (at end of treatment) within group A and B and comparison between corresponding&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary end-points :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Change in outcome scoring scale (OSS) from baseline to week 12 within group A and&#xD;
                B.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Change in UAS7 and OSS from baseline to week 24 (end of follow-up) within group A&#xD;
                and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Change in ASST, APST, IgE levels from baseline to week 12 within group A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Comparison for the above mentioned parameters between group A and B. Treatment&#xD;
                sessions will be for three months, daily oral cyclosporine and daily oral&#xD;
                azathioprine and after completion, patients will be additionally followed for three&#xD;
                more months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Oral cyclosporine 3mg/kg/day (200mg/day) will be started and given for one week, if&#xD;
                patient shows improvement, the same dose will be continued for the total study&#xD;
                period ( three months) ,after physical examination and various laboratory testing&#xD;
                most importantly renal function tests, blood pressure monitoring, hemogram and if&#xD;
                no symptomatic improvement then dose of cyclosporine will be increased slowly till&#xD;
                5 mg/kg /day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Oral azathioprine will be started at 1mg/kg/day ( 50mg/day) for one week , if&#xD;
                patient demonstrates improvement, same dose is continued for the total study period&#xD;
                ( 3months), after physical examination and various laboratory testing i.e LFTs,&#xD;
                Hemogram, if no symptomatic improvement then dose of azathioprine will be increased&#xD;
                to 2mg/kg/day (100mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
                All the patients will be uniformly started on levocetrizine 10mg/day, which will&#xD;
                continue daily for one month in all patients followed by stopping the drug and&#xD;
                adding only if the patient is symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
                After three months both the drugs will be stopped and levocetrizine (10mg/day) will&#xD;
                be continued for three months of follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Clinical assessment of patients will be done before the starting of cyclosporine&#xD;
                and azathioprine, and every fortnightly during three months of treatment and during&#xD;
                three months of follow up period. Assessment will be done using UAS7and OSS as&#xD;
                devised by Berroeta et al.&#xD;

                are to be added to get UAS of that day and average UAS over 7 days is calculated&#xD;
                which will range between 0 to 6. Patients will be instructed to write down number&#xD;
                of weals and severity of itching in their daily urticaria diary. UAS7 will be&#xD;
                calculated every fortnightly by calculating average of weal and itch score of the&#xD;
                previous seven days after taking detailed history from patient.&#xD;

                Berroeta et al 22 for cyclosporine and azathioprine treatment of CU will also be&#xD;
                used for clinical assessment of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1- No change 2 - Minimal improvement (no change in frequency or extent, symptomatic&#xD;
                improvement ±) 3- Moderate improvement (less frequent or extensive, symptomatic&#xD;
                improvement +) 4- Marked improvement (occasional episodes and less extensive,&#xD;
                symptomatic improvement ++) 5- Clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
                In addition, ASST , APST and IgE levels will be done before starting cyclosporine&#xD;
                and azathioprine and at the completion of the treatment after three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                FOLLOW UP After completion of oral cyclosporine and oral azathioprine for three&#xD;
                months, patients will be followed up for a period of three more months, every&#xD;
                fortnightly in urticaria clinic. At each visit, clinical assessment will be done&#xD;
                using UAS7 and OSS. Urticaria being a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, will&#xD;
                relapse immediately as soon as the treatment is withheld. So, a follow up period of&#xD;
                three months will be sufficient enough to study the effect of cyclosporine and&#xD;
                azathioprine on long term remission of urticaria. Patients developing angioedema&#xD;
                and having uncontrolled excessive exacerbation during treatment will be removed&#xD;
                from study and will be treated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients who will fail to take the treatment for ≥ one week will be defined as&#xD;
                defaulters and removed from the study. Those with no improvement even after one&#xD;
                month of regular treatment will be labelled as non responders.&#xD;
