    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis continues to be a disease that is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in premature infants. It affects annually 0.72 infants per 1000 live&#xD;
      births among all neonates and 33 infants per 1000 live births among very low-birth-weight&#xD;
      (below 1500 gram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrotising enterocolitis presents with both gastrointestinal and systemic signs.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal signs as delayed gastric emptying, abdominal distention and bloody stools.&#xD;
      Non specific signs as lethargy, apnea, respiratory distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although clinical and characteristic radiological findings remain the most important tools so&#xD;
      far. Unfortunately, these signs are usually detectable in an advanced stage of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematological studies as severe or persistent thrombocytopenia, neutropenia,&#xD;
           coagulopathy, or acidosis might indicate severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serial C-reactive protein : that persistently high C-reactive protein indicated&#xD;
           developing complications, such as stricture or abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the majority of these biomarkers lack accuracy in preclinical stage and do not&#xD;
      allow proper discrimination from sepsis Therefore, the search for disease-specific, early and&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers remains warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calprotectin, a peptide secreted by neutrophils and macrophages and is a useful laboratory&#xD;
      biomarker for diagnosing necrotizing enterocolitis . Its non-specific biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation, but the nature of the specimen, e.g. stool, renders these mediators more&#xD;
      indicative of the site of tissue injury. And its levels may be a marker for early diagnosis&#xD;
      and resolution of gastrointestinal illness , but its utility for early diagnosis and&#xD;
      assessment of resolution of necrotizing enterocolitis needs to be studied in a larger&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plain X ray: Definite signs include pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural air) and portal&#xD;
      venous gas .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound : More sensitive and accurate imaging studies and could become helpful adjuncts to&#xD;
      abdominal films in the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major advantage of sonography over plain abdominal radiography is its superiority in&#xD;
      depicting small amount of gas. Ultrasound with Doppler might be more sensitive than abdominal&#xD;
      films for detecting necrotic bowel requiring surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When necrotizing enterocolitis is suspected, infants are given bowel rest , bowel&#xD;
      decompression, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (after cultures are obtained). Anaerobic&#xD;
      coverage should be considered. Adjunctive therapy includes cardiovascular, pulmonary, and&#xD;
      haematological support as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main options available for the surgical management of necrotizing enterocolitis are&#xD;
      exploratory laparotomy and primary peritoneal drainage .&#xD;
