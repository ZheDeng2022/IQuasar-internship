  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to determine if a visible respiratory function monitor (RFM)&#xD;
      displaying realtime measurements of delivered inflations improves clinical providers ability&#xD;
      to perform positive pressure ventilation (PPV) within a pre-defined target tidal volume in&#xD;
      preterm infants after birth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that the use of a respiratory function monitor (RFM) can&#xD;
      guide PPV in the DR.(Wood, Schmolzer) In this study, the New Life Box, (Advanced Life&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Weener, Germany) a neonatal Respiratory Monitor (RFM), will be used to measure&#xD;
      and calculate inflation pressures, flow, and tidal volumes in all enrolled infants. The New&#xD;
      Life Box uses a small variable orifice anemometer to measure gas flow in and out of a&#xD;
      face-mask or endotracheal tube. This signal is automatically integrated to provide inspired&#xD;
      (Vti) and expired (Vte) tidal volume. The difference equals the leak from the facemask or&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. Complete airway obstruction occurs when no flow of gas into or away from&#xD;
      the infant is seen during a positive pressure inflation. The RFM can also calculate and&#xD;
      measure respiratory rate and minute volume, inflations and spontaneous inspirations, and all&#xD;
      ventilation pressures. Using customized software heart rate, oxygen saturation and expired&#xD;
      carbon dioxide can be integrated into the RFM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NewLife Box monitor presents graphical information for pressure, flow, and volume. In&#xD;
      addition, the monitor displays numeric data for pressure (PIP and PEEP), tidal volume (Vti,&#xD;
      Vte), flow, respiratory rate and percent leak. The monitor integrates and displays&#xD;
      physiologic data streaming from the patient (heart rate and oxygen saturation) as well as&#xD;
      FiO2 from an oxygen analyzer in the inspiratory limb of the respiratory circuit. If enabled,&#xD;
      the monitor can incorporate video captured from an external camera. The video serves as a&#xD;
      helpful aid in the interpretation of the events during the RFM waveform recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an RFM in the DR has the potential to improve neonatal respiratory support and&#xD;
      reduce lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that observing the data and&#xD;
      waveforms displayed on an RFM during the provision of PPV to preterm infants (24-27 6/7 weeks&#xD;
      gestation) after birth will increase the proportion of inflations performed with a predefined&#xD;
      VTe &quot;safe range&quot; of 4 - 8 mls/kg.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred between Oct 2013-May 2019 in 7 NICUs in 6 Countries (Netherlands, Australia, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United States). IRBs at each site approved the study. At five of the seven non-US sites, deferred consent was endorsed for use when there was insufficient time for antenatal consent, or it was considered inappropriate.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Infants with antenatal enrollment into the trial were excluded from randomization if their delivery occurred outside of the gestational age eligibility window.Post-randomization exclusion occurred if postnatal consent was not obtained, no IPPV delivered, equipment failure, or a congenital anomaly was discovered.</pre_assignment_details>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were monitored from the time of birth (in the delivery room) to the time of transfer to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. All cause mortality was documented from the time of birth until hospital discharge or 44 weeks corrected gestational age, whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
      <desc>Need for positive pressure after birth is an inclusion criterion for this study, therefore respiratory failure requiring PPV or endotracheal intubation after birth was not considered an adverse event.</desc>
