  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods study is culturally tailoring and evaluating a communication intervention&#xD;
      to increase the frequency and quality of advance care planning with diverse American Indian&#xD;
      and Alaska Native adults with serious, life-limiting illness in primary care at two sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is an interdisciplinary field that aims to relieve emotional, spiritual and&#xD;
      physical suffering and improve quality of life in patients with serious, life-limiting&#xD;
      illness and their families. Unfortunately, palliative care is often introduced too late in&#xD;
      the course of care to maximize its potential benefits, in part because healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients alike lack the knowledge and self-efficacy to initiate conversations about&#xD;
      advance care planning (ACP). ACP is an important component of palliative care in which&#xD;
      patients, families and providers discuss and plan for the patient's desired treatment goals,&#xD;
      including preferences for care and who can make decisions on the patient's behalf if needed.&#xD;
      Integrating ACP into treatment early, before serious, life-limiting illness advances to a&#xD;
      late stage, can improve patient and caregiver quality of life, length of survival, and health&#xD;
      care cost. Primary care is an ideal setting for early integration of ACP, as primary care&#xD;
      providers routinely diagnose and care for patients in the early stage of serious,&#xD;
      life-limiting conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Alaska Native and&#xD;
      American Indian (AN/AI) people have disproportionately high prevalence of many serious,&#xD;
      life-limiting conditions, including cancer, coronary heart disease, and liver disease. Yet,&#xD;
      AN/AIs use ACP and other palliative care services significantly less than the overall&#xD;
      population. The reasons for this disparity are unclear, and AN/AIs are among the most&#xD;
      underrepresented groups in palliative care studies. Previous research indicates that when&#xD;
      given the opportunity, AIs will engage in ACP, and our preliminary data suggest strong&#xD;
      support among ANs for developing culturally congruent ACP interventions in primary care&#xD;
      settings. The need for timely and effective ACP is growing in AN/AI communities and there is&#xD;
      a pressing need for culturally-congruent, patient-centered palliative care interventions for&#xD;
      AN/AIs as tribal health systems manage rising numbers of AN/AI individuals with serious,&#xD;
      life-limiting illnesses. The aims of this collaborative, community-engaged, clinical study&#xD;
      are to: 1) conduct focus groups with 40 key stakeholders (patients, caregivers, providers,&#xD;
      administrators) in two tribal health systems to tailor an existing ACP communication&#xD;
      intervention for AN/AIs with serious, life-limiting illness; 2) evaluate the cultural&#xD;
      relevance and usability of the tailored ACP communication intervention among 20 AN/AI&#xD;
      patients using cognitive interviews; and 3) compare the impact of the tailored intervention&#xD;
      on frequency of ACP discussions, as well as quality of and satisfaction with ACP&#xD;
      communication between 30 AN/AI patients receiving individualized information to prompt ACP&#xD;
      discussions with providers and 30 AN/AI patients receiving usual care, with information to&#xD;
      prompt a discussion. Implementing effective, appropriate ACP is a high priority at&#xD;
      Southcentral Foundation (SCF) and First Nations Community HealthSource (FNCH), two tribal&#xD;
      health systems serving large, diverse populations of AN/AI people in Alaska and New Mexico.&#xD;
      This study will develop and evaluate a culturally congruent, patient- centered ACP&#xD;
      intervention at these sites and produce evidence for a large, multi-site clinical trial of&#xD;
      the intervention that could improve patient and caregiver outcomes in this diverse population&#xD;
      of more than 5 million Americans.&#xD;
