      Specific Aim: Implement an evidence-based diabetes prevention pragmatic trial for high risk&#xD;
      pre-diabetic individuals of Caribbean-descent to reduce the incidence of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: This study seeks to test the hypothesis that implementation of a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention, with escalation to Metformin therapy will lower the incidence of diabetes among&#xD;
      the highest risk pre-diabetic individuals of Caribbean-descent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of&#xD;
      lifestyle modification and Metformin use in minority populations. Our study population is&#xD;
      Caribbean-descent individuals in Region 2, Trinidad and Barbados. The investigators will have&#xD;
      five clinical intervention sites situated in New York - 2, Puerto Rico -1, Barbados -1,&#xD;
      Trinidad -1 and US Virgin Islands -1. These sites were chosen because of the investigators'&#xD;
      strong research network in these locations, and to enable us to address diabetes disparities&#xD;
      due to geographic differences. The investigators will first modify an established lifestyle&#xD;
      modification workshop series developed by the East Harlem Partnership for Diabetes Prevention&#xD;
      (EHPDP) for use in the community, 10to target the population at the involved clinical sites.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to adapt the D-CLIP protocol and escalate to Metformin therapy for the&#xD;
      highest risk pre-diabetic patients whose hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has not improved or who&#xD;
      remain morbidly obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will leverage our existing robust research infrastructure and network at&#xD;
      the five sites through our Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) and&#xD;
      now the Yale Transdisciplinary Collaborative center for Health Disparities focused on&#xD;
      Precision Medicine (Yale-TCC). ECHORN is a research collaboration funded by the NIMHD&#xD;
      (U2458849938) to address the burden of chronic disease in USVI, PR and the Eastern Caribbean.&#xD;
      The Yale-TCC (U54MD010711) leverages the infrastructure and knowledge of the ECHORN, expands&#xD;
      to include New York and New Jersey and focuses on diabetes and hypertension. The&#xD;
      investigators' network includes community advisory boards as well as policy delegations that&#xD;
      are well suited to inform this project and its expansion into routine healthcare practice and&#xD;
      policy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patient Recruitment:&#xD;
The investigators are targeting the highest risk pre-diabetic patients for this study. Patient recruitment will occur through the involved health clinics.&#xD;
Control Participants Control participants in existing ECHORN sites (Puerto Rico, Barbados and Trinidad) will be recruited from the ECHORN Cohort Study (ECS).&#xD;
ECS does not have a recruitment site in New York; therefore, the New York LIME sites will need to recruit their own control participants, through random assignment of consented participants into the intervention and control groups. These participants will be offered a delayed intervention at the end of 2.5years, given the evidence supporting behavioral modification for diabetes prevention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Diabetes Risk Score has been designed to be a screening tool for identifying high-risk subjects in the population and for increasing awareness of the modifiable risk factors and healthy lifestyle. The score ranges from 0-20, with a higher score indicating higher risk.</description>

    <description>The Self-efficacy survey is an excerpt from the 43-item Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes, designed for people at high risk for developing diabetes. It measures perceived comparative and environmental risk for developing diabetes. Scoring for the self-efficacy questions is done by an average and ranges from 1 to 4, with a higher score indicating more perceived risk.</description>

    <description>The lifestyle intervention consists of a series of workshops adapted from the East Harlem Partnerships for Diabetes Prevention that discuss diabetes prevention, finding and affording healthy foods, label reading, physical activity, planning a healthy plate, making traditional foods healthy and portion control.&#xD;
The newly launched East Harlem Diabetes Prevention (EHDP) project's mobile app, iHEED will be used by intervention participants to help reinforce the content they learn during the workshop series.</description>

    <description>At 6 months, intervention participants who have not been able to lose weight or bring their HbA1c below the high risk range of 6% (determined by point-of-care testing) will have Metformin prescribed by their provider. Metformin will be prescribed at 500mg twice a day. If no change is seen at 12 months follow up, the dose will be increased to 850mg twice a day.</description>
