      AIM: To provide initial information on the efficacy (pain reduction) and safety of focused&#xD;
      ultrasound surgery for the ablation of stump neuromas in amputees with chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: The study will include 10 amputees (men/women age &gt;18 years old) with chronic&#xD;
      (&gt;3 months) phantom/residual limb pain (NPS ≥ 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Patients potentially qualifying for the study will be offered an Informed Consent to&#xD;
      sign prior to further evaluation. Those who accept will sign the informed consent, complete&#xD;
      study questionnaires and be evaluated in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Specifically,&#xD;
      a complete medical history will be obtained to determine the patient's general health status,&#xD;
      current symptoms, frequency and dosage of their current analgesic intake etc. Baseline pain&#xD;
      scores will be established. If not performed within six months prior to the evaluation, a&#xD;
      contrast MRI of the stump will be performed. Patients not meeting the study criteria will be&#xD;
      exited from the study as screen failures and not be included in analyses. All qualifying&#xD;
      patients will complete a baseline MRI exam on treatment day. Any patient not meeting study&#xD;
      criteria at Imaging will be exited as screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the MRI exam, qualifying patients will proceed to the ExAblate treatment.&#xD;
      These patients will then be followed for 6-months post-ExAblate treatment; the patients will&#xD;
      complete study follow-up questionnaires at 1, 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after treatments. Follow-up visits will take place 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment to assess their pain status, their quality of life and safety. Data regarding&#xD;
      dosage and frequency of analgesic intake for the management of post amputation NP will be&#xD;
      collected. Relevant cost data will be collected in order to enable an assessment of the total&#xD;
      cost of the procedure.&#xD;

      I. BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, 1.6 million people were estimated to be living with limb loss (3). Up to 70% of the&#xD;
      patients who undergo limb amputation develop chronic phantom/residual limb pain. A&#xD;
      state-of-art understanding of the pathophysiologic basis underlying post-amputation pain&#xD;
      suggests that neuroma formation by regenerative sprouting, leading to increased ectopic&#xD;
      afferent input is the predominant mechanism involved in NP. Post-amputation pain is often&#xD;
      persistent, resistant to treatment and leads to considerable disability. Therefore, new&#xD;
      &quot;anti-nueromas&quot; treatments are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a non-invasive procedure that&#xD;
      combines two technologies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focused ultrasound (FUS) waves which are converted to thermal energy at precise focal&#xD;
           point, causes tissue temperature increase, resulting in irreversible thermal ablation of&#xD;
           the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: Three-dimensional imaging of the tissue and the ultrasound beam in real time&#xD;
           enhances the safety and effectiveness of the procedure by allowing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anatomical planning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Real time thermal imaging enables of the and its surrounding tissues. The safety&#xD;
                and effectiveness of MRgFUS has been shown in a prospective, randomized (3:1),&#xD;
                two-arm, sham-controlled, multicenter, international clinical study with a&#xD;
                sham-crossover option in patients with metastatic bone pain, who were not suitable&#xD;
                candidates for radiation therapy. A much higher proportion of MRgFUS patients than&#xD;
                controls were responders (65.2% vs 18.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide initial information on the efficacy (pain reduction) and safety of focused&#xD;
      ultrasound surgery for the ablation of stump neuromas in amputees with chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      IV. STUDY DESIGN Patients potentially qualifying for the study will be offered an Informed&#xD;
      Consent to sign prior to further evaluation. Those who accept will sign the informed consent,&#xD;
      complete study questionnaires and be evaluated in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Specifically, a complete medical history will be obtained to determine the patient's general&#xD;
      health status, current symptoms, frequency and dosage of their current analgesic intake etc.&#xD;
      Baseline pain scores will be established. If not performed within six months prior to the&#xD;
      evaluation, a contrast MRI of the stump will be performed. Patients not meeting the study&#xD;
      criteria will be exited from the study as screen failures and not be included in analyses.&#xD;
      All qualifying patients will complete a baseline MRI exam on treatment day. Any patient not&#xD;
      meeting study criteria at Imaging will be exited as screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualifying patients will proceed to the ExAblate treatment. These patients will then be&#xD;
      followed for 6-months post-ExAblate treatment; patients will complete study follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires at 1, 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 3 and 6 months after treatments. Follow-up&#xD;
      visits will take place 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment to assess their pain&#xD;
      status, their quality of life and safety. Data regarding dosage and frequency of analgesic&#xD;
      intake for the management of post amputation NP will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary endpoint: Change from baseline in the average daily pain intensity,&#xD;
      measured for 3 consecutive days, on the Numerical Pain Scale (NPS), an 11-point numeric&#xD;
      rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from baseline in the maximum daily pain intensity, measured for 3 consecutive&#xD;
           days, on the NPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in the minimum daily pain intensity, measured for 3 consecutive&#xD;
           days, on the NPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in the consumption of analgesic medications used for the post&#xD;
           amputation NP (i.e., increase, unchanged, decreased).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from baseline in Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in the European Quality of Life Five-Dimensional (EQ-5D)&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinician's Global Impression of Change from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's Global Impression of Change from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from the baseline in MRI findings in the treated neuroma(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline MRI examinations (without contrast) will be performed to identify the neuroma&#xD;
           size, location and extent and device accessibility as well as to evaluate the patient's&#xD;
           ability to cooperate during the ExAblate procedure. If at this point it is determined&#xD;
           that the patient does not meet all Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and cannot be&#xD;
           treated, the patient will be exited from the study. These patients will be considered&#xD;
           screening failures, and will not be included in any of the safety or efficacy endpoint&#xD;
           analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient meets all study criteria, the patient will have the ExAblate treatment&#xD;
           during this same MRI examination session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IV line will be positioned for the delivery of medications and will be maintained&#xD;
           throughout the procedure. Monitoring of heart rate and pO2 will be maintained throughout&#xD;
           the procedure using standard MR-compatible monitoring devices. The patients' skin will&#xD;
           be closely examined for hair in the treatment path. If necessary, the hair will be&#xD;
           removed around the treatment area and the skin will be cleaned, for example with&#xD;
           alcohol, from any oil based skin product. Degassed water and possibly an acoustic gel&#xD;
           pad will be placed atop of the transducers' window to generate acoustic coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be positioned on the ExAblate therapy bed in a selected position according&#xD;
           to the planned treatment area. The patient's area of treatment may be placed in a&#xD;
           special-purpose imaging coil and positioned in the magnet in the treatment position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An MRI scan will be performed with T2 and T1 weighted sequences in all three&#xD;
           orientations to localize and measure the target neuroma(s) to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any prior scar will be identified on the image and the ultrasound treatment plan will be&#xD;
           planned to avoid sonicating through the scar whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the neuroma(s) to be treated is identifiable on the MR images, accessible by the&#xD;
           device for treatment, and the patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
           treatment planning will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physician will trace the neuroma(s) in the targeted area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The physician will draw the treatment volume using MR images from one or more scan&#xD;
           orientations using the following guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to three well defined neuromas can be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A central point on the neuroma (depending on patient anatomy) will be sonicated with a&#xD;
           low thermal dose, to verify targeting accuracy in the patient. Target placement and&#xD;
           transducer positioning will be adjusted as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at this point it is determined that the patient cannot be treated, he or she will be&#xD;
           withdrawn from the magnet and the IV line and pulse oximeter will be removed. The&#xD;
           patient will be taken to the recovery area for observation and release. Follow-up will&#xD;
           consist of a phone call at 1-week post treatment. These patients will be considered&#xD;
           screen failures and will not be included in the efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to the delivery of any treatment sonications the patient will receive analgesia&#xD;
           and sedation or other measures to reduce pain and limit patient motion, and help&#xD;
           alleviate anxiety and claustrophobia. Monitoring of heart rate and pO2 saturation will&#xD;
           be maintained throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will begin. Sonications will be performed on successive points [sonication&#xD;
           duration between 15 - 60 sec]. The effect of each sonication will be measured by MR&#xD;
           using phase map imaging, reflecting the temperature-dependent change in the proton&#xD;
           resonance frequency. Acoustic power will be adjusted throughout the treatment, to&#xD;
           achieve temperature between 65 and 85 degrees from MR thermal images at the targeted&#xD;
           neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sonications will continue until the prescribed targeted area has been treated. The goal&#xD;
           is that the total time from 1st to last sonication will be limited to 180-minutes, or to&#xD;
           patient tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no more than 3 planned sonications can be performed using therapeutic energies, then&#xD;
           these patients will be considered as screen failures, and will not be included in the&#xD;
           intent-to-treat analysis. However, they will be added to the Safety analyses. Criteria&#xD;
           to terminate treatment include patient intolerance to the treatment, targeting&#xD;
           difficulties due to patient motion or a decision of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately post-treatment, a series of MR scans will be performed. The scanning will&#xD;
           include T2 weighted sequences and T1 weighted contrast enhanced sequences to evaluate&#xD;
           general anatomy and to assess treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be taken off the therapeutic table and escorted to a recovery area for&#xD;
           observation period pending release from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All MR exams taken during the study will be archived for later analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If during the treatment session, the physician did not complete the planned treatment,&#xD;
           and determines that it would be to the benefit of the patient to continue treatment at a&#xD;
           second session, a second treatment session may be completed within two (2) weeks of the&#xD;
           first treatment. However, up to three painful neuromas can be treated under this&#xD;
           protocol and the purpose of the second treatment is to complete the original treatment&#xD;
           plan. This protocol does not allow for a second treatment due to continued pain at the&#xD;
           treated site or the treatment of additional painful lesions. The preparation procedures&#xD;
           for the second treatment will be the same as the first. No more than two treatments&#xD;
           should be performed within a two (2) week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Telephone follow-up visits will be completed at 1 and 3 days, and 2 weeks post&#xD;
      treatment. Clinic visits will be completed at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months post-ExAblate&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will be evaluated for general health, efficacy measurements as well as&#xD;
      for device/procedure related AEs that may have occurred during the follow-up period.&#xD;
      Additional data regarding dosage and frequency of analgesic intake for the management of NP&#xD;
      will also be collected. For phone visits, study personnel will contact the patient, inquire&#xD;
      about AEs and question the patient according to the pain questionnaire, pain medication&#xD;
      intake. The study personnel will then sign and date the completed forms. A follow-up MRI to&#xD;
      assess the effects on the treated neuroma(s) will be performed four months after treatment.&#xD;
