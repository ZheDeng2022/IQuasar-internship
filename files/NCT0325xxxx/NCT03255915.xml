  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have a 28-day pre-ring baseline assessment period (Stage 1) followed by&#xD;
      randomization to order with 5 participants per study arm. All participants will sequentially&#xD;
      receive both study products for 28-days with at least a 2-week washout period between&#xD;
      products. Arm 1 will receive the TDF-FTC pod-IVR for Stage 2 followed by the placebo pod-IVR&#xD;
      during Stage 3. Arm 2 will receive the placebo pod-IVR for Stage 2 followed by the TDF-FTC&#xD;
      pod-IVR during Stage 3. During Stages 2 &amp; 3 participants will also complete brief phone&#xD;
      surveys (&lt;3 min), computer-assisted self-interviews (CASIs), and in-depth interviews (IDIs)&#xD;
      regarding perceptibility and acceptability. If willing, participants' male sexual partners&#xD;
      will be invited to complete IDIs as well.&#xD;
