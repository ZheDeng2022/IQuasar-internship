    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      at the time of TB diagnosis and prospectively followed for at least two years after&#xD;
      TB-treatment initiation with optional prolonged follow-up. Study visits will be performed in&#xD;
      the study clinics or if necessary at the participant's home at pre-defined time points after&#xD;
      TB treatment initiation. Clinical assessments, biological sample collections and collection&#xD;
      of socio-economic data will be performed according to the pre-defined schedule of events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The African continent today is emblematic of TB as a global health emergency with little&#xD;
      known about the long-term sequelae. It is likely that TB patients from resource-constrained&#xD;
      settings, who usually present with more extensive disease, are left with greater lung&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to advance the understanding of the clinical, microbiologic, and host&#xD;
      immune factors affecting the long-term sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis; to identify the&#xD;
      most important factors that contribute to lung impairment, including the immunological&#xD;
      response and genetic predisposition of the host and differences in the biology of the&#xD;
      pathogen; to determine occurrence of reversible and irreversible costs and socioeconomic&#xD;
      consequences for patients; and to facilitate novel interventions to restore and preserve&#xD;
      overall health, well-being and financial protection in patients with TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core of the current project is a prospective cohort of up to 1600 patients across four&#xD;
      countries (Mozambique, Tanzania, South Africa and The Gambia), enrolled at the time of TB&#xD;
      diagnosis, and followed up for at least 2 years. The overall goal of the cohort is to&#xD;
      describe and analyse the basis of the long-term clinical consequences of pulmonary TB, with a&#xD;
      particular focus on lung injury. The investigators will enroll patients during two years and&#xD;
      follow each patient up for at least two years. The project also includes a number of&#xD;
      sub-studies: Host-Immunology, Pathogen and Socio-Economic. General laboratory tests and TB&#xD;
      specific tests, X-ray, physical examination and cardio-pulmonary assessment will be performed&#xD;
      and the obtained clinical data will be recorded in study questionnaires. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect and analyse biological specimens (blood, urine and sputum) longitudinally during&#xD;
      the period of observation and after all specimens have been stored. In-depth analysis of the&#xD;
      host immune response, focusing on potential mechanisms of lung damage, including oxidative&#xD;
      injury, proteolytic matrix degradation, and neutrophil-mediated damage, neutrophil-macrophage&#xD;
      ratios and markers; and molecular analysis of mycobacterial dynamics and markers in relation&#xD;
      to pulmonary and microbiological treatment outcomes, including success, failure, relapse,&#xD;
      reinfection and death will be carried out. Socio-economic data, including patient costs, will&#xD;
      be collected at the time of TB diagnosis, during treatment, at the end of treatment and&#xD;
      during the follow-up period, and analysed to determine how the risk of TB sequelae is linked&#xD;
      with the socioeconomic position of the patient, to establish the occurrence of catastrophic&#xD;
      costs due to TB and the proportion of patients that resort to potentially irreversible&#xD;
      socioeconomic coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate data source will be maintained and confidentiality will be guaranteed. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed according to the statistical plan. Results of the study will be disseminated to all&#xD;
      relevant stakeholders through meetings, reports and publications.&#xD;
