  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be exposed to 50 L3 Necator americanus&#xD;
      larvae for a maximum of three times.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four volunteers will be allocated equally into three groups (i.e. group A, B, C).&#xD;
      Group A, B, and C will have one, two, and three infections respectively. Every infection will&#xD;
      be performed with 50 L3 Necator americanus larvae. Group A will receive infection at week 4&#xD;
      only. Group B will be infected at week 2 and week 4. Group C will be infected at week 0, 2&#xD;
      and 4. To maintain blinding, group A and B will receive mock infections with water at week 0&#xD;
      and week 0 and 2 respectively. The interval between each CHHI is 2 weeks. Before every&#xD;
      infection, the safety will be assessed by a review of adverse events data with a local safety&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen weeks after the last infection (week 20), all volunteers will be offered treatment&#xD;
      with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate infection. Volunteers with average egg counts&#xD;
      &gt;250 eggs per gram will be asked if they would be willing to keep their infection for a&#xD;
      maximum of two years (chronic donors). No more than four volunteers will be selected to be&#xD;
      chronic donors. Six months after the last infection (or after the last donation for the&#xD;
      chronic donors) volunteers will undergo their last visit.&#xD;
