      The trial will estimate post-operative pain management in elective surgical patients using&#xD;
      the PMD-200 device. The device measures physiological parameters by placing a non-invasive&#xD;
      sensor on a fingertip and displays an objective pain level in a 0-100 scale. The pain level&#xD;
      will be estimated before surgery (baseline), after surgery and during administration of&#xD;
      parenteral analgesia. Treatment and analgesia will be given according to clinical&#xD;
      considerations and standard ward protocols. The device measurements won't influence the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      1. Background The key to adequate pain management is assessing its presence, duration and&#xD;
           severity, identifying those who require intervention, and evaluating the treatment&#xD;
           efficacy. Pain relates to both the noxious input, via peripheral nerves, and to central&#xD;
           modulation, thereby, integrating different modalities such as affect, experience or&#xD;
           personality. Nociception refers to the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
           processing of information about the internal or external environment, as generated by&#xD;
           activation of nociceptors. Typically, noxious stimuli, including tissue injury, activate&#xD;
           nociceptors that are present in peripheral structures and that transmit information to&#xD;
           the spinal cord dorsal horn (or its trigeminal homologue - the nucleus caudalis). From&#xD;
           there, the information continues to the brainstem and ultimately the cerebral cortex,&#xD;
           where the perception of pain is generated. The pain is a product of higher brain center&#xD;
           processing, whereas nociception can occur in the absence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objective assessment of nociception poses a multitude of challenges. First, sedated or&#xD;
           unconscious patients by definition cannot experience pain. Under these circumstances, it&#xD;
           is more accurate to assess the nociception level. A body of research suggests that not&#xD;
           managing nociception can lead to central changes in pain pathways that predispose&#xD;
           individuals to chronic pain states.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current &quot;gold-standard&quot; pain assessment tools rely on self-reporting, requiring an&#xD;
           individual both to process external information and to communicate this personal&#xD;
           experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Circumstances exist where self-reporting is not possible, or where it is unreliable. In&#xD;
           these situations, surrogate markers utilize changes in behavioral or physiological&#xD;
           parameters. However, their use can be associated with considerable shortcomings. They&#xD;
           may be unreliable, hampered by observational bias, or influenced by disease processes or&#xD;
           pharmacological interventions. Developing an objective method of pain assessment&#xD;
           therefore needs to ensure tools that are sensitive and specific to pain. They need to be&#xD;
           observer-independent, not reliant on the patient's ability to communicate and not&#xD;
           influenced by disease characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A novel measure of nociception is the nociception level (NoL) index. It is based on&#xD;
           objective measures related to changes in the autonomic nervous system. The NoL index&#xD;
           ranges from 0 to 100 and is based on a nonlinear combination of nociception-related&#xD;
           physiologic variables, specifically heart rate, heart rate variability at the 0.15- to&#xD;
           0.4-Hz band power, photoplethysmograph wave amplitude , skin conductance level, number&#xD;
           of skin conductance fluctuations, and their time derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the trial the invastigator assume that combination of several parameters into a&#xD;
           single one (Nol Index) may have a stronger association with pain intensity than each of&#xD;
           the parameters alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medasense Biometrics Ltd. developed the PMD-200, a nociception/pain monitor that is&#xD;
           based on a patented, non-invasive technology enabling objective, continuous assessment&#xD;
           of changes in pain level. Information is collected through a finger-mounted probe that&#xD;
           monitors changes in multiple pain-related physiological parameters (pulse rate,&#xD;
           photoplethismograph amplitude, heart rate variability, skin conductance level and number&#xD;
           of skin conductance fluctuations). This information is analyzed using proprietary&#xD;
           artificial intelligence algorithms, which convert the physiological data to a real-time&#xD;
           nociception Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rationale for developing the device is to provide caregivers with the ability to&#xD;
           measure pain level (or nociception level for unconscious patients) during any procedure&#xD;
           and at any time. This information can prevent unnecessary pain, avoid overdose or under&#xD;
           usage of analgesic agents, enhance recovery and decrease hospitalization time and costs,&#xD;
           while answering the critical need to supervise patients' pain/nociception level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The finger probe sensor of PMD-200 collects the following signals:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. PhotoPlethysmograph (PPG) - used to optically obtain a volumetric measurement of&#xD;
                the finger's tip blood vessels. The trace is generated by light emitted from a LED&#xD;
                (~780nm) and collected by a photo diode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) - used to measure the electrical conductance of the&#xD;
                skin, which varies with its moisture level. The conductance is obtained by&#xD;
                injecting a current between two electrodes placed on the finger and measuring the&#xD;
                voltage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Temperature (TMP) - used to measure the skin temperature using a thermistor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Accelerometer (ACC) - used to measure finger movements The technology consists of&#xD;
                measurements of a number of pain-related physiological parameters that corresponds&#xD;
                with the autonomic nervous system's response to pain, and using the company's&#xD;
                proprietary algorithms, 'translating' these measurements into an index that&#xD;
                represents the pain response, the NoLâ„¢ (Nociception Level) Index. This index is&#xD;
                displayed on a bedside monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measurements taken by the Medasense monitor include galvanic skin response,&#xD;
           photoplethysmography , skin temperature and movement .&#xD;
&#xD;
           All measurements are taken simultaneously using a single finger probe attached to the&#xD;
           patient's finger. Miniature sensors are embedded into the probe, which includes reusable&#xD;
           and single use components. The finger probe is connected to the bedside monitor for&#xD;
           processing of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Operating the PMD-200 monitor is similar to other standard-of-care systems that track&#xD;
           changes in patients' vital functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure or blood oxygen&#xD;
           saturation. Such monitors obtain their information from sensing element(s) attached to&#xD;
           the patient, display the respective clinical values on a bedside, generate relevant&#xD;
           alerts, and maintain records of the information tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods Population study - electively patients that are going to underwent laparoscopic&#xD;
           cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. First measurement will be taken a day before surgery by placing the device on a&#xD;
                patient's 3rd finger for 3-5 minutes in a quiet environment. The measurement will&#xD;
                be the NOL value (baseline) without pain. The patient will be asked to estimate the&#xD;
                pain level using VAS (visual analog scale) score of 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After determining the NOL value, an IV catheter will be inserted, as required&#xD;
                pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The device will continue measuring the pain level while the patient will be asked&#xD;
                to estimate the pain level again using VAS .&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The patient will be operated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The patient will receive post-operative analgesia according to ward protocol - PRN&#xD;
                IV Dipyrone 1g or PRN IV Paracetamol 1g.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The device will measure pain from 5 minutes before until 20 minutes after&#xD;
                analgesics administration. During this time VAS score will be taken. This measure&#xD;
                will be taken up to 3 times during the post-operative hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. The measurement will be taken in a quiet environment without distractions. Any&#xD;
                distraction during measurement will be noted as an EVENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To examine the response of NoL Index in relation to pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To develop objective tool to assess the severity of pain in post-operative patient.&#xD;
