  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are known to have difficulty with&#xD;
      socio-communicative functioning and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests, and&#xD;
      there is considerable evidence that the majority also struggle with associated emotional&#xD;
      problems. Speech is typically delayed or may regress, comprehension is impaired, if not at&#xD;
      the word level, then at the level of sentences, nonverbal and verbal language are affected,&#xD;
      and pretend play is delayed or absent, some children are nonverbal or have sparse,&#xD;
      impoverished, poorly articulated, and grammatical speech. Objective: To assess in which&#xD;
      interface has ASD best performance or functionality. Method: Will be evaluated 100&#xD;
      individuals divided into two groups: 50 individuals with diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder (ASD-group), aged 7 to 15 years old, males and females; and 50 individuals with&#xD;
      typical development (TD-group) matched by age and sex to the ASD-group. Individuals with&#xD;
      comorbidities and functional disabilities that would impede the completion of the task were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Will be evaluated 100 individuals divided into two groups: 50 individuals with diagnosis of&#xD;
      Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD-group), aged 7 to 15 years old, males and females; and 50&#xD;
      individuals with typical development (TD-group) matched by age and sex to the ASD-group. The&#xD;
      ASD-group will be recruited from GAPI - Special Education in São Bernardo do Campo, São&#xD;
      Paulo, Brazil, which is a school for children and adolescents with pervasive developmental&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a diagnosis of ASD, apart from qualitative alterations in social communication and&#xD;
      interaction (criterion A) in addition to stereotyped, repetitive, restricted behavior&#xD;
      patterns (criterion B), that present in the early developmental period (criterion C), it is&#xD;
      also required that these &quot;symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social,&#xD;
      occupational and other important areas of current functioning&quot; (criterion D), and that they&#xD;
      are not better explained otherwise (criterion E). Given this information these items will be&#xD;
      taken into consideration and the group was well evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the purpose to homogenize the sample, will be only included ASD with the 1st level to&#xD;
      5th education to grade elementary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument For data collection will be used a gaming software created in partnership with the&#xD;
      Information Systems group of School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, EACH-USP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The game offers task of &quot;Timing&quot; Coincident, which when executed are displayed on the&#xD;
      computer screen 10 balls accessing (red light) in sequence until the last ball, which is&#xD;
      considered the target (green light). The participant can have immediate feedback of hit or&#xD;
      task error by different sounds (Auditory Interaction) and through visual images (Visual&#xD;
      Interaction) that change colors, that will be previously shown to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task Coincident Timing In the more tangible button-press task, the individuals will be&#xD;
      required to 'intercept' a falling virtual object at the moment it reached the interception&#xD;
      point by pressing a button on the computer's keyboard. In the more abstract, less tangible&#xD;
      task, they were instructed to 'intercept' the virtual object by making a hand movement (i.e.,&#xD;
      a waving gesture) in a virtual environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnitude and direction of each participant's error in anticipating the light's &quot;arrival&quot;&#xD;
      at the end of the runway, in milliseconds, is recorded by the game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective the game is to evaluate the difference in time between the participant's execution&#xD;
      of the response and the arrival of the object at the target location, overall temporal&#xD;
      accuracy, and hence coincidence-anticipation timing skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software provides a &quot;user login&quot; for each research participant, where the following data&#xD;
      are stored: Participant name; Date of birth; sex; Pathology type; Researcher name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures The participants will be positioned comfortably in a chair adjusted according to&#xD;
      size and needs along with a footrest so that they will be positioned properly to enable task&#xD;
      execution. Before starting the task, the operation of the game will be verbally explained and&#xD;
      a demonstration will be offered by the examiner. Runtime will be noted in each experimental&#xD;
      stage, as explained below: acquisition (A), retention (R), and transfer (T).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants made 20 trial acquisitions, 5 retention trials after 5 minutes with no&#xD;
      contact with the task and 5 transfer trials immediately after retention trials. Thus, each&#xD;
      participant will have 30 trials. During acquisition and retention trials, the bubbles&#xD;
      simulate a dropped light movement with 0.5 seconds between each bubble and 5 seconds between&#xD;
      the first and last bubble.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will perform alternating interfaces for the same task, Kinect for Windows&#xD;
      (gesture task with virtual environments), Keyboard (button press with tangible environments),&#xD;
      and both groups will carry out the transfer phase on Touch Screen interface. The subjects of&#xD;
      each group (ASD and TD) will be divided into 2 groups, group A and group B, according to the&#xD;
      order of interfaces to carry out the task; Group A will perform the abstract task (kinect&#xD;
      with more virtual activity) and then the tangible task (keyboard with more real activity),&#xD;
      and the group B, will perform the reverse process.&#xD;
