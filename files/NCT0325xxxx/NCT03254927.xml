  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of combining CDX-3379 and cetuximab. The study will enroll patients with&#xD;
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have previously received cetuximab and&#xD;
      progressed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-3379 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 3 (HER3 or ErbB3) found on certain cells and may act to promote&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR, a protein receptor that regulates&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CDX-3379 in combination&#xD;
      with cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have&#xD;
      previously received cetuximab and progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients that enroll in the study will be given the dose of 12 mg/kg CDX-3379 once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in combination with 400 mg/m2 cetuximab on the first day followed by weekly&#xD;
      doses of 250 mg/m2 cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 45 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely&#xD;
      monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side&#xD;
      effects that may occur.&#xD;
