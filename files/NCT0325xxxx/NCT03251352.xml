  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the maintenance of the molecular remission&#xD;
      after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) disconnection in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)&#xD;
      patients in China in the real-world clinical practice setting. This is a post-marketing,&#xD;
      non-interventional, single-arm, prospective registry study in adult patients with chronic&#xD;
      phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) in China. Patients will be recruited consecutively from&#xD;
      the study sites during the enrollment period. The enrolled patients will be undertaking TKI&#xD;
      discontinuation under the conditions of informed consent and frequent monitoring according to&#xD;
      the clinical guideline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard of care for patients with chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase. Imatinib, the first ATP competitive TKI, received approval&#xD;
      for use based on a dramatic and durable survival benefit. Other TKIs, the second generation&#xD;
      compounds dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib and the third generation drug ponatinib, were&#xD;
      designed and tested for a greater target-specific potency. With the development of these&#xD;
      effective TKI treatments, CML disease burden can be reduced to minimal levels, and CML&#xD;
      patients can have a life expectancy similar to that of the general population. Although TKI&#xD;
      treatment may result in a deep, stable molecular remission, CML treatment guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that patients continue TKI treatment indefinitely. However, Chronic TKI therapy can&#xD;
      cause drug-related adverse reactions and constitute financial difficulties, which can result&#xD;
      in decreased adherence to therapy. Therefore, the concept of a lifelong therapy with TKIs has&#xD;
      thus been challenged and treatment-free remission (TFR) strategies will soon integrate&#xD;
      clinical practice.TFR can be defined as the ability to maintain molecular remission without&#xD;
      taking any TKI therapy. Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of successful TFR. In the&#xD;
      STIM and TWISTER trials, imatinib discontinuation was proposed providing that patients had&#xD;
      achieved deep molecular response for a certain period. The 2-year probability to maintain&#xD;
      such deep molecular response levels without any TKI therapy was 38% in STIM and 47% in&#xD;
      TWISTER. Subsequently, several studies were conducted and confirmed that imatinib-free&#xD;
      remission was possible. Discontinuation of new generation TKIs was also investigated and&#xD;
      indicated that dasatinib or nilotinib may promote access to TFR strategies as compared to&#xD;
      imatinib. TFR is on the way to become an important goal in clinical practice, implicating an&#xD;
      alternation in CML management guidelines in the near future.&#xD;
