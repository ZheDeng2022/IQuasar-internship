    <description>Bionic pancreas system: The bionic pancreas is an autonomous, self-learning system that requires only the subject's weight for initialization, and then autonomously adapts insulin dosing to maintain glycemic control. The bionic pancreas uses continuous glucose monitoring as input to the controller. The bionic pancreas can be used in a bi-hormonal configuration, administering both insulin and glucagon as well as an insulin only setting.</description>
