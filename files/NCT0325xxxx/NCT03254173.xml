  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of the FDA&#xD;
      approved drug , mirtazapine , in treatment of cancer associated anorexia cachexia syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two arms will be compared . Arm A will involve 50 patients with confirmed advanced cancer&#xD;
      receiving mirtazapine 15 mg once daily for 8 weeks &amp; Arm B will involve another 50 patients&#xD;
      with confirmed advanced cancer receiving placebo for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms will be compared to assess efficacy of mirtazapine in appetite stimulation&#xD;
      primarily and to assess other outcomes secondarily which will be discussed later in details.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  A Written consent is to be obtained from all patients before being enrolled in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Complete Blood Count , Liver function tests and kidney function tests will be&#xD;
           obtained to assess safety to start the drug and to assess its dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two arms will be compared : mirtazapine oral 15mg daily versus placebo. This will be&#xD;
           conducted on a double-blinded basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral mirtazapine ( REMERON , RD , 30 mg tablets , Organon ) will be the original FDA&#xD;
           approved drugs that will be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment allocation will be concealed from patients, investigators, and study&#xD;
           coordinators enrolling the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be counseled and given dietary advice by a dietician at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be permitted to continue treatment at the same dose as scheduled as long&#xD;
           as weight was stabilized (no loss greater than 10 % of body weight at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of therapy : Patients will remain on protocol for a duration of 8 weeks as long&#xD;
           as they did not develop serious concurrent illness preventing further treatment,&#xD;
           unacceptable adverse events (grade 3 or higher), the patient decides to withdraw from&#xD;
           study, or the investigator judges that it is in the patient's best interest to&#xD;
           discontinue treatment due to general or specific health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data will include performance status, tumor type, sex, age, and percentage&#xD;
           weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ESAS scale (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ) will be used to assess the following&#xD;
           10 symptoms experienced by patients with cancer during the previous 24 hours:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Drowsiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. And feelings of well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of each symptom is rated on a numerical scale of 0 to 10 (0_no symptom, 10_worst&#xD;
      possible severity). The ESAS is both valid and reliable in the assessment of the intensity of&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FAACT questionnaire ( Functional Assessment of Anorexia\Cachexia Therapy ) with&#xD;
           anorexia \ cachexia subscale will be used to assess quality of life among the studied&#xD;
           patients , in a form of questionnaire including :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Physical well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Social well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Emotional well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Functional well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Additional concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The patient rates the answer on a scale of 0 to 4. The FACIT - Pal scale is&#xD;
                internally consistent , reliable and valid as a measure of health-related quality&#xD;
                of life for persons with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                We will contact their website to get the licence to use the questionnaire and to&#xD;
                get its translated version.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measures to assess efficacy of mirtazapine in weight gain :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assessment of weight of the patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Assessment of muscle strength ( via hand grip dynamometry , using the device named&#xD;
                Lite 200 lb , Fabrication Enterprises Incorporated Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessment of lean ( via bioimpedance analysis , using the device named BF100 ,&#xD;
                Beurer Company ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological methods to assess efficacy of mirtazapine in modulating inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
           media : quantitative c-reactive protein (CRP) and comparative analysis by enzyme-linked&#xD;
           immunoassay (ELISA) will be performed on IL-6 ( Interleukin - 6 ) , and YKL-40 serum&#xD;
           levels according to availability. They will be obtained at baseline (day 1 of treatment,&#xD;
           immediately before first dose) and at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of safety and tolerability Patients who will receive at least one dose of&#xD;
           study medication will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A traditional definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first cycle Will be&#xD;
           used (any grade 3 non-hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity within 4 weeks and&#xD;
           assessed as being at least possibly related to study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A toxicity questionnaire will be done at baseline and then at 14-day intervals until day&#xD;
           28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fully assess the toxicity profile of the drug, the safety evaluation period in the trial&#xD;
      will be extended 30 days from the date of the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with confirmed advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with appetite score equal or more than 4 on a 0 to 10 scale (10 _ worst&#xD;
             appetite).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with weight loss more than 5 % of body weight over 6 months . Or : Patients&#xD;
             with any degree of weight loss more than 2 % associated with BMI ( body mass index )&#xD;
             of less than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to take pills orally and not dependent on tube feeding (no oral mucosal&#xD;
             inflammation interfering with oral intake or dysphagia as determined by clinical&#xD;
             examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal organ function (creatinine ≤2× upper limit of normal, bilirubin ≤2; upper limit&#xD;
             of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients could be receiving concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an expected life span of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with weight gain for known cause , e.g. , ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women with childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to maintain oral intake .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with dementia or delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled symptoms that could impact appetite or caloric intake such&#xD;
             as nausea, pain, or depression will be excluded until their symptoms had stabilized&#xD;
             for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because improvement in anorexia and/or weight in depressed individuals could be due to&#xD;
             an antidepressant effect of mirtazapine, rather than to a direct effect on anorexia,&#xD;
             patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms will be also excluded. the&#xD;
             screening instrument will be a single-item interview assessing depressed mood of the&#xD;
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) instrument which is&#xD;
             validated and highly accurate in screening for depression when compared to the gold&#xD;
             standard of semistructured diagnostic interviews, and is rated on a 6-point Likert&#xD;
             scale, where 0 = no depression and 6 = extreme feelings of depression. Patients with a&#xD;
             score of 4 or more will be excluded from the study as they are considered to be at&#xD;
             high risk for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No treatment with antipsychotic agents such as risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine,&#xD;
             phenothiazine, or butyrophenone for 30 days prior to or during protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated vitamin B12 deficiency or endocrine abnormalities that could&#xD;
             affect appetite, such as thyroid dysfunction and hypoadrenalism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on supplements or medications with potential appetite-stimulating activity,&#xD;
             such as megestrol acetate, corticosteroids, or thalidomide, will be excluded unless&#xD;
             they are put on a stable dose for more than 2 weeks and continue to experience poor&#xD;
             appetite.&#xD;
