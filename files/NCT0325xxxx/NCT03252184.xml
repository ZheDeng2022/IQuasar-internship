    <textblock>
      The endothelial cell layer is responsible for the control of vascular homeostasis, a process&#xD;
      mediated by vasoconstricting and vasodilatory substances. The principal endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      vascular dilator is nitric oxide (NO), and the reduction of its synthesis or bioavailability&#xD;
      is the main cause for the development of endothelial dysfunction. The use of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation may be beneficial in several clinical situations. At the endothelial&#xD;
      level, the stimulatory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor, NO secretion, number of&#xD;
      capillaries and proliferation of endothelial cells are outstanding. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effects of photobiomodulation on the arterial endothelial function&#xD;
      of healthy individuals. The study design will be a randomized, crossover, clinical trial and&#xD;
      the sample will be composed of subjects selected by the eligibility criteria, and randomly&#xD;
      randomized according to the order of intervention of the groups. The hypothesis is that at&#xD;
      the end of the protocol with photobiomodulation an increase in endothelial function and blood&#xD;
      markers of endothelial function occurs, and no tissue temperature variation.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: The endothelial cell layer is responsible for the control of vascular&#xD;
      homeostasis, a process mediated by vasoconstricting and vasodilatory substances. The&#xD;
      principal endothelium-dependent vascular dilator is nitric oxide (NO), and the reduction of&#xD;
      its synthesis or bioavailability is the main cause for the development of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. The use of photobiomodulation may be beneficial in several clinical situations.&#xD;
      At the endothelial level, the stimulatory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor, NO&#xD;
      secretion, number of capillaries and proliferation of endothelial cells are outstanding. It&#xD;
      has also been shown an increase in glutathione levels, antioxidant effect and angiogenic&#xD;
      potential, which shows a potential vascular effect, and consequently, an improvement in&#xD;
      endothelial function. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation on the arterial endothelial function of healthy individuals. The study&#xD;
      design will be a randomized, crossover, clinical trial and the sample will be composed of 16&#xD;
      healthy subjects selected by the eligibility criteria, and randomly randomized according to&#xD;
      the order of intervention of the groups. The hypothesis is that at the end of the irradiation&#xD;
      protocol with photobiomodulation an increase in endothelial function and blood markers of&#xD;
      endothelial function occurs, and no tissue temperature variation. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of photobiomodulation on the arterial endothelial function of healthy&#xD;
      individuals. The secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the time of blood vessel dilation&#xD;
      after photobiomodulation. 2) To evaluate the effects of photobiomodulation on blood markers&#xD;
      (hemogram) and endothelial markers (cGMP and L-arginine), and Nitric oxide (nitrite and&#xD;
      nitrate). 3) To analyze associations between markers and metabolites with endothelial&#xD;
      function due to the effects of Photobiomodulation. 3) Analyze the local temperature before&#xD;
      and after photobiomodulation. 4) Analyze the local temperature before and after the&#xD;
      measurement of Endothelial function. 5) Evaluate possible associations between blood and&#xD;
      endothelial markers, nitric oxide pathway metabolites and Endothelial function with local&#xD;
      temperature. 6) To compare the effects of energy doses and wavelenghts of photobiosmodulation&#xD;
      on endothelial function, blood and endothelial markers, and metabolites of the nitric oxide&#xD;
      pathway. The research will be developed in room 709 of the Laboratory of Physiotherapy in&#xD;
      building II, UFCSPA and, for randomization, the simple technique will be used through numbers&#xD;
      generated by a freely available software. The generation of the sequence of numbers will be&#xD;
      done by a blind researcher, after the selection of the individuals by the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. The study will be separated in phases in according to photobiomodulation device&#xD;
      employed. Initially, we will use the laser with 658nm, power output of 10mW per point and&#xD;
      fluence of 18J, 36J e 54J per area. The individuals will be randomly assigned to: group 1&#xD;
      (energy dose of 18J), group 2 (energy dose of 36J), group 3 (energy dose of 54J), and group 4&#xD;
      (placebo). In the second phase, we will use the laser with 810nm, power density of 714 mW/cm2&#xD;
      and fluence of 30 J per spot. The individuals will be randomly assigned to: group 1 (energy&#xD;
      dose of 30J), group 2 (energy dose of 60J) and group 3 (placebo). Finally, we will measure&#xD;
      the time of blood vessel dilation after photobiomodulation with 30J and 60J. The normality of&#xD;
      the data will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data with symmetrical distribution will&#xD;
      be presented as mean ± standard deviation, and data with asymmetric distribution as median&#xD;
      and interquartile range (P25 - P75). The baseline characteristics of the patients will be&#xD;
      compared by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney when the distributions are parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric, respectively. The categorical variables will be compared by the Chi-square&#xD;
      test. Variance Analysis (ANOVA) will be used for repeated measures for pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention data analysis, or the Mann-Whitney test (asymmetric distribution), followed&#xD;
      by Bonferroni post hoc. The Pearson or Sperman correlations will be used for possible&#xD;
      association between the analyzed variables. Statistical significance of 5% (p &lt;0.05) will be&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
