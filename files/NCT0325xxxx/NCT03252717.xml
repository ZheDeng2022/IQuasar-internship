      To confirm the protein expression level in radiation-induced late effects patients and to&#xD;
      determine the performance value, in particular the positive predictive value, of a blood test&#xD;
      based on the dosage of a panel of five proteins, it is necessary to validate these&#xD;
      preliminary results by a prospective study on a large cohort of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Molecular mechanisms involved in radiation-induced responses are complex, and proteomic&#xD;
      approaches can be used to better understand the overall reaction process of ionizing&#xD;
      radiation and to identify potential radio-sensitive predictive markers. Until now, few&#xD;
      publications have addressed the determination of radiosensitive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous results and in order to improve the positive predictive value of the&#xD;
      radiation induced late effect assay, we developed a quantitative proteomic approach to&#xD;
      identify predictive radiobiological markers in patients with severe toxicity. First, four&#xD;
      patients were selected with a low RILA value from the prospective studies mentioned above.&#xD;
      Two patients had no toxicity at least four years after the end of treatment whereas two&#xD;
      others patients developed a severe toxicity greater than grade 2. T-lymphocytes have been&#xD;
      isolated from whole blood and half of them have been irradiated in vitro. It will then&#xD;
      performed a quantitative proteomics workflow using an 8-plex iTRAQ labeling and after several&#xD;
      fractionations to optimize resolution of analysis (off gel fractionation followed by&#xD;
      nanoliquid chromatography), proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (4800 plus&#xD;
      MALDI TOF/TOF). More than 1300 total proteins were identified with high confidence (95%, one&#xD;
      unique peptide). At 0 Gy, 135 proteins were differentially expressed between patients with or&#xD;
      without severe radio-induced toxicity. In irradiated T-lymphocytes (8 Gy), 107 proteins were&#xD;
      differentially expressed between patients with or without severe radio-induced toxicity.&#xD;
      Among them, five proteins (AK2, adenylate kinase 2; IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+);&#xD;
      ANX1, annexin 1; APEX1, DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase, and HSC70, Heat shock&#xD;
      cognate 71 kDa) with the highest protein expression ratio (&gt;1.5) and that showed no&#xD;
      difference expression ratio in 0 Gy controls, were selected for consecutive validation. These&#xD;
      proteins are involved in several mechanisms including metabolism and energy production,&#xD;
      apoptosis, calcium binding protein, and DNA damages repair. These five proteins are currently&#xD;
      the subject of patent application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then,10 other patients will be recruited (5 patients with grade ≥ 2 breast fibrosis and 5&#xD;
      patients without toxicity) who presented a low RILA value to validate proteins expression by&#xD;
      western-blotting. Results showed that all proteins were overexpressed in irradiated&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes patients with severe toxicity comparatively to patients without toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to confirm the protein expression level in radiation-induced late effects patients&#xD;
      and to determine the performance value, in particular the positive predictive value, of a&#xD;
      blood test based on the dosage of a panel of five proteins, it is necessary to validate these&#xD;
      preliminary results by a prospective study on a large cohort of patients&#xD;
