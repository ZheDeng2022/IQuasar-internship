  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant disease worldwide especially in china. Though&#xD;
      esophagectomy and definitive chemoradiotherapy are standard treatments, disease relapses in&#xD;
      many patients and the prognosis of metastatic ESCC is still poor. For patients with&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic ESCC, chemotherapy is an important treatment alone or with&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Taxane, platinum, and fluoropyrimidine have been reported effective in ESCC and&#xD;
      is used as first-line treatment of ESCC. As for 2nd-line treatment, both irinotecan and&#xD;
      taxane had been recommended based on data from clinical trials which were most enrolled&#xD;
      esophageal or esophageal-gastric junction adenocarcinoma and with only small sample size.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is still urgently needed to explore effective 2nd-line treatment for ESCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is an orally antiangiogenic agents. Preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      data had shown that it is effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. It had been approved as a 3rd-line treatment for patients with advanced&#xD;
      gastric cancer by state FDA of China in 2014. And the safety data showed that hemorrhage is&#xD;
      rare and non-fetal which is different from bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators initialize this phase II study to explore the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of irinotecan and apatinib combination treatment in unresectable or metastatic ESCC&#xD;
      patients who failed in 1st-line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Because PD-1 antibodies had been proved to be a standard second-line treatment in esophageal&#xD;
    cancer, the potential benefit of present intervention is under re-evaluation.&#xD;
